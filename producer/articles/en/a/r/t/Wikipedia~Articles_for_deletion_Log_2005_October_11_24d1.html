<p>Non-notable bio, vanity. Brown is a high school graduate of 2003, has his only novel published the same year. Novel appears to be published by a vanity press (Authorhouse or 1st Books), Amazon sales rank <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1414027184/103-0504023-2139018?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1414027184/103-0504023-2139018?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">#2,554,188 in Books</a> with two suspiciously effusive 5-star user reviews. I will also put the novel Alexander Browns: Sweet Dreams on AFD shortly. He may have great things in his future, but it isn't yet time for his encyclopedia bio. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 03:19, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Do Whatever You Wish</b>. For Future Reference I personally am not Alexander Brown, nor do I know him personally, However he is a regionally well-known writer. I apologize if my bio for him it appeared to be vain, but I fixed it to where it appears much as a stub, but I didn't have much to go on whlie writing the bio. I guess that is why I created the article here so maybe he will be a little well known and maybe if he so chooses can disclose more info about his life, I do recomend you at least read his novel beofre deleteing it, and then maybe you will see why it actually deserves to be listed, even as it is just a regionally well-known book. And I love the way you insult other users in these little forums, perhaps you should actually think before posting little rude comments. But You know what, I'll delete it myself... Go Fuck yourselves. southernrequiem | 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>One of 100,000 people killed in a concentration camp in Croatia. Actually the article says she's believed to be alive, but that's a hell of a long time to be missing.

<li><b>Delete</b> This article seems to have been produced by a Cambridge University computing lab assistant, who wanted to provide a guide for new students and visitors to the specific policies and technical details for the computer networks at different Cambridge University colleges.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is inappropriate for an encyclopedia - this information belongs on the cambridge computer lab website. Wikipedia is not an universal bulletin board (imagine if every university decided to put information about their specific policies on networks, accommodation, catering, discipline etc. on wikipedia). I don't even think this information belongs with the Cambridge University wikipedia entry. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 18:18, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The information about college networking policies is useful and much of it is not available elsewhere. It is as important to many people, for instance, as the fact that colleges have dining facilities, or that large numbers of people use bicycles for transportation in the city. Without having it mentioned on Wikipedia, however, most of these people wouldn't even realize that there might be anything to be concerned about until they have moved to Cambridge and enrolled in a college or department whose policies they find unacceptable. They will be stuck at this point since there is no way to get DSL in college housing or departmental offices. As I've written it, the page is incomplete, but I think it should be fleshed out and not deleted. I am a prospective student, not a lab assistant. <a href="../../../a/5/_/User%7EA5_333e.html" title="User:A5">A5</a> 19:15, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>There seems to be a persistant misunderstanding that this information is provided for people already <i>at</i> Cambridge. While it may be useful for students, it is mostly aimed at prospective students who will want to know what they are getting into. Freedom to use the internet, wired or wirelessly, to share it with visiting friends, etc. is a little more important than sherry. <a href="../../../a/5/_/User%7EA5_333e.html" title="User:A5">A5</a> 19:29, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Ouch. Nice to meet some genuinely nice people online...;-) I'm new to Wikipedia &amp; thought I'd write about something nice- I thought Wikipedia wanted to include everything it could but obviously I had the wrong idea &amp; I must apologise if I got things wrong. I'm saddened by the hostility I've come across here It doesn't matter if it's deleted it or not, but why pick holes in other people's entries?

<li>My intent was to lay out the reasons I don't believe Catfish show merits inclusion in wikipeida (if you were refering to my comments). I'm sorry if my comments came across as hostile. They were in no way an attack on you personally, 81.79.251.53. I just happen to think there is a strong case for not including most podcasts in wikipedia.

The first is to talk about the Cold War during the Reagan years (that is, it is used to periodize the Cold War into Cold War, Detente, Cold War II) (Paul Edward's book <i>The Closed World</i> from MIT Press does this quite a lot). The second use is somewhat as the original author implies — as a way of saying that the war on terror is the second Cold War. I think an article with this title could be made into something encyclopedic if it was about these two terms and what they are trying to imply in terms of periodization and history (along the lines, perhaps, of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_III_4587.html" title="World War III">World War III</a>), but the <i>current</i> text of the article is worth deleting. Just my two cents. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 21:16, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your efforts are apprecated. I wasn't implying that there's anything wrong with the site, just that it didn't seem particularly notable.

<dd>Sorry if I appeared a little defensive in my response, I've read up on lots of editing info now (that perhaps I should have read before I started editing, I know - but we all know what men and instruction manuals are like don't we!), and can understand why my edits might well be construed as spam. I'd like to reiterate though that any notion of intentional spamming is simply not the case. The Comedy Zone is a very popular site and doesn't need to use spamming tactics to get more visitors, so I'd rather that any edits that are questionable in this area are simply deleted (including this page, although I personally believe that it's valid), as I've no desire to be even remotely associated with such nefarious activities. <a href="../../../t/u/n/User%7ETuneless_d6ca.html" title="User:Tuneless">Tuneless</a> | <a href="../../../t/u/n/User_talk%7ETuneless_f002.html" title="User talk:Tuneless">Talk</a> 10:25, 14 October 2005 (GMT)</dd>

<dd>How many hits for "White supremacy" or "White power" or "Neo-Nazi" or "Nazi party" or "Ku Klu Klan" or all of the other synonyms and related topics? White supremacy has had a major effect on the history of the US, as well as the world if you extend "white supremacy" to include the racially-motivated actions of the Nazi party. This theory is miniscule in comparison. "Earth changes," by contrast, is a new theory, has nearly no published support, has no cultural impact whatsoever, and isn't peer-reviewed as a theory. (Even the goofy claims of one race's superiority over the others have been extensively investigated as scientific hypotheses.)

<li><s><b>Keep</b> but substantially refocus. As the article currently stands, it is too focused on events in the last year or so, but it has possibilities. The notion of 'Earth Changes' is actually fairly well known in the 'New Age' movement; I've stumbled across lots of documentary shows that discuss self-proclaimed psychics (Gordon Michael Scallion, for instance) who make claims about this sort of phenomenon. There's significant overlap with Judeo-Christian notions of the '<a href="../../../e/n/d/End_Times_279e.html" title="End Times">End Times</a>', but there's also a semi-parallell tradition in the new age/psychic phenomena movement. It's enough of a pop culture and social phenomenon to warrant documenting, even if the current article is a little weak. I think chopping out the 'current phenomenon' and global warming section and turning it into a stub on the belief in Earth Changes would make this an ultimately viable and useful article.</s> --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpasemunki_be3a.html" title="User:Spasemunki">Clay Collier</a> 23:54, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I completely re-wrote the article according to my own recommendations for making it focused on the <b>belief</b> in Earth Changes, rather than the somewhat un-focused bit that was there before. I really think that most of the criticisms that were leveled at the earlier article no longer apply.

<li><b>Comment</b> The rewrite is definitely better, but I'm still concerned about whether we're just replicating material found in other articles, and whether that will just make the entire subject harder to keep up-to-date.

<li>I'm not really seeing the maintenence issue. I haven't been able to find other articles that contain this particular information- could you link to where you think the overlap/problem is? There's quite a bit about belief in some sort of apocalypse, but nothing specific to this branch of the New Age tradition (except for a very short blurb on the <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Cayce_47e3.html" title="Edgar Cayce">Edgar Cayce</a> page about his particular predictions). I think that this constitutes a distinct (if somewhat diffuse) idea- and the specific term itself seems to be in fairly wide use among these New Age groups. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpasemunki_be3a.html" title="User:Spasemunki">Clay Collier</a> 21:22, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> we do usually delete forums, but this one is huge and seems notable. <b>Alexa rank 1,551.</b> Although not quite perfect, this article is a pretty good example of how a forum article should be done.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Gaia Online is a site with notable features that has drawn a significantly gigantic community. The user who put it up for deletion nomination seems to be doing it out of malice.

<li>I don't consider this to vanity, yet. If it stays as it is for a given period of time without providing any additional information, then yes. But, as it highlights an organization and not just an individual, and no one is named then how is it any more of a "vanity" than other similar organizations? <small>Unsigned comment by User:Elementary. This is the first edit this user has made.</small></li>

<p>I plan on adding more to this topic, but I've only just started. I'm new to Wiki, and don't know all the rules, but Greeno has a rich history and I think it should have a page that is linked from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst_5351.html" title="University of Massachusetts Amherst">UMass</a> main page. I think that people who are interested in learning about UMass would be interested in learning about the history of Greeno. It is a non-profit business somehow stays alive even though it is run by completely different people every 4 years. Please don't delete the article!</p>

<li>A detailed description of each item and accessory of clothing is a bit excessive, in that instance a picture is worth a thousand words.

<li>FWIW, 1. the article as it stands makes too many claims that can reasonably be taken as assertions of notability. 2. the thoughts of the subject of an article on the article can be important context, but should not enter into decision making over keeping or deleting the article.

<li>Aren't I?&#160;:) If it means anything, it's borne out of experience with a functional bureaucracy. When you see very poor articles get speedied, but then nominated for undeletion at VFU and then returned to AFD to get redeleted 20 days later, that sort of becomes a strong incentive to help get things done correctly the first time, if only to save us some time. But you're right, it makes me look like a humorless drone.&#160;:) <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">enceph</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#666699">alon</font></a> <i>20:51, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</i></li>

<p>His students, such as me, thought he would appreciate this article on him. However, it seems that he does not.

However, it is published by <a href="http://www.PublishAmerica.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.PublishAmerica.com" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. Whlie this is not a vanity outfit, it acts unlike a normal publisher in that it doesn't make any effort to market the book, and it produces a small number of copies that are sent to sellers on a 'returnable' basis.

<li><b>Keep</b> What is this all about? Who's to say that the LPO doesn't exist? I hate every single one of them, but they're definitely real. What does Yggdrasil know anyways?? What kind of name is that? I was in Calgary a few weeks ago where I understand they've just opened up a new chapter and believe me, I wish I had never found out about them. I am a fairly religious person, so one Sunday after church I'm waiting to cross the street, and this little old nun was having some trouble. Being the nice guy that I am, I decided to help her accross the street. There were a few other people crossing the street as well as it was a busy service. I'll never forget the guy walking next to me. He was wearing a blue jersey with I think "Chang" or something written on it. (I later found out it was an Everton Football Club jersey (the scouse accent was unmistakenable thinking about it now) which makes me wonder where the last line of the description came from..... Yggdrasil probably added it if he really is a member of a rival crew) Anyways, we get across the street and the man (I'd guess 6'3, brown hair, fairly big guy in general)grabbed the little old lady and ran. I tried chasing after him, but believe me, I'm not much of a physical specimen. I keep looking for them when I hear screams from behind a building. Awful screams that I'll never forget. It took me another few minutes to find where they came from, and when I got there, all I saw was the nun's black robe. I never saw the little old lady again, or the guy dressed in blue, but if I had..... well I don't know what I would have done, he was huge. Needless to say, I was pretty pissed off about the days happenings. I got back to my friends' place where I was staying and told him about the events of the day. To my surprise, he just shrugged it off and explained everything to me. He knew about the LPO and apparently that was the 5th nun that month to just "disappear". Apparently they have connections inside multi-national organizations and are next to impossible to track down. I'll never forget that day, but reading these BS posts about how it's not real has got me pretty riled up. Are any of you even from Calgary??--Concerned Calgary visitor</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> LPO is real, if you dont know ya betta ask somebody from TOXTETH.Yggdrasil is a member of a rival crew hell bent on disrespecting the LPO. Fuck you, you cock sucking twats......LPO will have its revenge.--London Philharmonic Orchestra</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I personally know someone who was robbed by Yggdrasil... I don't think he should be considered credible in this matter being a memeber of a rival group. -LPO Forever-</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'm not sure why some people think this is a hoax but LPO is no laughing matter. There have been rumours flying around that members of the gang are appearing in London Ont. Canada. Law enforcement officials are attributing the apparent relocation of these gang members to the record number of homicides in London this year. -Scared In London</li>

<li>This podcast is currently ranked #8 in the world at podcastalley.com and that's in 4 short months. How is that "non-notable"?</li>
</ul>
<p>This show is of no consequence to the general community. The rankings on podcastalley.com are based on votes by listeners. It's possible for one person to vote repeatedly, thus making the rankings useless. It seems like the top ten podcasts in the world as per ranked by podcastalley are different each month, which makes citing NLO as the number eight podcast even less useful, as it is likely that a new crop of podcasts will hold the top spots in the coming month.</p>
<p>Bottom line: this is a non-notable podcast. Efforts to argue otherwise are based on irrelevant information. This is NLO-Cruft and should be deleted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spoken like a true person that knows nothing about podcasts or podcasting. Votng is by listeners, making NLO a topic of pop culture. It's not person for one person to vote repeatedly unless they do so from different IP addresses and email addresses. You don't know what you're talking about. NLO has consistently been climbing the ranking snce it's inception. There are a million entries in Wikipedia that serve only as a reference for pop culture items. This is no different. Do not delete!</li>

<p>This article is nominated for deletion as I believe there was no such female rank in the SS. Females were not permitted to join the SS or hold regular SS ranks. Such female members were known collectively as "SS-Helferin".

<li>I have removed the titles from the article as ambiguious and unverifable. I also have a scan of an actual SS-Female Auxiliary record which I will add to the talk page of Helferin as soon as I make the article. In the record, there is no mention at all of these strange other ranks. The ranks, themselves, looks like someone just added "in" to the end of exsting male SS ranks. I am very suspicious that these ranks do not in fact exist. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 18:35, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margot_Dreschel_2717.html" title="Margot Dreschel">Margot Dreschel</a> article does reference this word, however this was added to the article by the same IP that created the Obersturmführerin article; not exactly compelling evidence. Googling the term turns up several mirrors of this wiki article and the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margot_Dreschel_2717.html" title="Margot Dreschel">Margot Dreschel</a> wiki article. It also produces a number of references to the term on German language sites (big surprise eh)? My German isn't the greatest, but it doesn't appear that the sites referencing this word in German are even remotely related to the SS or Nazis... though the references <i>could</i> be to Nazism as the context may be understood by the writer and the intended audience. Google translates Obersturmführerin as "Upper tower guide" thoug I think literally it would translate to "over storm leader". Point is that so far this isn't remotely verifiable and unless someone can provide a solid source for the claim that this is a female rank in the SS, I will say delete. On a side note, it appears that women were only allowed in the SS Auxillary ranks (as <a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> stated).--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:20, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

I fail to see why this school is any more important than any other secondary school in the country. Also, in my opinion, "good article" does not mean "worthy of an article". If the article was not formatted and presented in a nice way, would people be so keen to keep it? I just find it strange that non-notability is a strong deletion criteria, but because the article is on a school, it's considered to be worth keeping. This is not an argument, and it's not going to harm me if the article stays or not, but I'm just trying to get an understanding of the thinking behind the votes. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Lawrence_67fa.html" title="User:Daniel Lawrence">Daniel Lawrence</a> 17:42, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I can imagine it's a debate that has gone on for quite some time now. Your article was interesting, and it's good to read something considering both viewpoints. I didn't know there was such a big thing on Wikipedia about school articles. I've stayed away from creating any of my own in the past, because I thought they would be deleted for non-notability. I know better now. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Lawrence_67fa.html" title="User:Daniel Lawrence">Daniel Lawrence</a> 18:35, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't like your nomination. I was professional but brief. You state again that "Non-notability is a strong deletion criteria," and I repeat "Could you point that out in policies for me?"

<ul>
<li>Hipocrite, briefly and professionally, my answer to your request for pointing is: Examine deletion log, any day. Note reasons given. See <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_facto.html" title="De facto">de facto</a>. Note also that the recently adopted CSD A7 (though not directly on point) does suggest in its terms that "notability" is a recognizable, important feature of the deletion process. Note CSD A7 adopted by consensus. Thanks <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 04:46, 12 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>CSD A7, adopted by consensus, reads, in full "An article about a real person that does not assert that person's importance or significance. If the assertion is disputed or controversial, it should be taken to AFD instead. For details, see Wikipedia:Deletion of vanity articles." This does not apply to schools, which are not real people, nor does it have the word "notable" in it. I dispute that de facto notability is a criteria, given the fact that the comment down one from this, mine, and scores of others dispute such a distinction. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 17:33, 12 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I suggested, CSD A7 is not directly on point, but it suggests that "unimportant" or "insignificant" bios are deletable on site -- to claim that this doesn't reach notability (at least for biographies) would be an act of semantic sophistry of the first order. Your dispute is noted. Also note many others accept this de facto use, and so your apparent surprise at Daniel Lawrence's observation was either a fairly strange oversight, or disingenuity on your point. Thanks, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 21:01, 12 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My disgust at Daniel Lawrence's willingness to dissemble regarding "strong deletion criteria" is disgust at dissembling. Even the strongest deletionists do not call the disputed, possibly "de facto" deletion criteria that has not deleted a school in weeks "strong." <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 13:59, 13 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, I see the reason for your upset, and I apologize for my own hard-line.&#160;:) It has, however, subsequently become apparent that D. Lawrence is a relative newbie to the schools debate, in his defense. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 14:19, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anyway there's no consensus to apply non-notability to schools, or metro stations, or hollywood movies, or villages, or pokemons, or warships, so it can't be that strong a criterion. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 21:06, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Time is expensive - that also applies to users. Since we're talking generically, my opinion is that we should be considering with school articles if there is enough specific information on a school to warrant a separate article, or whether the information would be better served elsewhere (e.g information on the village's elementary school in the village article). If a school article is long, pretty, and 95% a statement of the obvious then one has to wonder if it is the best way to present the information. For example, although this article is better than a number of the virtual stubs we've had recently, a lot of the organisation described is just mirroring the UK's National Curriculum specification, and therefore will be the same as the vast majority of schools in the UK (although a school psychology department is a new one to me). <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 19:09, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Merges do not require a deletion - in fact, a vote for "merge" is a vote for keep (and replace with a redirect). Feel free to go ahead and merge things, and if consensus agrees that things should be merged, then they will remain merged. In fact, if this article were not under AFD, you could go ahead and merge it right now. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 19:13, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and expand</b> I was the one who started this, and then I got sidetracked by work, unfortunately. My apologies to the community. I happen to agree that this article is not anywhere near finished and I would not let all the contributions stand as they are definitely not good enough, but it was intended to invite contributions and get started. I requested that people woould contribute to the discussion as I was happy to take in suggestions and write up the article myself, and I wish people had done this. I <b>strongly</b> feel that there should be simplified versions of difficult topics. Frankly, as a physicist myself I hate some of the main QM article. It is not suitable as it is for an encyclopaedia article. It's written by phsicists for physicists, not for explanation. I am not convinced of merging it with <a href="../../../../simple/q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" class="extiw" title="simple:Quantum_mechanics">simple:Quantum mechanics</a>. That is for simple English, I was trying to use straightforward English and expand in some detail on the ideas, not quite the same thing. However, it would be better than nothing.

<li>"Quantum mechanics is, at least at first glance and at least in part, a <b>mathematical machine for predicting the behaviors of microscopic particles</b> — or, at least, of the measuring instruments we use to explore those behaviors — and in that capacity, it is spectacularly successful: in terms of power and precision, head and shoulders above any theory we have ever had. Mathematically, the theory is well understood; we know what its parts are, how they are put together, and why, in the mechanical sense (i.e., in a sense that can be answered by describing the internal grinding of gear against gear), the whole thing performs the way it does, how the information that gets fed in at one end is converted into what comes out the other. The question of what kind of a world it describes, however, is controversial; <b>there is very little agreement, among physicists and among philosophers, about what the world is like according to quantum mechanics.</b> Minimally interpreted, the theory describes a set of facts about the way the microscopic world impinges on the macroscopic one, how it affects our measuring instruments, described in everyday language or the language of classical mechanics. Disagreement centers on the question of what a microscopic world, which affects our apparatuses in the prescribed manner, is, or even could be, like intrinsically; or how those apparatuses could themselves be built out of microscopic parts of the sort the theory describes." <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm/" class="external text" title="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm/" rel="nofollow">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> You propose to provide a simplified version of <b>mathematical machine for predicting the behaviors of microscopic particles</b> by leaving out the math concepts that describe the behaviors? You propose to provide a simplified version of <b>what the world is like according to quantum mechanics</b> even when the experts can't? Or are you proposing others do this? It would be both useful and instructive for you to try writing a simplied version of quantum entangement (one tiny part of quantum mechanics). Posturing is easy. I encourage you to use quantum entangement to prove me wrong with an example of the type of treatment you propose for quantum mechanics. I hope this is contructive enough for you. If not, tell me why. I encourage your curiosity in quantum mechanic; I just think you should learn more about it before you jump into this task you have set for yourself. I believe the task as you have framed it will necesarily be a failure. I note that the content you have not deleted in the article is more along the lines of "history of QM". Another suggestion would be to write an article on that - the history of QM. I'm sure that would be a smashing success (if the article does not already exist - I haven't looked).

<li>WAS, while I appreciate you are being slightly more constructive I believe you are missing the point - several times! If you would stop pasting in quotes from other people for 5 minutes it might help. (1) You seem to miss (more than once) where I wrote I happen to be an (ex-)physicist, and I spent a decade in the 'trade'. I have postgraduate qualifications from a prominent Physics Dept. I say this NOT as a boast; there are many many better-qualified physicists than me here and many better able to explain the topic to a specialist audience than I am. Rather I say this as a point of information, and also that my 'curiosity' is quite well-sated, thank you. I have already learned and forgotten more about QM than many people will ever learn (not referring to you, I don't know how much you know, you only ever paste in other's words). Actually this is an issue, I have forgotten lots of detail over the years, but I did learn it in the first place. I have never said I was the only or the best person to do this task, I'm certainly not the best-qualified physicist here, but I'm probably one of the better explainers, I would like to believe. (2) This whole idea all was meant (by me) to be a work that would take quite some time, probably by several people. You seem to think a fully-formed article just jumps out. I happened to get swamped with work recently, which is why I was not able to get back to the article, which was unfortunate timing! Maybe the article could be 'hibernated' or hidden while it's worked on - is there a way to do this??? That's why I tried to get people to contribute to the discussion, not the article itself! I know I won't personally able to do much for the next few weeks, so I would be ok with mothballing it somehow. (3) I believe it is perfectly possible to explain concepts with minimal maths. There is a grand total of 1 equation in A Brief History of Time. Of course this 'explanation' is not a full QM treatise. What I am suggesting is more like can we get across the ideas to an intelligent person who doesn't have a degree in physics. (4) These quotes you love are really not relevant, sorry. (5) On quantum entanglement, I would say that some of the article here is actually not that bad, barring the equations. It wouldn't be a terrible starting point at explaining the matter simply. (6) I think, contrary to you, that there are many decent attempts to explain QM ideas in an accessible manner, and I think it is possible to attempt to explain the nauture of the problems with it too. Of course I never said I could resolve all its problems, where did you get that from? But I can SPEAK about them! You really miss this point. What part of "non-technical introduction to QM" don't you get? I never said I was going to clear up the subject entirely, that's laughable. (7) What was left after deleting was just my own quick text, frankly that's all I want to stand over. I happen to agree with you strongly that much of the text submitted to the article was inadequate. What I did yesterday was just to revert to what I have had the time to do and called it a stub which seemed prudent. It's really very little as I'm well aware of. It wasn't meant to be a history <i>per se</i>, but an introduction to an article. I agree that a History of QM could be a fine article. Incidentally, I was about to remove the link from the main QM article to this, but I see it's been done, good! It can be put back later if warranted.(8) If we did a quick poll I think it is not me who would be described as posturing in this discussion. You are making great sweeping statements about how everything is impossible, pasting in quotes from other people all the time, so enough! If you can't/won't contribute then butt out and go contribute where you are able. Your confrontational tone is winning you no friends in this matter, and makes that quote on your user page hilarious! I was originally motivated by a desire to explain and invite collaboration; not to abuse, ridicule, and obfuscate. So, sorry WAS, I will reply to you no more, I have not the time or energy so don't bother trying to rise me any further. I have a life outside here. Take care.

<li><b>Keep</b>, <b>rename</b> to Quantum mechanics for beginners, per above suggestion. - I'm the one that put the delete on this article. At that time it was unbelievably bad and no contributor seemed to have competance to do the job. Since then Paulc1001 (the creator of the article) has deleted the bad stuff and retained not QM-simplified but QM-intro or QM-beginners stuff. Therefore keeping the article but renaming it to QM - for beginners as suggested above seems to me to be the best option at this point. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 16:38, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agreed, but this isn't a discography. Discographies include singles, albums, and possibly compilations, not remixes. The excessive length of this list and its extremely low information-to-data ratio (so which is better: the Armand's 'British Nites' Remix of Lucky Love or Armand's 'British Nite' Mix Edit?) illustrate why that is.

<li>I disagree. Please Elaborate. 144.160.98.31 15:02, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK. Firstly Wikipedia is not a dictionary, and the article is a dictionary definition. Furthermore, IMV it's not a place for articles on every form of drunkenness in existence - if we include this one we also need <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trashed.html" title="Trashed">Trashed</a>, Trolleyed, <a href="../../../w/a/s/Wasted.html" title="Wasted">Wasted</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammered.html" title="Hammered">Hammered</a>, Mandibled, Cucumbered and any other term made up by a drunken student to describe their state. In any case, to have articles we need to have verifiable statements about what these words are - are there any press cuttings that talk about 'being shasted'? Essentially it's a load of immature nonsense of no encyclopedic interest and we should delete it. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 15:17, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, wikipedia serves as much of a "dictionary purpose" as a dictionary. See:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/i/n/Ain%27t.html" title="Ain't">Ain't</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../h/o/m/Homie.html" title="Homie">Homie</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../s/u/b/Subcrawl.html" title="Subcrawl">Subcrawl</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_goggles.html" title="Beer goggles">Beer_goggles</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these words are either slang or don't exist and aren't used in popular culture (e.g. "Subcrawl"). Also, the majority of these entries are <b>definitions</b> with a questionable "history" attached.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>All of those articles are a good bit more encyclopedic than Shasted. If you can trace its origin back to 1696 or get a line of toys named after it then it may well be encyclopedic. As it stands, it <a href="../../../a/i/n/Ain%27t.html" title="Ain't">ain't</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 15:55, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not a student, actually far from it. I first heard this term come from a parent of a drunk driver during a speech. I don't have the text from the speech but if I did, I would readily supply it. I'm glad you're confident in your abilities to judge maturity, but maybe you should actually <b>read</b> some of the content in the wikipedia. 144.160.98.31 15:50, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Even <i>notable</i> words aren't supposed to get dictionary-definition articles. BTW neither <a href="../../../w/a/s/Wasted.html" title="Wasted">wasted</a> nor <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trashed.html" title="Trashed">trashed</a> is about terms for drunkenness. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 07:25, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This is a dicdef of a neologism (apparently no relevant Google hits -- it's apparently a surname, though). Since nobody is using "shasted" in writing to mean drunk, it doesn't even belong on the List of slang terms for drunkenness. We don't need encyclopedia articles about different slang terms that all mean drunk; the encyclopedic article about the condition of being drunk is <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drunkenness.html" title="Drunkenness">Drunkenness</a> which deals with the issue of being trashed, wasted, hammered, and any other thing you can call it. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:07, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>abstain</b> I think that the person writting this must have know the originator so he put in his name, but i have heard this used by my friends before. I think that if someone removes the originators name it will be fine. Plus, if you want to remove this page then remove the woot page and all other definition pages of leet. they are all in the main leet page as definitions so if the final vote is to delete this page then delete all the leet definition pages.</li>
<li><b>Abstain</b> I agree with the above person. I have used it and I think that the person writting just wanted their name out or somethin'. and with the deletion- then delete woot and other leet words own pages.</li>

<p>Entirely non-notable and possibly non-existent literary movement which I suspect of being vanity advertising for the writers involved. Google hits for Syncretist Movement as a literary, as opposed to religious, movement seem to all derive from this article. No references are provided to enable verification.

<li><s><b>Speedy Keep</b> Google for Syncretism rather than <i>Syncretist Movement</i>. Try adding some authors such as Derrida.

<li>None of which has anything to do with G.

<dd>he also does not like following the rules. The vote to delete Category:Totalitarian dictators had been closed without a consensus, so that category should still be around. 172 removed the notice of closing and then proceeded to solicit votes to support his position, after supporters of the category thought the voting was over. Consult with the admins on that deletion for the details of his behavior. This is an article, far more notable than many articles, and not only is it different than a category, there is different text than that which was voted down in the category. I had prepared this text for the category page, after there was no consensus for deletion of the page, and the voting had been closed, in order to improve the category so that it would answer 172s objections and do better should there be another attempt to delete the category. 172 of course, will deny that it addresses his objections, but that doesn't matter, many others will see that it takes the stings out of his assertions that this cannot be implimented in a NPOV manner. Instead of pressing for arbcom review of 172s behavior, and a restoration of the catagory due to the voting irregularies he fostered. I was just going to wait a month and create it again. In the mean time this is as legitimate as any article. Unfortunately, a lot of work by several editors was destroyed during the vote for catagory deletion process by 172s behavior, since he was busy deleting the category from all articles while the vote was still going on and had to be admonished. As far as I know there is no easy central place to recover those totalilitarian dictator candidates. In summary:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>the original category should still be around and was only defeated due to irregularities by 172 after the voting had been closed without a consensus
<dl>
<dd>The criteria for deciding whether to close a debate on CfD is not set in stone. One editor did not see a consensus, and moved to close. I asked for more time, and reopened the debate, given that the trend was moving toward the delete side once a more clear explanation of why the category was inherently POV was made in the middle of the voting period. With more time, a consensus was established for deletion; and then an administrator eventually deleted the article <i>without my involvement</i>. All the attacks on me are just meant to distract everyone from the fact that there is a consensus against creating an article along the lines of "totalitarian dictators."<a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 11:14, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>so that event is irrelevant to making this a candidate for speedy deletion, this article is notable in its own right</li>
<li>this article is different than a category</li>
<li>the text in this article is different than that in the category, at least at the time of the voting and irregularities, so its merits are different, and its relation to the previous irregular events has been broken</li>
<li>the changes in the text are intended to address 172s objections, not his satisfaction, but perhaps to the satisfaction of others
<dl>
<dd>My objections aren't so special. What about the objections of the dozens of other people who came out in favor of deleting the category? <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 11:14, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>172 should be banned from editing the article, since he cannot edit it good faith, he has already concluded that it cannot be made workable, so any edits are likely to be as disruptive as his other behavior has been
<dl>
<dd>Pot kettle. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 11:14, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>this is the seventh point, if there are any fewer than 7, beware, 172 may have deleted any he didn't like. Admins should check the history every time he edits. If they had known this before, the category would still be around.
<dl>
<dd>You are being really disingenuous. You have no evidence that I deleted any votes. That's because I did not delete any votes. Yet I don't expect you to apologize when you eventually find out that I did not tamper with the CfD vote in question, nor any vote ever for that matter. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 11:14, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I never said you deleted votes, but reopening a vote that people had seen closed is worse than deleting votes. So then you could run a campaign without opposition, like the one party systems. You never really opened the vote, that wasn't your right, you only had the power to disguise the fact that it had been closed. You then contacted a half dozen or more likely voters for your position, they voted the way you intended. And then the finally the vote had been open long enough for you, just three more days with no notice to those who in good faith thought the issue was over. You should shouldn't be trusted with editing powers, you have no sense of perspective. You couldn't wait another month to try again or let the editors of the category prove themselves to you. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 11:27, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You certainly implied it: <i>beware, 172 may have deleted any he didn't like. Admins should check the history every time he edits. If they had known this before, the category would still be around.</i> Shame on you for making baseless accusations without any evidence. Further, I did nothing improper in reopening the debate. Reopening the debate for more time was not a violation of the spirit of the process. You are correct in pointing out that more people came out in favor of deleting the category after reopening. However, in contrast to voting in a single party state, leaving more time for discussion also gave the authors of the category more time to state their case and persuade people to see things in a different light. The fact that this did not happen is a reflection of the consensus to delete a category that the vast majority of editors consider unworkable and inherently POV. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 11:44, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You misunderstand the spirit of the process. The reason a supermajority consensus is required for deletion is not to frustrate the majority, it is to protect the minority. You destroyed that spirit by immoral, irregular and abusive use of powers and to get your own selfish way, right away. Yes, you only used powers that anyone of us could've used. You seem to think that having a power gives you the right to use it. Even wiki editing powers are a trust to be used and not abused. The voting was closed, anyone of us could have reopened it according to your reasoning. You should think about how universalizable that type of behavior is.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 11:58, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Repeating the same nonsense over and over again isn't going to make it correct. First, please review <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">Wikipedia:Be bold</a>. No one has any reason to get upset because I reopened a discussion for more feedback; after all, more intelligent feedback is always better than less feedback. Second, please review Wikipedia is not a democracy. According to the administrator who deleted the article, a consensus was established in favor of deletion. I did not make that determination. By this stage, protecting the minority is not an issue. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia; so it cannot disregard encyclopedic standards in order to appease a small minority of users. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 12:22, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I implied that you might do it. After doing what you did, why not suspect that you could also delete votes? Just exactly how do you draw your lines of ethical behavior?

<dd>I did not deceive anyone. There was no need to check the page history to find out that I was the one who reopened the debate. I said so on multiple pages, and informed the administrator who had earlier closed the debate right away on his user talk page. By the way, <i>I implied that you might do it</i> is as weasely of a response as they come. With no evidence that I have ever deleted other people's comments, you had no business making the insinuation. That insinuation would be tantamount to (say) me saying that you might have wife whom you beat on the basis of not seeing any evidence falsifying the claim. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 12:22, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Silverback's attempt to make me out to be the bogyman is a diversion from the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2005_September_23#Category:Totalitarian_dictators" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2005_September_23#Category:Totalitarian_dictators" rel="nofollow">there was a consensus to delete the category</a>. Yes, I reopened the debate. This did nothing more than allow more time for more feedback and more perspective in order for a consensus to be reached. And a consensus was reached. SimonP nominated the category for deletion. Deletion was supported by CalJW, Jiang, Haham hanuka, Wikiwizzy, Shanes, Tony Sidaway , Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters, mikkalai, SqueakBox, Mirv, CdC, Nat Krause, Jdforrester, Ziggurat, Modster, RustyCale, Jobe6, Alai, Aldux, siafu, Sean Curtin, Zscout370, fvw, John Kenney, FayssalF, Str1977, and me. For some reason or another, Silverback is attempting to vilify me and focus on my reasons for deleting the article. But this is nothing but a red herring to divert attention from the compelling reasons to delete the category brought up by dozens of other editors when a consensus was established. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 10:27, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I am a lawyer, and you can, Trovatore, as long as the translation is not verbatim. Facts themselves are not copyrightable. You translated the thing, so, if concerned, make your translation a bit "freer". <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 16:06, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think your advice is appropriately cautious. Do you practice IP law? A translation is a derivative work, and copyright can still apply. This is explicitly stated in <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106" class="external text" title="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106" rel="nofollow">U.S. Title 17</a>. A non-verbatim translation does not provide an end around copyright law. This article is very short and is limited to factual material and so provides very little opportunity "artistic expression" so it may be OK in this particular instance, but I think your suggestion is simply wrong in general. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 00:06, 12 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Briefly, I'll remind you that it is the burden of the copyright holder to prove infringement. For an article of a small size, or for one -- like this one also -- whose nature is a bare recitation of essential details (as with a newspaper item in brief), the act of translating freely would obscure sufficiently the origin of the material such that proof of infringement would be practically impossible. You are correct, and I would never intend, to apply my advice to <i>a novel</i>, or even a <i>poem</i>, or any other substantially original work of any length. However, I maintain the value of proposition advanced for all <i>translated, properly encyclopedic stubs</i>. So, I suppose that my advice would be incautious if anyone were unfortunate enough to think that it applied to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikibooks.html" title="Wikibooks">Wikibooks</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikisource.html" title="Wikisource">Wikisource</a>, or an extended analytic article here. Given the context, though, I'll stand behind my advice. If you care to continue this dispute, my talk page is always open.&#160;:) <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 03:43, 12 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think this is important, so I'll answer briefly here. You write, "Given the context, though, I'll stand by my advice." Here's the context:
<ul>
<li>Probably still a copyvio. I'm not a lawyer but I don't think you can get rid of copyright just by <i>translating something</i> [emphasis mine]. I'm not personally a big fan of copyright but I think we all understand that WP has to be careful about it. --Trovatore 16:02, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And this is your response:
<ul>
<li>I am a lawyer, and you can, Trovatore, as long as the translation is not verbatim. -- Xoloz 16:06, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In context, your response says that you can get rid of copyright by <i>translating something</i> as long as the translation is not verbatim. This is simply not true. You are correct to point out that a recitation of facts is not copyrightable in the U.S. (caution may be needed here too, as I believe this is not the case in some other jurisdictions), but this has <i>absolutely nothing</i> to do with translation—translation is a <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_herring.html" title="Red herring">red herring</a> here. Your advice relied on unstated assumptions that are not true in general, even in the context of Wikipedia articles. If you meant to say that copyright shouldn't be a problem for this specific translation, you should have said so explicitly. I have seen translated pages on wikipedia that are likely copyvios, and I tagged one such just a few days ago. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 09:45, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Granted, the hobo signs pages have merit, but not one of the Hobo signs pages makes an attempt to illustrate what an [Unsafe Camp] could be. --User:152.22.18.16 20:49, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why do we need an illustration of this? Any sane reader (and probably most <i>in</i>sane readers) could imagine what might constitute an unsafe campsite. And why do we need an entire article devoted to one sign? --<a href="../../../a/u/r/User%7EAurochs_96ed.html" title="User:Aurochs">Aurochs</a> 21:05, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually those links added were to a slightly different site I believe. There was a whole array of these things they call [cryptids] and some other interesting illustrations.

<li><b>Comment</b>: it doesn't seem to get a lot of unique, non-Wikipedia search results for a supposedly well known myth. Half of the top ten are Wikipedia mirrors and the later pages are similar, many of the other hits are weblogs and forums. No reputable sites jumped out at me. Also, the article admits only one factual reference exists. Articles on myths should be well sourced. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 04:42, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This is a common problem with the ethnology of obscure or marginalised groups. The Kosovo gypsies were and still are very much a marginalised group in that part of the world - it's quite possible that <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatomir_Vukanovi%C4%87_efe9.html" title="Tatomir Vukanović">Tatomir Vukanović</a>, the man who recorded the myth, was the only ethnologist working with Kosovo gypsies at that time. In that sort of situation, you have to look to the reputation of the individual researcher to judge how likely it is that his account is above board. Vukanović does seem to have had a very solid reputation. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 07:17, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That's a good point. That's why I added a comment instead of voting delete - I thought it would be unlikely a serious researcher would make it up. However, the ridiculousness of the myth is hard for me to get past. If he didn't make it up, I would suspect that it was a joke, a children's story or made up by another group to make gypsies look foolish. I'll vote <b>keep</b> unless it is disproven. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 07:40, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even serious researchers make mistakes. That's why there's such a thing as peer review. An encyclopedia should only report as fact things which are known to be true, not things which are yet to be disproven. This is not a tabloid. Another option would be to rewrite the article to make it clear that whether or not vampir watermolens are real folklore is unknown, but any efforts to edit the article in that direction are quickly reverted which is why I think deletion is the only valid option at this point. As it stands this article is a huge embarassment to Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../1/9/8/User%7E198.93.113.49.html" title="User:198.93.113.49">198.93.113.49</a> 16:51, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>STRONG KEEP This article is highly accurate in content. My watermelons at home started to have vampiristic qualities and I didn't know why - until I read this article! It possibly saved my life. People need to be informed on this subject. It is well researched.</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: Have to agree that, given the citations and source information, the article definitely should stay unless positively proven to be false.

<li><b>Keep</b> As the creator of this page, I wish to see it stay. The Yukon Legislature does have as site just as every other legislature in Canada does. I would also point out that this follows the same format of the other legislatures including; The House of Commons, the Senate, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, BC, and soon to be Nova Scotia and NewBrunswick (as soon as I get around to it). If anyone wonders where this comes from, I recieved the seating plan after contacting the Speaker of the Yukon Legislature Ted Staffen. If anyone wishes to see it, I can upload it. It took quite a while to get this so don't waste it. <a href="../../../m/s/1/User%7EMS123_ef22.html" title="User:MS123">MS123</a></li>

<li>Whoa, nelly. <a href="../../../m/s/1/User%7EMS123_ef22.html" title="User:MS123">MS123</a> seems to be right; several other Canadian legislative houses (including the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_House_of_Commons_f3ab.html" title="Canadian House of Commons">House of Commons</a>) have, for some reason, graphic representations of their seating plans as separate articles from the ones about the Houses themselves. See as follows:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_House_of_Commons_seating_plan_c790.html" title="Canadian House of Commons seating plan">Canadian House of Commons seating plan</a>,</li>

<li><a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Legislative_Assembly_seating_plan_b472.html" title="Ontario Legislative Assembly seating plan">Ontario Legislative Assembly seating plan</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In most other cases, there's a graphic on the main article. My reactions:</p>
<ol>
<li>I <i>don't</i> think these should have their own articles; if we keep them at all, they should somehow be made to fit into the legislative house's main article.</li>
<li>The sidescrolling in the House of Commons graphic is unacceptable; no Wikipedia article should <b>ever</b> scroll beyond the existing right border of the screen. If it just can't fit that way, <b>structure it vertically</b>.</li>
<li>In writing a Wikipedia article, the base assumption you have to start with is that your potential reader knows <b>nothing</b> about the topic. Your audience is not a person who already knows enough about <a href="../../../y/u/k/Yukon.html" title="Yukon">Yukon</a> politics that you don't need to explain anything for them -- your audience is a person who doesn't have a freaking clue in HELL what a "Fentie" and a "Duncan" and an "Edzerza" are, or what the difference is between blue and orange, or why the black box isn't lined up with the rest of them. In other words, you have to either wikilink the names so they can find out, or just leave the whole thing inside a longer article in the first place so they actually have some <i>context</i> for it.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>&lt;/end-rant&gt;</b> and <b>merge all</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:54, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The reason why these articles have thier own seperate pages is because we, or least I wished to keep the size of each article down. Certainly <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> must see that putting the entire seating plan of the House of Commons or the Ontario legislature on the same article as thier appropriate legislature page would increase the size of the article by way too much. We could replace these with images, however this leads to much difficulty in having to replace each time the legislature chamges. The other legislatures follow the same format, which I think is important. There is no telling how large the size of the legislatures will be so why not leave this page where it is. To one point the previous user made about Yukon Politics. This page <b>only</b> links to the Yukon Legislature page. The only way to come across this page, other than a search, is to go through the legislature page. This page contains a full list of every MLA. It shows the party leaders, Speaker, and cabinet ministers. Where is the diffuculty in finding out who Fentie is?</p>
<p>Moving on to the House of Commons. There is nothing wrong with having the page shift to the right or the left. This is something that shouldn't be a problem. The seating plan, I believe, would be more difficult to read in an up or down format. Such a thing would be more difficult to format and will be much longer as well. If it ain broke, don't fix it.</p>

<li>I disagree with you, MS: each page should have enough context that if someone comes across it by clicking on "random article" from the navigatio menu to your left, there is enough context and at least one link to another page that they can start to figure out what it's about. I think that is a Wikipedia standard. So if it is going to stay as a separate page, it must have some context, like that which I recently added to <a href="../../../y/u/k/Yukon_Legislative_Assembly_870c.html" title="Yukon Legislative Assembly">Yukon Legislative Assembly</a>. As far as where it belongs, that depends on the size of the article. I don't think that the YLA page is too big yet to require a fork, so we might as well put everything on one page. The House of Commons and Ont. leg. are big enough to warrant forking. By the way, I do like these charts, and thank you for taking the time to make them.

<li>There's everything wrong with having the page scroll to the right, actually. It's <i>always</i> considered bad form on the web; it's <i>never</i> acceptable web page formatting <i>anywhere</i>. And similarly, "you can only get here from there anyway" is never a valid argument against providing the necessary context; every article <i>has</i> to be formatted and structured as if it were a standalone entity. You can <i>never</i> just assume that your reader either (a) knows what you're talking about, or (b) knows how to <i>find out</i> what you're talking about. It's not just an arbitrary Wikipedia rule; it's a basic requirement of any legitimate article in any reference work of any kind. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 23:38, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
Hey Bearcat, STFU! Just because other pages use this type of format, it doesn't mean that these FEW pages do too! Most of the internet is laced with spyware and advertising, yet I see no argument for that nor would I expect to. Wikipedia is unique. It is an encyclopedia not a webpage. I used to argue that the look of a page or format of a page was more important than the information provided. Now I see that the information provided is more important. Can the seating of the HofC stand alone? I think so. There is a table that shows the colour of each party, so we know what the colours mean. I have added a link to a list of MP's. The title does say Seating Plan. I would not go to this page and look for information about pickles. But finally this page is not supposed to stand alone. It is a fork or offshoot of the House of Commons page. It is done this way to conserve space. <a href="../../../m/s/1/User%7EMS123_ef22.html" title="User:MS123">MS123</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Don't you tell me to STFU. That's completely inappropriate and unacceptable. And yes, information is the defining criterion of an encyclopedia; <b>that information still has to be presented in a usable way</b>. Scrolling off the right side of the screen is not acceptable; providing no context within the article itself is not acceptable. <b>It's not just an arbitrary Wikipedia rule; it's a basic requirement of any reference work of any kind.</b> <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:12, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll say STFU if I feel like it. We are talking about a seating plan of the legislature in the yukon. Put your opinions on this on you user page, otherwise, who asked you? A BASIC REQUIREMENT? According to you! It is no big deal to scroll to the right on a page. Having to do so doesn't make it unusable. Have you read the page? Why is there no context? What more do you need? There is a link to the Gov't plan, and place in the title Canadian House of Commons. I say again, I would go there to look for pickles. The plan is explained. What is your problem, are you just too lasy to click on the scroll bar, is that it? Never have I, or anyone else I know come across such a site and said "oh, I can't use this" I say that certain sites that shift to the right is unappropriate. But this is different. You don't read it like a book. It is not a continuous sentence that is unreadable. It is for reference.</p>

<li>This is a discussion page. I have every right to express my opinion on an open and active discussion <b>in that discussion</b>, and you can take your "STFU and whine about it on your user page" and mail it to someone who cares. This is not about what <i>I</i> say; it's a basic rule of creating a reference work: pages that scroll off to the right HAVE NO PLACE IN A REFERENCE WORK. PERIOD. Oh, and by the way, swearing at a site administrator isn't really the best way to earn yourself a whole lot of respect around here. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 20:14, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

Well maybe I could suck up to you. Maybe then I could earn some. Like I really care if a couple of faceless names respect me or not. I am hear to provide some work and knowledge to an encyclopedia. PERIOD. It is true, you do have the right to express these opinions. But not here. This is about the Yukon Legislature Seating Plan, not about the Canadian House of Commons. YOU brought that up. You tell me to send my opinion to send it to someone who cares. You are the only person to complain about this shift to the right. So you go tell someone who cares. Perhaps an Administrator shouldn't talk about wikipedia's "arbitrary" rules. If you have a problem with them, you and the other administrators can go work that out. Have a Ball! I point out that the plan is more of an image than anything else. Not a piece of literary work. Images shift to the right. And I point out that again that "pages that scroll off to the right HAVE NO PLACE IN A REFERENCE WORK" is still what you say. It is not a policy of wikipedia. If you wish to talk about website formats outside of wikipedia, make an article about it. (STFU, It's just fun to type isn't it. Eh, Bearcat?) <a href="../../../m/s/1/User%7EMS123_ef22.html" title="User:MS123">MS123</a></p>

<dd>You're the one who first brought the House of Commons article into the debate as a comparison. Not me. <b>You</b>. And for the last time, "pages that scroll off to the right HAVE NO PLACE IN A REFERENCE WORK" is <i>not</i> just "what I say"; it's a <i>fact</i>. It doesn't <i>need</i> to be spelled out in Wikipedia policy; it's <b>simple common sense</b>. Perhaps nobody else has said it's a problem, but nobody besides you has said it <i>isn't</i> a problem, either. The point remains that it's not up to <i>you</i> to decide what I'm allowed to say or where. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 20:52, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I did bring the House of Commons as a comparison, but what you are talking about is unrelated. The Yukon Legislator Seating Plan does not shift to the right. Listen 2+2=4 is a fact. What you are talking about is opinion, I don't care what you say. Look I'm not going to keep arguing with you. Let's deal with the current issue, and if others raise issues about the HofC later, we can talk about it then.
