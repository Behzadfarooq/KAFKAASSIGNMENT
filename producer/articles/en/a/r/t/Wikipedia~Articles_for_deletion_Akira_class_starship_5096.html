<li><b>Undecided</b>. To my knowledge the Akira class was never actually mentioned on screen by this name. Consequently, is it even canonical to use this name? Yes, the vessels based upon it have been shown (fleetingly), but has often been noted there are enough similarities with the Enterprise NX-01 that NX-class might be a more appropriate name. I can't put a vote one way or the other yet. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 01:15, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You stated that only information in the series is canon. Furthermore you do not support visual evidence.

<dd>Stop repeating the Original Research argument. It is clear you do not understand what you are talking about. I've read the rule and it does not cover what I am doing at all. I am taking data straight from a canon source. So it can't be original research. BTW, the TNG TM doesn't have any information on the Akira. It only has inconsistencies between the GCS class, and thats explained away in the DS9 TM by changes in the design. And once again you've not actualy stated the rule which the DS9 TM violates. You would write off the entire TM because it contradicts SOME information. Stop cherry picking the rules AM. If the TMs are inadmissable, then all non-canon information is inadmissable. If visual analysis is original research, then dialogue analysis is original research and the entire article violates the rule. Its a very simple concept of reality.

<li><b>Comment</b> Let me say again, this is simply a content dispute with another editor. I oppose his addition of his own original research to this and other articles, so his friend blanked it.

<dd>If you have something meaningful that you're getting at, say it. Otherwise, don't waste time with irrelevancies. While I do post on SD.net, I'm not a Trekkie and don't particularly care about Trek in general. This article means very little to me, but improper admin actions do interest me a great deal. Simple observation does not constitute original research; as far as sources go, counting the weapons on a ship is no different in that regard than listening to Dr. King's "I Have a Dream" speech or looking up the text of Washington's first inaugural address; it's there for everyone to see. The original research rule doesn't apply here, and I think you know that, because if it really did, you'd have shown how by now instead of simply repeating yourself. As it stands, your definition of original research covers almost everything on Wikipedia, to say nothing of this article. Or it would if you were even halfway consistent. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogue_9_6eb1.html" title="User:Rogue 9">Rogue 9</a> 18:46, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you don't have a particular interest in Star Trek then you may be unaware that there are no consist figures for weapon counts. Everyone looks at starships like the Akira class or the Nebula class and comes up with different numbers. Alyeska has studied screenshots and come up with his own numbers. That makes it original research. And please remember, people who disagree with Alyeska's analysis are "stupid".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Akira_class_starship&amp;diff=36283642&amp;oldid=36282494" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Akira_class_starship&amp;diff=36283642&amp;oldid=36282494" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The idea with the rules about verifiability and original research is that we can point to our sources to back up our edits.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I can look at the Enterprise and declare it is black too - not that this will be true, but the point is that opposition does not mean the death of an analysis. As long as Alyeska could justify his decisions for inclusion/exclusion of a suspected TT/phaser point, it is still valid. So put it up, along with any rebuttals, and let other people decide.

Original research should be edited out of the article, but ships of this class do appear identifiably in one movie (<a href="../../../f/i/r/Star_Trek%7E_First_Contact_51ac.html" title="Star Trek: First Contact">Star Trek: First Contact</a>) and several episodes of <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Space_Nine_9b3a.html" title="Deep Space Nine">Deep Space Nine</a>. Even if the name was never uttered on the screen, it is the best name currently available to identify the ship class, and an article containing what <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a> information is available (perhaps including anything pertinent from <a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Magazine_7fc9.html" title="Star Trek: The Magazine">Star Trek: The Magazine</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Star_Trek_Encyclopedia_7742.html" title="The Star Trek Encyclopedia">The Star Trek Encyclopedia</a>, noting disputed canon status) is useful. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpflyght_06d0.html" title="User:Warpflyght">WarpFlyght</a> 16:36, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Weak delete</b>: I have no big interest in Star Trek, but I do have a interest in Visual Analysis of Sci-Fi, so here I am. Here is the crux of the issue, no? For some reason, people have a wierd and arbitrary Macro/Micro divide when it comes to visual analysis. For "macro" things (generally meaning entire ships or their general shapes), they tend to accept it. But for "small" things (even as big as the relative size of ships, let alone tiny torpedo launchers), they call it Speculation, Original Research...etc - all of which involve the base point of ignoring it. This is even though both involve looking at the screen and taking down what one sees. Why is one guy Original Researching because he looks more closely and sees more details than the other? Is it his fault that you aren't paying enough attention? Aren't the sources for both people the same, so in principle equally verifiable? As for detail disputes, as a Star Wars guy I can tell you sadly that even purported official sources can't find their butts with both hands and a flashlight. There are at least three "official" lengths in circulation about <i>Executor</i>. Does that mean no conclusion can be made? Of course not - all the lengths are simply written in some context on the page. I suggest Involved Parties do the same here - put up some Big Pictures of Akira, and circle all the points that are definitely torp tubes/phasers/whatever in red and the disputed ones in yellow, followed by a explanation of the disputed areas. That would provide the needed verifiability - everyone can check out the same picture and decide for themselves. IMO, either taking down what's shown in the film is Original Research, or it isn't. From the number of movie and anime descriptions I see on Wiki, most would consider this action Valid rather than Original Research. Imposing arbitrary Macro/Micro limits is IMO hypocritical and arbitrary. As for TMs, AFAIK they are not canon, so let's not include them - but the films and TV episodes are, so they can be looked at more closely. In any case, what's left of this page after so called "Original Research" is removed is so little that it might as well be combined into some other page. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazuaki_Shimazaki_06cb.html" title="User:Kazuaki Shimazaki">Kazuaki Shimazaki</a> 05:16, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
