<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b> on whether these clearly public figures are sufficiently notable for their own articles. Some may choose to pursue a <a href="../../../m/e/r/WP%7EMERGE_94d1.html" title="WP:MERGE">merge</a>, which doesn't require AfD.

<li><b>Keep.</b> The only people who would ever stumble upon these articles would have a rather different opinion on their notability.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: notability is not "an opinion". It is, by definition, an objective matter and - in cases such as this - it is a thing to be established by reference to reputable sources. Those sources are insufficient in this case at this point in time. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 12:26, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b>. Generally, I don't think winning a reality show makes someone notable unless they become notable on their own.

<li><b>Keep</b> as there have been two seasons of a television show, a making the video, and now an album released by these artists, there are enough resources available to be collated and archived here. If one disagrees that there is enough notaraity now, what is the point in deleting if there is great likelihood that notaraity will be achieved at a later date? <a href="../../../p/v/o/User%7EPvodenski_a42d.html" title="User:Pvodenski">Pvodenski</a> 19:11, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>KEEP. They are now a part of America Pop Culture and media. They are musicians with TV time, video time and concert time. They have an album arriving in a week. Expansion will most definitely occur. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.60.220.5 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.60.220.5_148c.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.60.220.5">contribs</a>) 18:14, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The article may require cleanup, but each member of the group has been involved in other endeavors before the creation of the band. Also, the group is gaining more and more notoriety as of late, and people will want to read about the members of the band as well as the band itself. CTVampSlayer August 12, 2006. (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It gives a look into the fans favorite member of the group like Destiny's Child and TLC's pages even if they're not that popular yet. <a href="../../../a/j/b/User%7EAjblakeney_ff7f.html" title="User:Ajblakeney">AJ Blakeney</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> If individual members of the <a href="../../../p/u/s/Pussycat_Dolls_7197.html" title="Pussycat Dolls">Pussycat Dolls</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/e/Eden%27s_Crush_b679.html" title="Eden's Crush">Eden's Crush</a> get their own wikipedia pages, I don't see why these girls can't. They all seem to somewhat fall in the same category. Plus, the girls of Danity Kane are slowly gaining even more notability as their album release draws nearer (Aug 22) and they are appearing in more magazines. Their individual official web sites are also getting more hits and becoming more fleshed out, so there should be more information available for use by the wikipedia community (in terms of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and giving each girl their own individual entry). logsmein 23:26, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This group is becoming very popular, being constantly featured on Yahoo Buzz, being the Number 1 Music Artist on Myspace, and being on the top of MTV Artist pages. Their album will be released Aug 22, and the girls are starting to get a lot of publicity. Therefore, it would be unfair to close this page down strictly for the reason that this band is not popular. Also, if other bands have sites for their individual artists, it makes sense to allow these individual members to have their own parts as well. each girl will have their own fanbases who will want to read about the particular members.
