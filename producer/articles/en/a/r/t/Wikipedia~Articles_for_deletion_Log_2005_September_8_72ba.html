<p>This is a fan made map which next to no one plays.

<li><b>weak keep</b>. I've never played this level, but it is plausible that it is pretty popular (lots of google hits), and this is a decent article. I think the steam thing may be a red herring, because the screenshots are from classic counter-strike, and to my understanding, steam only supports CS:source. If this level is only for cs classic, then it wouldn't show up on steam.

<li><b>Comment</b> - No, Steam supports all HL1 engine games too. It may be a well written article with accompanying screenshots, but this map is non notable. Should we have warcraft 3 custom maps on wikipedia? What about fan made single player mods for HL1? I've been playing CS for many years, and this map has never taken off. Whereas some fan made maps have definitely been popular, fy_iceworld being the first one to spring to mind, cs_deathmatch hasn't. Steam can be a bit of a red herring, for example not a single server is online right now playing de_jeepathon2k, yet that map was officially included in beta 7 (I think) and was the first map to introduce the failed idea of drivable vehicles. Cs_deathmatch though has never been popular. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 11:54, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

The information is sparse, and written in a form not appropriate for an encyclopedia. It is created by user:156.63.100.36, who has made several changes in the Wikipedia, most of which are plainly vandalism; the remaining few are deletions of material without any edit summary (in fact, probably vandalism too).

<li>Kappa, I do not find your repeated accusations against anyone who nominates a school for VfD civil or productive, so we're even. However, let's get to the fallacy of your position. In fact, all universities and towns are inherently suitable as <i>topics</i> for articles, but not all articles on towns or universities are valid Wikipedia entries. There is no consensus that secondary schools are in the same class as colleges and universities and towns, but the point here is that <i>no one is voting to delete this because it's a school</i>: people are voting delete because the article is uninformative, does not establish (bring forth/explain/celebrate) the notability that you believe is inherent in the institution. It is being voted to delete because it's not a valid article, not because it's an article on a school. Please read the nomination before you encourage people to blindly block vote. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:55, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>To expand this, a look at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">Special:Newpages</a> shows that since the start of the month some 120, ONE-HUNDRED-AND-TWENTY new school articles have been created. Many of them are very brief stubs similar to the one we have at this article now. Only the most obviously silly ones get speedied--articles created to attack, those giving no context, and so on. Over the past six months, only about 280 articles have been listed for deletion. Of this small number, only a tiny proportion--currently around 40, have been deleted. A few more articles are deleted because they're copyright violations. Just deleting school articles isn't a realistic method of dealing with perceived systemic problems with Wikipedia, such as the belief that there are too many articles about non-notable schools, too many school stubs (or substubs, if you prefer), or too many articles that fail to provide us with an interesting read. The rate of creation and retention of school articles has far outstripped the rate at which this growth can be controlled simply by deleting them. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:07, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>A school can achieve notability by producing notable alumni, introducing a novel program, or being involved in a major historical or newsworthy event. The oldest Bartlett High School grads are all under 25 years old, and--as far as we know--none of them are notable. No school program is mentioned in the article, and no link to a news event is provided. Under these conditions, I don't think we should just let it sit for "a few decades" until it becomes notable. <a href="../../../o/w/e/User%7EOwenX_7b06.html" title="User:OwenX">Owen×</a> <a href="../../../o/w/e/User_talk%7EOwenX_e744.html" title="User talk:OwenX"><big>☎</big></a> 04:23, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As I've just demonstrated, it's no longer possible to restrict school articles to "notable" schools. In the past eight months AfD has deleted only around 40 school articles, and in the past <i>eight days</i> the new content of Wikipedia has increased (after discounting speedy deletions) by a total of 120 school articles. Copyvio deletions also account for a small number of deletions, but after all that it appears to me that the current rate of growth of school articles on Wikipedia exceeds many times over the rate at which they're deleted.</li>
<li>Even if we all agreed, every one of us, that non-notability of schools was a good reason for deleting the articles, we'd have to delete about 15 school articles every day just to keep up with the rate of creation. In the current circumstances, where it's actually quite rare for a school listed on AfD actually to be deleted, this just isn't going to happen. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 05:14, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>You are right, the current school AfD mechanism is doomed. I propose a new Speedy Deletion category: {{nn-school}}.

<li>Well look at it this way: if we can't get consensus to delete more than three or four school articles a month, we're not likely to arrive at consensus on a speedy policy for school articles. However desirable you may feel it would be, it's an unattainable goal in the present climate of opinion on school articles. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 06:40, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Worst rational ever.</b> So now the argument to keep schools is that they are being created faster than they can be deleted?

<li>Read it again. Far from a <i>rationale</i>, it's an analysis that shows that school articles cannot be controlled by AfD. Your energies are thus misspent. Also I notice that you again raise the false claim that schools are given special treatment on AfD. They are not. They are listed in precisely the same manner as other articles and editors are permitted to state their opinion on whether the articles are to be deleted, and finally a sysop comes a long, determines whether there is a consensus, and closes the debate. The article is then deleted if there is a consensus to delete it. AfD debates almost invariably result in the school article being kept, especially if the article is about a high school. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:40, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>You want an executive summary?</li>
<li>1) some people find the proposition that a high school is not notable every bit as baffling as you appear to find the proposition that it is</li>
<li>2) these articles are battle-tested. 269 nominations processed to day since January 1, 2005. 37 deletions. Deletion rate less than 15% of those nominated. Meanwhile I can tell you as a fact that 158 school articles were created on Wikipedia in the seven days from September 5th to September 11th. That is more than four times, in one week, the number of articles, articles <i>created</i>, that AfD has <i>deleted</i> in eight months.</li>
<li>You may think there is a problem. Clearly listing perfectly good articles for deletion on grounds like "not notable" is not the solution, because school articles are being created at such a vastly greater rate than they can be deleted. Notability cannot be anything but an excuse for deletion. All you're doing is venting your anger at the fact that there will always exist articles on Wikipedia that you cannot control. AfD is not a quality control tool, it cannot possibly perform that task. Only editors can do that. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 23:44, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>My response to this is: clearly they <i>are</i> being held to the same standard and passing the test with flying colors, and what other word do you use for the mood of someone who continues to complain that there is a problem with schools when Wikipedia tells him loud and clear, over a period of some months, that there is not? Fact: several times more school articles will be created by the end of this month than have been listed for deletion during the eight months January to August of this year.

<li>Tony while <i><a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_4cc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch">schoolwatch</a></i> has been very effective at preventing school article deletions, and to your credit, doing a lot of good work trying to improve those articles who will be improving the 158 that got written last week? Are these <i>articles</i> all a couple of lines or are some actually informative? I don't think the fact that people start these article <i>en mass</i> is an indication that they are useful articles' it's more of an indication that they don't have any other useful articles to contribute. If they cared they would do a good job. The strongest argument I have seen for schools, to date, is that it helps wikipedians learn to be productive. School articles are like a 'live' sandbox for developing skills and knowledge about wikipedia itself. I will support that argument. But to say these articles are useful just seems silly. There are much better resources online for this type of information. More to the point such databases do not get vandalised. How often are school articles vandalised and no ones notices? Would anyone even question if I changed stats in a school article. Say '73% of students passed' vandalised to '63% of students passed' a particular assessment exam? It would make a huge difference to prosepective students or parents and worse, when noticed, will reinforce the idea that wikipedia itself is an unreliable source for information. That's not a reputation wikipedia wants to cultivate in my opinon. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 00:06, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>What an awful straw man this is. Delete articles because they are subject to vandalism? Are you even remotely serious in proposing that because an article might be a target for vandalism that it ought to be deleted? I have read some whoppers in these debates, but this is the single-most absurd proposition I have yet encountered from those that want to delete or otherwise remove school articles. I am so flabbergasted at this argument that I am not even sure I should bother with a detailed refutation of why this argument is such patent nonsense. If proclivity to vandalism is a valid critera for article deletion, <b>any</b> controversial topic on Wikipedia should be deleted for fear that it might be vandalized. This argument simply leaves in me in shock (I thought I had heard it all). --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 00:25, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Not sure where you got that straw man from? The argument is not that they are prone to vandalism. The argument is that that <b>there is a high chance the vandalism will go unnoticed and remain to be confused as fact</b>.

<li>David, if Schoolwatch hadn't bothered to lift a finger these articles would exist. The claim that they're all or even mostly one or two-liners is a canard--I even believed it myself until a few months ago I sat down and watched the creation of some school articles, as they happened, on <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">Special:Newpages</a>, and now you can look at my <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_New_2739.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/New">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/New</a> and check them for yourselves. Some of the best articles on Wikipedia are articles about schools.
<ul>
<li>Tony how can my question <b>Are these articles all a couple of lines or are some actually informative?</b> be misconstrued as an assertion? If you don't want to seriously discuss this issue then fine, it's not my problem if you assume that all users who vote delete are against you.

<dd>You're making a compelling argument for putting those articles on your watchlist and helping maintain them, but none at all for deleting them.

<dd>I have no problem with that but I can't watch all the schools. Also my argument would not be deletion but to maintain the two liner schools in lists with their peer local schools. At least then we get some context. Even if i have them on my watchlist it does not mean I will see a vandals edit, especially if I'm away for a while. Each school needs many people to watch. My sense is there are not many who do it; I could be wrong. Also it would not be my first choice to monitor school articles, I'd rather spend my time trying to catch the misinformed edits in the science pages, as well as improving the pages that need work. I'm happy to help with schools and I'm willing to hear the arguments but knee jerk 'keep' does not seem to be a wise use of limited resources (I know, wiki is not paper, but every page needs user hours and those ARE limited). <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 06:00, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think the problem you're having is in your assumption that you must take personal responsibility for the whole encyclopaedia and that it somehow reflects on you if you do not. But you don't. It's a wiki. Suggest a project, why not? Perhaps one of the more geeky types would make us a program that showed only school articles that changed, if we were to feed them in. Does Crypto whatsit's thing do that? Although I don't agree that vandalism of school pages is any more a problem than vandalism of other pages (a bewildering variety do get vandalised, usually in a very noticeable way that is caught by RC fiends -- I catch plenty when I'm in the mood), it's no solution to suggest they should not be allowed. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 05:06, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Vandalism is always visible in the history,even if you don't catch it at the time. Remember that our articles are only supposed to contain verifiable references, so if you encounter a figure that isn't referenced, delete the figure from the article. This is a Wiki, after all. On spotting edits to school articles, it's easy to do this by making a list of school articles and then linking to the "related changes" special page. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:42, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree with Nicodemus, and I think most editors would, that the "vandalism" argument is unworthy of a response. Oh let's just delete the whole encyclopedia in case somebody vandalizes it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 01:19, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>This is almost as absurd as the proposition in the first place. So now the argument is if an article might have what you subjectively have defined for us as a <b>"high chance"</b> of vandalism that goes unnoticed, an article should be deleted???

<ul>
<li>So misinformation is a good thing? Especially when the same data is easily available at other sites? Almost every one of the articles up for deletion have nothing that is not availabale in the public databases. Have any well written and researched school article ever being put up for deletion? If not then there is no conspiracy against schools as you seem to think.

<li>Agree with Tony about your attempts to have us focus on what you would like us to focus on, "please" or "pretty please" "or sugar on top" or otherwise. However Aaron, to answer your frequently-answered questions (*cough* talk about "canards" *cough*) yet again. A) School articles are not judged any differently from other articles such as towns, cities, battleships, crusiers, destroyers, submarines, firearms, television shows, movies, religious denominations, video games, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. What you and other deletionists want, is to hold schools to the same policy standards as vanity pages about non-notable PEOPLE (which do not constitute all other articles). B)Insofar as creation of stub articles is "encouraged" (*cough* canard *cough*), it is for the same reason that stubs of all other types are created and "encouraged" such as stubs for towns, cities, battleships, crusiers, destroyers, submarines, firearms, television shows, movies, religious denominations, video games, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. To be filled in at a later date, not to be AfD nominated within 3 days of their creation. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 03:12, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No, actually. I've always found it almost entirely meaningless. What meaning it does have seems to be "I don't think it's important myself". If you have another meaning in mind, perhaps you'd share it and explain what difference it would make in an encyclopaedia that includes the "sum of human knowledge". <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 07:25, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No it doesn't. Please do read it and you'll find that it's about what views people have on a subject, in the context of whether to include minority views. It has nothing to say on whether an article should or should not exist in an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:06, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ummm... are you asserting that that link <i>does not</i> say the number of people who hold a particular view is important to deciding if something belongs in Wikipedia? Really?<br />

<dd>It says that the number of people who hold a view is material when deciding whether that viewpoint should be represented when writing a neutral article. For instance one wouldn't need to represent the flat earth viewpoint in an article on the curvature of the earth. But you seem to be mistaking it for a statement about whether the number of people <i>interested in a subject</i> is material when deciding whether an article should be included in an encyclopedia. That's a different argument. You may well be able to make a case and I may well be persuaded by it, but citing the neutrality guideline isn't going to persuade me because it obviously doesn't say what you think it says. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:23, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, I'll play. Since, as you correctly note, we can't read your thoughts but only your typing, you're going to have to type why you think that applies here. Even if we had a similar policy for articles, it would amount to "write little about things of little interest and a lot about things of great interest", which is certainly not what you're arguing and would not be as compelling an argument for deletion as it is for pruning rubbish articles. If only you deletionists would do more of that and less of trying to prune the whole work! <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 05:06, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>A <i>very</i> inappropriate speedy candidate, as there are multiple assertions of notability. The only time you should use speedy A7 is if there is <i>no</i> assertion of notability ("Jim is a man he lives in Cupcake he is an insurance agent."). Here, for example, he is asserted to be the founder of a non-trivial group, etc. etc.. That said, let's examine the claims to notability: apart from some boosterism about how he was a copyright expert in high school, the main one is that he founded "CfAF", but that group is, as he admits elsewhere on the web: "www.loyalty.org itself is the web site for Californians for Academic Freedom, a <b>hypothetical</b> group of California loyalty oath opponents" <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/schoen/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.advogato.org/person/schoen/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. So much for that. Beyond that, he is the author of the "DeCSS haiku", which is amusing, but does not exactly make him notable. Ergo, <b>delete</b>, wish him luck. (We could do with a wikipedia article on the weird loyalty oath, though.) <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 17:51, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I disagree. He is said to have founde a group. There is no indication that the gorup is "non-trivial". To my mind, a statement is not a "claim of notability" under A7 <b>unless</b> the claim would, if true, indicatate notability to some significant minority of likely editors discussing the issue on AfD. A mere adjective ("famous", "notable", etc) is not a claim. A statement that a person "founded a group" with no suggestion that the group is itself notable in any way, or indeed is more than a one-person group is not a claim. this is a perfect A7 speedy, IMO. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:52, 8 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The text of the A7 says "An article about a real person that does not assert that person's importance or significance. If the assertion is disputed or controversial, it should be taken to VFD instead." In general, it is best to use speedy deletes only for 100% non-controversial cases where notability is not asserted, but I certaintly don't want to get into a revert war (or legalistic debate over the A7!) over this. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 20:18, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

Did they publish a list like this or was it compiled by others from their work?

<dd>Aha - my book is "Enochian Physics - The Structure of the Magical Universe" by Gerald J Schueler. He does mention the four hierachs of each Watchtower (Kings) which match the ones given in the list (minor spelling differences apart), but unfortunately doesn't list the angels. If it helps though, we could add: "Each Watchtower is divided into six subhierachies. The hierarch of each of these is called a Senior. Each of the four Watchtowers is also divided into four subquadrants whose hierarchies are called Archangels. These are further divided up into smaller hierarchies whose rulers are called Angels. In this way, the entire universe, visible and invisible, is teeming with beings in varying states of self-consciousness". We could also add the eleven rules of hierachies if that might improve it beyond being a mere list. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_alf_522c.html" title="User:Wiki alf">Alf</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWiki_alf_56f1.html" title="User talk:Wiki alf"><font color="green">melmac</font></a></sup> 19:15, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> this list presently reads as absolute nonsense, so if kept it must be provided with context. I'd say you should find a suitable article and merge this in, or if it is really an extended quotation then transwiki it as suggested above.</li>
<li>It looks clear to me that the <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabal.html" title="Cabal">cabal</a> will have none of this, and that voting is useless. First it's <i>crufty</i>; till someone points out that its probably more valuable than Pokemon(TM). Then the <i>title</i> of the article gets criticised; so someone changes it. But then it's the <i>context</i> -- so someone thoughtfully spends hours putting it in context, and still <b>they</b> aren't satisfied. Why don't the <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabal.html" title="Cabal">cabal</a> just own up to the fact that, once one of them has voted against an article, it <b>will</b> be deleted unless the rest of the cabal protest and protect it. --<a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockpuppetSamuelson_cde2.html" title="User:SockpuppetSamuelson">SockpuppetSamuelson</a> 12:58, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Possibly. But when the count's taken, you'll find votes discounted for relating to "older versions of the page", which therefore can't be applied to the new version, or (where people repeat a vote, so that it relates to the new version, both get discounted because it's double-voting, and then, of course, there are the votes discounted because "everybody" knows that they're sockpuppets (which is my cue to sneak away silently). --<a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockpuppetSamuelson_cde2.html" title="User:SockpuppetSamuelson">SockpuppetSamuelson</a> 07:09, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ok, folks, I realize that in the original article, I didn't post links to the game designs he is notable for working on. I welcome your comments in that regard.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have now included these links. He is, at the very least, notable to computer role playing gamers. Perhaps you are not included in that group of people, but if you look around Wikipedia, there is a page about almost every game he has worked on. To leave THOSE pages on Wikipedia, but to not include Josh Sawyer, is to have articles about the short stories of Ray Bradbury, but no Wikipedia entry about Ray Bradbury. I'm not saying that he's another Ray Bradbury - but he's worked on some of the better CRPG games that have come out in the last 5 years. Thank you. - Original Article Author.</p>

<li><b>For The Love of Pete</b> Hillman, your 'resume cruft' theory is hilarious. Do you really think there are people out there who have written in their resume, "See my entry in Wikipedia", and that such an act would mean something to ANYONE doing hiring? Also, I had to look up the word <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruft.html" title="Cruft">cruft</a> in Wikipedia, during which time I was slightly embarassed for not knowing it, but also glad that I had found Wikipedia. I use it about every day to look up something I read online, or some vague cultural reference. It's easier and more concise than Google.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why am I posting with just my IP? I don't see how registering as a user isn't something Sawyer himself could do. I'm not going to take the time to register as I'll likely never have reason to post a Wikipedia entry again.</p>
<p>The full truth is, as I have written it, take it or leave it:</p>
<p>1) I saw Sawyer's name mentioned in an article about Black Isle Studios when I was looking back at the Baldur's Gate series in Wikipedia. 2) I remembered him from talk about the game Fallout 3 some time ago. 3) I wondered "Who is this Josh Sawyer? What is he up to today??" 4) I saw that he had no Wikipedia entry. 5) I then decided to make my first (and probably only, thanks to rude people like DanMS and Hillman) Wikipedia entry after googling him and finding quite a lot of info and interviews. 6) Sorry for trying to help expand the content of this site. 7) I'll go back to being a regular browser. You can proceed on Deleting or Keeping this article, I have made my best case with the Ray Bradbury analogy at the top of this page.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The comparison to <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Bradbury_a4ab.html" title="Ray Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> is faulty, as Bradbury wrote books by himself. If I was part of the construction crew that built the Empire State Building, I would not be notable, even if the building is. The architect who designed it may be notable, tho.

<li><b>Answer to Comment</b>. Is it common for Wikipedians to judge entries that are not in their area of expertise/interest? If you don't know what a Lead Designer does for a video game... why are you voting Keep or Delete in this area at all?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Link about what a Game Designer does: <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/features/6129276/index.html?tag=boxcar_all_features_headline" class="external free" title="http://www.gamespot.com/features/6129276/index.html?tag=boxcar_all_features_headline" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamespot.com/features/6129276/index.html?tag=boxcar_all_features_headline</a><br />
<br />
I mean this in all seriousness, and not to offend you. Going with your Empire State Building example - I wouldn't go around the architecture areas of Wikipedia and judge whether certain designers and companies were or were not notable. I know nothing or architecture or building construction.<br />
As for your Empire State Building analogy... if building and architectural magazines were posting about your state and place of employment, and regularly running interviews with you, and people in web-site forums that didn't know you personally were asking about you and where you were working now ~ then I would conclude that you are a notable person "worthy" of a Wikipedia entry in regards to computer and console role playing video games. Try doing a google search for "JE Sawyer", "J.E. Sawyer" and "Josh Sawyer". You will find numerous interviews, forum discussions, and video game magazine articles. Mark aka Ye Olde Anonoymous Forum Poster who started this entire stupid thread, which I now regret. LOL. 71.10.112.33 23:42, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Delete. This site has less popularity that the deleted Pink Poogle Toy page — It's blatantly advertising allowed because the owner is an admin here. Abusing position for personal gain and advertising isn't allowed anywhere I administrate. <i>User:MattFrost wrote this.</i></li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> There are Wikitravel links all over Wikipedia; it's in the same situation as <a href="../../../i/m/d/IMDb_27b2.html" title="IMDb">IMDb</a>. Also, Wikipedia has a clear pro-other-Wiki-sites bias, which under the circumstances I think is perfectly reasonable. I have no problem with Wikitravel — as long as it's still clear that it's <a href="../../../w/i/k/Template_talk%7EWikitravel_b8ac.html" title="Template talk:Wikitravel">not a Wikimedia sister project!</a>&#160;:) --<a href="../../../q/u/u/User%7EQuuxplusone_9b50.html" title="User:Quuxplusone">Quuxplusone</a> 14:17, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I hardly see how an article about a non-profit, banneradless, CC-licensed fellow Wiki site can constitute "abusing position for personal gain". The article has been edited dozens of times and translated into 10+ languages since it was created in 2003. And for what it's worth, <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;q=&amp;url=wikitravel.org" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;q=&amp;url=wikitravel.org" rel="nofollow">Alexa</a> gives Wikitravel a rank of 26,859 as I type this, quite a bit higher than the 132k referenced in the PinkPT discussion last year.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Where do some people live? Just yesterday, on the 8 o' clock news on ALL Maltese TV stations, there was aired a delegation which arrived to Malta, led by Sir Paul Judge, the Chairman of the British Chamber of Marketing and the Master of the Worshipful Company of Marketors of the City of London. The delegation had a business breakfast with 140 of the leading business people of Malta and was opened by Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Tonio Borg. Massimo Ellul was the only Maltese to be part of the marketing professionals forming part of the delegation of the Marketors! A simple check on the official ISBN listing of published and registered books would give you his latest publication, <b>The Green Eight Pointed Cross</b>, with ISBN number 99932-0-317-3, which is also available on the internet. I have added a number of references in the article. I do not think that the Dept of Information of the Prime Minister's Office, the Times of Malta, The Malta Business Weekly, and all the other references, including the Who's Who publications, have got it wrong. Being an expert in marketing does not make you popular as well! I just happened to catch this debate on Wikipedia because I am also reading an MBA with Maastricht University by the Malta Institute of Management. By the way, Dr. Ellul is also an acvtive member of the Institute!! <b>Post-Graduate</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> but references are required. I have read the above, and reconsidered my position when it comes to this article. However, clear referencing is required in any case. I think the matter can be closed here. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltesedog_6843.html" title="User:Maltesedog">Maltesedog</a> 12:12, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Video games may not be your cup of tea, but clans are not "children's playgroups". I know plenty of clans that consist entirely of people who have reached majority. Certainly any of those who compete professionally are. Heck, my clan's average age is over 30 years of age. That said, I can't think of any clan that would be notable enough for an encyclopedia entry. <a href="../../../a/e/v/User%7EAeverett_b346.html" title="User:Aeverett">Al</a> 12:37, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If the article is accurate, keep it. A person who is a published author, radio announcer, journalist, and episcipopal secretary at age 17 is notable IMO. But is it accurate? there are no sources cited, and this is quite a list. Could this be a hoax? Can anyone verify the accuracy of this articel and cite sources, or else verify that it is a hoax?

<li>Found sufficient proof of journalism on RTK radio, but none for the secretary of the bishop thing. It is also important to note that the bishop in question is only a titular bishop and in actual fact does not have a specific region under his hands. Also it is very strange for a person of 16 years to know the languages mentioned especially in an island like Malta.. especially Greek! It could be true, but it is far fetched.<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltesedog_6843.html" title="User:Maltesedog">Maltesedog</a> <a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMaltesedog_cd92.html" title="User talk:Maltesedog"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 14:58, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I do not see that a commercial package containing nothing but multiple copies of a single standardized form for game players to use is notable enough to have its own article, nor that this can ever be more than a stub. Moreover this is for a particularly short-lived version of the form -- the article itself says it was quickly rendered obselete. <b>Delete</b> I think the entire content could safely be discardable, but if someone wantes to merge it into an appropriate larger article, fine.

<p>This page is a very problematic one since it is very obvious that there is an ego trip going on between some Maltese masonic contributors to this page.</p>
<p>The long list of edits and very nasty allegations and name dropping on such a delicate subject as Freemasons in Malta, can have severe repercussions on innocent Masons who do not even know about this page and who are being mentioned on it.</p>

<p>My suggestion: Deletion and bar user 217.15.96.18 for good from Wikipedia. Apart from a lot of copyright violations, he is jeopardising innocent people and re-writing 'history' as it suits him. And this not only with regards to masons in Malta.</p>

<dd>There doesn't presently look much chance of this being deleted any more than the Pokemons (and I don't think it should be, as I said). It's often said "but if my article A is deleted, then articles B–Z-in-unrelated-field ought to go too, because they are surely less notable". Should we judge articles by the lowest common denominator, or the highest? Which way lies the raising of standards? Would inclusionists or deletionists favour LCD or HCD, or neither? The fact is that there is a considerable body of editors prepared to defend Pokemon to the hilt — and to face-down those that claim it lowers standards with the claim that comprehensiveness is everything. The same seems not to be true of articles on real people, for some reason. I don't personally subscribe to either philosophy absolutely. Oh, and notpaper is notfree. $165,000 of the $200,000+ just raised is to be spent on hardware. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 22:00, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Minor government officer for a township with a population of 3000? OK, she held the post for 40 years, but it's not exactly Mayor of New York, is it? Local colour, and should be merged as such. As for the professor claims, I don't believe we keep articles on every single professor, only those with a notable publication record. So merely doing the job for years doesn't qualify them. Neither does padding out the article, which is what the minor financial losses (about $2 dollars per person) would count as to me.

<li>I am sufficiently concerned about the facts I have been able to check to be skeptical about the whole story. He doesn't run his own website - it's run by someone called Bradlee Sargent from an Arabic Evangelical Church in Florida. He doesn't have a PhD from "Florida Christian University" because there's no such university. There's no trace of the organization "Hope for the Nations" that he is said to run. Why does he use genuine quotations from Yusuf Ali's translation of the Qur'an interspersed with new translations? Where's the evidence of his activities in the US? Why does he provide a complete biography plus a photograph but no details that could be verified with his Mosque or Al-Azhar University? Gabriel could be who he says he is, but I'd like to see appropriate evidence. For someone who's published four books since 1997 under two different names he's somewhat elusive. --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Pitchford_f7f8.html" title="User:Ian Pitchford">Ian Pitchford</a> 21:25, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Short answer: historically they were <i>very</i> big <i>regionally.</i> Due to mergers and the tendency to keep local names it's a little hard to tell nowadays. Jewel itself was so big regionally that anyone who lived in the Chicago area or went to school there or had relatives there would know about it, and from time to time it has made national news, I forget why. Something unflattering, I think. Drug stores with the Osco name are national, I think. At any rate they arrived in Massachusetts a couple of decades ago. When I go to the "Jewel-Osco" site and search for stores in Massachusetts it brings up about seventy store names within 20 miles of my home, but they are all either "Shaws" or "Star," which are regional household names that have apparently been sucked into the Albertsons maw. Traditionally, grocery chains used to be regional. Over the last few decades the U.S. government has all but abandoned enforcement of antitrust and everything regional is combining into national oligopolies, but for some reason the grocery chains prefer to keep the familiar regional names on the storefronts. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:19, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well the scope of this afd was because there are various links to various title holders to other pages of Wikipedia. Maltese nobility is of no importance in Malta apart to the title bearer which is proud of his inheritance! I mean, is there the need to give so much important to people which are not really famous after all in Malta? Ask how many people know them!

Nobility leaves no impact and hardly anyone knows about it, i'm afraid.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The nobility is per definition a notable group in society, and most families of the higher nobility are at least somewhat notable or have some notable members. Looking at the articles makes it clear that many of these families once played a significant economic and political role in the history of the island.

<li>Opinions of people are not the same, I agree, but when you have everyone stating to keep then that should send a strong message to you. If you reduce the details it becomes unnecessary to leave it there. Each peice of data contains necessary information of history. Perhaps some wording can be changed but the peice as it stands should be kept as a whole. When you mentioned that the younger generation are not aware of the Nobility, I feel your misleading people, as if you remember studying Maltese history, it was full of Nobles leading the charge for Malta to become where it stands today. A primeminister was also a member of the Nobility. Lord Strickland was also a Count of Catena. This is vitual information that shouldnt be forgotten. Much of our politicans were members of the Nobility. One of our Maltese EU members of Parliament is a member of the Nobility. (Attard-Montalto is the Baron of San Paolino). Past or Present, the Maltese nobility is with us. Socialist or Nationalist, the nobility are involved in either politican parties. Beware and learn but also be proud of who you are.

<li>Tancerville - you have personal interests in keeping the article, and your view on the matter is biased. It is true that the Mr. Attard Montalto is of noble birth, however his work is purely of a political nature, and has no connection with his noble ancestary. Rest assured that I'm not hiding in any way what Maltese truly are.

<li>This is absurd. Nobility are inherently notable - Maltese or otherwise, past or present. It is absolutely absurd of you to "insist" anything - that is exactly what the AfD process is about. Interest of Maltese nobility to Maltese today is irrelevant to encyclopedic entries about nobility. There is already overwhelming concensus to <b>keep</b> this article, irrespective of your constant "insisting".

<li><b>Comment</b> Modern nobility who have no authority are not inherently notable. However, this list is broader than a single person, so I have no problems with this article, as it is quite possible for groups of people to be notable even if the individuals that compose it are not.

<p>From the history, this page was created on 26 May 2005. Has only always consisted of one line, "<a href="../../../h/u/d/Huddersfield.html" title="Huddersfield">Huddersfield</a>, Jamaica (or Haddersfield) is a small settlement located in the St Mary parish Jamaica." Wikilink is to a Huddersfield in England. Am unable to find any evidence that there actually is a Jamaican Huddersfield through quick google. If there really <i>is</i> a small settlement called Huddersfield in Jamaica, it may be so small as to be difficult to write a meaningful article about; there is as yet no evidence I can see that this is even real.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Thanks everyone. I couldn't myself find evidence to decide the question of whether this was a hoax (which if it were is grounds for deletion) or real (which if it were, I was sure my talented fellow WPns would discover, even if I could'nt). This is why I waited before entering a vote rather than place it along with the nom like I normally would. Pilatus, good job finding that link. So there definitely seems to be a H<b><u>a</u></b>ddersfield in this Parish St Mary place. I'm not sure why you said it's known by both names; the link only describes a Haddersfield. Do you have further info? Grutness' link is to a place in St.Mary; would this be the same place as the Parish? Given the available info, my vote would be to <b>redirect</b> this page to one created at <a href="../../../h/a/d/Haddersfield%2C_Jamaica_bce3.html" title="Haddersfield, Jamaica">Haddersfield, Jamaica</a> which would contain the current text and Pilatus' link as a basic ref. A disambig page for this and the British city would be good. There seems to be a general consensus for the name to include Jamaica, as seen <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities_in_Jamaica_c06f.html" title="List of cities in Jamaica">here</a>. If this is eventually closed without a consensus to delete, I'd be willing to do the legwork (creating the new page, the disambig, and doing the redirect).—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">encephalon</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#606060">έγκέφαλος</font></a>&#160; 07:21:52, 2005-09-09 (UTC)</li>

<dd>LOL. I see that Kappa and Pilatus are already on it (except the redirect is going the other way). Cool. I think, given that the evidence we currently have only substantiates the name with an "a", I prefer the redirect the other way. But since one can't redirect a page that's under AfD, I'll wait.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. All cities, towns, villages, or any other things you'll find in a real atlas or encyclopedia are notable, no matter what country in which they are located. (Even RickK agreed - see <a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERambot_Delete_992c.html" title="User talk:Rambot/Delete">User talk:Rambot/Delete</a> for precedents on deleting Rambot articles.) <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html" title="User:Rambot">Rambot</a>'s contributions on cities, which were mostly computer-generated rather than written by human users, have been great, and they've really helped us with building up articles on places and other things one would find in a real encyclopedia. I'd love to see projects like Rambot's extended to other countries besides the U.S., to keep us from getting too US/UK-centric around here, but until we have bots covering every city in the world, we'll just need to rely on human editors. Also, having articles for all of the towns helps keep people interested in editing here, if they can go find an incomplete article on their town and add information about what makes their town unique. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 19:33, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hello Pilatus. I can certainly understand your view. However, it's often a good idea to be careful using the speedy tag, because inappropriately SD'd articles consume a lot of our resources (and create unnecessary conflict) when they turn up at VfU. According to <a href="../../../p/n/_/WP%7EPN_ca1e.html" title="WP:PN">WP:PN</a>, there are only 2 types of content that meet the patent nonsense criteria: gibberish (eg. the article is "<i>djkjd090u8]r{ssdklsm993wq</i>"), or the sentences are so incomprehensible no intelligent person can be expected to understand any of it. The text here is neither— it is quite intelligible as an ad of some sort, or a hoax (both of which are proscribed by <a href="../../../p/n/_/WP%7EPN_ca1e.html" title="WP:PN">WP:PN</a>).

<p>I feel this is non-ensyclopedic, and while the persons are notable in the vast majority of cases theyr mere denial of beeing gay is not. It is basicaly a list of people who have responded in a sertain way to rumors or sometimes (joking) questions from the press. Verifiable and factual yes, but not ensyclopedic or particularly helpfull. I can't think of any use for such a list. If there is any substance to the "allegations" then the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_gay%2C_lesbian_or_bisexual_people.html#Persons_of_debated_lesbian.2C_gay_or_bisexual_orientation" title="List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people">#Persons of debated lesbian, gay or bisexual orientation</a> section of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_gay%2C_lesbian_or_bisexual_people.html" title="List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people">List_of_gay,_lesbian_or_bisexual_people</a> can be used (and indeed several of the people on this list is also to be found there) as it at least have a solid criterea for inclution and require the "controversy" to be notable enough to be mentioned on the person's Wikipedia article first, not just added to the list. For the rest it's just frivilous tabloid rumors and listing them here would basicaly amount to rumor mongering of no real value. During the previous detabe some people argued that the list could be used to "wash" the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_gay%2C_lesbian_or_bisexual_people.html" title="List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people">List_of_gay,_lesbian_or_bisexual_people</a> of controvertial names, but as mentioned there are several people who are on both lists so it's obviously not beeing used for that purpose either. To sum up: If this information belong anywhere at all it's the "trivia" section of the respective persons articles, not on a list of every famous person who's ever said "I'm not gay" in public. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> 22:45, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Cannot be made NPOV.
