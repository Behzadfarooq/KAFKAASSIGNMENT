<p><b>Co-Creator Notice</b> Hi, it's 'Matthew' from the Basic4GL Forum here, there seems to be some problems with the Basic4GL Wikipedia entry so I'm going to try and deal with them here if that's alright.</p>
<p>I only got involved in the 'Basic4GL Wikipedia entry project' Yesterday.</p>
<p>1.) I've removed the Tags beneath the Images which were directing people to the Basic4GL Site in order to Download Games created in Basic4GL.</p>
<p>2.) I'd forgotten to add the GFDL Copyright Tag to the 'Flymass' Image, this has been rectified.</p>
<p>3.) I've added a Link to the History of the BASIC Programming Language.</p>
<p>4.) Some of you have questioned the Importence of Basic4GL in the 'Realm' of Programming Languages, I'd just like to draw your attention to another BASIC programming Language which has a Site on Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBasic" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBasic" rel="nofollow">FreeBasic</a>. If FreeBasic has a Site then I really can't see why Basic4GL can't.</p>
<p>5.) Just discovered that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_Basic" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_Basic" rel="nofollow">BlitzBasic</a> a Commercial version of the BASIC Programming Language is on Wikipedia, surely their Site reads more like an Advertisement than our's does. --<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisi_calc_f82f.html" title="User:Visi calc">Visi calc</a> 13:19, 3 October 2006 (UTC) 'Matthew Basi4GL Forum' --<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisi_calc_f82f.html" title="User:Visi calc">Visi calc</a> 19:24, 3 October 2006 (UTC) 'Updated by Matthew' <small>— <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisi_calc_f82f.html" title="User:Visi calc">Visi calc</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/s/User_talk%7EVisi_calc_d67a.html" title="User talk:Visi calc">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Visi_calc_da34.html" title="Special:Contributions/Visi calc">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree, this is sick... I've seen tons of less "notable" programming languages out there. And Matthew is correct... If FreeBasic can have an article, why not Basic4GL? Basic4GL is free too... And BASIC... I have personally witnessed Basic4GL's deletion from wikipedia three times now... None of which were advertising and I fail to see how this isn't considered "notable" when compared to some of the other programming languages on here. FreeBASIC/Free pascal/Euphoria/FASM... I have tried all of those and I can't see how any of them are more "notable" -David <small>— 70.104.113.201 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.104.113.201_e7c6.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.104.113.201">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Non-notable, advert, all that. Also, to Visi Calc - Pointing to articles that you feel are less notable than this isn't a defense. The only result of that is that it's now really likely that the FreeBasic article will get AfD'd as well. --<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPresN_40fd.html" title="User:PresN">PresN</a> 19:23, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Basic4gl is a great new programming language for beginners and it deserves recognition. I've noticed the language bieng mentioned in a wide variety of discussion forums lately: it is gaining popularity and support. I see no logical reason to deny people information on Basic4gl, and patrons of Basic4gl and Wikipedia would be dissapointed at such an act. "Notability" is no criteria on which to base this decision, and if it were, a lack of notability should be an arguement for keeping Basic4gl here. Is the goal of Wikipedia only to regurgitate widely available, notable information? Should information on Basic4gl not be available from Wikipedia simply because it's not widely available elsewhere? <small>— 140.211.24.87 (<a href="../../../1/4/0/User_talk%7E140.211.24.87.html" title="User talk:140.211.24.87">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_140.211.24.87_3bc1.html" title="Special:Contributions/140.211.24.87">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

There isn't a deadline at which all of Wikipedia's content gets shipped off to the printers, after all, what's the harm in taking our time? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 06:10, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Past a certain point, the fact that a cleanup tag goes unheeded is itself inherent evidence that perhaps the subject isn't as Wikiworthy as we'd like to believe. In such a case, it may be preferable to simply delete the article <i>without prejudice</i>, so that someone else may come along later and produce a better article from scratch.

<li>"Not so much today" is kind of my point. If there had been a Wikipedia in 1992 and someone nominated <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_WELL_4590.html" title="The WELL">The WELL</a>, it would have been closed as a blatantly bad-faith nomination within about 90 seconds. But in 2006? It's more like "Oh yeah, the WELL. I remember them; they're still around? Wow..." If someone quietly slapped a {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} tag on it, there's an off chance it might get deleted before anyone else that cared even noticed. As for the books, they were all written by longstanding WELL members, so someone could argue they're just part of the self-referential walled garden, and time has passed and the WELL hasn't kept up, etc. (I'm just speaking of it as a potential <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">WP:CCC</a> example; I have no intention of putting it up for AfD.) --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 02:59, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>To start with, most of those creatures are only mentioned in another <i>encyclopedia</i> (<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_World_of_Kong_451e.html" title="The World of Kong">The World of Kong</a></i>), which brings down questions of copyright. If we offer a free alternative, it is a significant threat to the sales of the book. I also have problems with the silly prose, the complete non-notability, and absolutely no hope of expansion (being that they only exist as entries in a fictional encyclopedia). <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterrobamf_9382.html" title="User:Interrobamf">Interrobamf</a> 01:45, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep for All</b>- I see no real reason to delete these articles. First of all, your request sounds like a bad faith nomination, and, while I don't mean to attack you in any way, you seem to have many references to vandalizing user talk pages and spreading your own ideas. Second, I don't see "a significant threat to the sales of the book" as a viable argument. We have articles about many books, but no one has listed one for deletion based on the fact that it would detract from the book's sales. As for expansion, there will always be a chance for an article to be expanded (images, infoboxes, etc.) I also don't see any "silly prose" that you suggest. I hope this serves as a good argument against your nomination.</li>

<li>Do you care to back up the existence my so-called "vandalizing"? Besides the incident about fair use images on a user page, which is againist policy, and a situation you clearly don't understand? You also do understand how irrelevant that is to this debate? And that this is hardly a bad faith nomination compared to nominations that simply state "fancruft"?<br />
<br />
Moving beyond that, articles on books don't delve into exact details about their content nor is that even comparable to this situation. It's quite simple. The only information about those fictional species is in the book, which is presented as an encyclopedia. Wikipedia copies all the detail. People now have little reason to buy the book because they can get all the detail (and under your proposition for expansion, images) for free.

<li>No, I don't realize any threat. For example, no one has listed the articles about the different types of Middle-Earth elves for deletion, just because it would decrease sales of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Silmarillion_7dd6.html" title="The Silmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></i>. No one has even listed them for merge. Also, I really wouldn't consider this <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">fancruft</a>, since these articles are much like the article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_creatures_6679.html" title="List of Star Wars creatures">List of Star Wars creatures</a>, only with more detail.

One of my most vivid memories is hearing John Williams perform in St Albans Abbey - one man and an acoustic guitar in one of the largest cathedral naves in England, <i>without any amplification</i>. The audience was around a thousand people and you could have heard a pin drop, it felt as if there were just the two of us there. A truly breathtaking performance. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 12:18, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, if there is more than one list of greatest guitarists, then a sourced List of guitarists labeled the greatest ever would be encyclopaedic if maintained (cf <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_in_English_labeled_the_worst_ever_e4be.html" title="List of songs in English labeled the worst ever">List of songs in English labeled the worst ever</a>). <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 01:26, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The point of articles like this is that the list is a handy way to cite acclaim for a guitarist without saying "regarded by many...", and linking to an article on the list rather than to the list itself allows for some contexualization--like pointing out that the list, being compiled by a rock music magazine, is inevitably a list of rock guitarists rather than all guitarists. It's clear that this article is headed for deletion, but perhaps it could be reborn as an article that brings together several similar lists from different sources for a broader approach. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENareek_2a6e.html" title="User:Nareek">Nareek</a> 21:23, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

The award nomination mentions are well and good, but the problem is that they don't contribute too much to <i>non-trivial</i> third-party coverage (they're just lists).

<li><b>Delete</b> The speedy delete incident is explained by someone trolling the article's author at Talk:Bass Pig, but we can be pretty sure that the author didn't want to have the article speedily deleted. Anyway, I can't see any sign of third-party reporting on this. It is very hard to Wikipedia articles to be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> (an absolute requirement) if they are written by people involved with the subject (this is why we have <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">a guideline suggesting that it may be a problem if you write about yourself or your friends</a>). For that reason we usually expect someone else, a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable third-party source</a>, to have written about things before Wikipedia has an article on them. Because that hasn't happened in this case I don't see how this article can be neutral as required. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 16:01, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. No need to delete this. The student is known in the blogsophere as an important contributor to an important website. I would say he is certainly notable on The Huffington Post - in August the site recorded 2.5 million unique visitors and 34 million page views. His writing has probably reached more readers than a large number of authors on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> Again, I assert that ZIM is a legitimate enterprise product. The company receives many calls and e-mails per day regarding licencing of the software to major firms. It does not have much Internet presence due to the nature of the product; it is designed for private use in companies, and the public server is only for demos and testing. The article is written as no such advertisement. If the language is written in a non-wiki way, then it needs to be flagged for <i>cleanup</i>, not for deletion. I assure you ZIM is legitimate.

<li><b>Keep</b> ZIM is a real product that is vastly used in the business world. Its web presence is low and this is unfortuanate, but this does not change the fact that it is wide spread. As for sourceforge: look at how long this product has been on sourceforge. One cannot just jump a few hoops to get on sourceforge. One must undergo a large review process. Sorceforge logs are of news releases that sourceforge <i>published</i>. The third one, yes I'll agree, is just a couple of script kiddies using the software, but after all, the internet presense of ZIM is for script kiddies; the wide spread usage of this in the business world is done over the telephone and with real material.

<li>I am not an expert, but I have studied enough Eastern philosophy and religion to know that when the phrase "ultimate reality" is used in these contexts, it can mean only one of a few things which are best covered in other articles on Wikipedia. 1) Ultimate reality can mean the real world which lies transcend and lies beyond the apparent world of the sense. This is covered in hundreds of different articles. 2) UR can be a shorthand for the "meaning of life", as in the first link which you cite. This should be covered in <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meaning_of_life.html" title="Meaning of life">meaning of life</a>. Ultimate reality often means some undisclosed higher plane of existence/heightened state of consciousness achieved through transcendental meditation, the use of drugs. This should obviously be covered in things like <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satori.html" title="Satori">satori</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlightenment.html" title="Enlightenment">enlightenment</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consciousness.html" title="Consciousness">consciousness</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality.html" title="Spirituality">spirituality</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcendental_meditation.html" title="Transcendental meditation">transcendental meditation</a>, etc.. etc. Somehow I do NOT think that Wikipedia is LACKING in such material.

<li>How is that justification to keep this overly long, overly detailed, unsourcable novelization of the games? A mistake was made when such a lengthy, overdetailed plot summary was kept in the first place, and this AFD should delete what was originally dumped to a subarticle. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 10:00, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The merit of the topic's inclusion is more important in this discussion, since these style-specific issues can be addressed later. Besides, there isn't much to criticize about the page in this regard, at least from a personal standpoint: The page is fairly well written (although it is lengthy and isn't short enough to be "plot summary"), while the references, if anything, are mostly from the actual games themselves (but if specific citation is needed, websites are best candidate).
<p>However, there is also a recommendation to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html#Making_good_use_of_Wikibooks_and_Wikisource" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">make use of Wikibooks</a> on topics such as this, as it has in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_83fd.html#Plot_overview" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince#Plot overview</a>, for example.

<li><b>Keep</b> As the Half-Life series has a unified Storyline, having a single article collecting that information is very useful, as it means somebody won't have to scan several pages at once to get the same info. I don't see the point in asking for sources when anybody can just play the game if they want to do so, but I'm sure there are FAQs and Game Guides that include most of the information. Anything else can(amount of detail, connections to the real world), and should be, dealt with in cleanup, not calls for deleting. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 13:42, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Does every fact in every article need to be sourced? No, of course not. The rigidity implied by your statement of non-negotiability is troubling, because it seems to imply that everything needs complete sources, which is rather silly. The rule of common sense applies. For example, you don't need to find a source to say that the White House is well, White. In this case, you can verify any of the content directly by playing the game. If you don't like that, for whatever reason, though it sounds silly to me, you can easily go over to Gamefaqs and read any number of the Half-life FAQs there. Many of them are quite descriptive as to the Story line. If that's not enough for you, then why don't you identify some of the sections which you find troubling on the article's talk page, we'll see if some sources can be found to establish them. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:15, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not proposing any changes to the exising game articles. My personal opinion is that the level of detail in the storylines in many of those articles is excessive... but that is just my opinion. Trust me, I have no interest in going to each of these individual articles and fighting to edit those sections down. I don't agree however with having a separate storyline article just to have redundant information all in one place. I think Alba's suggestion below is a rather good idea if Wikibooks will have this.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:02, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I would agree with you, except for one very big thing. The Half-life series has a unified, on-going storyline, as such, it is important to cover that issue. At the least, the information in this article should be merged, however pruned it may need to be to <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-life_series.html" title="Half-life series">Half-life series</a>. Since you agree that the information itself belongs in the individual articles, I don't see how you can argue that having it in one single place is a bad idea. Sure, it's redudant, but redundancy is often a good thing. How else would you do it? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:33, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>There's a good compromise that can be made here. The article as is should first be <b>copied to Wikibooks</b> as it is worthwhile but not encyclopedic.

<li>I have to disagree. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html#Examples_2" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">WP:FICT</a> also cites the <i>Final Fantasy X</i> article series, which uses Wikibooks to host information that would less likely merit inclusion in Wikipedia. The contents in <i>Half-Life</i> series storyline are simply plotlines and not game guides or walkthroughs, which I would otherwise suggest deleting or moving to StrategyWiki. The existing but incomplete Wikibooks entry on the <i>Half-Life</i> series would also benefit from a transwiki, and is perhaps the best way to resolve this issue. ╫ <b><a href="../../../z/s/_/User%7EZS_3578.html" title="User:ZS">２５</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/_/User_talk%7EZS_8bf1.html" title="User talk:ZS"><font color="green">◀RingADing▶</font></a></sup></b> 11:17, 3 October 2006 (UTC) ╫</li>

<dd>It isn't Wikipedia's fault there are several Pokedexes. The reason the "regional" Poxedexes exist is since the collection mechanic is integral to the games, but not every Pokemon will fit in every game (especially the original Game Boy ones).

<li><b>Keep or merge</b> The different classifications are useful. For example, if someone is only interested in the first generation, there will be no mention of Munchlax or Smoochum and so on. The one by stage is useful too. And by name is quite useful as well, because people are more likely to know the names rather than the numbers. The ones by individual pokedex could be put on the same page. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelritchie200_69e6.html" title="User:Michaelritchie200">Michaelritchie200</a> 17:56, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b>: I think something some people don't realize is that these aren't just the same lists with all the Pokémon rearranged. The lists contain different <i>sets of Pokémon</i> that can only reasonably be sorted into separate lists.

The reason was that with all these lists - listed seperately, mind you, with a section for National and a section for Jhoto and so forth - made a gigantic and rather cumbersome article. Putting everything on a table and arranging them by either National number or alphabetically would solve that problem rather nicely. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparky_the_Seventh_Chaos_dc6c.html" title="User:Sparky the Seventh Chaos">Sparky Lurkdragon</a> 10:28, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Addemendum: In my haste to explain myself, I forgot my rationale for keeping the Stage list. Well, while the various number lists just present the Pokemon reordered by whatever strange whims the designers had in the different generations (and Jhoto doesn't even <i>have</i> numbers, per se), Stage presents an entirely different set of information, and personally I like seeing the different evolutionary families arranged in an easy-to-see manner. I wouldn't be crushed if the final decision was to add a 'Stage' column to DanPMK's table, but I'd prefer the Stage list to stand on its own. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparky_the_Seventh_Chaos_dc6c.html" title="User:Sparky the Seventh Chaos">Sparky Lurkdragon</a> 10:35, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It seems like it'll just cause clutter to me. Take a look at DanPMK's test page. It looks really squished and untidy. If the other pages are deleted, the information just ends up being pointless. If we're going to keep the numbers, we might as well add the types or something.
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, it looks rather clumsy and confusing. The internal Hoenn numbers are there so there won't be blank spaces, but if we add Shinou numbers, there WILL be blanks, since it doesn't have internal Shinou numbers past 151. Adding the types would mean we would have to keep the page one vertical column, or else it would be too wide. This would make it far too long. As of now, the page is very large. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanPMK_ec28.html" title="User:DanPMK">DanPMK</a> 06:43, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I would like to invite you to better study content of 'Casus Europae' (Tychon v. Dell) and state proper citations:</li>
<li>I do not claim nor enjoy a trademark victory against Exxon.</li>
<li>My European Opposition against registration of Dell's Community Trade Mark (CTM)was succesful and is fully documented on xxell.com <a href="http://www.xxell.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xxell.com" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, notwithstanding Dell's appeal and strategic countering before Dutch courts.</li>
<li>Casus Europa clearly defines implementing of TM-supported firmware computer programs as they link mental processes (like instant 'branding' of this new method of 'implicit patenting') to software programs. Compare the Macrossan Patent-case where the assembly-function of computer programs is discussed.</li>
<li>The .E trademark is uniquely self-patenting because there is no way around this business-method other than copying it with less distinctive internet icons.</li>
<li>I persist in my oppinion that Dell and Exxon are imposing gibberish and a global threat to fair and independent research, innovation, progress, real change and development and thus being the global cause and main force behind the structural and startegic complexxon of enduring error sustained by information-terror where energy-fundamentals determine foreign affairs and international diplomacy endangering state-sovereignty usually misperceived and dubbed as state-failures: the global P3-tangle of incorporated governance guided by the primacy of economic fundamentalism.</li>
<li>The root cause of the information war (Silent War) cannot even be silenced by Wikipedians, but you are all free to try.</li>
<li>I wish you good luck in persuing to unveil the truth and sustain the global battle against mingled corporate arrogance and public ignorance.</li>

<dd>Mr Tychon</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am very sorry that you feel so put upon, and I wanted to write this <i>final</i> comment to try to explain to you why I have been giving such negative feedback. I would reassure you that I carefully read all of your articles and your website before putting forward my vote for deletion. The reason for my voting to delete your articles is not because I do not agree with your point of view, or because I do not think you are correct in your point of view, but because it simply <i>is not possible</i> to understand what you are trying to say. I am afraid that your command of the English language does not appear to be good enough to get your points across and I can see no possibilty of improving the situation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My first comment, noting that you may not be an English speaker, was intended to be supportive. The fact that English is not your first language should be taken into account and extra effort put into trying to understand what you want to say. I have made that extra effort and still do not understand you. If I may make a friendly suggestion, why not create articles on the Dutch Wiki (I've run a seach under Complexxon, Tychon and xxell and can find nothing), so that you are writing in your own language. When you have a stable and accepted article, I'm sure there would be an opportunity to have it translated into English by someone with a better command of the language.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am sorry for my error in saying that you had a victory over Exxon, rather than saying that it was a victory over Dell. This was an honest mistake. I have now reviewed the complete decisions in the Tychon V Dell case and the subsequent appeal. As a registered (but non-practicing) European Trade Mark Attorney I am sorry to have to tell you that you clearly do not have a full grasp of intellectual property law and are not qualified to comment on it. For example, I note that OHIM's decision was based entirely on their own reasoning and that very little you had to say was taken into account. Your submissions that Dell had stolen your trademark and had bad advertising practices were completely ignored. Your submissions that your own trademark had achieved recognition were rejected. OHIM rejected Dell's trademark for some of the goods and services under which they had requested it to be registered, giving you only a partial victory. The subsequent appeal (filed by you) was found to be inadmissible because you failed to pay an appeal fee. Apparently, you said that you should not be required to pay an appeal fee. I am afraid that that strikes me as a very arrogant submission to make and I am not surprised that your appeal was thrown out.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In any event, as I mentioned before, your partial victory over Dell <i>only</i> shows that you have previously registered a trade mark that was similar to the trade mark that Dell wished to register. It does not support your point of view expressed in any of the articles that are proposed for deletion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, as a registered (and practicing) European Patent Attorney from the UK, I can say with utter certainty that there is no such thing as an "implicit patent". <a href="http://www.xxell.com/index.php?page=64" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.xxell.com/index.php?page=64" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> There is also no such thing as a global patent. The Macrossan decision in the UK does not support the patenting of computer-implemented mental processes, does not have global importance and the appeal filed by Mr Macrossan has not yet been judged on. A trademark does not give you patent rights and is not a "business method". Having run a search on [ep.espacenet.org], I find that you do not appear to have any granted or pending patents. Therefore, someone can provide exactly the same services as you so long as they use a different trade mark. Your comments on software patents are therefore completely misguided. They also do not appear to have any relevance to the articles that have been proposed for deletion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In summary, having carefully reviewed all of the materials made available to me, I can make no sense and can see no merit in any of your articles and maintain my vote to have them deleted.</dd>

<li>The problem is that Wikipedia tends to believe more in "first be famous, <i>then</i> have you get an article" kind of thing. For example, I opposed inclusion of <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Mesa_%28game_mod%29_f303.html" title="Black Mesa (game mod)">Black Mesa</a></i>, because the thing isn't even out yet, but they have game mag mentions, ModDB awards, alleged commendations from Valve etcetera; who am I to argue against that? People will probably remember them even if it turns out to be vapourware. If Missing Information can't provide such mentions, then I'm afraid we can't really establish the notability. "Certain boards" probably won't help. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 14:08, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The mod only has "public test" version out.

<li><b>Comment</b>; in the interests of full disclosure, I should point out an earlier debate on a similar article, at Talk:List_of_English_suffixes#Proposal_to_move_to_Wiktionary, which did not produce a consensus.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I wonder, whether the difference between a "dictionary" and an "encyclopedia" exists simply because the primary medium used is paper? This might be a source of the ambiguity on how to deal with such situations. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 14:53, 2 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It isn't, and the difference is a simple one: It's the <a href="../../../u/s/e/Use-mention_distinction.html" title="Use-mention distinction">use-mention distinction</a>. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dog" class="extiw" title="wikt:dog">dog</a> is a dictionary article about the word "dog". <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog.html" title="Dog">dog</a> is an encyclopaedia article about a species of animal denoted by that word. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:30, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Transwiki</b>. HappyCamper, I think the distinction between "dictionary" and "encyclopedia" lies in how they are used, not in the medium. Although the distinction is a somewhat blurry one (people differ in their opinion on just where the line is to be drawn), there <i>is</i> a distinction, and people tend to turn to encyclopedia for certain things while they tend to turn to dictionaries for other things. It seems to me that most people would expect to find this list in a dictionary, not in an encyclopedia. Hence, transwiki. — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 15:57, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Blank</b> as it does seem this article is not encyclopedia itself, however, since dietary requirements as part of a religion are acceptable in themselves (see Kashut), and I assume that Sikhism has something similar otherwise this article wouldn't exist, so it should have something in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Well this is an interesting case. I'm not 100% set on deletion because AfD is not here to take care of content issues, but this is one case where I think the article is so poorly done that completely wiping it out and starting from scratch wouldn't be such a bad idea. Of course if someone wants to do a total (sourced) rewrite before the AfD is complete I'd happily change my opinion to keep. On an unrelated note, it appears the originator is a role account (per the message on the userpage) and should probably be dealt with as well.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:41, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is an important issue for Sikhs and for others. To understand dietary habits of Sikhs (and of other religions) is of significance to life and the importance of diet cannot be denied. Diet plays an key role in the lives of all and it is a matter relating to an important religion of the world. Don't you think that the world would be interested to know about the dietary habits of the Sikhs? We have similar dietary articles for <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_vegetarianism.html" title="Christian vegetarianism">Christianty</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetarianism_in_Buddhism_e2e0.html" title="Vegetarianism in Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, etc. and so I think if this article is deleted then in fairness those others should also be deleted.<br />
The article has been vandalised by <a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikh-history_70b0.html" title="User:Sikh-history">User:sikh-history</a> who has a set agenda - See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Sikh-history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Sikh-history" rel="nofollow">his contributions</a> which all only relate to a one-set-POV. He has since 23 September been changing various articles to his POV in relation to diet and Sikhism. He is deliberately changing this article and other so that they are deleted from the database so that this matter is not brought to the attention of the world as this suits his view.<br />
I suggest that the article is reverted to the version that I created. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> 03:05, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The content of the article put up for deletion has no basis in fact. It is completely unsupportable. Also, this is not a dispute between two individuals. The original Dakini article which was moved to <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakini%28Buddhism%29_72b7.html" title="Dakini(Buddhism)">Dakini(Buddhism)</a> is the result of editing by multiple editors over several years.

<li>Those last two paragraphs on dakinis in Tibetan tantric practice are (I think) accurate, if unsourced (though I think they come from well-regarded books on Tibetan Buddhism by <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reginald_Ray_decf.html" title="Reginald Ray">Reginald Ray</a>).

<li><b>Comment</b> exactly. A merge does not necessarily denote that the entirety fo both articles needs to exist in one merged article. What can be sourced from the current <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakini.html" title="Dakini">Dakini</a> should be retained. What cannot be sourced should be removed from the article as <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a>. From the looks of it <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakini%28Buddhism%29_72b7.html" title="Dakini(Buddhism)">Dakini(Buddhism)</a> is well sourced and the info there should be incorporated back into the <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakini.html" title="Dakini">Dakini</a> with a redirect from <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakini%28Buddhism%29_72b7.html" title="Dakini(Buddhism)">Dakini(Buddhism)</a> to <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakini.html" title="Dakini">Dakini</a>. The point is that all of this effort could be <b>boldly</b> done without an AfD; This is a content issue and there is nothing here that needs to be deleted. If there is a problem with this because specific editors don't agree with this course of action or are reverting changes without discussion than this is a situation that needs to be dealt with through a Request for Comment or Mediation.

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b>. I admit that this is borderline, and that the <i>original</i> article was primarily intended for self-promotion. However, it has since been rewritten, and as such the arguments from the original AFD, for the most part, do not apply. By extension, a comment made prior to said rewrite is used as the primary basis for deletion, and it is equally inapplicable.--<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sean_Black_def1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sean Black">SB</a> | <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black">T</a> 02:43, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But that's a <i>very</i> subjective (hence POV) interpretation of notability. I think our general policy is to trust publishers to decide what's worth publishing and what's not, which makes it more objective. Having multiple published books makes someone notable by definition. Period. I don't know what ruler you would use to determine who is a "minor writer." At a minimum, his books sold very well regionally, and he was very well-known locally. --<a href="../../../n/t/h/User%7ENThurston_9c8d.html" title="User:NThurston">NThurston</a> 20:40, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly. That proposed guideline is what has been used repeatedly to nuke people's web-only, or thought-up-between-high-school-classes, Micronation articles. To meet the criteria, the Micronation has to have widespread press coverage, and a real-world presence of some sort (even if that's souvenier material production). One could posit higher criteria (some sort of actual territory claim) but there seems little point; the ones that have a real world presence of any sort and press coverage is a small enough group, all of which now have WP articles.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This is a notable topic and the subject of study for more than a century. Whole books (such as <i>The Uncollected Sherlock Holmes</i>) have been written about the semi-canon material written by <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Arthur_Conan_Doyle_017d.html" title="Sir Arthur Conan Doyle">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</a> but not considered part of the core set of Holmes stories. The article does have somewhat of an essay feel to it due to the signed "conclusion" section, but that's a case for cleanup, not deletion. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 18:19, 2 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Further comment</b> According to the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Canon (fiction)">Canon (fiction)</a> article, the concept of a literary "canon" originated with Holmes scholars attempts to differentiate the core Holmes stories from the many pastiches, parodies, etc. In other words, Holmes was the first fictional work to be discussed in terms of having a "canon". This further strengthens my already-ironclad opinion that the topic is worthy of an article. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 13:13, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Blank and Start Over</b> The subject itself is noteworthy, so I have no problem with that, but I'm not sure of this article. I'd suggest it being part of the main Sherlock Holmes article, but that might take up too much space, so it would be best to keep seperate.</li>
<li><b>Keep for now and cleanup</b> Desperately needs referencing, but as per Starblind, I'm going to give the creator the benefit of the doubt for now. Cleanup, reference, and remove the essay-like "conclusion". If it still lacks references in a couple of months, reconsider for deletion. I don't think this is fancruft by the way. It's far from sufficiently obsessively detailed over trivia. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 19:33, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This isn't a group, it was a historical, ground-breaking exhibition for its time during a critical period of art history, that was a gathering of a number of notable artists.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article needs editing, it is still a little shrill in its appearance. The Ninth Street shows were both real and important to the downtown New York art world in the fifties. As were the Tenth Street galleries and the Whitney Annuals. <a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModernist_ef8e.html" title="User:Modernist">Modernist</a> 00:51, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Thank you for appreciating the article. The heading of the article is not clear. <b>There was only one "Ninth Street" Show</b> May 21st to June 10th, 1951. For the first time the public was able to see the best examples of the New York School avant-garde. The "9th Street Art Exhibition" may refer to a collective title of exhibitions on the 9th Street. This article is about one very significant exhibition. There were cooperatives like the Tanager Gallery on 10th Street but it opened later in 1952. The Whitney Annuals were very important but had nothing to do with the "Ninth Street" Show. This show was organized and hung by the artists themselves. It would be inportant to change the heading to <b>"Ninth Street" Show.</b> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarika_Herskovic_88dc.html" title="User:Marika Herskovic">Marika Herskovic</a> 02:03, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>This deletion process started by nn group: ITY. Who is ITY? "Wikipedia does not have a user page with this exact name. In general, this page should be created and edited by User:ITY."

<p>This is an article about a band which released, according to the article, one LP, one single and one 12"; a CD of their back catalogue has since been produced. It does not appear that their releases were on a major label, as failure to be signed by a major label was cited as the reason for the band folding. The article was very spammy, I cleaned it a bit. I do not see any credible assertion of notability, but it may be that Someone Out There knows of some additional data which will establish the importance of the group.</p>

<li>I think you've misinterpreted me. The citations in this article at the moment are from the Qur'an and that's perfectly ok, since we need the text there as it is. There are also explanations of the scientific processes involved. What the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_and_the_Bible_23d4.html" title="Science and the Bible">Science and the Bible</a> article has as well as these is a collection of sources where scientists and theologians have examined the compatibility of the two things. This article (at the moment), <i>doesn't</i>. I'm not saying that such sources don't exist, I'm just saying that they're not here at the moment. Without them, it looks more like original research. For example, which "Scientists say that before the galaxies in the Universe were formed, celestial matter was initially in the form of huge gaseous matter or clouds." Likewise, I was under the distinct impression that some planets orbit the sun in an elliptical manner rather than the "rounded course", so a citation would need to be provided here, and so on. In relation to the argument that there are other articles which don't cite sources, the fact that a series of articles of a certain type exist isn't a reason in favour of keeping any particular article of that type. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 22:03, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>About <b>science I am copying most of the things from wikipedia other articles</b>. BTW rounded does not mean perfext circle or ellipse. In rounded both are covered. It is just commonly known fact. I know because it is about Islam so I have to find references about commonly known fact. I also know that you cannot even wait for references for few hours or days.

<li>First of all, please understand that no one is attacking you nor the Islamic faith. Secondly, I believe you are still mistaken as to BigHaz's meaning: it is not the science that needs citations, but the <i>correlations</i> between science and the Qur'ān. I could go through the <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upanishads.html" title="Upanishads">Upanishads</a> and correlate sections of it to scientific thought, but that would be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.

<li>&#160;: See I have to work on other things too and do not get lots of free time to work on wikipedia. In order to improve the article I want to do following two things. Firstly, I will ask some other people in wikipedia to contribute (as they are good in this subject). Secondly, I will issue books from library. However, it depends that when I will have free time again (may be after a week). Lastly, I think when more people will know about the article then it will improve significantly. Because few will add criticism and other will defend it with references at the end we will have a healthy article (that what is wikipedia about).

<dd><b>Comment:</b> As it stands now the article <i>is</i> an apology of Islam. It's a good thing that you invite other people to work on it, and the work already done is a good basis. However, you know (or by now you should know) what the rules are. There's nothing forbidding you from working on a preliminary acceptable version of the article outside Wikipedia, or in your own userspace. I'd be happy to help, but the article is original research (your own ellaboration) and I'm not familiar with any reference works that could be used in this case. For now, <b>no vote</b>, but I'm afraid the article cannot stand as it is now, as it violates policies that are at the core of Wikipedia. If it does get deleted, you still have the right to ask that a copy of the text be restored <i>outside of article space</i> for your own use, so you can eventually make it conformant to WP policies and re-create it.</dd>
<dd><b>Comment 2:</b> The above observation by Danny Lilithborne is simply not a valid argument. "If you delete this, why don't you delete that" is possibly the single most posted opinion in AfD, but it never works, and it only messes up the process. —<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm very aware of that. However, I think it works in this case. Deleting an article that just needs citations and clean-up to be encyclopedic is not appropriate, and deleting this but leaving the Bible article conveys a clear double-standard. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 01:59, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment.</b> There is a very clear difference between the two articles, though: one examines the relationship between science and scripture (both correllations and discrepencies), and one selectively interprets passages in scripture to show that they are in agreement with scientific thought. If we were drawing analogies, this would be similar to an article about Creationism that only listed verses that could be interpreted to agree with scientific finding. The fact that the creator has stated within this AFD that the article "claims that everything in Quran is scientific or correct scientifically" further adds to the article's underlying POViness. -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope">Merope</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerope_f738.html" title="User talk:Merope">Talk</a></sup></small> 02:20, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>In the last few AfD's I have participated in this same argument is put forward "the other side is just having his friends come and help him". First I think there should be more faith in the WP Community. Lots of people contribute to these debates, many people who just want to help improve WP and have no connection what so ever to the article in question. Furthermore it is an ad hoc attack to focus on the personalities of the contributors rather than the substance of the debate. I personally peruse the AfD's and participate at on anything that catches my eye. When generalities are made about the contributors of a debate that do not apply to me at all, I feel a bit insulted. <a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatherhaveaheart_e6da.html" title="User:Ratherhaveaheart">Ratherhaveaheart</a> 16:21, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Move</b> This article should be moved to a book page <i>The Bible, The Qur'an and Science</i> as the article gives "French born Saudi royal physician" Maurice Bucaille 's book as a source for these theories. I might mention that the arguments listed on the page as so preposterous as to hardly be worth refuting, for example the line where it says the "heavens and the earth were of one piece, then We parted them" allegedly refering to the Big Bang. Do we need to even mention that that Earth did not exist at the time of the Big Bang.--<a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">CltFn</a> 04:14, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Being "popular" isn't a reason to be in an encyclopedia.

<ul>
<li>Well, personaly, I believe that being popular IS a good reason, but whatever, it's just my opinion. Acording to <a href="http://info.abril.com.br/premioinfo/2005/" class="external autonumber" title="http://info.abril.com.br/premioinfo/2005/" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> tought, the site was choosen as "site of the year", as is visited by 120.000 people every day. Too bad it's in portuguese, as it is pretty much all material about it (not much I found, but not much I researched). What I can report you is that at every Sunday, at the sports program of <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Globo_0914.html" title="TV Globo">TV Globo</a> (by far the largest one in Brazil), there is one <i>charge</i> featured every week. The author also made some animations for the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28Brazil%29_63b6.html" title="Big Brother (Brazil)">Big Brother (Brazil)</a> show. The site was reviewed in <a href="../../../v/e/j/Veja.html" title="Veja">Veja</a> magazine, one of the biggest in the country. The author appeared in the television show of <a href="../../../j/%C3%B4/_/J%C3%B4_Soares_0e8b.html" title="Jô Soares">Jô Soares</a>, a similar show in Brazil to David Letterman's or Jay Lenno's. Hell, in Brazil, the site is probably more visited then Wikipedia (and probably a LOT more then the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_Wikipedia_60d7.html" title="Portuguese Wikipedia">Portuguese Wikipedia</a>). But links and stuff? Sorry, I don't have. All the information in the article is easily accessible from the site - you just have to speak portuguese. Well, the informations on the article. The ones I posted here can't go for the article because I don't have links to prove it. They are true, tought. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgumacoisaqq_3232.html" title="User:Algumacoisaqq">algumacoisaqq</a> 00:39, 6 October 2006 (UTC) Also: I know the article lacks quality and such, and it's hard for people from outside to know about it's importance just from looking at it. But it could have being asked, I don't know. This isn't the first, or the second (well, it's the third) article for deletion that I see complaining about web based stuff, when it just shouldn't.
<ul>
<li>Given that there are sources in Portuguese, perhaps this would be a good article to write in the <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1gina_principal" class="external text" title="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1gina_principal" rel="nofollow">Portuguese Wikipedia</a>? To be in the English Wikipedia there have to be (I suppose) sources in English, or translated into English. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 14:58, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It allready exists in the Portuguese Wikipedia. Look, if you think the article lacks the quality to be on wikipedia, then just delete it, because it has been a long time ago since I wrote it and to be honest I have no interest in researching english fonts just to prove my point. I'm just saying that I know about the wikipedia rules - I used to be a regular contributor in Portuguese wikipedia - and there is no reason to delete this article at all. The thing is that I'm not interested to continue to maintain that particular article, so if you think it should be deleted for the lack of sources, fine by me (oh well, not really fine, I'll be pissed off, but whatever, at least I won't complain). The thing is that, as far as I know, all the info in the article is just to bloody obvious to be quoted from sources (yeah, I know, I need to read the "no original resource" rule again... but I just think that rule is flawed). Besides, I believe English wikipedia has the most resources about this subject in the English language. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgumacoisaqq_3232.html" title="User:Algumacoisaqq">algumacoisaqq</a> 17:58, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I just read again these rules (verificability, no original research). It looks like they are a lot more important now then they used to be. I didn't found any mention about language, tought. I still believe all info can be found inside the site (the site being a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a>, is it possible?), it's just that it is in Portuguese. Oh well, I'll see if anyone from pt.wikipedia is interested in fixing it. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgumacoisaqq_3232.html" title="User:Algumacoisaqq">algumacoisaqq</a> 18:11, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b>. The title is descriptive rather than some specific term, and absence of google search is meaningless. Lack of references is not big deal. We are not talking about something controversial here. I am quite sure there are quite a few Dutch namebooks in existence. Gogling for "dutch names" gives quite a few thoussands of google hits. I have found the article interesting: it shows a pet name formation distinct from, say English, and it may well be made in a solid article; examples exist, see eg <a href="http://www.geocities.com/heartland/prairie/3374/dutchname1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/heartland/prairie/3374/dutchname1.htm" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> (not exactly on topic; just to show encyclopedic potential, and interesting, too; quoting: <i>"For someone just starting Dutch research, a Dutch name is like a foreign word."</i>). `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 02:39, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> "Quite a few Dutch namebooks in existence". You must be kidding. I was inundated by books every time my wife was pregnant. Well, many English, French and Russian names are now frequent and current in the Dutch language area, and some of these names are subject to "shortening" that would sound very strange in the original language. Dominique is shortened to Niek (also the shortened form of Nikolass) when the child is a boy, to Dom or Dommi when it is a girl. Tanja becomes Tan - in Belgium at least. Evelyn in all forms and pronunciations is shortened to Evy or Evie. "Kat" (yes, it also mean cat) can stand for many female names, and is rather awkward when you have a daughter called Kathelijn AND a daughter called Katja (like I have). While in the Netherlands only the female short forms are used for official registration at town hall (Cor or Neel are officially Conelis but Neeltje is registered), in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium the short forms are also registered for boys. So, this article can actually be expanded a "little".--<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 13:42, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> Wikipedia is extremely large (well over a million articles). Hundreds, if not thousands, of new articles are added every day.

<li>I would also like to add that: The reason I hadn't previously created an account is because I did not see a need. All the articles I had viewed were generally complete, or not being challenged. Such a great sense of community here I must say, you target new users and assume things about them. Just because I found an article of interest to me, signed up so I could help out, you say i have created a "single purpose account", that's not very nice. I am actually a little disappointed by the wiki community, or part of it at least. If I see a need to help edit another article in the future, then I will, but as yet I do not see that need. I hope you can accept my proposal... <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalcol13_da9d.html" title="User:Malcol13">Malcol13</a> 06:10, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> She is UP and Coming! I made this article to pay homage to someone who is up and coming. She was on the cover of Spanish Vogue too! That's a big deal! She's signed with several MAJOR modeling agencies and she's on their websites! You guys need to calm down! Also, she is related to one of the world's most classically famous actresses, Merle Oberon.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.174.160.135 (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.174.160.135.html" title="User talk:70.174.160.135">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.174.160.135_7a08.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.174.160.135">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Reply</b> Here's the thing: Wikipedia is absolutely, positively, 100%, do not pass go, do not collect $200 NOT for "up and coming" anything. If you're not notable <i>right now</i>, then the article needs to wait until you are. Wikipedia is <i>not</i> for raising someone's profile. It's for documenting people that <i>already</i> have a high profile. And Julia Oberon does not. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 04:40, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Addition</b> Be it good or ill, I tracked down a link to a scan of the cover of the August 2004 Vogue. Is this her:<a href="http://www.chloesevigny.com/chloe_pictures2/vogue_espana_august2004_cover.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chloesevigny.com/chloe_pictures2/vogue_espana_august2004_cover.jpg" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> I have no idea. Does it mean she meet notability requirements? Probably not. The picture doesn't mention a name (as far as I can tell) and is more about the clothes and makeup than the model. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 04:31, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> No that is not her, but the fact that she was on the cover of a very prominent magazine, regardless of content -IS- important. She is up and coming in the USA, she is well known in many other countries as well. She has a huge fan base in Japan. Also, the fact that she is distantly related to the famous actress Merle Oberon should be enough to qualify her as notable. People are interested in these types of things, even though you don't seem to think so. Why would anyone use Wikipedia as an outlet to boost their notority? This isn't exactly People Magazine. And please, don't refer to *me* as if I was her. That's pretty presumptious and inncorrect.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.174.160.135 (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.174.160.135.html" title="User talk:70.174.160.135">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.174.160.135_7a08.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.174.160.135">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> A couple of things. 1) The Merle Oberon connection is meaningless. I'm the second cousin once removed of the inspiration for the title character of Rain Main, the grand nephew of the junior Senator from Utah and the son of the head of the math department of University of Utah (these three facts are all true). Being someone's relative isn't meaningful. Even if she was, Merle Oberon isn't all that famous. Sorry. 2) If she was well known, there would be google chatter about her. The internet <i>loves</i> models. No fansites, nothing. Google is worldwide, but there are no matches for her name in <i>any</i> Japanese website. Wikipedia entries have to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notable</a>. Julia Oberon is not. Why would someone use Wikipedia to boost their notability? The same reason they write their name on walls. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 07:00, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
