<li>Of course it is a duplicate, look at the articles, they all three purport to do the same thing: list doomsday scenarios. There is a long history of editors trying to merge <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_of_civilization.html" title="End of civilization">End of civilization</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_extinction.html" title="Human extinction">Human extinction</a> into a single article, but article approach differences have prevented it. Now we have a third person (yourself) with an unsourced list of doomsday scenarios and a third approach to the same problem. It's highly confusing for the reader to determine which list to look at. Also just because it is a list it is not exempt from original research and POV rules. Who says these are doomsday scenarios - half of them are science fiction as far as I and many others are concerned (based on previous edit histories of the other articles). -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 23:49, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> This should be deleted as duplication (along with the two mentioned off the top, we have <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doomsday_event.html" title="Doomsday event">Doomsday event</a> and <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extinction_event.html" title="Extinction event">Extinction event</a>), but I thought I'd leave a note to Maple rather than piling one on: this may not be duplication in that you don't see elsewhere the info you think belongs here, but it is duplication insofar as those other pages <i>ought to be able to handle what this list contains</i>. That is, we seem to have enough articles on this topic (the list is functioning as a category, basically), so try to improve the other articles and, of course <i>cite your sources</i>. Also, rationalize what belongs. Terrorism can, of course, have a "catastrophic effect on humans" but it would only be an extinction level event as a proximate cause of something else (e.g., nuclear holocaust). I do not agree, BTW, that this "just can't be made encyclopedic." Potentialities of this sort can be sourced, and I think there might actually be an absence in our coverage (after just a glance): are we separating human level extinction from terrestrial tree of life extinction? Terrorism won't bother bacteria—is there anything (beyond the Sun's demise) that <i>would</i> eliminate <i>all</i> life on Earth? We should list/describe that, if we don't already. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 23:06, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Whether any of those should be merged is a separate issue, and probably confusing this decision.

<dd>I am unsure what you accuse me of objecting to by using the paradoxical term "neutral bias." I will tell you what I do advocate, however, and what I do object to. I advocate making objective decisions, by which I mean making decisions (<i>keep</i>, <i>delete</i>, <i>merge</i>, etc.) <i>a posteriori</i>. I consider Wikipedians who monitor the <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">Articles for Deletion</a> page more likely to be objective and <i>a posteriori</i> compared to Wikipedians solicited specifically because of the extent of the discussion's correspondence with their own preconceived ideas. By soliciting votes from fifty-eight articles related to the article we are discussing here, <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapleTree_5e64.html" title="User:MapleTree">MapleTree</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/p/User_talk%7EMapleTree_ba42.html" title="User talk:MapleTree">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MapleTree_eb96.html" title="Special:Contributions/MapleTree">contribs</a>) has compromised this discussion by introducing possible <i>a priori</i> judgements. Specifically, because the preconceived ideas of Wikipedians who monitor Articles for Deletion are less likely to correspond to the article in discussion here than Wikipedians solicied from fifty-eight articles pertaining to doomsday scenarios, I consider the former more likely to be objective and more likely to be capable to pass <i>a posteriori</i> judgements than the latter. I consider the former group more likely to be able to accept or deny the strength of a deletion proposal on the basis of the strength of the arguments in support of deletion, rather than the extent of the proposal's correspondence with their own preconceived ideas. I do not think that your vote is <i>necessarily</i> impartial because you were solicited, Serge; because MapleTree solicted requests to "save this article," however, I think that he introduced sufficient <i>a priori</i> and subjective judgements to this discussion to create an impartial, subjective, and <i>a priori</i> discussion. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 03:22, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see. It is the "save this article" language to which you object. I suppose that might be a problem, but it could work either way. When I saw it, I wasn't overwhelmed with a desire to go save an article, it piqued my interest to find out what the fuss is all about. I read the comments here, and the articles in question, and voted accordingly. It could have gone either way. I honestly don't think I was biased to find in favor of saving because of the language used in the solicitiation. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 15:58, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I admire your <i>a posteriori</i> judgement, Serge. I object not only to the "save this article" language posted on fifty-eight peripherally-related talk pages by <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapleTree_5e64.html" title="User:MapleTree">MapleTree</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/p/User_talk%7EMapleTree_ba42.html" title="User talk:MapleTree">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MapleTree_eb96.html" title="Special:Contributions/MapleTree">contribs</a>), but also to any solicitations to discuss the deletion of any article. Granted, the notice on every page discussed for deletion is specifically such a solicitation and is arguably most likely to attract possible <i>a priori</i> judgements, but I think it is necessary to prevent confusion; but it is unacceptable to attract any more possible judgements and thus further subjectively bias the discussion. Nonetheless, it is "...considered highly inappropriate or unacceptable to advertise Wikipedia articles that are being debated [for deletion]...." (<a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html#Advertising_and_soliciting_meatpuppets" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>) Finally, I wish participants in every discussion would "...disclose whether [they] are an article's primary author or if [they] otherwise have a vested interest in the article." (<a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a>) Then we might not be having this discussion and instead be improving Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 00:32, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The full quote from <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html#Advertising_and_soliciting_meatpuppets" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> is, "It is considered highly inappropriate or unacceptable to advertise Wikipedia articles that are being debated <b>in order to attract users with known views and bias</b>, in order to strengthen one side of a debate.". You conveniently left out that critical clause that I emboldened: <b>in order to attract users with known views and bias</b>. How <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapleTree_5e64.html" title="User:MapleTree">MapleTree</a> could possibly know the views and bias of me or anyone else who happened to stumble on to one of his innocent solicitations, I have no idea. But maybe his crystal ball is in better order than mine. Apparently you think so. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 03:35, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I apologize for leaving out that clause. I did not intend to, as you accuse me of, "redact the relevant portions" and "conveniently [leave] out [the] critical clause." I honestly did not, at the time I quoted <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>, find it [the clause] important, although I can see I was mistaken. I fid not think I needed to illuminate that point. I was mistaken. I disagree, however, that the solicitations of <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapleTree_5e64.html" title="User:MapleTree">MapleTree</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/p/User_talk%7EMapleTree_ba42.html" title="User talk:MapleTree">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MapleTree_eb96.html" title="Special:Contributions/MapleTree">contribs</a>) were innocent or innocuous; I argue that they were indeed harmful. I think that specifically because MapleTree's posts were a request to "save this article," they inherently attract (not solely, but largely) users with known views and biases that specifically correspond to this article, thus violating the specific clause of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> in its entirety. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 06:25, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So your argument rests on the assumption that the "save this article" wording in the solicitations is likely to attract more of those who are inclined to save articles in general, to save this particular article, or both, than those who are more inclined to delete it for some reason. I disagree. I could see it working either way. It could just as easily have backfired on him, and, judging by the way the votes are going, appears to have accomplished exactly that. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 22:16, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also, it overlaps at least two existing resources that have themselves had intermittent efforts toward merger; further muddying of the waters is not necessary.

<dd>Someone should be able to define a set of criteria for inclusion <b>now</b>. If the result is <i>keep but define a set of criteria for inclusion</i>, I doubt the criteria will be created because the list will have already been kept, the goal of achieving favorable consensus already achieved; but if the proposal is <i>delete unless a set of criteria for inclusion is created</i>, then there is significant timely motivation for the condition to be met. If a set of criteria cannot now be created, but can be created in the future, then the article can be nominated for <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 02:08, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> unles a set of criteria for inclusion are created. I think that "if [an event] is listed as an X [potentially apocalyptic event], that [event] must have been identified as an X by a reliable published source" (from the essay <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_in_Wikipedia_9f97.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists in Wikipedia">Lists in Wikipedia</a>). None of the events in this list give any note by any reliable published source as to their apocalyptic nature. Thus this list is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. But I agree with <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarskell_425e.html" title="User talk:Marskell">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marskell_5d95.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marskell">contribs</a>) that the content in this list can be made encyclopedic. But until specific criteria for inclusion are created such that this list cannot exponentially grow, and such that it only permits <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">verifiable</a> information, I nominate it for deletion. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 02:30, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I thought of specific criteria I want to know immediately if I were to come to this article. Is it an article about doomsday, or about any events that pose existential risk? The two events are dissimilar. Doomsday may refer to different Christian eschatological beliefs, or it may refer to any doomsday event, which "...may range from a major disruption of human civilization, to the extinction of human life, to the destruction of the planet Earth, to the annihilation of the entire universe." (<a href="../../../d/o/o/Doomsday_event.html" title="Doomsday event">Doomsday event</a>) <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existential_risk.html" title="Existential risk">Existential risk</a> may not necessarily "...annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life...," but may merely "...permanently and drastically curtail its [Earth-originating intelligent life's] potential."</dd>
<dd>So, is this article going to,
<ol>
<li>elaborate on and illuminate various Christian eschatological belifes,</li>
<li>list any doomsday event,</li>
<li>detail any event which may "...annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life...," or</li>
<li>merely list any event which may "...permanently and drastically curtail its [Earth-originating intelligent life's] potential."</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>If it is the first, it is a duplicate of <a href="../../../e/s/c/Eschatology.html" title="Eschatology">Eschatology</a>; if it is the second, it is a duplicate of <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_of_civilization.html" title="End of civilization">End of civilization</a>; if it is the third, it is a duplicate of <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_of_civilization.html" title="End of civilization">End of civilization</a>; and if it is the fourth, it is deserves an entirely new name and new content, <i>if</i> that content is verifiable.</dd>
<dd>There, if anyone can provide a specific set of criteria that does not specifically describe another article as I layed out, or if anyone can show me where my reasoning is wrong and how this list could be distinct from the three (and fourth hypothetical) article, then I will be impressed and will gladly consider changing my vote. --<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 02:54, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>We've been through this before in the other articles. Just because a source lists it doesn't mean it's valid. Many of the sources list scenarios that are science fiction.

We already have two other articles that do this. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 14:14, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I believe the title of this list is intuitive and should be used in this regard. Pendragon39 04:44, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep but edit</b> I think it holds merit as an article, but things like hurricanes, which affect relativly few people in the whole world, and the article titled "The End is Nigh" should be removed from the list as "The End is Nigh" is not an actual even that could lead to eventual desturction of the world as we know it, but an editorial. All in all, keep the article, but see to it that it is redone properly. Optomal7 23:42, 6 October (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> remove the nonsense entries like tornado and hurricane. It is ironic that one of the article's opponents <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> re-inserts such items in the article (after their deletion), which are obvious nonsense and then oppose the article's existence.
