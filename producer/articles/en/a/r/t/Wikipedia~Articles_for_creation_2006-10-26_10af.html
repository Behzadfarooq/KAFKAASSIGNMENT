<p>Hayes Greenfield is a well-known jazz musician and saxophonist in New York City. Hayes has produced numerous albums, his most recent being Peace of Mind. He also started the "Jazz-Ma-Taz" program in New York City in 1997. "Jazz-Ma-Taz" is his live, interactive show for young people that introduces jazz in a fun, unique, and participatory way. While Hayes and his band jazz up familiar songs, young people are encouraged to join in through call-and-response, scatting, singing, interpretive sound, movement, conducting, and tap dance. Says Hayes, “What I am trying to do with Jazz-A-Ma-Tazz is to show kids how much fun they can have with jazz. To stretch their ears and minds to the magic and joys of improvisation in a way that enables kids to embrace this beautiful music and make it their own. When I get done with them they leave chanting, singing and knowing that jazz is alive and well and not old foggie music." "Jazz-Ma-Taz" has spread all around the world in different venues such as festivals, performing arts centers, schools, community centers, and musuems. From 1993-2000, Hayes was the head of the music department at "The Door", a center for inner-city youth in New York City. Hayes also mentored young men at Friends of Island Academy, an organization providing services to those making the transition from incarceration back to the community. Hayes has also taught jazz on the west coast to high school students and also developed a Literacy Through Jazz curriculum for the New Jersey Chamber Society that is currently being taught in New Jersey private and public schools. Besides teaching, Hayes also worked on composing the score for the documentary"American Rebuilds: A Year at Ground Zero", which aired on PBS as part of its 9/11 memorial programming. A filmmaker, as well, Hayes Greenfield has produced two award-winning short films: For the Children, a film/music video, and Friends of the Children. Both films examine problems facing American youth in today’s society and investigate ways that caring adults and community programs have helped shape young people’s lives in positive and productive ways. Hayes was recently recognized by New York University who honored him with the SCPS/GSP 2005 Marc Crawford Jazz Educators Award (previous recipients include Clark Terry, Benny Golson, Kenny Barron, Al Grey, Barry Harris, John Hicks, Dwite Mitchell, Willie Ruff, and Steve Wilson). He was also awarded a grant from Chamber Music of America for their 2006-07 Residency Partnership Program. Hayes attended the Choate Rosemary Hall school in Wallingford, CT and graduated in 1975. He is recognized as one of the most famous musicians to have attended the prep school.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-26_10af.html" title="Edit section: Paco Felici - Artist">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Paco Felici - Artist</span></h2>
<p>Paco Felici (American, B. 1970) is a noted self taught artist based in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>While Felici employs media often seen in folk art, including wood, housepaint, and found objects, his large scale paintings and sculptural renditions have been regarded as being a distinctive folk-pop crossover.</p>
<p>Upon first impression Felici's deceptively simple works give off sense of carefree playfulness, close study reveals the artist's keen awareness of social injustice and inequality around the world and in the U.S. Popular and often-repeated works like Felici's "Paletas," his homage to the ubiquitous Mexican ice cream vendors around Texas, are the artist's tribute to the unsung working class immigrants whom he also deals with in his professional life, and around whom he has grown up since childhood.</p>
<p>His earlier works circa 1999-2000 often capture American icons, real and fictional, in a distinct style he quickly developed and continues to hone-in. Completely self taught but with an ample knowledge or art history, politics and world events, Felici's opts to work within his limitations by butressing what he lacks in brushstroke technique with instantly recognizable, simple figures. His take on the Statue of Liberty ("Libertad"), with thick lips and almond-shaped eyes, is one particular theme Felici often repeats and which brought him to statewide prominence when it was first published on the cover of The Texas Observer.</p>
<p>In other popular works, such as "Krispy Kreme," what at first appears to be a lighthearted and colorful take on a pop culture phenomena of the ubiquitous donut franchise strikes many viewers as an understated commentary on social inequity, as a Hispanic or African American subject in the foreground, an apparent clerk at the popular eatery, stares blankly ahead.</p>
<p>Felici, howerver, the otherwise accessible artist has remained notoriously tight lipped during interviews about the deeper social commentary of his works, deferring to the viewer's interpretation. "I don't know- perhaps a collector likes a painting because it matches their couch," he was once responded when asked why he felt his art was gaining significant popularity.</p>
<p>It was Felici's bold, playful, but ultimately poignant style and undercurrent of social commentary that drew the attention of editors at the University of Iowa, who in 2002 commissioned Felici to create the cover and interior artwork for Humor Me: An Anthology of Humor by Writers of Color, one of the first collections of humorous prose and poetry devoted entirely to contemporary minority American writers.</p>
<p>It is around the same time that Felici was approached by the reclusive singer-songwriter Faris Nourallah to create the artwork for "Problematico" (2003, Western Vinyl), the Dallas-based musician second solo album. Since the forging of their artistic collaboration, Felici has created cover artwork for the ensuing King of Sweden (2004, Western Vinyl)and Il Suo Cuore di Transistor (2006, Awful Bliss).</p>
<p>In 2003 his artwork was also featured in the yet-to-be-released "Wendell Baker Story," filmed mostly in Austin and written and directed by fellow Texan Luke Wilson.</p>
<p>While many of the artist's works circa 1999-2003 included other notables, including Colonel Sanders, American presidents, contemporary sports figures, and musicians as subject matter, subsequent paintings, watercolors and sculptures have largely steered clear from using celebrities as subject matter. He has likewise scaled back his once prodigious output (in the beginning, Felici was known to create 20 to 30 works per week), opting instead for creating more elaborate sculptural pieces.</p>
<p>Since that time, Felici has delved into more abstract and representarional subject matter, particularly birds and animals, relationships between men and women (perhaps best captured by his striking renderings of Adam and Eve), and creating large scale works with old signs and other found objects. A 2003 trip through the Southwest also moved him to execute his multicultural take on native American subjects, including large scale works depticting tribal chiefs and warriors. He also creates numerous works on pages of old books and ledger paper, in the tradition of native Americans rounded into reservations in the mid to late 1800s.</p>
<p>Felici is also notorious for his folksy recreations of iconic American products, such as McDonald's French Fries, Windex bottles, and oversized renderings of chewing gum wrappers, where he substitutes the well known brand names with their Hispanicized counterparts: Juicy Fruit becomes "Juicyfuta" and Big Red becomes "Big Rojo" -- a commentary on the growing influence of Hispanic culture and linguistics in America, a topic with which Felici, who is fluent in five languages, is intimately familiar.</p>
<p>Felici's work is included in numerous prominent private, corporate and museum collections and art galleries in his home state of Texas and also Florida and California.</p>

<p>Felici spent his formative years traveling througout the world, as required by his father's career. A year after his borth in Brazil, the family lived in Mexico, Egypt, Algeria, Canada, Italy, Sweden, and eventually immigrated to the United States in 1984. Felici attended high school in Plano, a suburb of Dallas, and moved to Austin to attend the University of Texas, where he was an English major. Consequently, his art is heavily influenced by his exposure to multiple cultures and a childhood spent residing and traveling extensively in five continents.</p>
<p>After college, Felici became a research and policy analyst for Dan Morales, then attorney general of Texas. Felici still maintains a prominent position within Texas government as an assistant to current Attorney General Greg Abbott, whom he primarily advises on communications strategies and issues related to the growing Hispanic constituency in Texas. Felici is a well known advocate both in Texas and nationally on behalf of Hispanics and the development of state level policies to better serve that community, particularly fighting financial exploitation of newly arrived immigrants. He served in a similar advisory capacity for then Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, who went on to become U.S. Senator.</p>
<p>Several Texas newspapers have extensively profiled Felici's "double life," both as a prominent, almost accidental artist whose professional life helps to significantly shape public policy in Texas.</p>

<p>The song 'Ends' by Everlast on june 21, 1999. It is a very typical song from Everlast and is incredibly similar to the more famous song, 'What It's Like.' Just like in the song 'What It's Like' there are three stories. The first is about a friend who was very smart but had no money and couldn't get into a college. He starts waiting tables to get money and then starts smoking crack. Eventually he ends up dead after trying to rob a man. The second story is about a young woman who uses prostitution to make money and make ends meet. The last story is about two friends that sold drugs together and eventually end up getting robbed and dissapearing. Although it is unclear what the word 'ends' specifically means in this song the main idea of it is money. "But he's from business school and he's nervous with a tool, so he ends up on his back in a bloody pool, for the ends." "From the Wetlands all the way to the Apollo, if you're broke she's spittin' if you're rich she might swallow, for the ends." "Fly jewels and clothes and they got no jobs and then one dissapeared and one got robbed, for the ends." In each of those lines from different verses it is apparent that the word ends basically means money. This song is from the album 'Whitey Ford Sings the Blues' by Everlast. The chorus of the song goes: "Some people will rob their mother's for the ends, Rats snitch on one another for the ends, Sometimes kids get murdered for their ends, So before we go any further i want my ends"</p>

<p>A "Comprehensive Annual Financial Report" or "CAFR" as a government book keeping practice started in the post WWII economic boom and replaced what was regularly a "off-the-books" practice called the "general fixed asset account group" . The various levels of government "general government" or the federal United States, individual state governments and government agencies each began producing a CAFR in the late 1940's to early 1950's to catalog an accurate picture of institutional funds, or financial holdings, assets and total investment incomes for those government and nongovernmental entities using the report, which is above and beyond the budget process. In 1945, the Government Corporation Control Act, began the auditing of wholly owned government corporations and mixed ownership corporations,( those that government may have controlling holdings in but operate as private corporations) all of which may come under the term "enterprise funds". Accounting principles for government entities are set by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB)</p>
<p><a name="CAFR_vs._Budget" id="CAFR_vs._Budget"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-26_10af.html" title="Edit section: CAFR vs. Budget">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">CAFR vs. Budget</span></h3>
<p>The CAFR shows accounting entries the basic budget reports do not, and should not be confused with "rainy day funds" that are included in government budgetary reports and process. A budget is for a select grouping ("general fund") of accounts showing only the more commonly known revenue income from taxes, fees, licenses, fines and a select few revenue sources not gennerally profit generating. The common government budget report also includes, expenses such as salaries, police, and entitlements will be shown along with required holdings to fund pensions, insurance and bonds.</p>
<p>The CAFR shows not only selectively presented budget items, but also government "enterprise operations" or "enterprise funds", investments, and the return on them (or loss). These funds include but are not limited to assets and holdings to back pension and retirement obligation reserves as required by law.</p>
<p><a name="Surplusses" id="Surplusses"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-26_10af.html" title="Edit section: Surplusses">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Surplusses</span></h3>
<p>While a budget might indicate that the government or agency has financial trouble and debt, (because of excess spending within the select grouping of "general fund" accounts presented), the CAFR will normally indicate that government possesses extra holdings considerably over what is shown in a budget report or "general fund" alone. Examples from recient history include, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessie_Ventura_1847.html" title="Jessie Ventura">Jessie Ventura</a>'s career, puncuated by his returning some of the government surplusses to voters as govenor of Minnesota. Other rare news events have highlighted the off-the-budget holdings of government. In one widely reported example in the late 1990's (Los Angeles) Orange County California lost $1-Billion on investments in the <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derivatives.html" title="Derivatives">derivatives</a> market.</p>
<p>A former US Air Force Accountant, Gerald R. Klatt and a former commodities broker Walter Burien, have made contoversial claims, since at least 1996, about the CAFR or "2nd set of books", with their assesments of government assets holdings and investment supporting <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globalism.html" title="Globalism">globalism</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_trade.html" title="Free trade">free trade</a>. In recient years (1999) changes have been made to the GASB rules and claims have been made that such changes are some of the attempts to hide assets and "enterprise funds" from the general public after some sporatic media attention on these issues.</p>

<p>Michael Starr (born March 13, 1977) is a rising modern day British playwright. He began writing back in 1999 with a series of comedy sketches. However, it was a serious one man short play called 'Dilemma' which finally caught the eye. 'Dilemma' went on to win the "1999 Geoffrey Allen award for best short play" award and had a short but successul run in the South of England.</p>
<p>In 2001, Michael returned to sketchwork teaming up with talented British comedian Graeme Storer as they produced a host of material and live shows to dazzle audiences everywhere. 2003 saw an amitious television sitcom named 'Lush' come to life for the first time under Starrs guidance. The project took off beyond anybodies expectation and was snapped up by Australian Network station Sub One following attention from the likes of BBC Talent, Tiscarly, and Digital West.</p>
<p>In 2005, Michael Starr's debut play 'Stranded' appeared on stage with the Colnbrook Amateur Stage Theatre under his direction and received positive feedback from NODA, local press, and audiences alike. Michael is currently working on two new plays.</p>

It was here that Lauren met many friends and started to get invloved in music and sports much more. Lauren played golf for her high school while attending and was highly regarded on her team. Lauren also played soccer for some time and continues to enjoy sports of many kinds. Although you may never know at first glance, Lauren is a very competitive girl. It is a known fact that Matt Housh has beaten her countless times at Mario Party and that she is very angry about it. It is needless to say if Matt Housh played against Lauren in golf that Lauren would pawn Matt pretty badly. Lauren is kinda and effectionate. She has come to be one of Jehovah's Witnesses and loves her god Jehovah. She loves her family as well including her original parents Randall and Lisa Twist along with her brother Joshua and her sister Kourtney. Lauren is a student at CSUS and does not enjoy school.

<p>My Device are a three-piece rock band who recently won the Sony Walkman Breaking Band competition for www.nme.com. They were picked by a list of expert judges such as creation record's Alan McGee from over 6,000 bands, and the prize was an opening slot for the 10th birthday party of nme.com, supporting Kasabian. The show was streamed on the nme website. Since then the band have released their debut album "Nervous System" through Oxford based indie label Shifty Disco, who have in the past put out releases from The Young Knives, The Unbelievable Truth, Nought and many more. I am not a member of the band, but I was at the KOKO show with Kasabian and have since bought their album from a high street shop.</p>

<p>Travelling in an aeroplane can be an enriching experience.From the skies above,we not only get a panoramic of the land but also an insight into human behavior...</p>
<p>When the jet sprang into the sky, it was clear why the city had developed the way it had, seeing it scaled six inches to the mile.There seemed an inevitability about what on ground had looked haphazard, unplanned and without style when the jet sprang into the sky.</p>
<p>When the jet reached ten thousand feet, it was clear why the country had cities where rivers ran and why the valleys were populated. The logic of geography— that land and water attracted man— was clearly delineated when the jet reached ten thousand feet.</p>
<p>When the jet rose six miles high, it was clear that the earth was round and that it had more sea than land. But it was difficult to understand that the men on the earth found causes to hate each other,to build walls across cities and to kill. From that height,it was not clear why.</p>

<p><b>Key Signifier</b> is a literary device coined by Heerak Christian Kim at the 2005 Society of Biblical Literature International Conference in Singapore. Key Signifier is a literary device that draws on collective memory and canonized body of literature from the past in order to prompt a particular action or response in the reader, audience, and listener. Although related to the concept of intertextuality, key signifiers are fundamentally different in that the emphasis is on function, intentionality, and causation rather than association and mere literary reference. This newly coined literary device is critical for understanding the concept of scripturalization and canonization of texts and ideas, and is currently gaining serious momentum in academia among literary critics and textual scholars.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-26_10af.html" title="Edit section: LANCING PARK">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">LANCING PARK</span></h2>
<p>Most of Lancing during 19th Century was used for market gardening, but the area where Lancing Park is situated was described in 1845 as “enclosed pasture land of the Lloyd Estate” The Lloyd family had become owners of Lancing Manor in North Lancing and its surrounding lands in 1770. The reason for the lack of market gardening in this area was due to the close proximity of the sea. The area was originally below sea level until the 12th Centaury. When the sea finally recede it left a behind a very wind swept, salty marshland which was totally unsuitable for market garden crops because of the high salt content in the ground, despite being gradually drained over the following centuries. The only purpose the Lancing Park area could be put too was for all aspects of horse rearing, training, dealing and recreation. Even an Inn was built, called “The Horseshoes” in the south-east corner of the area for the benefit of visitors to South Lancing. This building still exists today as a Public House called “The Three Horseshoes”. Also in 1845 a famous horse was reared in this area. Although the real colour and name of the horse are uncertain this animal became immortalized in a story book by Anna Sewell called “Black Beauty”. Then at the start of the 20th Century the area was subjected to great changes. The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway company was suffering from a chronic shortage of work space in its works on the side of a hill near Brighton station. So after much searching and negotiation the railway company purchased 137 Acres of the then called Carr-Lloyd Estate in South Lancing, including the Lancing Park area, initially for a railway wagon repair works, but by 1912 the works had been expanded to a carriage and wagon building works. However, only 66 Acres of the land was actually used as a railway works. In 1923 The L.B. &amp; S.C. Railway was absorbed into the new Southern Railway grouping and by 1928 it was realised that the unused railway land would never be needed by the new S.R. so the remaining 71 Acres of land was offered for sale. The portion of the surplus land that was between the works and the sea front coast road (now the A259), attracted the attention of a Mr. Parker Joseph Reynolds who was better known as the comic variety actor Charles Austin. Charles Austin was famous for his comic micky takes of everything and anything to do with the establishment. His most famous sketch was his portrayal of a half witted policeman called P.C. Parker. He would most certainly be considered very politically and socially incorrect now! Charlie or Chas as he was more often called by his fellow entertainers and friends purchased this area, approximately 10 Acres, initially to build a permanent sea-side home for himself and his wife Ruby. The purchase of such a large parcel of land was quite easy for him because he was a very wealthy man earning around £300 a month for his performances. When you compare this with £300 for a new brick built bungalow in the Lancing area during this period, it gives you a good idea of how wealthy he was. Though I suspect that if he hadn’t lost around £50 000 on the Gee-Gees at about this time, including an investment in a rather slow race horse called “Parker” which was quoted as “loitering with intent to finish a race” in the 1927 Derby, he may have purchased the entire 71 Acres. Charlie decided after purchasing the land to build his new home in the extreme western end of his estate, on the corner of the Lower Brighton Road and Western Road. The new house was appropriately called “Charleigh” and it became his permanent home until his death in January 1944. About 6 Acres at the eastern end of his estate he decided to devote to a holiday home project. It seems he was inspired by the great holiday/retirement home development that had been going on since 1914 at Peacehaven to the East of Brighton. He called his development “Lancing Park” probably because he wanted to continue the idea of a recreational place with both the locals, visitors and of course purchasers. Being a comic mimic to the core, and probably aided and abetted by his entertainment friends like Bud Flanagan, Chesney Allen and “Monsewer” Eddie Gray, members of The Crazy Gang, who either visited him or lived nearby, he erected two pillars at the eastern entrance to his estate, because not only did Peacehaven have ornamental pillars on it’s boundary, but nearby Brighton in 1928 was celebrating it’s very enlarged “Borough” status by erecting two stone gate pillars where it’s new Northern boundary crosses the A23 between Patcham and Pyecombe. Both the Peacehaven and the Brighton pillars are still standing. The Brighton pillars are still referred to today as “The Pylons”. Charles Austin advertised his “Lancing Park” project as building plots “built to order”. In1929 only nine plots were sold, but by 1936 this had grown to 37 plots, not far off the final figure of 47, all of which still exist in some form or other. He later sold a further two Acres at the rear of his house for building plots, but as this area was not connected to Lancing Park, he had a new access road built from the main coast road. As he was brought up, did most of his performances and acquired his fame in London, he named this new road “West End Way”. Perhaps Chas Austin’s biggest claim to fame is that he was elected “King Rat” of the Grand Order of Water Rats no fewer than six times (1912,1913,1918,1927,1928 and 1932). A record that still stands today with the G.O.W.R.. The Grand Order of Water Rats is a very exclusive fraternity of show-business performers who meet regularly in the spirit of comradeship and raise money for deserving causes. Chas or Charlie Austin was so well known in South Lancing for this achievement that the locals referred to him as “Ratty”. After Charlie’s death, the house “Charleigh” became a Guesthouse for many years until its demolition in the early 1970’s to make way for a block of flats.</p>

<p>The Short Bus Window Lickers are a <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore.html" title="Hardcore">hardcore</a> <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk.html" title="Punk">punk</a> band from <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>.</p>
<p>The Short Bus Window Lickers started up in 2000 with Mark on vocals, P-tex on bass, Eric on drums and Joseber and Pumuki on guitar. They played a couple of gigs, but as various members disappeared mysteriously off the scene, either as a result of emigration, illness or chronic constipation, had to lay dormant for about a year untill June 2002 when Mark and P-tex decided to get the band back together. They found Robin to play guitar and after tryin out several drummers, found Darragh from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Restarts_873b.html" title="The Restarts">the Restarts</a> to play drums.</p>
<p>The first gig with this new line-up was opening the South London Punx Picnic 2003. There have been loadsa Lickers-gigs since then, mostly in London at benefits, squats, pubs and clubs and in February 2004 St. Vicky, their first album was recorded and the Window Lickers had become well known in the London punkscene.</p>
<p>Unfortunately in May 2004 Darragh had to call it a day cos of his busy life as a student and played his last gig with them on May 28th at the 1st Hackney Punx Olympix at the (late) Poison Club, which by then had almost become a second home for the band.</p>
<p>After trying out several drummers and even doing a gig with Jay (UK Subs, The Business) as a stand-in they finally found the right man: Szmalec from the Polish band Afroporno.</p>
<p>The Short Bus Window Lickers haven't stopped gigging since with bands like the <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varukers.html" title="Varukers">Varukers</a>, Icons Of Filth, Sick On The Bus, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discharge.html" title="Discharge">Discharge</a>, the UK Subs, <a href="../../../r/i/o/Riot_Clone_91ca.html" title="Riot/Clone">Riot/Clone</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disorder.html" title="Disorder">Disorder</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broken_Bones_64a0.html" title="Broken Bones">Broken Bones</a>, Dread Messiah, Inner Terrestrials and P.A.I.N. to name a few.</p>
<p>In January 2006 the Short Bus Window Lickers independently released their first full length album called '6 For A Fiver' on CD and a vinyl version will be available later this year on Brain Damage/Mass Productions and in March this year they went on their first European Tour, the '6 For A Fiver' tour to promote their new album, playing gigs in Holland, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Belgium and France and in September they played in Mallorca.</p>

<p>TEFRA (Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act) of 1982</p>
<p>Enacted by President Reagan in 1982, TEFRA raised taxes by $37.5 billion per year (over $100 billion in today's dollars)--almost 1 percent of the GDP--making it the largest peacetime tax increase in American history.</p>
<p>The International Reciprocal Trade Association lobbied for TEFRA in 1979 to bring commercial bartering up to the standard of recognized commerce by having barter commerce taxed like other forms of commerce.</p>
<p>As a result of TEFRA, certain barter exchanges are recognizable on IRS form 1099B.</p>
<p>TEFRA increased tax receipts, although without increasing tax rates, by removing some business tax breaks.</p>

<p>Carolus Hacquart was a composer, born in 1640 in Bruges, Belgium. Around 1670 he moved to the northern Netherlands, where he became active as a composer, teacher and an organisor of concerts. Carolus Hacquart is the composer of the first opera in the dutch language 'De triomferende min'. Unfortunately most of the music of this opera has to be considered lost.</p>
<p>Three other publications of his music have survived, his opus primum: Cantiones Sacrae (religious pieces for vocal soloists, choir and instrumentalists), his opus secundum: Harmonia Parnassia (collection of 10 sonatas for two or thee violins and basso continuo), and his third opus: Chelys (sonatas for the viola da gamba, probably originally with basso continuo, also very well playable without)</p>
<p>These works are preserved in the library of Durham Cathedral, GB</p>

<p>Ambulacral is typically used in context of anatomical parts of of the phylum Echinodermata or class Asteroidea. Echinoderms can have ambulacral parts that include ossicles, plates, spines, and suckers. For example, sea stars or "star fish" have an ambulacral groove on their oral side (underside). This ambulacral groove extends from the mouth to the end of each ray or arm. Each groove of each arm in turn has four rows of hollow tube feet that can be extended or withdrawn. Opposite the ambulacral groove is an ambulacral ridge on the aboral side of each ray.</p>
