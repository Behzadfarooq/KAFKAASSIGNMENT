<li><b>Keep</b> What do you mean <i>that kind</i> of encyclopedia? Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia and the insensitivity to this is of great concern. These pages were created out of respect for both living and fallen warriors and your wish to delete them concerns me. You have made this a political issue, which it is clearly not. A few rogue Vandalizer admins who are trying to shape Wikipedia in their own image should not be able to wield power in such a negative way. Who is watching the admins? Have their backgrounds been checked to ensure they aren't prone to disrupting the ongoing development of a true open-source encyclopedia. Seems some users and admins here have been abusing their power beyond reason. As you can clearly see by this category here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Canadian_law_enforcement_officers" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Canadian_law_enforcement_officers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Canadian_law_enforcement_officers</a> , there are others who are working to provide information on both living and deceased law enforcement officers. Please do not delete pages before you are aware of the full political implications of such an action.<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelebritySecurity_9407.html" title="User:CelebritySecurity">CelebritySecurity</a> 17:56, 24 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: A police officer doesn't deserve an article just because they exist(ed); out of the four articles filed directly in the category you note rather than subcategories, only one, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Gordon_Cheverie_d667.html" title="David Gordon Cheverie">David Gordon Cheverie</a>, strikes me as a person clearly deserving of an article. And even then, he's notable because he was a recipient of the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross_of_Valour_314a.html" title="Cross of Valour">Cross of Valour</a>. "Killed in the line of duty" does not make a police officer automatically notable -- that argument only holds water if the officer being killed in the line of duty somehow had lasting real world effects, such as inspiring a major new federal law that stiffened the penalties for killing a police officer. Valérie Gignac, for example, simply does not merit an article at this point. The RCMP officers killed in Mayercourt back in March don't merit individual articles (although the <i>incident</i> probably deserves one.) Wikipedia is not a memorial; it's an encyclopedia with specific standards for what belongs or doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 05:51, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> To those that suggest these articles and infobox be deleted, Shouldn't you begin the process of deleting all similar law enforcement officers from this website? Also, please note that the infobox has been written with proper code designating whether or not the officer is deceased or not. It is not intended as a memorial, merely something written to acknowledge the contributions of law enforcement officers, much in the same way celebrities and politicians are listed on this same website. <small>(this unmarked comment was made by <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelebritySecurity_9407.html" title="User:CelebritySecurity">CelebritySecurity</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I don't see why we couldn't keep such articles as this, it's not like we've got a lack of space on Wikipedia. I think there's a bit too much apetite for deletion around here.

<li><b>Keep</b> for substantial national media coverage of this specific person. Also, <a href="http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=fb6da79c-a103-4b01-b62b-593524fb276c&amp;k=84693" class="external text" title="http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=fb6da79c-a103-4b01-b62b-593524fb276c&amp;k=84693" rel="nofollow">this article</a> shows there is some material about his life preceeding his activities in Haiti. Also, in googling for this person, if you exclude the word Haiti, you get a number of articles written in the 1990s about his work related to international drug trafficking, which writers found signficant long *before* his death (the article I linked to was written after his death, but others were written before). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 18:03, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I cannot understand why this article would be deleted. The death of this peacekeeper in Haiti was widely covered in all major Canadian media as a top story. To Canadian readers, the topic is quite relevant. If this is not relevant then most of Wikipedia would also need to be deleted. I thought the point of wikipedia was that it would be more broad than the typical bound encyclopedia. There are a great many people who would benefit from this entry. I am a little skeptical about the political motivation for deleting this. The article itself does not seem to take a position on Canadian peacekeepers in Haiti but it is plausible that someone opposed to such a mission would be unsympathetic to the death of this man. It is an important fact to note.Someguy963 01:51, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comments</b>. As a member of a family with people in uniform, I feel I should step up and explain a couple of things here. I have no political agenda to which Someguy963 referred. We need to start with the premise of <i>my</i> vote: <i>Wikipedia is not a memorial</i>. This rule is put into place so we don't have thousands of articles for people who were murdered, died of accidents, or died while in the service in a country's military. My vote is <b>not</b> a lack of sympathy on my part - far from it as several relatives of mine have died in the service of their/my country. So, let's put that argument aside once and for all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While that premise holds, it doesn't mean that the deaths of specific military personnel cannot be mentioned in Wikipedia. It means that: A) if their activites prior to their death <b>set them apart from other military personnel who died in service</b> to make them sufficiently notable while alive, they should have an article; and B) if the activity that caused their deaths is itself sufficiently notable, then the person should be mentioned in the context of that activity and in the article discussing the activity, not necessarily in a new article for that person. When I look at these articles, I ask myself, "Which is the bigger story? Was this part of a bigger picture?" and go from there as to the proper location of the article in question.</dd>
<dd>In addition, references and mention of instances of A or B above must be made <i><b>in the article itself</b></i>, not here as the AfD reviews primarily the article, and many people participating in an AfD judge the article as written first, last, and foremost. Those who are saying there are additional references (and information) to further justify keeping the article should add them to the article NOW, before close of the AfD. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 12:12, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
