<p>We are a privately-funded business based in Silicon Valley, dedicated to helping local businesses get more customers quickly, easily and cost effectively. We know you've got a business to run, and you can't spare millions of dollars and extra employees to manage your advertising and marketing efforts. We don't think you should have to. Instead, let us help you.</p>
<p>As the Internet has matured, more information is available locally, and consumers are searching for it. Technological advances have transformed the World Wide Web from an impersonal galaxy into the Local Internet, a resource for information pertinent to your life and a vehicle for communicating and collaborating with your neighbors and friends. This evolution of the web into the Local Internet makes it possible for you to target and advertise directly to potential local customers. MerchantCircle helps you tap into the power of the Local Internet to reach these potential local customers, who are online right now, searching for deals, recommendations and information in your community. We created simple tools to help you to promote your products and services, and designed our site to get your business listed higher in search engine results on engines such as Google and Yahoo.</p>
<p>Many local businesses have been stumped when deciding where and how to advertise, and end up sinking their budget into placing ads in the yellow pages. We think the yellow pages are feeble relics of the rotary phone era, ineffective and unworthy of their outrageous prices. Consumers in the information age are much more likely to search for you on the web, and want more information about your offering than you can cram into one little static phone ad.

<p>Since ancient time man has used the science of physics to create instruments and music, and as early as the 14th century there has been written mention of guitar like instruments . Although the inventors of the guitar may not have known it, the reason why the guitar was able to create the sound and music was entirely because of the science of physics. In order to achieve the specific sounds required for music, guitars have various components that enable them to produce these specialized sounds. The top of the guitar is the called the headstock, and is attached to the neck of the guitar. On the headstock there are machine heads, also known as tuning keys, to which the strings are wound around. At the point where the headstock meets the neck of the guitar, there is a small piece of material (plastic, bone, etc.) called the nut, in which small grooves are carved in order to guide the strings up to the machine heads. The neck of the guitar runs all the way down the guitar until it meets the body of the guitar at the upper bout, and it contains the fret board of the guitar, containing the frets (metal strips) embedded in it at points along the length of th neck that divide it mathematically. The body of the guitar is a resonating chamber which projects the vibrations of the body through the hole cut on the top of it, called the sound hole.The strings of the guitar run from the machine heads, over the nut, down the neck, body, and the sound hole, and are anchored at a piece of hardware attached to the body of the guitar, called the bridge.</p>
<p>It is these components of the guitar that allow it to produce the specific sounds required to create music. In order to understand music and how guitars produce it, it is first required to understand the physics of sound. Sound is created when a wave motion is set up in the air by the vibration of material bodies . What this means is that when material bodies vibrate, they create a vibrational energy that travels in pressure waves through a medium . All forms of instruments create vibrations in order to produce sound waves that make the music, which is essentially organized sound , and guitars are a type of instrument called a string instrument, meaning that they create their sound through the vibrations of a string. On the guitar, the string that vibrates to produce the sound is fixed at both ends, is elastic, and therefore can vibrate . When the guitar string is either strummed or picked, the string of the guitar begins to vibrate, and since these vibrations are waves, they begin to travel in both directions along the string and are reflected back at each fixed end. These waves will not cancel each other out as they reflect back upon themselves, but instead form a standing wave, which is a situation where crests and troughs remain at fixed positions in the medium while the wave as a whole increases and decreases together . The guitar strings act in such a way that they can satisfy the relationship between wavelength and frequency, represented by the equation v = fλ . This equation can be rearranged to f = v/λ, meaning that the frequency of a wave (f) is dependent on both the speed of the wave (v), and the length of the wave (λ). As well, the speed of the wave traveling on the guitar string depends on the tension of the string (T) and the linear mass density of the string (µ), in fact, “the root frequency for a string is proportional to the square root of the tension, inversely proportional to its length, and inversely proportional to the square root of its linear mass density” . What this means is that waves will travel faster when the tension of the string is higher, which in turn means that the frequency will be higher as the tension is increased (f = v/λ, the v is increasing).</p>
<p>This also means that waves will travel slower on a more massive string, since if the mass is increased, the v will decrease. This relationship between the speed, tension, and mass density can be arranged into a new equation, v = T/µ.</p>
<p>When a standing wave vibrates, a combination of reflection and interference occur in such a way that the reflected waves interfere constructively with the incident waves, because the waves have changed phase when they reflected from one of the fixed ends. When this is happening, the medium appears to vibrate in segments, and it is not apparent that the whole wave is traveling. Since a guitar string has two fixed ends, it will act like a standing wave, and therefore when agitated by either being plucked or strummed; the wavelength that the string can produce is twice the length of the string . Since all the strings are the same length, all six strings on the guitar use the same range of wavelengths, however, in order to produce different sounds waves required to create music, different amounts of air must be displaced at different frequencies, meaning the guitar strings must be able to vibrate at different frequencies to do so . In order to create different frequencies on the guitar, one of the factors of the equation f = v/λ must be changed, so either the speed, or the length of the wave must be changed. Since the strings on the guitar are attached to the nut and bridge, and when played open have a fixed wavelength, the only other factor that can be changed to produce a different frequency is the speed of the wave, ‘v’. Since the speed of the speed of the wave is affected by the tension on the string and the mass density (v = T/µ.), either the tension of the string, or the mass density must be changed in order to create a different frequency. However, if the frequency of the vibration of the guitar string was only changed by varying the tension, then the high strings (needing a higher frequency) would have to be wound tight since the tension required would be fairly high, while the lower strings (needing a lower frequency) would require much less tension, and subsequently be very loose . Since it would be very difficult to play a guitar where the high strings are tight and the low strings loose, guitars are constructed in such a way that the tension of the strings should be equal. Since the only other factor that can be changed while playing all the strings open is the mass density, guitars are constructed so that the tension of the strings, as well as the mass density are increased together. As a result, guitar strings are made so that the higher the frequency required from the open string, the less mass density the string will have, since higher frequencies require a higher tension, and the less mass they have the less tension is needed to achieve the same frequency . Subsequently, the lower the frequency of a string required is, the higher the mass density is, since a lower tension produces lower frequencies, and the more mass the strings contain, the more tension is required. Since in standard tuning the strings on the guitar are a perfect fourth apart on pitch (frequency), except between G and B, the amount that the mass density must be increased so that the tension remains constant can be calculated .</p>
<p>However, music is complex, and many frequencies are required in order to create the correct sound waves that will produce the music. This poses a problem, because although the 6 strings of the guitar are set up in a playing friendly-manner, at this point each individual string can only produce one frequency, and since no different part of the equation to f = v/λ is being changed when an open string is played, which is not nearly enough variation to produce complex music. Therefore, one part of the equation to f = v/λ must be changed while playing a guitar in order to produce a different frequency. However, the speed of the wave cannot be changed, since the two factors (v = T/µ.), the tension of the string and the mass density are not changed significantly enough while playing to affect the speed of the wave enough to change the frequency. As a result, on the neck of the guitar there are little strips of metal called frets, whose function is to decrease the length of the string, which will cause a higher frequency. The way this works is that when the string is pressed down near a fret, the length of the string is shortened, since it no longer stretches from the nut to the bridge, rather from the bridge to the fret that the string is being held down on. What this does is that it decreases the length of the wave (λ) through decreasing the length of the medium (string), which consequently increases the frequency of the string . This way, on every string, the guitar player has an option of decreasing the length of the string in about 21 different ways , which will produce 21 different frequencies on each string. Since a guitar has six strings, and each string can have up to 21 frets, the notes that are now available for a guitar player to choose from are much larger, and since multiple strings can be played together, a guitar player now has many different frequencies to choose from in order to create music on a guitar.</p>
<p>However if a guitar string had only one single frequency that it vibrated on, the guitar would sound quite boring, and there would not be much difference between the guitar and other stringed instruments . The reason why guitars sound different than other stringed instruments is because of the different overtones, or harmonics dominant on a guitar . When a guitar string is either strummed or picked, the string begins to vibrate, and these vibrations are in the form of waves. However, the waves that are created by the vibrations of the string travel in both directions along the string, and continue forward until they are reflected off the fixed ends. When the waves are reflected, they change direction, and travel back the other way through the medium (the string). When the waves are traveling back through the string, they cause interference with the other waves traveling the string that were also caused by the vibration . The standing wave pattern is formed when there is perfectly timed interference of two waves passing through the same medium, to create a situation where the crests and troughs remain at fixed positions. On a guitar string, the waves that are reflected and are traveling in the opposite direction of the other waves on the string create a standing wave. Because of the interfering vibrations on a guitar string, standing wave patterns are created, meaning that there are some points along the string that appear to be standing still, and these points of no displacement are referred to as nodes. As well, there are other points along the medium that undergo vibrations between a large positive and large negative displacement, and are the points that undergo the maximum displacement during each vibrational cycle of the standing wave and are called antinodes. On the guitar string, a number of different patterns of standing waves may be produced, and each pattern will have different number of nodes and antinodes. Standing wave patterns can only be produced within the string of the guitar when it is vibrated at certain frequencies, however there are several frequencies with which the string can be vibrated to produce the different patterns of standing waves, each with a different number of nodes and antinodes. Every different frequency is associated with a different standing wave pattern, and they are referred to as harmonics. The most simple pattern of standing wave that can be produced is one at which the two nodes are at the fixed ends, which is the longest wavelength, and it is called the first harmonic, or fundamental harmonic. Since on a guitar string the waves keep on being reflected off the fixed ends and causing interference with each other, there are many different frequencies, but with any medium fixed at both ends, only certain sized waves can stand. This means that on a guitar string, only certain types of frequencies can stand, so we say that such a medium is tuned . Therefore, the strings on the guitar are tuned in such a way that the second pattern of the standing wave, or second harmonic, can only have half the wavelength and twice the frequency of the first harmonic . The second harmonic is also referred to as the first overtone, and it is these multiple overtones that we hear from the guitar string that make the guitar sound different that other instruments. Similarly, the third harmonic, or the third pattern possibility for the standing wave on a guitar, has one third the wavelength and three times the frequency when compared to the first harmonic and is called the second overtone. The rest of the harmonics follow the same pattern that the nth harmonic has 1/n wavelength and n times the frequency. It is the fundamental frequency (first harmonic) that determines the note that we hear, and the higher harmonics determine the timber. This means that the simplest standing wave pattern on the guitar string containing only two nodes and two antinodes, determines what musical note we hear, while the more complex standing wave patterns, the other harmonics, determine how that note sounds .</p>
<p>Sound is created when material vibrations cause changes in air pressure and create pressure waves. However, guitar strings are not large enough to move large enough amounts of air to create a sound loud enough to be easily heard by the human ear. Therefore, the body of an acoustic guitar is used to amplify the sounds the strings produce, and the body of the guitar is made up of different components that allow it to do so. The body of the guitar is basically a larger hollow space that is specially constructed to amplify the sound of the strings. The top plate of the body, the piece of wood located on the front of the body of the guitar, is constructed so that it can vibrate up and down relatively easily, and is usually made of light, springy wood, about 2.5 mm thick. Inside the actual body of the guitar there are series of braces that strengthen the plate and the keep the plate flat, despite the movement of the strings that will tend to make the bridge move, since it is attached to the top plate. On the opposite side of the guitar, there is the back plate that does not play as big a role in amplifying the sound, since it is held against the player's body and cannot vibrate much. The sides of the guitar also do not vibrate much in the direction perpendicular to their surface, so they also don’t radiate much sound.</p>
<p>When the strings are plucked or strummed, they begin to vibrate, and these vibrations in the form of waves are transmitted to the bridge of the guitar. Since the bridge is attached the top plate of the guitar, the top plate also begins to vibrate as a result of the vibrations of the string, via the bridge. If the string is vibrating at a high frequency, and subsequently the bridge is vibrating at a high frequency, most of the sound is radiated by the vibrations of the top plate. Since the top plate has a much larger surface area than the string, when the top plate vibrates as a result of the vibrations of the string, the volume of air the top plate is displacing is much larger than that of the string. Therefore, the pressure waves being produced by the top plate will be bigger, and the sound will be louder. For lower frequencies, the strings vibrations are transmitted via the bridge to the top plate, where it is then transmitted to the back plate, then reflected through the sound hole, which is constantly increasing the volume of the pressure waves being produced. In fact, it is not the vibrations of the guitar string that we hear when listening to a guitar, rather the amplification of the vibrations it produces through the body of the guitar.</p>
<p>Amazingly, when the guitar was first invented, the creators had no idea of the complex physics they were using. However, through experimentation and trial and error, the early inventors of the guitar produced an instrument that works on the basis of complex physics, and has become the most popular instrument in North America</p>

<p>The world's tallest man, Mohammad Alam Channa, has died from kidney failure in the United States. The 42-year-old farmer from Pakistan, described as the world's tallest man in the current edition of the Guinness Book of Records, measured 2.31 metres (more than seven feet seven inches).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Channa's height elevated him to celebrity status BBC correspondent Alastair Lawson said Mr Channa was treated as a novelty throughout his adult life in Pakistan.</p>
<p>"Everywhere he went in his home province of Sindh, he was followed by huge crowds," he said.</p>
<p>"Although he sometimes enjoyed the public interest, Mr Channa was occasionally irritated at being constantly treated as a curiosity.</p>
<p>"He complained that his celebrity status made it impossible for him to go anywhere in public without being pursued by large throngs of people."</p>
<p>His height also attracted the attention of the provincial government, which paid for him to have a specially-adapted car because Mr Channa found it too difficult to travel on public transport.</p>
<p>Mr Channa, who suffered from diabetes and high blood pressure, was often in ill health.</p>
<p>Three months ago he received financial help to go to America for treatment for numerous ailments, including kidney failure.</p>
<p>But he fell into a coma in New York in June, and died in hospital before doctors were able to operate on him.</p>
<p>He is survived by a wife and an eight-year-old son</p>

<p>Ehtesham reza 05:47, 21 June 2006 (UTC) A new university in Bangladesh does not attract its people particularly when there are twenty seven universities in the public sector and about fifty five in the private. But founding a science and technology university in a coastal terrain like Noakhali is significant. A newly accrued coastal system may render this university a versatile field station to study the pattern of changes in the seashore and to harness its opportunities.</p>
<p><br />
Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia laid the foundation stone of Noakhali Science and Technology University, NSTU, on 11 October 2003. It is the fourth in the row of twelve such universities the government has decided in 1997 to establish in the twelve erstwhile greater districts where there was no university. Academic activities have already started in the first three -- Patuakhali Science and Technology University, Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University at Dinajpur and Moulana Bhashani Science and Technology University at Tangail.</p>
<p>The aim of founding a science and technology university as defined in the project pro-forma is to mould merit into skilled work force and to develop centre of excellence to create and disseminate knowledge. Innovating new technologies and developing the old ones is also one of the R&amp;D objectives of these universities.</p>
<p><br />
Noakhali University of Science and Technology is being built at Sonapur eight kilometer south-west of Maijdee. It has a land area of 100 acres covering 93 Salla and 95 Noakhali Mouza. Its construction work was formally inaugurated on 24 March 2005. Law minister Barrister Moudud Ahmed graced the occasion as the chief guest. Education minister Dr. M Osman Farruk, local MP Mr. Md. Shahjahan, UGC chairman Prof. Dr. M Asaduzzaman and member Prof. Monirul Hoque attended as special guests.</p>
<p><br />
The site of the university is part of the land of a vast Char that stretches on the south to Char Jabbar, Char Bata, Char Wapda and Char Clark before it reaches the feebly flowing Bhulua river far beyond which lyes Hatiya and then the Nijhum Deep. Like the district itself Sonapur has a long history of erosion and accretion caused by the mighty Meghna on the west and the Bay of Bengal on the south.</p>
<p><br />
The landscape here is amazing particularly because of thin population and thin plantation. The area is not fertile as a result of salinity. Trees are recent and not grown as robust as they should be. Tall trees do not mark the horizon. Ponds appear in large numbers but most of them dry up during summer. Poor harvest and low vegetation is related to non-availability of nutrients in the sandy soil. Low or high tech methods including indigenous measures may turn these arid fields to rich farmlands. It will be appropriate for this university to watch these as also many other issues on academic foundations.</p>
<p><br />
Noakhali Science and Technology University will follow a semester system for its four-year undergraduate programme. A student would take 160-172 credit hours. The four-year degree will be completed in eight terms of twenty two weeks each. The first fifteen weeks will be engaged for lectures, lab or fieldworks with a one-week break in the middle. Week-16 and 17 will be used for student reading. Examinations will be held during the next two weeks and the results declared within the remaining three.</p>
<p>Term-1 or January Term will begin on 2 January and end up on 4 June and Term-2 or June Term will run from 5 June to 5 November. The eight-week long vacation will remain effective from 6 November to 1 January when the teachers and students will go on vacation. For a part of the community the first seven weeks of this vacation will be employed to run an intensive but Short Term in which students will repeat a failed course or take a course anew to remain in access of the 162 credit hours. Courses will be run in this Term on demand and supply basis. The number of classes per week for a course here will be doubled. Exams and results will be completed in the last week. During this long vacation admission for January Term will also be finalized.</p>
<p><br />
A course in a Term will be evaluated for 100 marks per credit hour. The evaluation components will be student attendance, 10 percent, quiz-assignment, 20 percent, mid term test after the term break, 20 percent and the term final 50 percent. Three to four books will be prescribed as the texts for any course although the teacher will follow one in Toto. The lecture schedule will show the length of materials to be covered in each lecture. A lecture not given due to a valid reason will be given on a weekend day to makeup. A three credit hour course will have three lectures, deliberations or lab exercises per week. The duration of a lab period will be twice as much of a lecture period and that for a fieldwork will be four times as much. Friday will be the weekly holiday.</p>
<p><br />
A number of subjects were named to be included in the inaugural list in which the prominent ones are Coastal Engineering and Management, Fisheries and Marine Science, Soil Science and Agro Technology, Forestry and Wood technology, Garments and Textile Technology, Computer Science &amp; Telecommunication Engineering, Pharmacy, Nursing Science, Leather and Footwear Technology, Management and Information System and Bachelor of Business Administration.</p>
<p><br />
The University will be a place of equal opportunity for all the students. They will choose and participate in activities to develop their cultural abilities and sportive feats. Job or studentship like teaching and research assistance or lab demonstration may be available for meritorious students. Initially the university will run a research centre to cover the research facilities for the departments. Adaptive research may be carried out through this centre based on some burning issues related to the coastal system.</p>
<p><br />
The first-phase construction work of the university under the supervision of Education Engineering Department is nearing completion at Sonapur. The BRTC of BUET has been appointed as the consultants. Precautionary measures against the calamites such as tidal surge, earthquake, Tsunami, cyclone, flood and salinity are being considered in depth. The Head of the Department of Architecture, BUET has developed a master plan having a profound theme and the thought of a modern university.</p>

<p>The BLU-82 [Bomb Live Unit-82] is a 15,000 pound bomb originally designed to clear helicopter landing zones in Vietnam. The warhead contains 12,600 pounds of GSX [Gelled Slurry Explosive] slurry. Gelled slurry explosives are prepared by forming a slurry of combinations of different ingredients. After this material has gelled, it is detonated by a high explosive booster. Slurry explosives are used in mining where formations to be fractured are wet, very dense, or strong. Slurries are very inexpensive compared with conventional military explosives and much easier to load into large casings. With slurry, filling a bomb is merely a matter of pouring the material into the casing. The slurry can be stored in non-explosive component form and turned into field-manufactured explosive as it is needed. Slurries, sometimes called water gels, contain ammonium nitrate partly in aqueous solution. Adding powdered aluminum as a sensitizer to slurries greatly increases the heat of explosion or the energy release. Aluminized slurries have been used in extremely hard rock with excellent results. The bomb is detonated a few feet above ground level by a 38-inch fuze extender, optimized to clear vegetation while creating no crater. Nicknamed "Big Blue 82", the weapon is frequently and incorrectly referred to as "Daisy Cutter", a term which more properly applies to the fuze assembly for above-ground bursts. In Vietnam it was used to clear helicopter landing zones about 250 feet in diameter. Also called the Daisy Cutter, the BLU-82/B was first used in Vietnam on 23 March 1970. Eleven BLU-82s were dropped during Desert Storm, all from Special Operations C-130s. The initial drops were intended to test the ability of the bomb to clear mines; no reliable bomb damage assessment exist on mine clearing effectiveness. Later, bombs were dropped as much for their psychological effect as for their destructive power.</p>

<p>Rakesh Chandra Adhikari alias RAKA is a new species of monkey that has been discovered in the jungles of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh in India. It had been discovered by the late Dr.Peter Scheldt of the Institute of Endangered and Dangerous Species. This species is known for its FEROCIOUS and very IRRITABLE nature.</p>
<p>The villagers of the otherwise quiet village of Nainital have talked about the "Muh Nochwa" alias the "Rakesh Chandra Adhikari" species for centuries. Even army was once called in to take care of the menace. A detailed exposition of this animal was documented by the late Dr.Peter. The late Dr. Peter is also believed to have died due to monkey attacks, on the accounts of the report given by his fellow professor Dr. Anand Mohan who survived the attack.</p>
<p>One of the latest sitings was reported in the Asia's biggest university - BHU, &amp; a special team was called in to take care of the matter. After a long &amp; fierse search it was finally trapped by Mr. N. S. Rajput, a lecturer of electronics department of IT BHU, and is now under observation in the the Institute of Endangered and Dangerous Species.</p>

<p>Tahn Nickson...</p>
<p>Tahn Nickson is of a Mongolian origin. He is the lord of one of the Durkanese Militia camps and commands it from Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. The military camp that he runs is for people of fine athleticsm, tested by tasks such as climbing the Gobi Desert sand dunes (40) in a minimum time of 15 minutes. These men, or even woman, are also of fine intellectual ability. They must sit an I.Q Test - scoring over 115, otherwise they're out! Tahn Nickson is soon to be made a god. The whole Mongolian population in it's entirety look up to him - therefore he'll be Tahn Nckson - God of the Infant Mortality Rate, which currently stands at 52.12 deaths/1,000 live births. His name in the Mongolian language means - Immortal, which contradicts his giveth of a God. It can also mean Man - translated to 'The Man' in english - in some of the many minor dialects withheld in Mongolia.</p>

<p><b>The main wormer in WormGuard Plus</b></p>
<p>The wormer in WormGuard is a concentrated form of FDA approved Food Grade Diatomaceous Earth which consist of tiny phytoplanktons mainly composed of amorphous hydrated silicates, of less than 1 %. When parasites come in contact with the tiny particles,there exoskeleton is pierced and the waxy fats and lipids leak from the cuticle of the insect resulting in fluid loss, dehydration and death and this is done naturally without chemicals.. The Chinese have used Diatomaceous Earth to rid animals of intestinal parasites for more than 4000 years. DE is approximately 3% magnesium, 86% silicon, 5% sodium, 2% iron and many other trace minerals such as titanium, boron, manganese, copper and zirconium. Home &gt; -- Supplement Dictionary -- &gt; Diatomaceous Earth / DE Diatomaceous Earth, or DE, is the fossilized remains of diatoms, which are hard shelled creatures found in marine and fresh waters. The shells are sharp-edged and tear insects up from the inside out until they are completely desiccated and therefore die. Humans, and animals such as cattle and pets, are large enough that they are not susceptible to the same damage as what is inflicted on insects. DE has been reported in the scientific literature to absorb methyl mercury, E. coli, endotoxins, viruses, including poliovirus, organophosphate pesticide residues, drug residues, and protein, perhaps even the proteinaceous toxins produced by some intestinal infections. DE is approximately 3% magnesium, 86% silicon, 5% sodium, 2% iron and many other trace minerals such as titanium, boron, manganese, copper and zirconium. Diatomaceous Earth Uses &amp; Scientific Evidence For after researching its properties, it is now being used in industrial filtration, toothpaste, women’s makeup, and as a way to de-tox the body, or cleanse the body of parasites. Diatomaceous Earth is a natural and safe way to kill parasites without chemicals. Diatomaceous Earth Dosage Information The best way to begin taking Diatomaceous Earth is 1 tablespoon daily in juice, water, or tea. Diatomaceous Earth Safety &amp; Interaction Information Diatomaceous Earth is general regarded as safe and non-toxic when taken in the recommended doses. Do not inhale this product. Diatomaceous Earth is a fine powdered dust that can cause eye and respiratory irritation. <a name="Sources_37" id="Sources_37"></a></p>

<p>The Promised Messiah and founder of the Jamaat Ahmadiyya Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani's blessed son, Hazrat Mirza Bashiruddin Mahmood Ahmad (The Khalifatul Masih II and Musleh Mauod) married Hazrat Syeda Maryam Begum on 7th February, 1924. She was the daughter of Hazrat Dr. Abdul Sattar Shah, scion of an eminent Syed family. In his Nikah sermon, Syed Sarwar Shah Sahib, a venerable companion of the Promised Messiah said, "I am now advanced in years and would soon pass away, But those who live would witness the advent of Servants of the faith born in this wedlock with a Syeda as occurred before. This is my resolute conviction."</p>
<p>And so this Servant of the faith was born on 18th December, 1928. He grew up righteousness and virtuous under the guidance of his illustrious father and devout mother and with divine blessings. Once, during his childhood, he was asked by a well-know Ahmadi Savant, Maulana Abdul Rahim Nayyer, "Which reward would you cherish most for doing good work?" "Allah - Only Allah" was the 10 year old's spontaneous answer.</p>
<p>The blessed personage was named Hazrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad. His erudition encompasses wide range of knowledge both spiritual and material. After graduation, he obtained the "Shahid" degree from Jamia Ahmadiyya (Theological Academy) at Rabwah. Then he studied in Europe for two and half years.</p>
<p>After completing his higher education, he dedicated his life to the service of faith. In October 1958, he was given charge of "Waqf-e-Jadid" the department for propagation of the highest grades of virtue and for fostering welfare of Ahmadis. From 1960 to 1969 he was vice-president and then president of Majlis Khuddam-ul-Ahmadiyya in which capacity he displayed remarkable qualities of leadership. From 1979 to 1982, he was president of Majlis Ansarullah. He served as Director of Fazl-e-Omar Foundation in the time of Hazrat Khalifatul Masih III. He was patron of the International Ahmadiyya Association of Architect and Engineers (IAAAE). Allah has bestowed upon him extraordinary talents of speech and writing. The books authored by him gave greatly enriched the repository of Ahmadiyya literature. Some of the well-known titles are: Biography of Hazrat Fazl-e-Omar, Murder in the name of Allah, Maudoodi Islam, What Ahmadiyyat gave to the world, and The Moral Excellence of the Holy Prophet in Wars.</p>
<p>Hazrat Hafiz Mirza Nasir, Khalifatul Masih III passed away on the 9th of June, 1982 and the following day Hazrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad Sahib was elected as Khalifatul Masih IV. Under his able guidance and with divine help, the Jamaat is making great strides. Progress and advancement is evident in every respect - geographically, historically, morally, and spiritually.</p>
<p>Allah says in the Holy Quran, "He indeed prospers who purifies it" 91:10. As such purification of soul is regarded the foremost guiding principle for the followers of Allah's prophets. Hazrat Khalifatul Masih IV has exhorted the Jamaat to achieve this end in various ways some of which are mentioned here.</p>
<p>Huzur emphasised on the importance of observing congregational Prayer Service. He dealt with this topic in three phases - in Friday Sermon of 1st April 1983 and in various sermons since 8th November 1985. On 17th June 1988, he once again stressed the need for establishing and strengthening communion with Allah through prayers. With Allah's grace, these dynamic exhortations are producing good results and the general improvement in moral and spiritual standards of the Jamaat in quite evident.</p>
<p>The so-called modern society has shattered the dignity of woman under the illusion of equality. The manner in which Islam has safeguarded the honour and esteem of woman in deprecated and subjected to misplaced criticism. In his question and answer session and Press Conferences, Huzur not only refuted this criticism, he also enunciated the true status of woman in Islam. He exhorted the Ahmadi women to observe "Purdah" strictly and to safeguard the Islamic values. In his sermon at the annual Ahmadiyya conference of 1982, he warned the Ahmadi women against the perils of western culture and conveyed to them the significance and importance of Islamic Purdah.</p>
<p>In consequence of this guidance, most of the Ahmadi ladies in western countries now meticulously observe Purdah.</p>
<p>Islam has propounded very noble teachings about family life and the Holy Prophet was a model of moral excellence in this respect. Some people do not follow this good example and transgress Quranic teachings. In his Friday Sermon of 14th February, 1986, Huzur exhorted the Ahmadis to completely root out this behaviour from their daily lives and foster graciousness between kindred and in-laws. In response many families have forsworn their past attitude.</p>
<p>The Ahmadis as a group stand out from others as comparatively free from the shackles of un-Islamic customs and superstitions. Shortcomings do arise at times and Huzur has particularly laid stress to eradicate them. In his sermons of 8th March, 1985 and 10th May, 1985, Huzur enjoined the Ahmadis to eschew giving dowry beyond means, exchanging gifts on New Year Day or other similar customs.</p>
<p>The Muslims celebrate Eid twice a year. The affluent generally move within the narrow confines of their own circle. In his Eid Sermon of 1983, Huzur asked the wealthy Ahmadis to go to the homes of their poor brethren to wish them happy Eid and offer them gifts. In compliance of this directive, the delectation of Eid in Ahmadi society has escalated significantly and this is the very substance and philosophy of Islamic festival of Eid.</p>
<p>To derive real profit from the teachings of Quran, one must be righteous. Allah says, "It is a guidance for the righteous." 2:3. In a gathering the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) pointed his finger towards his chest and said, "The righteousness should be here". Elucidating this Hadith, the Promised Messiah pronounced "Righteousness is a virtue that should be rooted in the heart." The Khalifatul Masih IV reflected elaborately on this topic in various sermons. The righteousness nourished with the awe and love of Allah is supreme and perpetual.</p>
<p>The preaching of Islam is obligatory for every Muslim. In the present age it is only the Ahmadiyya Movement which is actively engaged in this great effort and this fact is conceded by our antagonists also. Hazrat Khalifatul Masih IV has vastly expanded this programme of preaching and propagation. The Ahmadis by and large are now perceptive to this call and in addition there is a regular cadre of preachers. On the whole, the implementation of the programme in as many as 152 countries of the world.</p>
<p>In the era of the 4th Caliph, the Jamaat has come to exercise considerable influence winning more and more adherents, among them eminent personalities and tribal kings. In 1987, two such kings from Nigeria made the covenant and joined Jamaat. Thus the Promised Messiah's revelation, "Kings will seek blessings from thy clothes" found fulfilment once again. Huzur bestowed sacred relics of the Promised Messiah on these two kings when they presented themselves during the annual Ahmadiyya Conference in London in 1987.</p>
<p>The Promised Messiah was commissioned by God for rejuvenating Islam and disseminating the Holy Quran. During the time of the 2nd and 3rd Caliphs, translation of the Holy Quran was done in different languages. This work has been considerably accelerated now. Translations in fifty one languages of the world have been completed and published. Translation of 300 selected verses of the Quran in 118 languages of the world have been done. This monumental achievement has no parallel in the last 1400 years.</p>
<p>To achieve the highest grades of excellence and purification, spending in the cause of Allah is proclaimed a virtue of great merit subordinated only to the performance of prayer. It is a measure of the grand spiritual revolution brought about by the Promised Messiah that the Ahmadis are always prepared and eager to spend money in the cause of Allah. Their zeal for such voluntary sacrifices has been ever growing having greatly accelerated in the era of Hazrat Khalifatul Masih IV.</p>
<p>The annual budget of Jamaat has reached 1 billion mark. This figure represents the Obligatory Donations only. There are other categories like Tehrik-e-Jadid, Waqf-e-Jadid, Syedna Bilal Fund and Propagation of Quran Fund. Hazrat Khalifatul Masih IV journeys many countries each year. This is to oversee, streamline, extend and accelerate the multifarious activities of the Jamaat. The countries graced by him are Africa, East and West, Far East, Europe, America and Canada.</p>
<p>Only one and half month after becoming Khalifa, Huzur travelled to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Holland, UK and Australia. He inaugurated the "Basharat Mosque" the first ever to be built in Spain in 750 years. He addressed 18 press conferences wherein he provided erudite interpretation of Islamic teachings.</p>
<p>For seven weeks in 1983 (Aug. 22 - Oct. 14) he visited Singapore, Fiji, Australia and Sri Lanka. Laying the foundation stone of "Bait-ul-Huda" mosque and Mission House at Sydney was a momentous event of this tour. He also addressed a crowded press conference at the University of Canberra where he expounded the beauty of Islamic values. In December 1984, he undertook a tour of Holland, Germany and France. Plans for establishing big centres were discussed.</p>
<p>In September 1985, Huzur again visited European countries. New Missions in Holland, Belgium, West Germany were declared open. A sprawling and spacious centre, "Nasir Gardens" was inaugurated. Huzur travelled to seven European countries, opened five new missions and examined the prospects of establishing another four. In addition to question and answer sessions, four press conferences were addressed.</p>
<p>From Mid August to 7th October, 1986, Huzur visited Canada, Holland, West Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Spain where he met eminent personalities and also the press. During the tour, foundation stone of the first Ahmadiyya Mosque in Canada was laid.</p>
<p>The same year he graced the Annual Khuddam-ul-Ahmadiyya gathering in Frankfurt and also visited Belgium and Holland. In 1987, he travelled twice to European countries, USA and Canada. This was indeed a history making tour as many new Missions were inaugurated. He met a cross section of eminent persons and conveyed to them the Islamic teachings in a most persuasive way. He was hailed in many cities of America where the day was declared "Mirza Tahir Ahmad Day".</p>
<p>In January 1988, he set his foot in West Africa for the first time. This tour of six countries spanning over five weeks was highly successful. Tumultuous welcome greeted him everywhere, Gambia, Sierra-Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana and Nigeria. Various Presidents, Ministers, Parliamentarians and Paramount Chiefs met him. The President of Sierra Leone was with him for half an hour. He offered him the use of his personal helicopter and also assigned Police Personnel for his security. Throughout the country, the government made arrangements for his stay. Likewise the government of Liberia provided him use of two Chauffeur-driven cars as well as a Police Squad for security duty. There was meeting with the President and Vice President of Ghana. In almost all these countries, Radio and TV gave ample and appreciative coverage to Huzur's activities. Medical and educational institutions provided by the Movement for the benefit of the people were highly praised.</p>
<p>Returning from his tour, Huzur proclaimed:</p>
<p>"I perceive Light not Darkness in this continent. Many outsiders came here and exploited the people. The wealth of Africa was used elsewhere. Allah has inspired a plan in my mind that the Ahmadiyya Movement would procure funds elsewhere in the world but utilise here in Africa." Huzur created an exclusive department and charged it with fostering the renaissance and revival of the African people. He also urged Ahmadi doctors, teachers and specialists in other fields to offer themselves for service in Africa. Same year in March/April, Huzur visited Frankfurt and Glasgow. In August/September, he travelled to East Africa and Mauritius. This was the first time ever that an Ahmadi Khalifa had travelled to this part of the world. He visited Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania besides Mauritius. This was, again a very successful visit. Some mosques were inaugurated. Various Ahmadis got the opportunity of meeting with exalted personage and benefiting from his sublime discourses.</p>
<p>All these tours by the head of the world-wide Ahmadiyya Movement strengthened and uplifted the spirituality and created awakening among the Ahmadi masses. These were instrumental in dispelling the wrong notions about Islam held by a section of the educated classes. On occasions, the critics were confounded when Huzur expounded the correct interpretation of Islamic teachings and were impelled to embrace Islam there and then. In the course of his African tour, hundreds of persons got initiated in Ahmadiyyat.</p>
<p>Whenever any prophet of Allah comes, he and his followers are opposed and derided. It has been the same with Jamaat Ahmadiyya the followers of the Promised Messiah ever since its inception. In 1974 the government of Pakistan embarked on their persecution which reached most cruel dimensions with the promulgation of Zia-ul-Haq's Ordinance XX in 1984. The Ahmadis were tormented and persecuted continuously and life was made unbearable for them. But they displayed amazing steadfastness and spirit of sacrifice. In the face of such horrible oppression they stood firm like a rock. Their fearless resolve stems from their unshakeable faith that they hold fast the rope of Allah in the form of Khilafat. Under the guidance of Khilafat the machinations, intrigues and campaigns of derision are met with fortitude, highest grade of virtues and beneficence, reminiscent of the earliest Muslims.</p>
<p>The tortures perpetuated on peace loving Ahmadis grew ever harsher. Some two dozen Ahmadis are martyred. The Holy Founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement is subjected to slander and blasphemous allegations. Profane and foul language is used against other venerable persons of the Jamaat. Such dirty propaganda is spread throughout the world. The Jamaat does not posses enough resources to reply. Yet our Imam, Khalifatul Masih administered cogent refutations to the "White Paper" brought out by the government of Pakistan. This refutation was contained in a series of 18 booklets issued from London, and later published in one volume.</p>
<p>All efforts of their reformation having failed, all precepts fallen on deaf ears, warning of Divine punishments unheeded and having exhausted every other avenue, the Khalifatul Masih IV, on 10th June, 1988, now challenged all their TOP leaders for a "Mubahala". Let the matter be judged by Allah, The Best of Judges.</p>
<p>One month after the challenge of Mubahala, Maulavi Aslam Qureshi who had gone underground capriciously, reappeared. It had been alleged that he was abducted and then murdered, and the name of the Head of Ahmadiyya Community was maliciously implicated. Aslam Qureshi's appearance was an ignominious disgrace for the opponents.</p>
<p>The admonitory destruction of General Zia-ul-Haq on 17th August, 1988 (only nine weeks after the challenge of Mubahala) is the manifestation of another Grand Sign for the Truth of Ahmadiyyat.</p>
<p>Blessed are those who take heed of divine signs, recognise the Reformer of the Age and come together under the banner of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and those who are steadfast in their allegiance to the institution of Khilafat. May Allah shower His Blessings on them. Ameen!</p>

<p>The Zaku used by the Oldsmobile army was a magnificant triumph of Zeon engineering. It was hard work on the part of the Mars Zeon though. The design called for a whole new direction for the design. Insted of an improvement in weapon capacity, it was mainly upgraded in it's mobility, with an all new thruster system. It also featured newer armor, and an improved cockpit system to comply with new radar and sensor systems. The new version also featured a beam rifle for standard armament. Many more changes were also applied to update this 40-year old mobile suit. All the changes were applied by the Mars Zeon as a means to update thier units abilities due to the arrival of the new, lethal Miniature Mobile Suits being fielded by the EFF. The Mars Zeon's Zaku would see combat during the theft of the F90 Gundam from the Federation in UC.120. The newer Zaku units would perform well, however they would ultimatley be defeated.</p>

<p>Anthony Van Corlears, who died in 1664. left a packet of letter size paper, tied together with a red ribbon. The writing was obviously done with a quill type pen. The paper contained a draft of a story about Chief Croton. What Corlears wrote is as follows: The Kitchawanc Indians lived in an area now known as Croton-on-Hudson. Their village was located in Senasqua, now known as Croton Point. They had built a fort that was 1,200 feet long and 600 feet wide. Nearby they also had their burial grounds, and that area was considered sacred to them. The village of Croton-on-Hudsond derived it's name from one of the chiefs of these Indians. That would be Chief Kroten or Knoten, meaning the wind, for he could run like the wind. Ths name was later anglicized to Croton. Chief Croton was an able leader, and he dearly loved his people, as well as the environs of Croton. He particularly loved to gaze at the river, and watch the eagles circling over Buffalo Ridge (now called Hook mountain). He also loved to fish and hunt the abundant wildlilfe in the area. Unfortunately, other Indian tribes also wanted to control this area because of it's pleantiful bounty, and it's stratigic location. And even though most of the Indian tribes beloned to the Algonquin nation, such raids and warfare between them was not unusual. In was in one such raid, early one summer, that Chief Croton was killed. The Kitchawancs had been raided by the Siwanoy Indians from Connecticut, but their raid had failed.But while pursuing them Chief Croton fell in battle, and because he died near what is today Somers, he was not buried in his village. Shortly after his deathsome Indians, at Croton Point, began talking about seeing the spirit of Chief Croton wandering about the village at night. As more and more of the Kitchawancs claimed to see the ghost of Chief Croton, the new leader, Chief Ackimak, called a meeting of the council of elders to discuss the phennomenon. At the meeting, the medicine man agreed to go into a trance, and find out why the spirit of Chief Croton was so restless. After the appropriate three days of preparation had elapsed, and the correct ritual performed, the shaman was able to go into a trance and contact Chief Croton. The problem was simple, the spirit of Chief Croton could not rest because he missed his tribe, and the village. He wanted to be buried among his people. And that was the reason he roamed about Senasqu and Croton Point. The medicine man reported all of this to the tribal council, and he advised them that he knew of a ritual that would could solve the problem. The difficulty was that that this ritual could only be used once, and timing was all important. The ritual had to take place at night, when the full moon reached it's apogee, and the spirit in order to have eternal rest, had to be joined with the body when it was reburied; otherwise it would be locked into whatever place it happend to be at that moment, for all eternity. The kitchawanc council agreed that the ritual should be performed, and the appropriate arrangements were made. The Indian braves that were sent to retrive Chief Croton's body, however, ran into difficulties that delayed them. They had spotted a band of Siwanoys near Somers, and had to take a detour in order to get to the burial site. This delayed cost them several hours. Nevertheless, they did manage to retrieve the corpse, and head back to Croton as quickly as possible. The spirit of Chief Crotn followed their progress, but as they neared Croton the spirit raced ahead to the Indian cemetery. The moon, however, was reaching it's apogee, and the medicine man realized that the burial cortege would not reach the village in time. He sought an appropriate burial place, and found it in a small water filled grotto, near Collabaugh Pond. Here, wrapped in a deerskin shroud, and weighd down with heavy rocks, the body of Chief Croton was rebuired. The shaman called out to Chief Croton to quickly come to the grotto before the moon reached it's peak in th midnight sky. Chief Croton heard the medicine man's call, and realized that his wish to be buried in Croton Point was not to be. He took one last tour of his village,of Senasqua, the fort,and the river withs it's oyster beds, and sadly headed up the Indian path that ran along the Croton River. But he had waited too long, and as he headed up Mount Airy, the moon reached it's highest point, and Chief Croton's spirit was locked into a rock formation that he was passing throough. The medicine man, realized at once ... Corlear's story ended in mid sentence, and if it was ever completed it certainly was not in this batch of papers. Because of Chief Croton's wandering spirit the area around the old Indian burial ground is stilled called Haunted Hollow. The old Indian path along the Croton River is now route 129. Inbetween road markers 1019 and 1020, just west at the entrance of Crotn Gorge Park, one can see a natural rock wall on the north side, that is some twenty feet high. In late December or early January, when the ice begins to form over this rock wall, one can make out the outline of a face. It is the tear stained face of Chief Croton! Because of his lingering love of Croton, he was never to find eternal peace.</p>

<p>Who is Fouad Abou Nader? I am born in 1956 ( on June 27 ) in Baalbeck. I began my studies in a school beside my house in Beirut. Then, i joined Jamhour, from where I was gracefully returned into "terminale". So I made my applied sciences with the college Mont-La-Salle. Then I joined with the AUB. I spent there one year, during which I took part more in brawls and fact of the policy that medicine. Then the war started. So I was registered with the FFM. I obtained there my diploma of medicine in 1982.</p>
<p>And your past as resistant? I adhered to the Kataeb Party at the beginning of the years 1970. I especially worked within the framework of the militia of the party, and on the level of the organization of the students. - In 1974, he participated in his first fight against the Palestinians in Dekwaneh. - In the regular forces Kataeb, I formed part of the troop of the "bejin" from which result the majority from the persons in charge for the LF. From this troop, we were integrated into the military Council Kataeb. In 1980, the FL were created. Then we worked within this framework. I became chief of the operations - or what is called the third office - LF. In 1982, I became chief of staff and in 1984, commander-in-chief of the LF. Bachir Gemayel (1982 ): "if the LF should give a medal of honnor to one of his fighter, it would be Fouad Abou Nader". ( Al 3amal ). Fady Frem ( 1984 ): "Bachir wanted Fouad took the LF after me, now it is done". ( Al 3amal ). Fouad Abou Nader draw the LF red cross and founded the Saddem special force. He protected the lebanese muslims by hiding them in the free areas at the time of the israeli bombardment of West Beirut.</p>
<p>Is your promotion within the FL related to your relationship with the Gemayel family? It is certain that many people see the things thus. Those which do not know me affirm only if I were not the grandson of Pierre Gemayel, I would not be there, today. Since you raise this question, I will tell you a small history: before the war, I passed four to five years in the regular Forces kataeb. I was treated there like any other militiaman and even my closer friends were unaware of than I was the grandson of sheikh Pierre Gemayel. It is only during war the two year old, when I was wounded for the first time and that sheikh Pierre came to visit me to the hospital, that they learned my family tie with him. Not so much because of the visit in itself - sheikh Pierre returned visited regularly to all the casualties - but rather of a particular emotion in my mother... So I am very proud of being able to say that I created something by myself and that I climbed one by one levels, small combatant with the chief, discreetly and thanks to my capacities. However, I am very proud to belong to this family, that of sheikh Pierre, who learned to me much from things, in particular a certain ethics in the life. Fouad Abou Nader stayed President ( ra2is ) of the Command Council and Commander in chief ( ka2d el a3la ) of the Lebanese Forces and also, prominent member of the Kataeb political office until the end of the war despite the intifadas of 1985 and 1986 and the assassination attempt against him in 1986.</p>
<p>He refused the Tripartite accord in 1985 and the Taef accord in 1989. He supported Aoun’s war of liberation but refused to participate to the Aoun/Geagea's conflict in 1989/90 ( he searched to reconcile the both camps ) and refused the Fraternity accord with Syria in 1991. The last Lebanese Forces'military battle against Syria in 1990, was led by Abou Rabbih's men, under the Fouad Abou Nader's command. His companion, Elias el Zayek were killed in 1990 and after, Dany Chamoun with who, he formed the new Lebanese Front. He lived in Lebanon under occupation, dividing the daily of the Lebanese people. In 1994, when Samir Geagea was jailed ( juged coupable for the assassination of Elias el Zayek ), he refused to open the file about the assassination attempt against him.</p>
<p>His wife, Sandra, was wounded at the time of the attack which killed Rafic Hariri. He participed to the lebanese revolution in 2005 against Syria. He made reappear from its ashes the council of command of the Lebanese forces under the name of “Former Lebanese Forces” also known under the name of “Bachir Gemayel’s companions” and joined the new kataeb higher political council and his companions joined the kataeb political office but as opposants of Amine Gemayel, “supreme president” and Karim Pakradouni, “president” of the Kataeb Party. The current of Fouad Abou Nader in the party was known under the name of “social democratic” ( in french, démocrate social ). But in 2006, he decided to leave the kataeb party and create a new party.</p>

<p>Raul Gonzalez Blanco Raul Gonzalez Blanco was born on June 27th 1977 in Madrid, Spain. He was brought up in a modest quarter of the city, the colony of San Cristobal de los Angeles. Raul is a product of Atletico Madrid's youth system but was picked up by rivals Real during a financial slump at his former club. Real's coach Jorge Valdano introduced him to the starting lineup at 17, and the youngster did not disappoint scoring six goals in his first 11 games. In the summer of 1996, Spain's national coach Javier Clemente decided not to select Raul for Euro 96 because of his age. Raul's consistent scoring at the club level proved that he was the real deal and eventually earned him a spot as a striker in Spain's national side. At World Cup 98, Raul did little as his country failed to advance past the group stage, but his presence became more and more significant at Euro 2000 and World Cup 2002. On the club level, Raul's career has been far more productive. He helped with Real Madrid's journey to Champions League glory as they beat Juventus 1-0 at Amsterdam Arena during 1998. Two years later, Raul was once more on top of Europe as his team defeated Valencia. History repeated itself in 2002 as Real Madrid took the Champions League title once more with a 2-1 victory over Leverkusen. Raul shined throughout the tournament and opened the score of the final. Raul is a striker in the classical sense of the word. He can disappear for 80 minutes of playing time, just to come back and score two goals and turning the scoreboard upside down. Raul has good skills on the ball: he can shoot well, beat defenders, play the ball off quickly or hold possession. He is a versatile striker but needs to be fed and directed with quality midfield support. Raul scores most of his chances but rarely produces goals on his own.</p>

<p>The Odessa City Collectors' Society (OCCS) as self-dependent public organization of cultural and educational character exists since February 1972.</p>
<p>The origin of OCCS dates from the early history of Odessa. The Odessa Society of History and Antiquities (OSHA) founded in 1839 can be considered to be its forebear with good reason. Many founders and directors of OSHA and also curators of its museum were numismatists and collectors of antiquity: N.N. Murzakevich. E.R. Von Stern, A.L. Bertie-Delagard and many others. The member of this society, collector and numismatist P.O.Burachkov was an author of the fundamental Coins Catalogue of the Northern Black Sea Region .</p>
<p>In 1914 the Odessa Municipal Council (Duma) registered the regulations of the Odessa Society of the collectors of the Europe and America post stamps . In its structure were entered philatelists, numismatists, collectors of paper money, postcards and other directions of collectings .</p>
<p>In the pre-war period there were many known collectors in Odessa : numismatists V.V. Voskresensky and M.A. Zilberman, collector of paper money E.I. Detilot and others.</p>
<p>They were not included in the organization but had regular meetings mostly in the Alexandrovsky park .</p>
<p>In March, 1958, the Odessa Society of collectors (OSC) was organized with the regional and city organizations. The chairman of the regional organization became a known philatelist Kharitonov V.P.. The philatelic section as the most numerous played the main role in OSC. The number of the representatives of the other directions were thrice less .</p>
<p>In 1960'-1970' such collectors as numismatists Petridis V.L., Kotzievsky A.S. and Alekseev V.P., collector of paper money Makandarov G.I., collector of medals Korchenov V.K., collectors of postcards Tziporkis R.M. and Prikhotsky A.I. and many others were known not only in Odessa but also outside of it.</p>
<p>In February, 1972,ОSC was divided into two self-dependent public organizations : the Odessa Philatelic Society and the Odessa City Collectors' Society (ОCCS). From that time ОCCS has its own regulations and office , its own membership card and badge.</p>
<p>A seaman Repkin B.N. was the first chairman of ОCCS. Then the society was headed by Edidovich V.A. (1972-1982), Tarsis S.A. (1982-1991), Loboda P.G. (1991-present time).</p>
<p>In 1980'-1990' the most outstanding collectors in Odessa were numismatists Vayshenker V.I. and Shadrin B.S., collector of posrcards Drozdovskiy V.A., collector of paper money Bisselman Y.L.</p>
<p>The members of ОCCS made an important contribution to the cultural life of Odessa. They founded the number of new museums: Bleshunov A.V. - The Municipal Museum of Personal Collections, Beliy A.M. - The Museum of Chinaware in Ilichevsk, Tziporkis R.M. - the Museum "Old Odessa ", Loboda P.G. - The Odessa Numismatics Museum .</p>
<p>The Odessa City Collectors' Society is not only the oldest and largest in city public organization but also dynamically developing structure. At the beginning of 2006 there were more than 1500 members of Society.</p>

<p>Melvin Lerner, a social pyschologist, was the first psychologist to theorise and test the 'Just World Hypothesis' (also known as the 'Just World Belief'). He carried out a study in 1965 in which the participants were told that a fellow student of theirs had received a lottery win. His results showed that participants tended to perceive the lottery winner as harder working than other students who had lost the lottery.</p>
<p>This supported his 'Just World Hypothesis' in the respect that the participants had convinced themselves that the student had deserved the win due to being hard-workers, even if this was not the case. The hypothesis suggests that we naturally make the assumption that 'good people' deserve rewards and 'bad people' deserve their misfortunes. This could be due to early age encouragement to believe that hard work will be rewarded and that crime or misbehaviour will be punished.</p>

The explosion killed Ganimes. However, the amoeba survived, and infected another Ganimes and a giant turtle, Kamoebas. However, their weakness was supersonic waves, and a swarm of bats lead to a fight. Neither monster seemed to have a clear advantage over the other, but Ganimes managed to flip Kamoebas into a volcano. However, the mutated turtle grabbed hold of one of the lobsters limbs, and dragged them both in. Sources: Space Amoeba at Tohokingdom.com</p>

<p>Vignan Institute of Technology &amp; Science (VITS) is one of the three engineering institutes run by the well-known Vignan group of Guntur and was established in the year 1999. Vignan Engineering College, Vadlamudi, near Guntur was started in 1997 where as the Vignan Institute of Information Technology at Visakhapatnam came into existence from this academic year.</p>
<p>VITS is located at Vignan Hills, a sprinting 350 acres land with valleys and watersheds, with mango groves and greening around. It is situated at a distance of 35 kms. from Koti, Hyderabad. As citizens of the world, it is our duty to take care of our environment in the best way possible. The very atmosphere of Vignan is a case study in environmental awareness and protection. Students take an active part by observing nature's many moods, planning trees, and to pre-serve nature's fragile balance. Vignan believes it is important to nurture a serene and intellectually rich environment for students to learn. Lessons cease to be rituals and instead become lively and full and interesting focal points to study well. In such surroundings it becomes difficult to be detached and instead the whole scenario becomes extremely student friendly. Located in sprawling campus away from the city, landscaped to perfection with spacious, well-equipped and purpose-designed buildings, Vignan Institute of Technology &amp; Science as a dream world of academics. Learning is relaxing and enjoyable in such atmosphere, where both body and soul are taken care of by providing physical comforts and satisfying the intellectual curiosity.</p>
<p>Vignan's massive academic edifice is the precious brainchild of Dr. L. Rathaiah, a visionary educationist. He foresaw the rapid transformation of education into a highly professionalised and demanding environment. He developed a series of educational materials for public and competitive examinations and later established the Vignan Residential institutions in 1983. The success of Vignan led to the mushrooming of residential institutions all over Andhra Pradesh and gave a big boost to the educational standards, with students from Andhra Pradesh grabbing the lion's share of the ranks and seats in IITs, BITS, RECs and many more reputed National Institutions. Dr. L. Rathaiah believes in global competence and looks forward to the day when an Indian standard becomes a benchmark all over the globe in education. Modest to the core, he prefers his work to speak instead. With his visionary guidance, VITS has set its mission and motto.</p>

<p>TransButtah is an assumed fictional character who roams the internet, often joking around on several forums or websites. He was created on the <a href="http://shinobiman.proboards15.com" class="external text" title="http://shinobiman.proboards15.com" rel="nofollow">Sega8Bit Forum</a> almost two years ago. He was banned several times, but persuaded one of the local moderators to unban him. He currently runs his own blog of nonsense, located <a href="http://tbuttah.blogspot.com" class="external text" title="http://tbuttah.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>TransButtah was known to be a huge nuisance, but since a little less than a year ago, has toned it down alot. He does still post some weird things, though, but is now a respected member.</p>
<p>He has also been known to post fake pictures of video games he has made, such as "Sonic and Robotnik in Love" and "TransButtah in Miracle World".</p>

Some call it a band but i doubt wheter rother has ever been in a band. It is in fact rather unusual for ppl in the electro scene to be in a band! (Yes ppl lets face it, T.

<p>This is claimed to the the Best,hardest,longest &amp; most complex track of Tool's 2006 album 10,000 Days.Being similar in structure to the 'Third Eye ' of Aenima,in that it has no clear structure.There are 33 different Rhythm,key &amp; beat changes in this song..This song shows the complexity 'Tool' can bring about in their songs. The song starts of hard ,with vocals like a commanding whisper,but within 2-3 minutes songs settles &amp;'normal' vocals come into the front.Danny carey once again is brilliant.Near the end ,the guitars of Adam &amp; Justin shows what they can do.The best song for people who are used to the complex changes in 'Tool' songs &amp; like the songs to evolve.</p>

<p>Where can one begin, this fellow has the ego the size of a planet.</p>
<p>He has about as much mental ability as a limp noodle... and that’s when he’s trying. You know him when you meet him but the strong smell of tobacco and the smell of unwashed teenager. Also you will notice every non-emo female recoil from him merely at the mention of his name.</p>
<p>All you can do upon meeting him is ask him a simple question: "Would you like some nub-caek?"</p>
<p>He is also under the delusion that pirates own everything? No, ninj4s own and that’s a fact!</p>

<p>This is a traditional Irish folk song with lyrics by W. B. Yeats and set to the music by Herbert Hughes. The original old air was entitled "The Maids of Mourne Shore."</p>
<p>A sally is another name for a willow tree. In Ireland, towns or villages had sally gardens because the willows provided rods used to hold down the thatch of a thatched-roof house. The Sally Gardens referred to by Yeats were outside Sligo, Ireland but have long since disappeared due to development.</p>
<p>Due to the general abandonment of thatch being used as roofing material, in some rural areas one may find over-grown willow thickets. Since they are no longer regularly cut back for use in thatching, they have grown wild.</p>

<p>"Mafia Fraud" generally refers to a specific type of attack on electronically based identification/communication systems. The basic premise of the attack is to act as a proxy, intercepting messages to and from each participant, and then relaying the information to its intended recipient. In an unsecured/unencrypted environment, this would allow the attacker to inspect any information being exchanged between the parties involved.</p>

<p>Robin Crutchfield left a quiet, secluded childhood in Ohio and Pennsylvania, studying painting and sculpture, and moved to New York City in the early 1970’s to pursue an interest in performance art, symbolism, and tableau vivant.</p>
<p>After critically acclaimed works at several galleries including Stefan Ein’s 3 Mercer St. Store and Artist’s Space, he took up a keyboard and founded the minimal, no wave experimental noise band, DNA, with Arto Lindsay and Ikue Mori, which performed at Max’s Kansas City and CBGB’s during the birth of the indie music movement. With recordings to follow, including an Eno-produced album “No New York”, he left DNA less than a year later, to form a solo project of sorts, Dark Day, which made the most of collaboration with various artists and musicians, resulting in further recordings, and concerts where he could express his performance art ideas using dark, moody, psycho-social, symbolic elements.</p>
<p>In the ‘80s, he added writing to his accomplishments, self-publishing several short novels, inspired by the styles of Ted Geisel and Gertrude Stein, and did live performance readings at Club 57 St. Marks, and Joseph Papp’s Public Theater, as well as experimenting with filmmaking.</p>
<p>In the ‘90s, , loaning his music to a Belgian label, and filmmaker Errol Morris, for a short-lived television series, he returned to music playing with computer-based, multi-layered coglike solo composition, and independently releasing several collections.</p>
<p>While continuing his musical pursuits, at the turn of the century, he began delving deeper into the past, writing and publishing a series of faerie tales in miniature book format.</p>
<p>He has more or less retreated from technology of late, pursuing studies related to the faerie and wiccan realms, occult symbology, and the playing of primitive, spiritually evocative, instruments, an African drum, a variety of small harps, psalteries, thumb pianos and assorted percussion, having an affinity with the wyrd folk movement.</p>

<p>João António Ferreira Resende Alves(Born on 05-12-1952 in Albergaria-a-Velha) was an attacking midfielder who became an idol for clubs like Boavista, Benfica and Salamanca. He was nicknamed "Luvas Pretas"(Black Gloves) because he used to play always with black gloves, those gloves used to belong to his grandfather(former football player) who also were them when playing.He won Portuguese player of the year award in 1975 and best foreign player award in Spain (beating names like Kempes and Cruyff!). In International level, we won 36 caps for Portugal(14 by Boavista ,4 by Salamanca and 17 by Benfica) and scored 3 times.</p>
<p>Curious Note: The black gloves of João Alves are now part of SL Benfica Museum.</p>
