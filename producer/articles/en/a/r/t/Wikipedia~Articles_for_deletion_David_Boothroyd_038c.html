<p>I am nominating this article about <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">myself</a> for deletion as I don't think I make the notability criteria (although possibly verging on them). However I reserve the right to become notable in the future. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 22:02, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I don't really want to argue with you about your own notability, but running "the most comprehensive election results database in the United Kingdom" seems pretty notable. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> 22:45, 8 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That would (if true) make <i>the database</i> notable. Webmasters generally don't inherit the notability of the web sites that they run. It's usually what <i>else</i> the webmasters do that qualifies them for inclusion of a biography. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> picked upon the better point. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:55:14, 2005-08-09 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, published author. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 22:49, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Significant as politician and author. Commendably modest too. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 00:22, August 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, even taking the autobiography (see below) at face value, the subject is not unequivocally significant <i>as a politician</i>, being only a member of a local government council, articles upon which are oftentimes deleted here. (See <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_Local_politicians_0d4d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Local politicians">Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Local politicians</a> for a discussion.) Many editors set the bar at politicians elected at a national or state/province level, or widely infamous failures to be so elected. This person has mainly only been an <i>assistant to</i> such politicians. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:55:14, 2005-08-09 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable for modesty, at the very least. But, seriously, someone should check out some of the claims in the article sometime. Do Brits really use his website? <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 01:20, 9 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>All</i> of the claims made in this autobiographical article (see below) need checking out before it can be stated that this person satisfies the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria. This article <i>has no non-autobiographical sources</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:55:14, 2005-08-09 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. All schoo^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^HNon-notability not established by nominator. —<b>RaD Man</b> (<i>talk</i>) 05:41, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>"It is said that his birth was marked by earthquakes, tidal waves, tornadoes, firestorms, the explosion of three neighbouring stars, and, shortly afterwards, by the issuing of over six and three quarter million writs for damages from all of the major landowners in his Galactic sector. However, the only person by whom this is said is Beeblebrox himself, and there are several possible theories to explain this." — <i><a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitch-Hiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_55f3.html" title="Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy">Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></i>, Fit The Ninth.
<p>To ensure that this wasn't <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">autobiography</a>, with all of its ensuing verifiability perils, I checked the history, and was pleased to see my expectation confirmed that <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">User:dbiv</a> didn't write it ... <i>until</i> I saw that it was a straight word-for-word copy (done by 62.254.64.14 (<a href="../../../6/2/2E/User_talk%7E62.254.64.14.html" title="User talk:62.254.64.14">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.254.64.14_0dd7.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.254.64.14">contribs</a>)) of the autobiography on <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">dbiv</a>'s user page. If the only source of the information on a subject is the subject itself, albeit via a third party parroting it, it is suspect. If the subject really is a published author of a book with a wide audience, then he meets the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria. However, the article cites no sources and so far the <i>only</i> source that we have for this statement, and indeed for everything else in the article, is <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">dbiv</a>'s autobiography. The comments above are unwisely taking the article at face value. No matter how we might trust <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">User:dbiv</a> it is unwise to trust <i>any</i> autobiography. We don't trust the editors who write unsourced articles about themselves claiming that they are world reknowned academics, business leaders, coolest bitches on the block, and the like. We should not trust a straight copy of <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">User:dbiv</a> writing about himself on his user page.</p>
<p>Attempting independent verification, therefore, I find that the book, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1902301595</a>, exists, and <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBig_Jim_Fae_Scotland_3c0f.html" title="User talk:Big Jim Fae Scotland">has apparently been read by at least one other Wikipedia editor</a>. So it appears that yes, this is a published author who has written a book with an audience of 5,000 or more, and thus the WP:BIO criterion is satisfied. However, the article is in need of a <b>Complete Rewrite citing <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a></b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:55:14, 2005-08-09 (UTC)</p>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>--and perhaps dbiv could suggest some sources where we could verify this information? <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 14:55, August 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have already offered to do so on Talk:David Boothroyd. Incidentally I'm not the same David Boothroyd as wrote "The drive to productization" and works at the University of Kent at Canterbury, nor the same as is involved in the Bradford branch of the Campaign for Real Ale. I am not the Dave Boothroyd who wrote the syndicated article on the history of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Day_c52a.html" title="Joseph Day">Joseph Day</a>, the inventor of the two-stroke engine, although I am his son. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 15:02, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm inclined to trust the user's judgement of non-notability, especially given that the book in question only gets 34 displayed hits<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Politico%27s+Guide+to+the+History+of+British+Political+Parties%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=30&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Politico%27s+Guide+to+the+History+of+British+Political+Parties%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=30&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (several of which are Wikipedia and it's mirrors), doesn't appear to be available at major booksellers, and was published by an "online bookstore"<a href="http://www.politicos.co.uk/page.jsp?name=about" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.politicos.co.uk/page.jsp?name=about" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Also, the article appears to be a screen-scrape of the subject's User page, making it (admittedly unintentional) self-promotion. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 23:02, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, appears to be significantly notable within his field. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHall_Monitor_050f.html" title="User:Hall Monitor">Hall Monitor</a> 23:32, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> complete lack or rock and roll, and unimaginative family naming convention down the generations might lead to future namespace issues... On a more serious note, shame we can't just redirect articles on wikipedians to their User: pages, which generally do a better job of description and can be as POV and unverified as they like. Anyway, political researchers are not notable by default, nor are people who've published a book, there's many thousands of both. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippedmartin_fad3.html" title="User:Zippedmartin">zippedmartin</a> 10:49, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I agree with the above regarding redirecting to user pages, and also the intro by the subject himself concerning questionable notability. <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Boothroyd_fae0.html" title="Betty Boothroyd">Betty</a> perhaps, but not David. It is commendable that he elected himself for vfd. I am also not comfortable with the promotion of the election results web page, which could be best located elsewhere within wp if it is worthy. --81.79.16.164 13:31, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
