<li><b>Do not delete</b> Interesting that the Luas has only been going a few years and there is already a pub crawl based around it. Myspace is not as big in Ireland as the US. That there are only 14 members is as much a reflection on myspace.com's business plan as anything else. Sfegan 04:25, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do not delete</b> With alcohol being a contributing factor in approximately 33% of all road deaths in Ireland, surely we should be encouraging the use of public transport whilst drinking. I really can't understand why people are trying to remove this page and hence encourage the shameful practice of drink-driving.--Frank Xerox 11:19, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hmmm, two newly created users with their only contributions being to this one page... I went on a pub crawl with the TCD Food and Drink Society last September, should it get a page? After all, it's been going for longer than the Luas has. Nowhere near notable enough to get a page. Now, if you're going for ten years and you regularly cram up the Luas and get news coverage, then maybe. Also, Frank_Xerox, this page has nothing to do with drink-driving or promoting sensible drinking habits (as a matter of fact, isn't a pub crawl the opposite of sensible drinking?) <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupersheep_75b6.html" title="User:Supersheep">Supersheep</a> 13:26, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My dear mr. Sheep, if you are trying to imply that I simply created my account in order to post about a subject that I am interested in, then you'd be correct! I mean, I do look at Wikipedia a fair bit but I have far more fasciniating things to do with my time than to post my opinions on each and every subject that I happen to come across. Does this make my opinion about the DDLPC less valid than that of every randomer who has no interest in the subject whatsoever? In the future I'll be sure to nerd it up big time and post about every topic that has no relevance to me. Maybe then my opinions will be valid... As for creating a page for the TCD pub crawl, well why not! If you feel it was fun, then go ahead! It might be a good way to promote the pubcrawl... I find your criteria for what deserves a wikipedia article a little perculiar. Does something really need to be hugely successful and in the mainstream media to be considered a valid entity? Does the phrase "cult status" not mean anything to you? If you are unfamiliar with it, just look it up on Wikipedia. Doubtless there's an entry out there for it, just waiting to be commented on... The DDLPC is all about promoting both non sensible drinking and sensible non drink driving. I think at least one of those themes is valid and important to society and should not be suppressed... --Frank Xerox 19:20, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Humm.. if the criteria for an article to be listed on Wikipedia is that it refers to something that (a) has existed for 10 years, (b) regularly involves at least the number of people that would fit onto a modern, mid-sized metropolitan tram system and (c) gets a lot of main-stream media coverage, I fear that a lot of articles on Wikipedia must be scheduled for deletion. Actually, I have to wonder about the logistics of getting one LUAS full of people (358 including two wheelchairs on the green line according to the <a href="../../../l/u/a/LUAS_edcb.html" title="LUAS">LUAS</a> article) into the various pubs on the south side. It would take forever for them to all get their pints. One could only hope they were not doing rounds, 358 drinks in one night is more than anyone could advise. I am afraid I do not know anything about the TCD F&amp;D Soc pub-crawl, and so can't comment. I'd be interested in learning more about it, but doubt that I will be given the opportunity to do so from Wikipedia. If one of the officers of the society feels inclined to spend their time creating a page about it, I fear it will be deleted before I get a chance to see it. Sfegan 21:15, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> I don't understand why some individuals want this page to be deleted. Since the DDL has a following, is non-commercial and has been on the go for two years (with this years event scheduled for Dec. 27 I gather), I don't see the problem nor do I agree that it can be considered a vanity article. As other people have pointed out, the Luas itself is a new system and therefore, by definition, pub crawls which avail of it are also new. In fact, if one puruses the other articles on pub crawls, I think most would agree that the DDL is one of the more interesting crawls.

<li>It fails basic Wikipedia <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> standards.

<li><b>Do not delete</b> As an ex-pat living abroad, I find it hard to stay in touch with modern Irish transportation and social drinking trends. This article presents valuable information on both, exemplifies a popular Irish (international?) past-time and exhibits the creativity and wit with which Dubliners aproach the art of getting drunk. I have not participated in this particular pub crawl but, next December, when the Luas pulls into its stops, I'll be going out the front door with Daniel.

<li>This argument has nothing to do with Wikipedia inclusion standards (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>).

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think the present solution - a redirect with a short mention in the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Pub_crawl.html" title="Pub crawl">Pub crawl</a> article is the best. If DDL becomes more notable, then expand it into a full page. Also, Sfegan, Wikipedia has notability criteria, and this just doesn't fit them - I live in Ireland, and I've never heard of it. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupersheep_75b6.html" title="User:Supersheep">Supersheep</a> 09:44, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to short mention in Pub Crawl, failing that, <b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: If it lacks verifiability from reliable sources, there's no grounds to add it to another article, either. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 18:16, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: As an avid reader of Wikipedia and co-founder of the DDL, I thought that it would be appropriate to post an article about it here. Having not heard of most of the other pub crawls listed on the pub crawl page, I presumed that they, like the DDL, were not known about by the wider public. I am surprised to see that the DDL is the only one of them which has been singled out as not being notable enough. I agree that, since it is a young pub crawl, not many people have heard of it but, I don't think this makes it non-noteworthy. It is the only (that I know of) pub crawl on Dublin's Luas line, has a well-defined set of rules and, has a date on which it happens each year thus making it easily verifiable to any one who wishes to check. Shmree 23:25, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: If you feel that the other pub crawls included do not meet inclusion criteria (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, written in a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">not original research</a>), then you are more than welcome to nominate them for deletion. Also, the onus is on those editors who wish to <i>keep</i> the article to provide verifiability, especially since other editors have been unable to find information from any reliable sources (e.g., third-party mentions) about this pub crawl. <i>The burden of evidence lies with the editors who have made an edit or wish an edit to remain. Editors should therefore provide references. If an article topic has no reputable, reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic.</i> (per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 05:27, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
