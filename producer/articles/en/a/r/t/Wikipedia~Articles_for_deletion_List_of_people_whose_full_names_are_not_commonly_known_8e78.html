<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. Geez, people, let's take a solid look at this list. Think about it for several seconds, there are a great deal of people that their actual full names are not known.

<p><b>Delete</b> normally I'd PROD first but I see no way this article can ever be anything other that unsourced/original research/arguing the point. What third-party sources exist that prove the qualification inherent in the title? Remember Wikipedia is based on verfication not truth - while it might be self-evident to us all that Buzz Aldrin's first name is not commonly known (truth), how do we prove verfication for such a claim? <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 23:16, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep and rename</b> Couldn't this be transformed to become List of famous nicknames, or something like that? Then we would just have to verify that the nicknames are used publicly, and that the person is in some way notable. Regarding nom - it seems to me that the current claims could be verified if a news organization ever did a survey (my local news outlets often do surveys to 'prove' how bad our education system is!)... or is that a cop out? I agree with pruning some of the obvious 'Bobby'-type names. <a href="../../../9/9/o/User%7E99of9.html" title="User:99of9">99of9</a> 07:08, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The name's slightly off - I'd prefer something that suggests these people are more commonly known by these shorter names, even if their full names are known to some extent (example: Gaius Julius Caesar). Even so, this list is as useful as the other list of names here - I learned a couple things reading it myself. Re: Notability - anyone who isn't notable should not be on the list. Verification: the ratio between 11,100 g-hits for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Thomas+Sean+Connery%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Thomas+Sean+Connery%22" rel="nofollow">Thomas Sean Connery</a> and 2,430,000 g-hits for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Sean+Connery%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Sean+Connery%22" rel="nofollow">Sean Connery</a> makes it clear which name he is more commonly known by. (Applying those standards, some of the entries on the current list are questionable, but the list itself is valid.) <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 09:49, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But your methodology is original research. (yes I know we use g-hits ABOUT articles but not WITHIN articles) --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 10:30, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I wasn't suggesting that we add g-hits to the article text, just that we use it as a tool when assessing it. Right now, we can use g-hits to assess notability, without having to explicitly add "Joe Bloggs is notable because he has 50,000 g-hits" to an article. If the tool is accepted for use there, then it can also be used for other purposes.</dd>

<dd>I understand that we have to be careful to avoid <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, but there must be some point where consensus can be used to say that if someone is referred to as "Sean Connery" in published sources 220 more times than he is referred to as "Thomas Sean Connery", then his common name is, in fact, "Sean Connery". I'd suggest that such reasoning is already used implicitly on Wikipedia when dealing with abbreviated and stage names. "L. Ron Hubbard" gets 1,130,000 g-hits, versus 21,800 for "Lafayette Ronald Hubbard". And there are plenty of references in the <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._Ron_Hubbard_3ec8.html" title="L. Ron Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a> article which <i>use</i> this shorter name. But there is no reference there saying <i>why</i> that is used as his common name. Such a reference is unnecessary, and trying to guess why one name is preferred over another would be OR. All we are doing is stating what the most common name is. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 14:22, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> per nom.</s> <b>Rename</b> As the examples above illustrate, almost anyone could be on this list. L. Ron Hubbard, Sean Connery, etc. - what about John F. Kennedy, since most people include only his middle initial rather than full middle name? George W. Bush? Mel Gibson? (To my view, the only names that could <i>not</i> conceivably be on this list would be Lee Harvey Oswald and John Wilkes Booth.) When a list is that ill-defined, I think it should be deleted under WP:OR (because choosing the names for a list that could conceivably include anyone inherently involves original research and decision-making). If it's possible to re-define this list, great - but I don't see a way to do that, so I think it should be deleted. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 16:55, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I think you'll find none of the extra names you've mentioned above are on the list. I agree that listing names like those would be ridiculous, so you're right - the list does need to be redefined. What about changing the name to List of people whose first names are not commonly used? In fact, the intro paragraph already states that, but it could be clearer, so I've had a go at reworking it. How does the new version look to you? <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 00:11, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I definitely think that's better, and have amended my "vote" - there are examples (e.g. Alfonse Capone) on the list that don't meet that, but that can be cleaned up. I still worry that it <i>could</i> be an unmanageably long list - but think it's worth keeping and renaming to see if it can be managed (if not, then we can reconsider it). You didn't raise this, but I don't share the concerns of the nominator about verifying common usage of these names (with a few exceptions). I think that's do-able - my only worry is definability of the list. (I also think it might be worth considering whether to include both real and fictional people - but that doesn't weigh directly on this debate.) --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 00:45, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> A very useful list, but hard to keep straight what is what--needs to be redone, probably as a <b>table</b>.<a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 04:27, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. How does one determine commonly known? Verify this? Also, this information is already presumably contained on the articles about each of this people. If a user wishes to know the full name of a celeb that is where they will find it. To whom would it even occur that such a list exists? <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe">WJBscribe</a> 10:26, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Some ideas on verification, using both published works and community consensus, were already mentioned above. If you're worried about the title saying "commonly known", we could always change it to "commonly used", which is easier to verify. How do users find this list, you asked? If someone wants a list of names for whatever reason, I'm guessing they'd start at the "list of names" category and work from there. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 00:08, 6 December 2006 (UTC) 00:06, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, as doesn't provide user with anything new. A user wanting to read about <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yogi_Berra_6200.html" title="Yogi Berra">Yogi Berra</a> will simply type his name into the search box, and be taken there directly. Even if the user knows that Yogi Berra's first name isn't actually "Yogi" he's not going to try to find this page: he'll simply type <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berra.html" title="Berra">Berra</a>, then click the 'Search' button, and Yogi is second on the list. It's a mildly interesting list, but virtually impossible to maintain over time - very few article creators would be likely to know of its existence, so plenty of people would be missing from this list as biographies are added, and I can't imagine someone dedicated enough to watch and read every new biographical entry just to maintain this. It's not for us. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:28, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>By that reasoning, no list is safe, since people would only look up individual subjects directly. <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> makes it clear that lists are allowed on Wikipedia. I refer you to this section in the "Navigation" section:
<dl>
<dd>If the user has some general idea of what they are looking for but does not know the specific terminology, they would tend to use the lists of related topics (also called list of links to related articles).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Several people have commented that the information presented here is useful - this list provides an easy portal for people trying to find this information. Without this list, the only way to find the people listed would be to type in their name directly, but that's a catch-22. If I don't know that Yogi Berra isn't known by his first name, how am I supposed to type "Yogi Berra" into a search bar? <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 22:39, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
