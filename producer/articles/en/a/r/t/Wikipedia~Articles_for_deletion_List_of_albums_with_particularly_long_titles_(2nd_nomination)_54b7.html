<p>This Nintendude-esque list is an idiosyncratic non-topic. It can't possibly illustrate any articles (is anyone going to write long album titles?), it invites the addition of non-notable songs/albums/bands, and there's no trend that this article illustrates or could possibly illustrate. It's transient, the length of albums is not a significant subject of study, and the criteria cannot help but be entirely arbitrary.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: the length set to ten may be somewhat arbitrary, however looking at the length of the itself, as well as my own CD collection, it isn't as arbitrary as it seems. Most albums have relatively short titles of usually less than a couple of words. Therefore this list makes it an interesting list of exceptions Spearhead 19:39, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is <i>entirely</i> unencyclopaedic. It's also very subjective - people have different opinions about what constitutes a long album title. If this article is renamed to List of albums with titles containing more than ten words, we'll doubtless have lists of albums with titles less than ten words long, lists of titles of albums containing a certain number, lists of song titles with more than 10 words, and so on. My point is, do we really <i>need</i> all of that? It's completely unencyclopaedic and subjective in the first place, and the lists it's sure to spawn will become unmaintainable. I also don't think an album becomes notable simply because its title is long. Additionally, I doubt anyone will come to Wikipedia to search for a list of albums with titles containing ten or more words. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b>Srose</b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(talk)</font></a> 15:34, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Does not violate any policy: (i) WP:NOT does not mention trivia; (ii) list inclusion requirements are specific and highly discriminate - this article is not anywhere close to the defined clauses of WP:NOT indiscriminate collection of information. Those clauses are specific, not elastic. They can not encompass any topic that a given nominator finds objectionable on a given day; (iii) calling this an "idosyncratic non-topic" is a matter of opinion. It is belied by the long-standing interest in album/song names throughout pop music history, evidenced by the work of <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Hornby_a019.html" title="Nick Hornby">Nick Hornby</a>. This list examines an aspect of naming conventions in the field of recorded music.

<li>Is there long-standing interest in the subject of song name length? Would it ever be possible to write an article about song name length?

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I discuss WP:NOT in my original comment, but I would encourage you to review the indiscriminate collection of information section. There is no mention of "arbitrary" in WP:Not. The "indiscriminate" section of WP:NOT applies to seven types of articles; this is not one of them. There is also very long-standing interest in song titles (of which this clearly examines an aspect) and it should be eminently possible to write a more developed overview of the topic, perhaps as an introduction to the list. A possible starting point might be Charles Lindsay's 1928 article, <i>The Nomenclature of the Popular song</i> <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-1283(192806)3%3A5%3C369%3ATNOTPS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-N" class="external autonumber" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-1283(192806)3%3A5%3C369%3ATNOTPS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-N" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 14:47, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> IMO, all of these arbitrarily defined lists violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> as well. The idea that a list with "10 words in the title" is originial research on the part of the editor(s) who added this "criteria" as they have essentially used Wikipedia to corrolate or define "particularly long titles" with "10 Words". Unless one can provide some sort of external <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sourcing showing there is ample reason to believe that 10 words is a generally accepted cutoff where a song title becomes long. Otherwise, Wikipedia is simply allowing contributors to create lists based on their own personal, unverified criteria.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 11:44, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
