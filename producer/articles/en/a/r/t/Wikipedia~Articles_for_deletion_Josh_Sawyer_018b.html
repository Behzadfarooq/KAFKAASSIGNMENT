<li>Ok, folks, I realize that in the original article, I didn't post links to the game designs he is notable for working on. I welcome your comments in that regard.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have now included these links. He is, at the very least, notable to computer role playing gamers. Perhaps you are not included in that group of people, but if you look around Wikipedia, there is a page about almost every game he has worked on. To leave THOSE pages on Wikipedia, but to not include Josh Sawyer, is to have articles about the short stories of Ray Bradbury, but no Wikipedia entry about Ray Bradbury. I'm not saying that he's another Ray Bradbury - but he's worked on some of the better CRPG games that have come out in the last 5 years. Thank you. - Original Article Author.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - notable to whom? I performed the old google search on both "josh sawyer" and "je sawyer". Most of the hits meant for this Josh Sawyer come from computer gaming sites, which take the time to track his employement changes and report them as news. I've been surprised it has taken this long for someone to attempt an article for WP. For the purposes of disclosure, I was friends with Josh while we were both students at Lawrence University. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 00:36, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just to come to the defense of both Josh and the anonymous user, Josh would never disguise myself in order to write his own WP article.

<li><b>For The Love of Pete</b> Hillman, your 'resume cruft' theory is hilarious. Do you really think there are people out there who have written in their resume, "See my entry in Wikipedia", and that such an act would mean something to ANYONE doing hiring? Also, I had to look up the word <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruft.html" title="Cruft">cruft</a> in Wikipedia, during which time I was slightly embarassed for not knowing it, but also glad that I had found Wikipedia. I use it about every day to look up something I read online, or some vague cultural reference. It's easier and more concise than Google.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why am I posting with just my IP? I don't see how registering as a user isn't something Sawyer himself could do. I'm not going to take the time to register as I'll likely never have reason to post a Wikipedia entry again.</p>
<p>The full truth is, as I have written it, take it or leave it:</p>
<p>1) I saw Sawyer's name mentioned in an article about Black Isle Studios when I was looking back at the Baldur's Gate series in Wikipedia. 2) I remembered him from talk about the game Fallout 3 some time ago. 3) I wondered "Who is this Josh Sawyer? What is he up to today??" 4) I saw that he had no Wikipedia entry. 5) I then decided to make my first (and probably only, thanks to rude people like DanMS and Hillman) Wikipedia entry after googling him and finding quite a lot of info and interviews. 6) Sorry for trying to help expand the content of this site. 7) I'll go back to being a regular browser. You can proceed on Deleting or Keeping this article, I have made my best case with the Ray Bradbury analogy at the top of this page. Thank you for your time. 71.10.112.33 03:40, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The comparison to <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Bradbury_a4ab.html" title="Ray Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> is faulty, as Bradbury wrote books by himself. If I was part of the construction crew that built the Empire State Building, I would not be notable, even if the building is. The architect who designed it may be notable, tho. I can't tell very well where this guy fits in exactly, so no vote yet. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:26, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Answer to Comment</b>. Is it common for Wikipedians to judge entries that are not in their area of expertise/interest? If you don't know what a Lead Designer does for a video game... why are you voting Keep or Delete in this area at all?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Link about what a Game Designer does: <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/features/6129276/index.html?tag=boxcar_all_features_headline" class="external free" title="http://www.gamespot.com/features/6129276/index.html?tag=boxcar_all_features_headline" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamespot.com/features/6129276/index.html?tag=boxcar_all_features_headline</a><br />
<br />
I mean this in all seriousness, and not to offend you. Going with your Empire State Building example - I wouldn't go around the architecture areas of Wikipedia and judge whether certain designers and companies were or were not notable. I know nothing or architecture or building construction.<br />
As for your Empire State Building analogy... if building and architectural magazines were posting about your state and place of employment, and regularly running interviews with you, and people in web-site forums that didn't know you personally were asking about you and where you were working now ~ then I would conclude that you are a notable person "worthy" of a Wikipedia entry in regards to computer and console role playing video games. Try doing a google search for "JE Sawyer", "J.E. Sawyer" and "Josh Sawyer". You will find numerous interviews, forum discussions, and video game magazine articles. Mark aka Ye Olde Anonoymous Forum Poster who started this entire stupid thread, which I now regret. LOL. 71.10.112.33 23:42, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
