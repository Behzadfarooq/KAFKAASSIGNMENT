<li><b>Comment</b>Another ad hominem, however, since it didn't start the vfd, it shouldn't be grounds to close the vfd. This is not wishful thinking, you haven't read the article or you are not paying attention to reality. By the way, 3 different states put forth an effort to impeach.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Survived AfD before. Where else on Wikipedia do we report on impeachment movement activities?

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm not sure we can really say, in encyclopaedic terms, that there is a properly-formed "movement" for this. <a href="../../../z/a/x/User%7EZaxem_8e49.html" title="User:Zaxem">Zaxem</a> 02:48, 7 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please take the time to read the first sentence of the article. It says "for the purposes of this article". Please continue reading the article. A lot (a LOT) of time and effort has been put into this article by many many people to conform to Wikipedia standards. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 02:50, 7 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If an encyclopedia is going to report on a "movement", it should be a proper movement, not one that requires a "for the purposes of this article..." clarification. Otherwise any disparate belief held a by a few random people can be called a "movement". <a href="../../../z/a/x/User%7EZaxem_8e49.html" title="User:Zaxem">Zaxem</a> 03:10, 7 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> However, any of those alleged movements would lack millions of participants as compared to this movement, so your logic is rendered invalid. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 00:13, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>What do you mean "held a by a few random people". Polls have shown that a large portion of the U.S. population supports impeachment. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalphin_2def.html" title="User:Falphin">Falphin</a> 03:15, 7 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But does that mean they're involved in a "movement"? <a href="../../../z/a/x/User%7EZaxem_8e49.html" title="User:Zaxem">Zaxem</a> 03:17, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>There a few separate movements noted here. But the title of this article implies that there's one, reasonably unified movement. Which (depite the opening paragraph blurb about "for the purposes of this article...") gives a false impression that I don't think a good encyclopedia should be giving. Maybe the different individuals and groups will become more unified at some point, and at that point an article with this title would be fair. But right now this article, through its title, gives an impression which does not reflect reality. In my view, it's wrong for an encyclopedia to do that. Perhaps my objection is only with the title rather than the info outlined in the article. But I still think that's a reasonable objection for me to raise. <a href="../../../z/a/x/User%7EZaxem_8e49.html" title="User:Zaxem">Zaxem</a> 03:54, 7 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are extensive discussions in the archives about the article title and attempts to rename it. Article titles are place-holders, matters of convenience. They do not specify that something "exists". For example you will find encyclopedia articles called <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval_science.html" title="Medieval science">medieval science</a> in many encyclopedias, but science did not even exist until the modern era - but we call it that because people know what it means (it was actually called "natural philosophy"). The text of the article is what is most important. Many professional encyclopedias use the phrase "for the purposes of this article" in the first paragraph, commonly done, it is a useful tool. The article really goes out of its way to define exactly what is meant and makes no claim what so ever of a "unified" movement. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 04:04, 7 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nevertheless this article's title gives a false impression about something very current. I still think that's wrong for an encyclopedia of the quality that Wikipedia aspires to be. <a href="../../../z/a/x/User%7EZaxem_8e49.html" title="User:Zaxem">Zaxem</a> 04:12, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Yes it's a reasonable objection that the title should perhaps be "Movements to impeach..." or something else. Not really a good reason to delete. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i> 13:26 <a href="../../../7/_/m/7_May_677b.html" title="7 May">7 May</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Super-strong Keep</b>. Just because there's no chance in hell of it happening doesn't mean the movement ain't present.

<li><b>Super-strong Keep</b> There very much is a movement, I believe there was in fact a few towns somewhere in the general New England area that petitioned their senators and congressman to push for the impeachment of bush.

<li><b>Über-strong Keep</b> This article has <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_0daf.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Movement to impeach George W. Bush">already survived VfD</a>. Articles cannot violate WP:CIVIL, WP:NPA. (Nor do they personally attack Bush in an uncivil manner, but instead cite people and articles who dispute his policies' legality.) WP:BEANS is just an essay, not a guideline nor policy. Furthermore, WP:BEANS only advises us, in a somewhat humorous way, not to do give ideas out on how to disrupt Wikipedia. (I guess, though, we are giving ideas on how to disrupt the govt of the US, but that's not the issue here.) "No chance in hell of this being reality" is wrong. Perhaps you are disputing the chances of impeachment, but that is not what this article is about. This article is about people who called for Bush to be impeached. There are some people calling for impeachment, thus the reality of the movement's existence is at 100%. If the article were titled "Impeachment of Bush", then you would have a point. Now to attack the contentions of WP:NPOV and WP:NOR. A read of the article reveals many sources, from which information has been taken and collected in this article. There are some 65 external links in the article text. Clearly, original research just isn't here. There are no personal interviews, personal polls conducted, nor uncited lawyerly thinkings. As for WP:NPOV, this article is as detached from the issue and neutral as I have seen. I believe it provides a third party accounting of the issue at hand. The article has not made assertions that were found elsewhere from reliable sources, but instead simply reports on what other people say. The only possible problem that I see, would be the lack of discussion about the people who are against this movement, however, as some have pointed on the article's Talk page, it is nonexistent, and the article does mention a little bit about a <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html#White_House_reaction" title="Movement to impeach George W.

<li><b>Keep</b>. When the "Rationales for impeachment ..." came up on AfD last week, the Deleters claimed that it was unnecessary because this article existed. Fair enough; now this one's up for AfD? Sorry, but AfD shouldn't be a stalking horse for blatant partisan nonsense -- although a glance at the nom's user page is illuminating -- nor for people who have a hard time wrapping their heads around the difference between an article which is written in violation of NPOV and one reporting the publicized viewpoints of others. That WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA have been inexplicably cited leads me (for the very first time) to question the good faith of an AfD nomination. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 05:47, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

The movement exists, demonstrably. The article could use NPOV polishing &amp; some trimming, to be sure, but this public issue is as real as other movements Wikipedia includes.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I've read most of the current article and see a neutral reporting of why some people think the President should be impeached. I think this conflict is good for ensuring the thoroughness and accuracy of the article, but the efforts of contributors and editors should not be wasted by deletion. This article is becoming quite comprehensive and has several pages of citations for it to just be a soapbox for the mythological liberal bias. If certain contributors want to impose a FNC style fair and balanced approach, then perhaps they should create an article on the reasons not to impeach Bush. <a href="../../../c/f/p/User%7ECfpresley_8cc2.html" title="User:Cfpresley">Cfpresley</a> 12:51, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and Clean Up</b> - I agree with Nescio (gasp!) in that this looks like an abuse of the AfD system. I do have problems with this article but they are problems that can be remedied through constructive editing by level-headed editors from both points of view (ideally, from editors neutral on the topic). I've always had a vague discomfort with the title (mostly with the connotations of "movement") as well as the fact that all the examples given are far-left objections. The article should also mention that at 31% approval rating, there are some Conservatives that are calling for investigations on issues like failing to secure the borders, uncontrolled spending, etc. There <i>are</i> a few noteworthy people calling for impeachment and a few in Congress that are willing to listen...and if the Dems win a majority in November, hearings could become a reality. I think it's worthy of an article here, but as presently written, needs to be cleaned up, NPOV-ized, and de-soapboxed.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">WilliamThweatt</a> 16:30, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
