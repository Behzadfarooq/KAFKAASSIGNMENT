<li>Completely different. "Football" is a broad sport played in various incarnations. An athlete who habitually participates at a sufficiently notable level in such events is notable, and we have specific guidelines to determine which ones are and are not. Mr. Raciti has no long-term notability with something like "football" - he is connected to a very specific news event. His notability is inextricably tied to the event, whereas footballers often have slight claims to notability outside of football. Regardless, Mr. Raciti is known for one thing, and one thing only - being killed in the Catania violence. It would, therefore, be more sensible to cover him in that article, where his notability is better contextualized, than to break him off from the event and have two articles on what are, notability-wise, the same subject.

<ul>
<li>He is notable as part of the event and should therefore be covered in the article for the event. He is not notable as a person because he receives no actual coverage as a person prior to this event, and, as he's now dead, will not be able to become notable as a person.

<li>This discussion is becoming silly. Does it even matter what I say? I keep trying to explain my reasons and you don't even address them, so why bother replying? Yes, it does matter. To be notable by Wikipedia standards, you are the subject of multiple non-trivial yadda yadda yadda. Raciti is not. The violence is. Raciti is a plausible search term and makes a lovely redirect as an aspect of the Catania violence covered within that article, in my opinion. Obviously there won't be a consensus to merge and I'm not even bothering to propose it on the page. I only keep explaining myself because you keep replying, which I assumed meant you wanted to discuss my idea. If you do not and simply wish to keep reasserting that you disagree, then that's unnecessary and I will stop attempting to explain myself for some vain non-purpose, but please then do not lead me to believe I should be further discussing the reasoning behind my opinion to merge.

</li>
<li>Okay, let's stop it all. The guideline says "the person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial works...", not "he has been the most primary one". On these works, Raciti is a subject too, together with the events itself, Catania football club and so on. Then, you can find another criterion which says "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for playing a major role in a event receiving major news and media coverage" are likely to be notable here in Wikipedia. Raciti's name achieved notoriety worldwide following the events. Sorry, GassyGuy, but it seems you're wrong, and it seems also I'm not the only one to have such opinion on the matter (look at the discussion and votes).

<li>Well this is a first... Regular participants in AfD debates will know that I tend to feel that middle schools are generally non-notable. However... Has anyone else actually looked the school up on Google&#160;? It's very easy to find the following information: the Salk School of Science runs a unique science curriculum in New York, and is "part of a collaboration between the New York University School of Medicine and the New York City Department of Education... Members of the medical and scientific community work with Salk teachers to create curriculum... Members of the NYU School of Medicine (NYUSM) and the NYU School of Dentistry teach and mentor students in grades 6 through 8 at the Salk School" ( from the school's website ). I have added this information to the article; it should be clear that I feel that the school is notable. I therefore, with great astonishment, find myself the first person in this debate to say <b>Keep</b>, though with the proviso that we should also <b>Improve References</b>. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 15:12, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is going to be a <i>Keep</i> decision, so I won't be arguing about it, but I'll leave a final note. It's all well and good that a good institution has linked up with the school, but that institution doesn't focus on education, and even the best high schools are rarely linked with medical schools, so I think this is more hype than substance. I really don't think it passes any of the notability guidelines for schools, and at best deserves just a mention in an article about Bloomberg's initiatives. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 20:54, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think that's a fair point. My expectation ( not yet proven ) is that we can find enough independent references to support the claim to notability. I don't have a problem with revisiting this debate in a few months. I'm not a fan of school articles generally, but if the facts as presented in the article are true it seems to me that this is the sort of thing that would make the school notable. In the past I've advocated retention of an article about a similar school that had built a special relationship with the US Geological Survey ( or something like that, I don't remember all the details ), for much the same reasons. If every school did this sort of thing it would cease to be notable, but so far as I can tell this doesn't happen. In a sense, my view of notability for schools is tied up with how we might answer the question "Would a well-informed educationalist have a reason to refer to this school rather than any other when talking about his subject?". I think that for this school the answer to that question is "Yes".

<dd>I am aware of all these lists, and I feel they are all utterly inappropriate (a Category structure is <b>much</b> better). However, given the sheer number of these I feel making a nomination on one of them <i>without prejudice</i> on the others is the way forward; better to gauge consensus on one of them then have a massive bulk nomination which would likely be a sockfest. This particular one is hideous as it stands, but even after clean up there will still be an unencyclopedic list.--<a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENilfanion_64a5.html" title="User:Nilfanion">Nilf</a><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Nilfanion" class="extiw" title="commons:User:Nilfanion">anion</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/l/User_talk%7ENilfanion_2aa8.html" title="User talk:Nilfanion">talk</a>) 01:16, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The lists exist because they were started as the only means to organise the articles <i>before the category system existed</i>. Perhaps they have had their day, but I find your contempt for the huge amount of effort by good wikipedians that they represent repellent. The fact that I am probably the largest contributor to the subcategorisation of the by-country categories which have largely superseded these lists does little to reduce my annoyance at your unpleasant attitude. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 02:36, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b><s>Comment</s> Delete</b> - Nilfanion, you note that categorization is appropriate here. However, do categories indeed exist for such things? This list is quite well-structured, while categories are often a mess. If the category structure is as detailed and well-organized, I will most likely support deletion. Also, I do not think that deliberately not listing other articles is appropriate when you are aware of them and believe the same criticisms apply. List them all and if there truly is consensus, let them all be deleted at once (that way, it is not necessary to repeat the same arguments for every single list). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:34, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The category exists here just fine its <a href="../../../b/r/a/Category%7EBrazil_f5e4.html" title="Category:Brazil">Category:Brazil</a> <i>and its subcategories</i> - the scope of the list is to cover EVERYTHING in there. The structure of the whole category tree is superior to this list. One fundamental reason for not listing them all at once, is that there are a very large numbers of these. As for listing just this one as many of them are broken down further (due to the overwhelming length), this would be an AfD on hundreds of articles; and they all have a different feel. Whilst I feel they all have the same flaws, the community may not agree with me and could lead to a hideous mess, with some people saying "keep UK, USA and India but delete the rest" for example. Doing this one country at a time <i>without</i> letting the results from one AfD prejudice another may be less-efficient if everyone agrees with me, but if any individual article became contentious that would not poison the others and make the discussion a mess. I think I'm going to write an essay on this category and post to my user space (and link from this AfD's talk page).--<a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENilfanion_64a5.html" title="User:Nilfanion">Nilf</a><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Nilfanion" class="extiw" title="commons:User:Nilfanion">anion</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/l/User_talk%7ENilfanion_2aa8.html" title="User talk:Nilfanion">talk</a>) 00:03, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a list of songs in one of the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance_Dance_Revolution_cf23.html" title="Dance Dance Revolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a> games. The game is notable, but the lists are unencyclopedic - one such list, Dance Dance Revolution SuperNOVA song list, is one of the largest articles on Wikipedia. These lists are mostly unmaintained, and are probably better off on a fan site - <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, nor is it a game guide.</p>

<li>Well, to the Pope, but I didn't really compare them. You asked why a large list would be included in an "encyclopedic" article. That's an example of such a list. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 04:39, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Did you understand what I meant? The Catholic Church is of much greater notability than DDR. So a list of popes is encyclopedic where a list of songs from DDR isn't.

<li><b>Delete all</b> These projects already have information pages on their respective sites. There is also a severe lack of standard for which projects are allowed to become official on ocr. In other words, anyone who managed to finish a project had it become official, regardless of quality. Lack of standards may work for OCR, but not for wikipedia. Furthermore, at the risk of being POV, I'll be frank and say that with the exception of one or two of these projects, they are all quite bad. 72.208.129.108 17:59, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The site these albums are from is indeed notable, and the above-mentioned guidelines for the notability of music state that albums by notable artists are automatically notable as well.

<li>You're missing a step in your logic here - having your music on a notable website does not make an artist notable, otherwise every 16-year-old with a guitar on <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a> or <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> would be considered notable.

<li>Let's take your analogy a bit further - if YouTube were to release a sort of "best-of DVD" of what the YouTube employees think is some of the best stuff on their site, and the DVD would be downloaded or sold hundred thousands of times -- would this be notable? I do think so. And that's pretty much what these albums are, the best songs on a specific topic by the OCR-Community, with ten or even hundred thousands of downloads each (I only see counters for BitTorrent D/L's, but all those albums are downloadable directly as well, which is preferred by most web-users).

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - OCReMix is not open for anyone to simply post their music; that is where the MySpace or YouTube analogy fails.<br /></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The site staff carefully picks out submitted music to be posted to the site through a rigorous quality control system. A similar system is in place for determining the validity of official album projects. With regards to notability, OCReMix as a site is considered notable. This has been established. Among other reasons, this is because it fulfills point six in the music notability guidelines: "# Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or of the local scene of a city; note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability." OCReMix is verifiably the pioneer of the genre of video game music rearrangements and is easily the most prominent site in the field.<br /></dd>
<dd>Now, consider the following. OCReMix as an abstract concept did not pioneer the genre. It's fame and notability is derived from the music itself, which is created by various artists who submit to the site and go through the evaluated process. Without said music, which is created by supposedly "non-notable" artists, OCR would not have gotten off the ground at all. The site exists, and is constantly growing in popularity, because there is a community of skilled artists that contribute to the database of music that essentially defines the site. Thus, when the same artists that made (and continue to make) OCR notable release an album officially <i>through</i> OCR, that album in turn is also notable.<br /></dd>
<dd>The Time Magazine comparison is also inaccurate. Here is a better one. Let's say there is a record label, "DNA Records", that pioneers a new style of music, Jazz Metal. The artist roster consists of primarily hobbyist musicians who have no interest in doing any sort of mainstream release are not not "notable" by Wiki standards. While an obscure/esoteric genre, various print magazines and websites applaud "DNA Records" for their accomplishment and the DNA Records site becomes the #1 place for Jazz Metal. According to the logic of the people voting "delete", any actual albums the "DNA Records" label releases would be considered non-notable. This is illogical. Simply because the artists involved are not individually notable (according to Wiki guidelines), <b>it is their collective work that defined and developed the new genre to begin with</b>. Surely, none of you would say that an <b>official compilation release</b> by DNA Records would be non-notable simply because the individual artists were not! Yet, that is what many of you are saying about OCR, which is in an identical situation.

<li>I would say that the DNA Records albums would not notable. Genres are not invented - they are terms given by music reviewers and journalists to describe trends in sound. If the sound they pioneered was as truly innovative as you boast, the artists would be reviewed and discussed by reputable third-party sources, which would make the <i>artists</i> notable. Record companies with no notable artists are rarely themselves notable - remember that OCRemix is a notable website, not a notable record company. Furthermore, video game music remixes are nothing new, OCRemix (despite being a very good site) did <i>not</i> invent them, and fan releases by OCRemix volunteers are <i>not</i> notable. Your analogy would probably be more effective if you found a real-life example instead of resorting to the hypothetical. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 20:22, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes, it's true that OCR did not pioneer or invent the genre per se, but it is the most prominent representative as we have already established and has been cited numerous times in different forms of media, as well as by notable composers in the field. The site has done quite a bit for the genre and attracted much attention for it. Moving on, for all practical purposes, OCR is a record label. Every sound recording posted to the site is distributed and branded as an "OC ReMix". The fact that there are no physical releases is inconsequential; numerous internet-only record labels exist. While the site does not refer to itself as such, for comparative purposes OCR functions like the hypothetical "DNA Records" might - collecting sound recordings from various artists, branding them, and releasing them to the public.<br /></li>

<dd>You are wrong in assuming that an innovative or pioneering sound would necessarily be "reviewed and discussed by reputable third-party sources", especially if the release in question is a compilation. What if the form of music is simply not palatable to the general public or mainstream media? What if there are so many artists involved (in the case of OCR) that discussing each one of them at length would be impossible, and it would be more practical to simply talk about the general concept?<br /></dd>
<dd>Ultimately, I think the black-and-white adherence to the notability guidelines here does not make sense when applied to something like this. I think the album guidelines were more intended for traditional labels doing traditional releases. I agree that it would not be wise to allow every tiny indie label with a basement album release to be on Wikipedia. And to that end I think the guidelines are successful. However, an allowance can and should be made for a case like OCR, which is NOT traditional either in the type of music it promotes or in how it distributes the music. These albums have been downloaded (collectively) over 110,000 times through OCR's official torrents alone, not counting the traffic from numerous HTTP mirrors. That is a truly massive number, and to write them off simply because a print publication hasn't written about them specifically would be in poor judgment.

<li>You continue to neglect to address my central point - the same point DorfDepp made. The artists that submit to OCR are what give the site its notability, much like a notable record label is only that because artists record and release music through it. Once again, as these are official album projects that represent the core of what OCR is all about (which has been established to be notable), they should be considered notable even though the individuals involved are in and of themselves not. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, if you will.<br /></li>

<dd>BTW the reason why I continue to write so much is that barely anyone in favor of deletion has provided any non-trivial discussion on the topic and appear to just be reading your initial post and making a cursory evaluation of the facts at hand. According to the very "Arguments to Avoid" article you linked, "delete per nom" is as invalid as my citation of # of downloads. I will remind everyone, as an earlier poster did, that the same arguments for deletion were brought up for these albums in the past and no consensus was reached. Ignoring that precedent seems unjust.

<dd>Now, here's the place where things get confusing: The argument for keeping these is "OCReMix is notable, these are distributed through OCReMix, thus these are notable as well". OCReMix is notable through <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, as a website; it's not a record label, so OCR can not confer notability to its projects through WP:MUSIC. But, these "albums" aren't really albums in the strict sense; they have no physical distribution, only distribution through the OCReMix website. They may then fall under the category of "web content" as well.</dd>
<dd>However, they'd likely fail those criteria as well, because of the previously noted lack of coverage in reliable sources, along with the fact that they are not distributed independently, only through OCReMix itself.</dd>
<dd>It is also noted that the projects are already mentioned and listed in the main OCReMix article.</dd>

<li>First off, we have to ignore the Slashdot postings, as those were written by members of the projects themselves (or djpretzel.) Then we are left with three sources: the Russian DVD insert, which is likely a trivial reference, the Music4Games blog entry, which is a non-notable and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">unreliable</a> website, and the IGN.com reference, which merely displays the album's cover art as a picture of Sonic. The rest of the posts are about OCRemix itself, not the albums. Wikipedia's notability guidelines require multiple, non-trivial, third-party, reliable sources: none of these sources fulfill any of those requirements, and the single source for each of those three albums is not enough to satisfy notability. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 03:11, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep/Clean-up</b> Article has now been cited. Article has now also removed much of the language which made it seem "ad-like" - the entry is now much more encyclopedic in nature. Content has been added which shows the scope of the organization is national and international, important and unique. I would like to point out that the "delete" votes here seem to be a snowballing effect, not viewing the article on its own merits, rather basing opinions on previous "delete votes". Example: "non-notable, no matter what quality or quantity the amount of effort put forth" - if you draw this conclusion out, this could be said of Wikipedia (which is a collection of quality efforts). If you look at it now that is has been cleaned up, objectively, you will see this is just about as 'wikipedia' as things go - a collective organization which only exists because of the communal input and efforts of a group of people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside recognition as measure of notability: Duke University Library, an internationally renowned organization, has collected and archived the papers of the founder of Internationalist Books, as well as the organizational records, in its Rare Books and Manuscripts Collection: <a href="http://catalog.library.duke.edu/F/9SDT4RH7DN9L73STVTQT4U8CCL1P7D9DGNCS2A6JE89GJJPYY7-00865?func=full-set-set&amp;set_number=001654&amp;set_entry=000013&amp;format=999" class="external text" title="http://catalog.library.duke.edu/F/9SDT4RH7DN9L73STVTQT4U8CCL1P7D9DGNCS2A6JE89GJJPYY7-00865?func=full-set-set&amp;set_number=001654&amp;set_entry=000013&amp;format=999" rel="nofollow">Duke University Library collection</a> This is evidence that the organization is a unique phenomenon, which deserves to be noted.</p>
<p>If time is a measure of notability: Note that of all of the other entries in noteworthy <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infoshop.html" title="Infoshop">infoshops</a> listed, only two (Jura and Wooden Shoe) were founded prior to 1981 - the founding date of the Internationalist. Not to mention that Jura and Wooden Shoe exist in much larger markets than Chapel Hill, NC. To exist as an independent bookstore for 25 years in a small college town, and to be the only remaining independent bookstore in downtown Chapel Hill, is intrinsically notable (not to mention the history, the outside articles, and all the other measures that comply with the notability guidelines).</p>
<p>Note also, if comparing to the other <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infoshop.html" title="Infoshop">infoshop</a> entries, that many do not have external links other than their own websites. Here we have a number of outside links, which is a major part of notability - from the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">the notability guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, a quick anecdote: I recently spoke with a friend in San Francisco. We have not spoken in about ten years. When she learned that I had moved to Chapel Hill the first thing that she asked me was: "Have you been to the Internationalist?"--Citizenplastic 15:30, 5 February 2007 (UTC)<small>— Citizenplastic (<a href="../../../c/i/t/User_talk%7ECitizenplastic_289d.html" title="User talk:Citizenplastic">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Citizenplastic_c0a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Citizenplastic">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<li><b>Merge</b> Responding to Michael Hardy: they do both seem to pick out the same features, the diagonals in Ulams sprials are all of the form <span class="texhtml"><i>n</i> = <i>a</i><i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>b</i><i>x</i> + <i>c</i></span> likewise the curves picked out by this spiral are of the same form <span class="texhtml"><i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>a</i></span>, or <span class="texhtml"><i>x</i>(<i>x</i> + 1) + <i>b</i></span>. One rotation in Ulams spiral is two rotations in this spiral, so there is some simple correspondence. I think there are certain nice features of this presentation as it lacks the sharp corners of Ulam's, and the fact that each quadratic makes a single curve from the origin rather than two diagonal lines in Ulam's. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 00:46, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This article is not "incapable of NPOV". Students at Drexel are frequently unhappy with administrative treatment. That is a <i>fact</i>.

The term "Drexel Shaft" is frequently used to refer to this dissatisfaction with Drexel university. That is also a fact, although it is harder to find sources for.

<li><b>Delete</b> The band's limited notability doesn't extend to this member, especially given that all the sources seem to be connected to the subject in some way. There has been apparent sockpupperty on many articles associated with this subject and an excess of self-promotion.

<li><b>Comment</b> Revision as of 14:36, 9 September 2006 by Stevenkray added substantial spam links to the article. I removed these today, and added some links which are in the reference section of <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tin_Foil_Phoenix_2f08.html" title="Tin Foil Phoenix">Tin Foil Phoenix</a> (TFP). The support that he was a member of that band and discusses some other history of Kray. As it stands I assume that TFP is notable since it has an article at WP. Is Kray notable as a member of the band? At minimum I see this as a redirect to TFP.

<li>As a member of the appropriate Wikiproject, I do believe that I should add my two cents. If you look at the characters lists and actually watch the episodes, you will find the some characters, while not major characters, are more important than others. I agree that the list of minor characters should be trimmed down. However, since that is not what is the current topic, i will adress this one. All the articles already list guest voices in the infobox and it would be easy to find the information if needed. So since that article, in essence, has already been split, my vote is <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Placebo_Effect_8620.html" title="User:The Placebo Effect">The Placebo Effect</a> 22:51, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In the case of immigrants from multiethnic states, it's a lot more common to refer to them using their ethnic origin (e.g. <a href="../../../h/m/o/Hmong_American_adfd.html" title="Hmong American">Hmong American</a>, Uyghur American) rather than their national origin, and most immigrants from such states identify based on their ethnicity rather than their former/ancestral nationality. The most prominent historical example of this: immigrants from the USSR were virtually never referred to as "Soviet Americans" or the like, but instead as Russian Americans, Kazakh Americans, Estonian Americans, etc. The title "Malaysian American" is a problematic neologism because it implies a group identity that probably doesn't exist in the first place (and to which no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> attest); it's probably a mistake to call a group of people by a name with which they themselves wouldn't primarily identify. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 07:48, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see your point, but there are also counter-examples. For example, I do not imagine anyone would identify as a Tutsi, Hutu, or Twa American, but instead a Rwandan or Burundian American. Likewise, Filipino American is used instead of Tagalog American and Bolivian American in the place of Aymaran American. Despite that, I still do not think "Malaysian American" or "Rwandan/Filipino/Bolivian American" are neologisms as they are simply combinations of two common identities for which an English-language convention exists (in this case, nationality/country of origin followed by current citizenship). I view "Malaysian American" as a categorization rather than a particular group identity that individuals may or may not adopt.

<p>I nominated this article for deletion because it looks a great deal like just a statement of one person's personal philosophy. I say this because of the personal tone of the article, the fact that it has only one contributor, and the fact that I was unable to find a single other source for the topic on Google, though there were references to "philosophical creationists" of a completely different nature, i.e., those who defend <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> on philosophical grounds. <a href="../../../m/y/c/User%7EMycroft7_4214.html" title="User:Mycroft7">Mycroft7</a> 01:48, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

If it is his neurobiology research, then I don't see how it rises above other professors' work. There does not seem to be any large, independent review of his research and definitely no review outside his research area. I have worked in multiple research labs and his body of work does not stand out from any other researcher's contributions in their fields. There does not appear to be anything to add to this article. He correlated brain signals in monkeys and humans (and he didn't even find the location in the brain that directly correlated to the monkey's F5 section) and he works on RobotCub. That's all there is to his research and that doesn't meet the requirements of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 04:30, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Ju66l3r, could you expand on "he didn't even find the location in the brain...". The Google scholar hits and "impact" for this persons articles are quite good (i.e. above average), so normally I would say his work is well cited, and vote keep. However, it sounds like you can explain why the google scholar hits are out of whack with reality (or robotics as the case may be). <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 20:40, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

The Google Books search did not turn up any books by Fadiga, only some citations (which are nice, but lots of people get cited.) There are a truly enormous number of Google Scholar hits... until you realize that "fadiga" is a word in (Portuguese? Maybe Italian as well?) He <i>has</i> published a number of papers, but it is always hard for an outsider to evaluate how valuable those are.

<dd>In Google Scholar, if you click on the link on the left "L Fadiga", it reduces the number to only entries where the person is one of the authors: <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;sa=G&amp;oi=qs&amp;q=luciano+fadiga+author:l-fadiga" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;sa=G&amp;oi=qs&amp;q=luciano+fadiga+author:l-fadiga" rel="nofollow">35</a> in notable journals and these articles are regularly cited by other articles. Each of those citations (1000s) can be considered a "review" of this mans work, by his peers. It is hard for outsiders to judge, and that is why I asked if Ju66l3r can give more information. If the work has has been discredited since then maybe it can be discarded or merely noted on the appropriate page.</dd>

<dd>It should be recognized that nearly any researcher who publishes is likely doing so as the "first" to observe something. The contribution by the subject of discussion was to see parallels between primate and human brain responses (the region of the human brain responsible for what was observed was later determined by others according to the New Scientist article). This does not reach above what any other professor accomplishes during their careers. 35 publications (per Google Scholar) is not necessarily above average for tenured faculty. Many of these publications appear to be work primarily by others and list L Fadiga as a middle (often collaborating) author. I am more moved by the 3 book citations provided above than the publication list. The Guardian and New Scientist articles are about the total works of multiple professors' scientific contributions to fully characterize the F5 motor neurons and Dr. Fadiga is not the subject of the article in either case. I do not see the notability requirements being met which is not to say that his research has not been important to its field. Unfortunately, nearly every professor has contributed to their fields in important ways (it's part of what warrants their status in their profession) and so the notability requirements at Wikipedia are held fairly high to be sure that the encyclopedia is not flooded with every professor and simply becomes a Who's Who of PubMed/Citeseer/etc. Furthermore, it should be noted that Dr. Fadiga's work was passed up in favor of reviews and work by his colleagues instead in the <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirror_neuron.html" title="Mirror neuron">Mirror neuron</a> article, suggesting that his work alone may not notable to the Wikipedia community improving the same scientific topic. That his name is missing from that Wikipedia page is certainly more circumstantial but something to consider. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 20:31, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>: Continuing on what I wrote above, I checked <a href="http://isihighlycited.com" class="external text" title="http://isihighlycited.com" rel="nofollow">ISI's HighlyCited.com</a> which lists the 250 most-cited authors in each of 21 fields and did not find Dr. Fadiga. You may feel this is too restrictive, but I felt it was important to note that it is not as if he is an abnormally highly cited authors in neurobiology as a previous comment felt to be suggesting. Furthermore, I looked for more independent articles on mirror neurons and found <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/10/science/10mirr.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=4b525f923a669928&amp;ex=1294549200&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/10/science/10mirr.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=4b525f923a669928&amp;ex=1294549200&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" rel="nofollow">an article</a> by the New York Times from a year ago that thoroughly discusses the topic and does not note Dr. Fadiga.

Dr. Fadiga's work is not mentioned in the links nor are any of his 3 book chapter contributions part of the books listed for references by NOVA. The more I dig on this, the more I find that Drs.

I'm clarifying my nomination. The article has been expanded significantly, and the reasoning above no longer applies. There's still a question of notability. Surely not every Linux/Unix command is notable. In my Linux/Unix experience I've never had occasion to use this command. However, my experience is relatively small, and I don't feel qualified to judge the notability. I'll leave that for the rest of y'all to debate. I'm officially <b>no vote</b> on this one. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdavidw_0345.html" title="User:Adavidw">adavidw</a> 22:32, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I suggest trying to determine that for yourself by evaluating the depths of the available sources.

If it helps, notice that there are two classes of books when it comes to guides to Linux distributions and to Unix: those that simply re-print the manual page, and those that actually devote one or more pages to their own, original, discussions of the command. The books cited are in the latter class. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:20, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - since this aricle is being (improperly) cited as a defense for the also-nominated article <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children_of_the_Prime_Ministers_of_Canada_4da0.html" title="Children of the Prime Ministers of Canada">Children of the Prime Ministers of Canada</a>, I thought perhaps this one ought to be nominated now rather than later. The children of world leaders, whether they are the children of a US president or of a Canadian Prime Minister or a Filipino president, are not inherently notable in and of themselves. The proper place for the otherwise non-notable offspring of presidents to be listed is in the article about the individual president. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:58, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

I feel the information about children of presidents should be preserved, especially since many (but not all!) of them do have articles, and because presidents themselves are inherently super-notable.

<dd>Yes, you hit the nail on the head. To be worth keeping, a list has to provide a benefit over and above other ways that we can present the information. With this list and the related list of children of Canadian Prime Ministers, there needs to be some value in the list itself. Ask yourself: why would anyone need such a list other than for the sake of knowing trivia? If you can't come up with a good answer, then the list should be deleted. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 03:41, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I don't need to repeat myself; later in the page I point out that the children of political leaders have been studied within political biography, history, and sociology, and give a few cites.

<dd>Sorry, us Wikipedians contribute as best we can with the knowledge we have. It is one of the joys of Wikipedia that in the course of AFD, I learn all sorts of stuff that I didn't know before. I read what you wrote below and it is perhaps convincing. What I propose is that somebody (perhaps you) write the article as a stub right now (a paragraph or two with the references you provided below will suffice). If this had been done at the outset, this entire discussion might have been different. I suspect, however, that it will eventually turn out that children of Presidents are not far different from children of CEOs and other community leaders. That's just my personal speculation, though, and, as OR, has no place in this discussion or anywhere else in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 06:29, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Would Folantin, Morschi, and all the other people who say this is a list of non-notable people please explain how a list of "non-notable" people has so many blue links (and I note that some of the ones who don't, should, and will, no doubt, someday)? And why a topic which is of obvious sociological importance -- the study of access to power &amp; transfer of power among kin -- is being dismissed as "non-notable"? I would refer people to the entire <a href="../../../n/o/b/Category%7ENobility_b1ae.html" title="Category:Nobility">Category:Nobility</a>, an automated list basically tracking families with political power, and ask for someone to make a clear distinction about why political families in democratic country are somehow "not notable". --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 14:17, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Then those would apply only to the method for inheritance, such as primogeniture; and I would note that in democracies children of presidents are considerably more likly to become presidents themselves, than children <i>not</i> of presidents. ... Regardless, "non notability" applies to articles dedicated to the individual; it doesn't apply to them being mentioned or listed in other articles. An article (list) about children of the presidents of the US must be judged as to whether that topic, is, itself, notable. Judging by presence of published literature and scholarship on the subject, it is.

</ul>
<p><i>Anyone who was, at one point, an official member of a ruling family of a country is considered notable. The definition of a royal family may vary by country, but generally includes the spouse of the reigning monarch, any or all surviving spouses of a deceased monarch, and the children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, and cousins of the reigning monarch, as well as their spouses.</i></p>
<p><i>This includes former monarchies - if the person was born while the monarchy was still in existence, they are notable on that basis. Any children of a deposed monarch, even if born after the deposition, are automatically notable (thus, for instance, the younger children of the former King of the Hellenes, or all the children of the former Kings of Romania and Bulgaria). Other close relations of formerly reigning royal families must qualify under WP:BIO.</i></p>

<li><b>comment</b> - I suspect that the people who are voting delete don't get the historical significance of the relationship, probably because this is merely a list (which raises a trivia red flag for folks). It strongly suggests that the list, as such, needs at least a preface describing the scholarship that has studied these people as an identifiable group, and their significance in political and biographical studies. It's a larger problem with lists: That some lists are clearly trivia, and some lists are really the germ of an important idea; but it's difficult for people to distinguish between the two without context and information. Perhaps the deleters (who appear to be a minority, albeit a substantial one) would be willing to suspend judgment for a while until the most robust of these Children-of-leaders articles (the US presidents' kids) can be fleshed out with some additional text &amp; supporting references. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 16:08, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Some of these children become more notable then others, especially those put in the spotlight or have a political future because of their political parent's status. They would most likely be considered 'nobodys' if they were not children of a president. They play an important part in the life of the president. Look at the Bush twins, they have done nothing notable, yet because their father is President of the U.S. they have become notable. Take away his Presidency and his daughters wouldn't even have an article in Wikipedia. Same goes for Chelsea Clinton, no Bill and they'd say "who's that girl?" Being a child of a U.S. President or any world leader, current or not, is notable. <a href="../../../j/j/m/User%7EJjmillerhistorian_b2eb.html" title="User:Jjmillerhistorian">Jjmillerhistorian</a> 14:11, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b>: A number of people have argued, above, that the list should be deleted because it contains people who are not notable (gist: "If they're notable give them their own article."). That is a misapprehension of how <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> works. WP:N applies to the <i>subject</i> of an article; not to every individual fact within an article. In a biographical article, the <i>subject</i> of the article -- the person discussed -- must be notable. In a article about a topic (which is what a list is), not every individual component need be individually notable. See, e.g., <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> which describes making lists of characters in books, rather than individual pages for books.</li>

(Some have argued that actually all children of US presidents are individually notable; my point is that they need not be notable to be mentioned in an article, and a <i>list</i> is a type of article.) My own take on this list/article is that it really should be an article with an embedded list, which would contextualize the list aspect and make the significance clear; however, even as a list with a bit of prefatory material, the <i>subject</i> of the list is notable.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>I think the problem is not whether or not the children of Presidents are individually notable. Obviously, many of them are. The question is whether the group is a worthwhile collection of information as a group. Many graduates of West Point are notable but a list of every graduate of West Point would be ridiculous, partly because of the number but also because so many of them are non-notable. At the risk of repeating myself, the question is - "To whom would this list be useful?" If, as <a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">User:Lquilter</a> suggests, the group is of interest as a group then we should keep this list but then the article on Children of the Presidents of the United States should also be created. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 06:54, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>There are people who can use this information while researching U.S. Presidential history. Their children play a big part in their lives, some even effect their politics. Franklin Pierce even mentioned his last of three sons to die in his inaugural. His three sons may not be considered notable, but the event of Benjamin Pierce's death definately was. The article also helps compare all the U.S. President's children all at one time; who is the oldest, how many are still alive, how many did each President have, etc. It is useful to those who are obviously interested in this. If you have no interest in Presidents or history it would be easy not to care and suggest to delete. There are alot of "lists" here I would get rid of, but I know there might be a reason to keep them. This article is very new and still needs work. Not every article has to be useful to every person. It is definately useful to those who want to keep it. <a href="../../../j/j/m/User%7EJjmillerhistorian_b2eb.html" title="User:Jjmillerhistorian">Jjmillerhistorian</a> 12:00, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Article creation comment</b> - A couple of people have now suggested that the list is appropriate if an existing article is there to support it. I initially preferred a single article, with text and an incorporated list, and I wrote two paragraphs at the top of the current list that could serve as a stub. But now I see perhaps the virtues of a separate article: One article could explain the sociological aspects of being a child of a political leader, placing it into context with inherited nobility, economic class, personal life outcomes, and so on; and there could be short sections that discuss any specific national effects, national political history, or other specific national research that have been done, which would link to the relevant supported lists (children of Canadian PMs, children of US presidents, and so on). (Heck, we could probably cannibalize some of the arguments on this page to flesh out the text.) --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 14:01, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think that a number of the notability "voters" miss the point. Of course some presidential children aren't notable (though a few are even as children). But this is a list covering a notable topic (as shown by sourcing) and may in fact help prevent the creation of stubs of non-notable presidential children, since they can have their bio-stubs here. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 09:00, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Disambiguation to what, exactly? We're questioning the notability of one school, and you believe we should change the page to mention <i>three</i> non-notable schools? If there's more than one notable Disney School, that's when one mentions disambiguation. I'm not buying this "it's notable because it's unusual to have a school named after an entertainer" argument either. There's a school named after a horse in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portola_Valley%2C_California_fb93.html" title="Portola Valley, California">Portola Valley, California</a>, which has to be rarer than a school named after an entertainer, and it isn't notable either. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 15:36, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I edited this article back in March - unfortunately I was new to Wikipedia and didn't cite anything. I have no general knowledge of the subject and I am certain I pulled any info I added from several newspaper articles that appeared in the <i><a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayton_Daily_News_fefd.html" title="Dayton Daily News">Dayton Daily News</a></i> after his death. I don't have access, but I think they are available on the newspaper's web archive (and likely on LexisNexis); article titles include "Former Mayor McGee dies" and "McGee changed city he dearly loved, served". In general, I don't think there's a lack of press coverage if someone was able to do the research - he was one of the first black mayors of a city as large as Dayton and was quite active with the NAACP - but due to the timeframe of McGee's service I doubt much will be available on the web. -<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Smooth_ae06.html" title="User:Big Smooth">Big</a> <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBig_Smooth_1480.html" title="User talk:Big Smooth">Smooth</a></i> 16:38, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I was surprised to read that Dayton only has a population of about 150k, but the greater Dayton area is close to 900k. So how notable is the mayor of a 150k city?

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm not convinced. This article singles out a generic term and then simply catalogs various uses of it. The problem is that the term has so many different referents that the article is not really about anything at all; to the extent that it is about something it is because the article is original research, chronicalling a cultural meme that is recognized only in the head of the author. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 00:40, 6 February 2007 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi
<ul>
<li>I wholly agree that the article requires a rewrite, but that is not grounds for deletion. The sources are in agreement that the term applies to a nonconventional conflict in the post-Cold War era. That different sources apply this term in differing manners and to differing conflicts does not invalidate the need for an article. The guideline for inclusion here is <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, which this decidedly meets; many of these sources discuss the term and its application (rather than simply employing it in context).

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_III_4587.html" title="World War III">World War III</a>.

<li><b>Cleanup and Keep</b>. The concept of a fourth World War and the implications it would bring is no more implausible than the theory of evolution.

<p>This fails every rule in the book. The article was written by a single user who has not made any other contributions to Wikipedia. There are no links in or out. Most importantly, there are no references. I'll have trouble finding any on my own because there's almost nothing about her on the Internet. If everything the article says about her is true, she might be notable, but we'll never know.

<p>Nonnotable local band. Only source given is Delusions of Adequacy, a music-review site open to submissions by anyone. Speedied twice and reposted by author who claims they're notable as the leading rockabilly band in Adelaide, Australia. I think it still fails <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>, but bringing here for consensus. <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 05:16, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> i am the author of the page. contrary to what nawlinwiki has said the source i quoted, Delusions of Adequacy (DOA) is not open to submissions by anyone, only the reviewers employed by the site submit material. however anyone is able to contact them giving them information about music they would like o see reviewed. however this music is chosen at the discretion of DOA. the site is well established, having been formed in 1999. it is classed as an e-zine rather than just a website and they post new material on a regular basis. as an established e-zine they have an editorial team which regulates the content. i have contacted the editor in chief of the site in order to get more details of the site's editorial policy.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>i also believe that being the only band of a genre in a city of more that 1 million people constitutes a level of notability suitable for a small wikipedia article. the band's notability is likely to increase this year as some of the most notable psychobilly bands in the world will be touring australia, and as the only local act in that genre it is highly likely that they will be supporting these acts. i feel that this is surely notable enough to make a wikipedia page for them suitable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>as i said i contacted the editor of DOA and asked his to either contact me with details of the editorial policy of DOA or to post the information here. either way more details about the reliability of the site will soon be availiable and i ask that enough time be given for this to happen.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>finally i would like to ask about how much research nawlinwiki did into the source i quoted before deeming it unreliable? thank you --<a href="../../../t/3/h/User%7ET3hllama_dc7d.html" title="User:T3hllama">T3hllama</a> 10:20, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am Raul69, an Adelaide citizen. I am very in touch with the Adelaide music scene and not only is this band 'The Hoodoo Voodoo Dolls' highly respected (and only) psychobilly band but they are a a highly respected and popular band in general. Within a year of coneption, the band has been added to the hugely popular 'Scorcherfest' bill and one of the biggest events in the Australian Psychobilly/Rockabilly calander, the annual Kustom Kulture Weekender. This page provides useful information for psychobilly fans from around adelaide and south australia who might not otherwise have heard about this band. I have also looked over this DOA site and I found it to be a good site and thorouly reliable. <small>— <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul69_e181.html" title="User:Raul69">Raul69</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Raul69_4358.html" title="Special:Contributions/Raul69">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have received an email from Kyle O'Donnell, editor in cheif of DOA. here is a excerpt:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"DOA has been around since 1999 and offers new content (album, mp3, and concert reviews as well as features, interviews, etc.) every weekday. We have a dedicated staff of writers chosen by the editors (myself and Jenn Patton). We do not accept content written by anyone not on our staff. Furthermore, DOA receives about 30,000 unique visitors per month.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We are dedicated to helping preserve the spirit of independent music and a number of links to DOA reviews already exist on various wikipedia pages."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>as he says links to DOA articles are already used as references on other wikipedia pages. if this is the case then this shows that wikipedia has accepted DOA as a reliable source priviously, so why do you not in this case. --<a href="../../../t/3/h/User%7ET3hllama_dc7d.html" title="User:T3hllama">T3hllama</a> 03:08, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The fact that some articles use links to DOA does not make it ipso facto a reliable encyclopedic source. We are not doubting that this source exists, or that it does what you say it does (namely, that it reviews music in the Adelaide area.) However, having been reviewed once in a minor local newspaper does not meet the guidelines at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 04:01, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>DOA is not a minor local newspaper. they are an international e-zine review music from all over the world not just my area. i feel that some research should be done by people before they dismiss a source as unreliable, such as actually looking at the page or contacting the editors.--<a href="../../../t/3/h/User%7ET3hllama_dc7d.html" title="User:T3hllama">T3hllama</a> 04:40, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's an international ezine with only 30,000 readers actually makes it <i>less</i> of a notable source than if it were a local newspaper. Furthermore, one can't leave it up to every editor to contact the management of a magazine and prove its notable.

<dd>while a small readership does indeed make it less of a notable source, a readership of 30,000 is still quite large. i can assure you that if any further reviews are written they too would be credited.--<a href="../../../t/3/h/User%7ET3hllama_dc7d.html" title="User:T3hllama">T3hllama</a> 06:11, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I wouldn't even class DOA as a single source who has written about the band. "Send us your CD/single/MP3 and we'll review it" sites are astonishingly common. Footnote 1 of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> states "The barometer of notability is whether people <i>independent</i> of the subject itself have actually considered the musician, ensemble, composer, or lyricist notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works that focus upon it." In my opinion review sites such as these do not meet this standard, they are not writing about the band as such, just the music they have been sent to review. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 04:22, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>But as stated the subject of each revue is chosen at the discretion of the editors. they do not review every MP3, CD or single sent to them. they choose songs or CDs to review based on their own impressions of the song or CD. writers also search for material as well as seleting from the material sent to them. they arent a cash for comment organisation.--<a href="../../../t/3/h/User%7ET3hllama_dc7d.html" title="User:T3hllama">T3hllama</a> 06:11, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I see no such disclaimer on the site, or in any message purported to be from anyone involved with the site posted here. That isn't relevant to my point anyway. My point was that a band is considered notable if a writer independently publishes an article about them. Reviews of songs or CDs are not covered under that in my opinion, otherwise every band that has ever been reviewed in more than one fanzine could be considered notable. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 06:51, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>if your previous point had been clear i would not have need to query it! i shall ask you again. if u do not consider an independent review to be an article about a band what do you consider to be an article about a band? also, having checked out the Ghits you pointed out i would like to say taht if it was not for this wikipedia page i doubt the band would feature on a site in russian. 14 unique Ghits when not including wikipedia and myspace is also significant i think. the band are also waiting on a full review from a german based psychobilly magazine to be published in the near future. in this case it was the magazine that contacted them asking for a CD rather than the other way around. would that be a suitible article or do you dismiss all review as unsatisfactory? --<a href="../../../t/3/h/User%7ET3hllama_dc7d.html" title="User:T3hllama">T3hllama</a> 08:01, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The question is not whether the <i>article</i> is complete or sourced or whatever, but whether the <i>subject</i> is notable. It comes down to a question - could a complete, encyclopaedic article meeting all Wikipedia policies be written on this topic? If the answer is "no", it shouldn't be here. If the answer is "yes", then the article needs to diversify its sources. Simply being a good band in the opinion of its fans does not qualify it. Note this is not an indictment of anyone or of the band - there's a band I'd *love* to write about, is big on the local scene here in Perth, sells out concerts at local venues, has been on the Big Day Out lineup twice, gets daily Triple J airplay and is about to release what could be their breakthrough album. They're still, however, not notable at this point. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 09:34, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Is it a coincidence that all three names end with "wold" or ("wald") and that one is a "Djork" (dork?)? No google hits on any of the "wo(a)lds". I think the blog is as much a hoax as this article. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETRosenbaum_85b9.html" title="User:TRosenbaum">TRosenbaum</a> 15:37, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You editors are tough, but I respect your intent to maintain integrity. Haven't done enough homework to understand publication requirements. Looks like it will take a few years to meet notability standards (one book has been published, but more in the works). Comment to N Shar: not everyone engages in fiction when presenting references! We have hard copies and pdf's of all references, including the article referenced in Note 8 -- newspapers take liberties with word play in their headlines when the subject allows it.

<li><b>Comment.</b> I didn't mean to accuse you of faking anything (although I guess it came across that way). However, the number of times I've thought I knew what an article was about and been wrong, or cited the wrong article, etc. is quite astonishing. You are certainly right about people taking liberties with wordplay, though. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 00:58, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Depends what search terms you use. Add WWF to it and you get a number of sources: <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Plane+flight+from+hell%2C+WWF&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Plane+flight+from+hell%2C+WWF&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> It's also covered in Scott Keith's book "Wrestling's one-ring circus". Given the breadth of sources, I'd say it's fine as far as references are concerned, but I still don't think it's notable and important enough to have its own article (see my comments further down). --<a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatsnumbereleven_aa67.html" title="User:Batsnumbereleven">Dave.</a> 00:05, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I wouldn't call Scott Keith a reliable source, especially considering the numerous factual inaccuracies in his first book. The problem with the sources is that none of them really say the same thing. For example <a href="http://www.pwbts.com/columns/b051302.html" class="external text" title="http://www.pwbts.com/columns/b051302.html" rel="nofollow">PWBTS</a> reports The Torch stated Curt Hennig started the fight, while <a href="http://www.1wrestling.com/news/newsline.asp?news=9371" class="external text" title="http://www.1wrestling.com/news/newsline.asp?news=9371" rel="nofollow">1Wrestling</a> reports that Jerry Lawler stated Curt Hennig didn't start the fight. There are too many conflicting and unconfirmed reports about what happened, and I don't believe rumours and speculation are appropriate. For that reason I think it will always fail <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 08:56, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is one of those borderline issues. I see both sides, but I don't think it's too big of a deal. I mean, it does fit the category of professional wrestling slang. You bring up the term to most smart fans and wrestlers, they know what you mean. I think we also need to realize how big this was at the time. This might be more of a context of the time issue than anything else IMO.

I see nothing wrong with deleting all public school articles be deleted if they don't make any assertion for notability - this just happened to catch my attention because I was looking at previous edits by a vandal. As far as I can tell, this is just an unremarkable high school that doesn't meet the criteria inclusion. <a href="../../../y/t/n/User_talk%7EYtny_624b.html" title="User talk:Ytny">talk to</a> <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> 08:18, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>OK, but why is a public school not, on its face, notable? Yes, Wikipedia is not simply a collection of facts, but it is a collection of encyclopedic knowledge. Scale says that not everything is notable (for example, we don't have articles on every person in the world), but most things which are limited in scope are (such as schools, cities, counties, discovered stars, etc). The existence of Lewisville High School is very notable for those of us who live around it. LHS has played a large role in both the immediate area and by producing otherwise notable people who have graduated from it.</li>

Public school entries, not just the entry for LHS, rise, in my opinion, above a stated list or small blurb.

In general, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is used rather bluntly to mean "anything I have arbitrarily decided doesn't merit an article in Wikipedia for which I won't bother to come up with an actual reason".

I just spent an hour adding an infobox and straigtening up (when I should ahve been sleeping, thank you very much), but was unable to add much in the way of independent sources--not because there aren't any, but because there are too many Google hits to go through--more than 13,000 for '"Lewisville High School" texas'. The local papers don't seem to keep stories in open archives long, but there's lots of sports and band stuff and a $200 million local bond issue for the school district (hmmm... do you think that some independent sources may have written something about that?). The high school is over 100 years old, has changed campuses three or more times, and has over 3000 students. It needs local editors to find sources for encyclopedic information that they already know of or to do more focussed searched for what they know must be there. I'm sure that the story of its growth and the development of the other four high schools in the district must be incredibly boring, compared to, say, Japanese football, but the simple solution to a strong personal aversoin to school articles is to click the random article button and read up on the Pokemon character or 1950s soap opera or whatever. This article should have been tagged some other way to ask for cleanup or citations. Is is very annoying to have to do crisis managment like this whenever a high school gets put on AfD with no prior effort to improve things.--<a href="../../../h/j/a/User%7EHjal_95ba.html" title="User:Hjal">Hjal</a> 08:04, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Nothing in the article indicates why it stands out from its peers. Winning a few championships is not notable: it happens to every school from time to time. We need to see real notability ( a special partnership with industry, special teaching methods, a tradition of producing great athletes or biochemists or whatever - just give us something that marks the school out ). Importance in the local community is not enough ( if it were there'd be an article about every local bar and post office ): we need to know why someone who isn't from the local community should be interested. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 15:46, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>That's rather the point of the debate, I think. Is Wikipedia limited solely to topics of a "large" interest, or are obscure-to-those-who-don't-live-there articles allowed? If so, where is the "large" drawn? Major cities? States? Countries? There are sovereign nations in the world whose population is dwarfed by the mildly-recognized suburb I live in. Who gets priority? Honestly, I don't see a problem with Wikipedia having an article about every local bar and post office. Computers can contain and organize huge amounts of data; the search function here and in major search engines is so good that there's not "wading through the crap" any longer. I think there should be a bias towards more information and more articles on more subjects, not less. <a href="../../../w/y/v/User%7EWyv_8748.html" title="User:Wyv">Wyv</a> 01:07, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per commenters above. I really don't want to say "If we delete x, we have to delete y too", but since LHS is in the same district as Hebron and Marcus high schools (which are highly notable, at least in texas), it shouldn't be deleted (at least on because of a lack of notability). Until there is a set critera on what makes a school notable or not, it is better just to only delete the poorly written ones for now. <a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadernet_f2d6.html" title="User:Zadernet"><b><font color="black">Zader</font></b></a><a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadernet_Concordia_c1a6.html" title="User:Zadernet/Concordia"><b><font color="blue">n</font></b></a><a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadernet_f2d6.html" title="User:Zadernet"><b><font color="black">et</font></b></a> 02:01, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Response</b> For what it's worth, there is a proposed criteria for schools at <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a>, and this high school fails each one. In absence of a notability policy for schools, we have to go by <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, which requires the school to be the subject of multiple, independent and non-trivial coverage, which isn't the case here. Most of the information comes from self-published sources, and the one (i.e., not multiple) independent source that's cited makes no case for the school's notability - what school hasn't had some sort of construction done?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Being in the same district as other schools doesn't cut it either, because notability doesn't transfer simply because of geographical proximity. And the school having a band or a state champion football team doesn't really separate the school from any other.</dd>
<dd>While the opinions here are overwhelmingly in favor of keep, you can find the majority of those arguments in <a href="../../../a/r/g/Wikipedia%7EArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions_1a86.html" title="Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions">Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions</a>, including <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">WP:USEFUL</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/g/Wikipedia%7EArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions_1a86.html#It_doesn.27t_do_any_harm" title="Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions">WP:NOHARM</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/g/Wikipedia%7EArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions_1a86.html#It_should_be_about_everything" title="Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions">WP:ABOUTEVERYTHING</a>.

<li><b>Re-Response</b> There are more sources now. BTW, you are repeating yourself to little effect. The current <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> is unlikely to get consensus and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> does not require that articles about the construction of a school seem "notable" or interesting to you. The existance of the articles demonstrates "notability" by definition. A school is not a person (or, for that matter, a grandmother). Typical persons (and grandmothers) get a few short mentions in the news over their lives--birth, marriage, death--their construction jobs are not written up unless they are extraordinary, whereas every major school project gets multiple coverage because the community is interested (as they are in championship teams) and the publishers think that it is notable (as in the dictionary, "worthy of note"). And, if you don't like using the "Show preview" button, the next time you add a couple of paragraphs, you might not want to mark the last of five edits "minor."--<a href="../../../h/j/a/User%7EHjal_95ba.html" title="User:Hjal">Hjal</a> 08:39, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm afraid the "Show preview" button didn't show me that those redirects were dead, and I made one error and added a short sentence, those are the three minor errors. And I'm not sure where I'm repeating myself. I simply addressed the arguments made based on Wikipedia policy, and if that's repetitive, well, WP hadn't changed since I last commented.</dd>
<dd>I did notice a section about football records were added, which is at least a claim to notability (though I wonder if the state championship scoring record might be more appropriate in an article about high school football in Texas and I'm actually surprised there isn't one).</dd>
<dd>The question you have to ask though, is what distinguishes this high school from other schools? Why should anyone who doesn't have vested interest in the school care. <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuyvesant_High_School_9363.html" title="Stuyvesant High School">Stuyvesant High School</a> has multiple Nobel-winning graduates. <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenbrook_North_High_School_3d0b.html" title="Glenbrook North High School">Glenbrook North High School</a> has pop culture significance and national notoriety through a hazing incident. <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Rock_Central_High_School_2610.html" title="Little Rock Central High School">Little Rock Central High School</a> has historical significance. You can certainly make a case with the football record, though honestly, I'm not sure if that's enough. But that's up to the closing admin to decide.</dd>
<dd>And remember that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is a minimum threshold, not a "Two articles and you're in" pass. Mentions in the local paper are certainly worth considering, but construction news and sports scores are trivial to all but those within the community. <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> (<a href="../../../y/t/n/User_talk%7EYtny_624b.html" title="User talk:Ytny">talk</a>) 23:46, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We all know that Stephen Colbert is the most important and influential human who ever lived, and that his pearls of wisdom rival those of Ghandi, his put-downs surpass those of Wilde and Beecham, and every word he utters is peerless prose to be cherished for ever, but nonetheless I don't think we need an article for <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">things made up on the Colbert Report one day</a>.

It had a speedy tag, but due to controversy (especially from <a href="http://www.geekzone.co.nz/freitasm/2154" class="external text" title="http://www.geekzone.co.nz/freitasm/2154" rel="nofollow">Geek Zone</a>), I am submitting this to AFD.

<dd><b>A call for calm:</b> As the person who added this to AFD and reversed the speedy deletion nomination, could I please remind people to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>? Some people saw it as having no real context, or being advertising. That in itself could be argued to be against good faith, but in my opinion honest mistakes happen and that's what I'm seeing here. There is no conspiracy to remove new articles from Wikipedia! Some articles are appropriate, and others are not appropriate. Many people (so far) have agreed with my suggestion to merge, so it doesn't do anyone any good to say that there is a group of editors on Wikipedia with a vendetta against Wikipedia!!!!! Please, everyone calm down. I know how these things go, as I've gotten upset over AFDs also, so I have some sympathy. However, every time I've been upset I've gotten up a lot of people's noses and either my behaviour (or percieved behaviour) has caused people to argue for deletion, or has caused a redo of the AFD.

<li>The controversy stems from the lack of due process - so far, I've seen no real justification for deleting the article. I can assure everyone that there is no spamming, promotion or advertising going on here. Please assist by explaining why the article is objectionable. It's not the greatest thing that's ever happened in the world, but it does have significance to Kiwis, and other such <a href="../../../u/n/c/Unconference.html" title="Unconference">unconferences</a> are listed in Wikipedia already. If New Zealand events with historical bearing are not considered important and Wikipedia intends to delete all other similar things entries as listed in the <a href="../../../u/n/c/Unconference.html" title="Unconference">unconference</a> entry in the name of consistency, fine, I'll accept that.<a href="../../../j/u/h/User%7EJuhaSaarinen_1a66.html" title="User:JuhaSaarinen">Juha</a> 08:40, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Ta bu shi da yu: Firstly, thanks for your more helpful tone. In my view we have been subject to needlessly hostile editing today. (I should note that my own name did not appear in the original text; it was in the new text created by Juha after mine was deleted.) I have written an entry outlining what happened and noting significant elements of the event on the Talk page for the original article - if I need to reiterate that information here, just let me know and I'll do so. Please accept that we are simply trying to create a concise article relating to an important event for the New Zealand tech community, and one which will take place annually. If required, I am happy to write a studiedly neutral new entry for the event (I am a working journalist), but I genuinely struggle to seen where Juha or I have done anything wrong. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussb10_eac8.html" title="User:Russb10">Russb10</a> 09:08, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, firstly, nobody has done anything wrong. It was perfectly fine to create a new article, but then it was perfectly find for someone to think it was spam (though perhaps not in saying so out loud, as this is really going against <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>). However, notability is a bit of a vague and nebulous concept on Wikipedia (and in fact, pretty much everywhere). For instance, my wife (if she would ever edit Wikipedia, bless her soul) would not find Kiwi Foo Camp notable, whereas I do find it somewhat notable, though not enough for an article in it's own right. The problem with the existence of the article is not with it's neutrality - this can always be fixed - but with determining just <i>where</i> the article should exist on Wikipedia. My take is it should go into <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foo_Camp_8e2d.html" title="Foo Camp">Foo Camp</a>, until it picks up over a few years. After a few years, it could then by <a href="../../../s/p/l/Wikipedia%7ESplitting_article_cd41.html" title="Wikipedia:Splitting article">split</a>, but only after some consensus. Would there be a problem with merging it into <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foo_Camp_8e2d.html" title="Foo Camp">Foo Camp</a>? - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 09:43, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ta bu shi da yu: I guess it would be an adequate result for the article to be merged with the main Foo Camp article, even if the two events have different organisational teams and take place in different countries. But you wrote this on Geekzone: <i>Your article may be found notable, but one of the arguments on the talk page should not be used - the argument that the Foo Camp article was how people found out about Kiwi Foo Camp.</i> This isn't what I said, so allow me to clarify: The main Wikipedia Foo Camp article is Google's top result for the relevant search: it is the most linked-information about Foo Camp, and by definition the primary means by which people find out what Foo Camp is. For a hostile editor to muse that it is "spam" and therefore ripe for deletion seems destructive in the extreme to me. I appreciate everything you say about Wikipedia's status as an encylopedia, but I really think you could be a little stronger in your criticism of the unfair and irrational editing that has gone on today.<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussb10_eac8.html" title="User:Russb10">Russb10</a> 09:52, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I too was stunned to see a good-faith article being labelled as spam when it clearly didn't hawk anything. That said, maybe the best thing is to learn from what happened and be glad that the Wikipedia process worked in the end and brought the article to the AFD stage. Not that I understand how that happened, but either way, if it causes too much grief to have the <a href="../../../k/i/w/Kiwi_Foo_Camp_8fe3.html" title="Kiwi Foo Camp">Kiwi Foo Camp</a> as a separate article, merging with the main <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foo_Camp_8e2d.html" title="Foo Camp">Foo Camp</a> one seems to be an acceptable compromise.</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>In case it's necessary information, like Russell I too am a working journalist in New Zealand. I have no connection with O'Reilly or any other entity represented at the Kiwi Foo Camp. There is a not so nice irony in that Wikipedia was held up to the Hon Judith Tizard as a contrast to the state-sponsored <a href="../../../t/e/_/Te_Ara_641e.html" title="Te Ara">Te Ara</a> online encyclopaedia of New Zealand... the former being much more useful to Kiwis than the latter due to the richness of the content. --<a href="../../../j/u/h/User%7EJuhaSaarinen_1a66.html" title="User:JuhaSaarinen">Juha</a> 10:12, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Alright, in the course of seeking to do the right thing here, I have read the grounds for speedy deletion in the Deletion policy: <i>Pages that are suitable for immediate deletion and which can obviously be deleted on sight (see criteria for speedy deletion; examples include patent nonsense, advertising, pure vandalism and certain housekeeping situations</i> - or, as the line below sums it up, "utter rubbish". This is simply not an accurate description of the original article, yet it was marked for speedy deletion within minutes of creation. It was then, so far as I can tell, deleted even though the hangon tag had been posted, and while it was being edited. New text was then retagged for speedy deletion on completely different grounds. The <i>only</i> reason this article has gone to AFD is this hostile editing.<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussb10_eac8.html" title="User:Russb10">Russb10</a> 11:08, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>First, I have nothing to do with Kiwi Foo Camp, I didn't help organise it and I didn't attend. However I would like to make some observations... Whether something is notable or not is a very relative thing that relies on what people are interested in. Personally, I don't find some things that are in 'real' encyclopedias all that notable, never mind Wikipedia. The beauty of Wikipedia is that it is digital allowing millions or billions of pages. 'Real' encyclopeidas are limited in size and therefore someone has to decide what is notable and what is not (or what they believe SHOULD be notable) for the average reader of that encyclopedia. Wikipedia allows us to search through thousands of artists and read about their different albums. A 'real' encyclopedia might have an article about The Beatles but not every single one of their albums. A 'real' encyclopedia might have a entry about a popular TV show but wont list all the episodes along with information about what happened in them and when they were first aired. If something is notable to a group of people, not neccersarily you or a Wikipedia admin, and isn't spam or advertising, then it should be allowed on Wikipeida. If you aren't personally interested in this topic, you don't have to read it. Stop applying old thinking to a new, digital, medium. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteremcc_2d55.html" title="User:Peteremcc">Peteremcc</a> 12:24, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> - This article is incomprehensible. There is no context whatsoever for me to even determine if it is notable or not. It has no sources.

<ul>
<li>Dmz5: It would have been nice to have the chance for a cleanup. The article has been under threat of speedy deletion since a few minutes after its creation, and the original text, which was concise and straightforward, was summarily deleted. The article was then deleted again, while it was being edited. Had it been allowed to exist for so much as a day without this aggressive behaviour, it might have been possible to make a better decision on its merit. I am happy to join a consensus on a <b>merge</b> if it means some text can actually be worked on (I'm assuming our hostile editor is also bound by this consensus and won't then try and delete the main article). Assuming the decision is to merge, who then does that job?<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussb10_eac8.html" title="User:Russb10">Russb10</a> 20:53, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I don't feel strongly about this; if the article was cleaned up more and given additional sources, then it could be kept. When I first saw the article, it was rather difficult to determine what the article is about. The very first, deleted, version was better in my opinion. I've cleaned it up a little bit.

<li>That might seem like a chicken and egg scenario, but there are very many articles which have been saved from AfD because someone improves them substantially during the process. Also, no one is really arguing for outright deletion of this article any more, only for merge, so the contents are likely to be retained whether as this article or as a subsection of Foo Camp.</li>
<li>Nothing is likely to happen in terms of deletion or merging for five days from the creation of this AfD. If the press hasn't covered the event by then, I doubt that they will do so.</li>

<li>It's interesting to note that Jimbo Wales attended the 2005 Foo Camp, and appears to be arguing that the presence of someone at a Foo Camp helps to establish their notability <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jane_mcgonigal_1ce3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jane mcgonigal">here</a>.

<li>As noted elsewhere, the original text was mine. Yes, there is sourcing material steadily emerging (the event concluded only two days ago), including mainstream press and online coverage. Minister Cunliffe's undertaking to focus on internet peering policy (sourcing is available for the precise quote) signals a significant regulatory direction. But I agree: it's difficult to justify working on it when it has already been summarily deleted twice in a day. I'd also appreciate some guidance on what coverage is considered robust: do detailed blog entries count, or must it be conventional media? One potential issue with merging is that it seems likely that it will quickly outgrow the main Foo Camp entry, to the point where it may have to be split again.<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussb10_eac8.html" title="User:Russb10">Russb10</a> 23:42, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, blogs are not normally considered acceptable. See <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable sources</a>. Ideally, there would be an article on nzherald.co.nz, since Herald articles stay online indefinitely, but an article on (for example) stuff.co.nz (which removes material after about a week), or which wasn't online at all but could be looked up in a public library would be fine. Something on a radio program would be better than nothing. I don't know enough about Idealog to know whether it qualifies as a reliable source, but I linked to your article in it anyway since it has more detail than the Wikipedia article.</li>
<li>Yes, merging to the Foo Camp article will unbalance that article in the short term. However, having such a detailed report of one event may inspire others to add similar reports of other events. I assume that there will be a main 2007 Foo Camp, which is yet to happen. If the New Zealand event does become annual, then it very likely will be split out again, but the intention of the organisers immediately following the first event is not a strong guarantee that repeats will happen.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User_talk%7EGadfium_49fb.html" title="User talk:Gadfium"><font face="cursive" color="#808080">gadfium</font></a> 00:51, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I could live with a merge-and-split, and I fully understand your caution, but a 2008 event does seem far more likely than not. At least one lead sponsor has already committed, as have several overseas guests who couldn't make it this year, and the venue is available again.

<li><b>Re: A call for calm:</b> Ta bu shi da yu, I was grateful for you starting the AFD process so we could at least bring some sense to proceedings. I did assume good fath when I saw the original speedy deletion notice and immediately tried to meet the request (even though, as gadfium implies above, the original text was not, as policy requires, anything like "utter rubbish"). But what happened subsequently - including the deletion of the article twice while it was under a "hangon" tag, and the borderline abusive attitude of one editor, who came up with serial justifications for the article's summary removal - is a bit hard to square with an honest mistake. This has been a confusing and not particularly happy experience, but I'll draw a line under it now. I'm happy to be held to a high standard and just get on with putting together a good article.<a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussb10_eac8.html" title="User:Russb10">Russb10</a> 02:38, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - this event is much more notable than many which have survived the AfD process. I think that the presence of a serving Government minister and some of New Zealand's most successful business leaders is enough to establish notability. I am uncomfortable with the tinge of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a> about the article itself, but in this case I'm confident that will change as the long weekend ends in New Zealand and press coverage comes in. <a href="../../../o/r/p/User%7EOrpheus_fee3.html" title="User:Orpheus">Orpheus</a> 00:31, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

I'd also argue that this is an area where expert bloggers (and there were many of those) are <i>more</i> likely to be credible than mainstream journalists. But I gather <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_DiBona_02a8.html" title="Chris DiBona">Chris DiBona</a> will be discussing the event on TVNZ's Business programme tomorrow morning, and I'll link to the video when it appears online.

<p><b>Please keep:</b>This event was invitation only and happened during a public holiday /long weekend which may help explain the delay in external reports. It is notable in bringing together 150 of the NZ internet leadership entrepreneurs in a small but geographically spread country. Mamy of these people had not met face to face previously. As such it is much more significant for NZ impacts than perhaps the related conferences in the U.S. It could be included inside the main <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foo_Camp_8e2d.html" title="Foo Camp">Foo Camp</a> article but deserves at least a section of its own. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakemp50cz_cace.html" title="User:Jakemp50cz">Jakemp50cz</a> 01:08, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I think the relevance and context of this article would be improved if the original Foo Camp entry were to provide a clearer definition of the <i>Foo Camp</i> concept. At present, it explains who initiated it and why, but not exactly what it is; you have to go to the "unconference" page to learn that a Foo Camp is differentiated from an unconference in that it is an invite-only event (there may be more to the idea than this also! I should note that I've only reviewed these pages because I was interested in the debate, and the topic itself is new to me). I can see how the main Foo Camp entry could be considered to be bordering on self-promotion, as it does kinda come across as "Tim O'Reilly's Big Idea" - but in my view, better presentation of Foo Camp as a concept in its own right (followed by the introduction of O'Reilly and his team as the creators of the concept) would make the entry more informative and encyclopaedic in style. This would also provide a better context for the Kiwi Foo Camp article, either merged or (a less cumbersome alternative, I think) as a page in its own right.SM Flynn 01:43, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Colour me totally bemused by this little storm. There is nothing contentious at all in the nody of the article or the subject. This has been a significant event for the NZ tech industry, as an attendee I have already been asked to talk about what happened at foo camp. For a country of about 4 milliion with a thriving little IT industry events like this one stand out hugely, as does the native and overseas guest list. To some extent Wikipedia is recording IT history in our country the making. If we can have entries on Wikipedia about trainspotting (that is of no interest to myslef or my wife) then I am totally surprised that information regarding kiwifoo camp is contentious. Donnz 04:37, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Out of interest, why do you call it a "storm"? Deletion is a normal part of Wikipedia. No regular Wikipedian is making a big deal out of this! I should point out, however, that we are not a news source. Try another site for this sort of thing. If the event is notable, then it should be kept, just don't say that we are here to record IT history "as it happens". That will almost <i>never</i> be the case! - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 06:10, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well, just because a few people have signed up to edit does not mean they have not followed Wikipedia for years or understood and followed many of the debates that have take place. This one has been a surprise and I stick to my "storm" the analogy. By the way, when I was researching what the hell foo camp was in the first place I came to wikipedia, and sure enough there was an entry with some very useful information for me. No reason why that information on kiwifoo should not be available to others in the future. Seems to be a very US centric POV to suggest a merge into the foo camp article.

<li><b>Comment</b> (since I have alreadyed voted to merge). I am concerned about this article in several ways. The first is that participants at it are obviously basking in the post-conference glow and are predicting that major NZ IT policy changes will come out of the conference, this remains to be seen. The second is that since the conference was private and has a minimal website or other presence it will be difficult to varify (especially after a year or two) what occured or even who attended, current information is a few photos and half a dozen pages of summary. Compare the conference say to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_National_Party_f015.html" title="New Zealand National Party">National</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Labour_Party_8ef8.html" title="New Zealand Labour Party">Labour</a> annual caucus retreat, they have plenty of cabinet ministers and their effect on NZs future is likely to be much greater. The knowledge Wave conference a few years ago also had a lot of hype that didn't pan out. I really think the article should be kept merged in until it is obvious it had a lasting affect. BTW to those new to wikipedia, this sort of debate is normal, imagine a newspaper getting a glowing report from a conference that included the phrase "meeting marks a historical turning point for a country" , should the paper accept and print it as gospel? - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonLyall_811c.html" title="User:SimonLyall">SimonLyall</a> 09:24, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. There is actually strong case for deletion, maybe it will be mreged, and no case to keep it. The page is total dreck, unencyclopedic, and it doesn't belong here. And I suggest that you don't write long ditribes insulting the other editors and cluttering the page. The afd guidelines do discourage those with a vested interest (like creating the article) from voting, or at least having their opinions discounted. And if you don't like it, tough. There's plenty of other notable articles to create or fix, and this is not one of them. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 23:36, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comments</b></li>
</ul>
<p>A first proposal for deletion has already been answered on the talk page of the article. I reproduce the original proposal and its rebuttal here.</p>
Original Proposal:
<blockquote>
<p>essay, nn, uncyclopedic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rebuttal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I object to this proposal for deletion. I refute the arguments put forward for deltion as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>essay. By essay, I presume that the proposer is referring to the policy that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_publisher_of_original_thought_Wikipedia" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">is not to contain essays stating a personal opinion</a>. This article is not an essay and contains no personal opinion. Every sentence is a fact and is drawn from a reference independent of the author, as such the accusation of essay status is false.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>nn. I presume 'nn' means <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">non-notable</a>. Notability states "if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other." This article draws from four independent sources. In addition three of the sources are peer reviewed. As such the article well and truly exceeds the criteria for notability and has a stronger claim to notability than most Wikipedia articles.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>uncyclopedic. According to the Category:Articles_which_may_be_unencyclopedic page, unencyclopedic means the article fails to pass <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>. The claim of unencyclopedic is false as the article passes all these tests. The proposer needs to point out which, if any, tests on <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> this article fails.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As directed in the template: "You may remove this message if you improve the article, or if you otherwise object to deletion of the article for any reason.", so I am removing the template.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original proposer has gone on to reinstate the proposal and modify the reasons given. The proposer seems to be taking a shotgun approach, where if enough allegations are made one will hit the target. To answer this new set of allegations:</p>
<p>nn. Already answered above. This article exceeds the notability guidelines.</p>
<p>very specialized. Specialization has <b>never</b> been a reason to delete from Wikipedia. By the same criteria any one of thousands of physics, mathematics, or any field of endeavour that requires a high level qualification would also have to be deleted.</p>
<p>borders on original research. Nearly every aspect of the article comes from a peer reviewed publication. The allegation of original research is baseless. One or two statements do not yet have references, but these are not original research and are definitely not grounds for deletion. Again, if every article that had a minority of unsourced statements was deleted nearly every Wikipedia article would have to be deleted.</p>
<p>essay. Answered above. There is no point of view or personal opinion being pushed in the article. Essay seems to be the proposors personal point of view, with no objective basis.</p>
<p>doesn't need it's own article. Personal opinion of the proposer. Please back this up with reasons based on Wikipedia policy.</p>
<p>Violates various aspects of WP:NOT. A sweeping statement. Please state exactly which aspects of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> are being violated.</p>
<p>I will point out that the proposer has made no attempt to answer the rebuttal given to the original proposal to delete. Instead the proposer put up another proposal with modified reasons. The proposer seems to think that it is not necessary to justify his/her position but that it is sufficient to just repeat it.</p>
<p>To quote from <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">Wikipedia:Deletion_process</a>: "deletion is based upon policy and not personal likes and dislikes." and "So deletion is not a strict "count of votes", but rather a judgement based upon experience and taking into account the policy-related points made by those contributing."</p>
<p>What it says is that the deletion process is not a popularity contest. Rather it is to be policy based. Let me answer each commenter:</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a>: You are putting words into my mouth. Your conclusion is baseless. Yes I did create the article. No I don't have a vested interest in it and personally have no interest in professional wrestling. I am defending this article to prevent abuse of the Wikipedia deletion process. Every objection you have to the article has been answered, yet your only response is to repeat the allegations louder. As per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">Wikipedia:Deletion_process</a> you need to prove that the article violates policy and not attack the messenger.</p>
<p>Simply calling for deletion is not a positive contribution to Wikipedia. At the minimum you need to be able to back a call for deletion with valid arguments. Better still contribute to improve the article in question.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a>: Merge into <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_object_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Foreign object (professional wrestling)">Foreign object (professional wrestling)</a>. That is a useful suggestion.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> A source does not have to be specifically about a topic. For example, many species of plants or animals only get a passing mention in publications, but would rate a mention in Wikipedia. Be careful that your opposition is not subjective.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatsnumbereleven_aa67.html" title="User:Batsnumbereleven">Dave.</a> As above for your point about sources. A useful point about the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_wrestling.html" title="Hardcore wrestling">Hardcore wrestling</a> article, though overlap between articles is not a reason for deletion. Being a complete subset might be. Articles may need to repeat material to be self contained.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmedea_0f30.html" title="User:Madmedea">Madmedea</a> You point about notability has been refuted. If this article violates the notability guideline, so do most in Wikipedia.</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> this is not a popularity vote, so "as per above" does not contribute anything new to the discussion.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> That is a personal opinion and has no place in this discussion. Please back your position by referring to policy.</p>
<p>To restate. The only "vested" interest I have is to prevent abuse of the wikipedia deletion process. So far there is no case for deletion and a weak case for a merge. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Dalton_7b14.html" title="User:John Dalton">John Dalton</a> 22:32, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have real concerns with the direction the AfD process heads at times. My understanding is that the AfD process is not about voting. As such there is no need for abstention from voting due to interest. Rather than being a vote the keep/delete statement is a one word summary so each reader knows where the commenter is coming from. I understand the AfD process to be about putting forward the pros and cons of deleting an article in accordance with wikipedia policy. Once the cycle of pros and cons has run its course hopefully a clear answer has emerged on what to do. It concerns me that some see the process as a "yes/no" vote where the majority rules. Are my concerns shared? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Dalton_7b14.html" title="User:John Dalton">John Dalton</a> 07:01, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Here are some questions to consider. What if there was an article called <i>"Use Of Daggers By Roman Gladiators"</i>. Would you have the same feelings towards that article as to this one? Are your attitudes towards this article being influenced by wrestling being seen as "common man's" entertainment? Do you think the "scholarly" field of gladiators is more worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia than today's wrestlers? Why? Hopefully these questions will aid people's objectivity. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Dalton_7b14.html" title="User:John Dalton">John Dalton</a> 01:32, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If the use of daggers was a side-issue in terms of the overall topic of gladiatorial combat, and there was already an article about the use of other weapons or other styles of gladiatorial combat than the norm, then yes, I would feel the same. Hence my suggestion that this can be covered in or merged with <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_wrestling.html" title="Hardcore wrestling">Hardcore wrestling</a> or <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_object_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Foreign object (professional wrestling)">Foreign object (professional wrestling)</a>.

<dd><b>Keep</b> I would like to protest the decision to suggest this article for deletion for a second time.

<dd>The convention is small, but so are most conventions in the United Kingdom, most of which have their own articles which have never been prompted for deletion. This is also the largest and first convention on the island of Ireland and is recognized for that fact across the British Isles and beyond. I have put a lot of work into this article, as a lot of other people have so please forgive me for sounding more than a little upset here.

<dd>The previous AfD was put up for deletion in suspected bad faith. However, even if it is Northern Ireland's only anime con, it still doesn't establish notoriety because it has less than 500 attendants and is only had one year. I have only put up a handful of UK events, because if you take a look at <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minami_Con_3270.html" title="Minami Con">Minami Con</a>, you'll notice that it has less than 500 attendants, but because it is the oldest in the country, I ignored it.</dd>
<dd>Also, there is no bias here just in case--I am an Irish citizen as well as Canadian. Any UK or Irish con is being put up due to its notoriety. Being the first convention on the isle doesn't establish notoriety simply because it is not the first UK con, which Northern Ireland is a part of. If this convention was say in Cork or Dublin, then I'd be leaving it alone.&#160;:: <em><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Keigher_bca8.html" title="User:Colin Keigher">Colin Keigher</a></em> <font color="red"><b>(<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_Keigher_2a62.html" title="User talk:Colin Keigher">Talk</a>)</b></font> 18:16, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have to completely disagree with you. Tomo-Dachi was the first anime convention to ever be held on the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island_of_Ireland_ae49.html" title="Island of Ireland">Island of Ireland</a> which is a separate entity to any political borders; even Wikipedia has its own article on the Island as well as the countries that are on it. By your logic a convention could never claim to be the first on <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> because one side is Turkish controlled and the other Greek.</dd>

<dd>I did not mean to suggest that you were bias but I feel that you are wrong to nominate this convention based on a numbers game as you clearly stated in your deletion reason. And to correct you, Tomo-Dachi has run twice, and a third time due this summer. This is not a one off con but an established one and the largest in Ireland. <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButch-cassidy_450c.html" title="User:Butch-cassidy">Butch-cassidy</a></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Convention's status as the first convention in Ireland gives it notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> it's not the first in the United Kingdom, which Northern Ireland is a part of. Northern Ireland may be on the Isle of Eire, but it is not a part of the Republic of Ireland.

<li><b>Comment</b> Northern Ireland is <i>also</i> a part of the <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">island of Ireland</a>, and Tomo-Dachi was the first anime convention to take place on the land mass. It was started before any conventions in the Republic of Ireland, so bringing Dublin into the discussion is confusing the issue. I can see no strong argument for removing this article, and you've certainly done nothing to provide one. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAniki21_c4e4.html" title="User:Aniki21">aniki21</a> 15:00, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I haven't yet decided on this one. However, I do want to say that attendance figures aren't the sole measure of notability. Since this is the first and only convention in Northern Ireland, it is notable. But the biggest problem I have with the article is lack of references to reliable third-party sources. If I do decide for delete, it would be for that reason alone. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 13:31, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>: I really want to be nice and just say keep, but I really can't see <i>any</i> anime convention really being notable enough to warrent its own article.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> (bordering on <i>abstain</i>), there referneces are rather tricky to check up on. Another user on the previous AfD mentioned trouble finding out if the sources even exist. Plus there is the whole hosting on tripod which raises doubts. As is the nature of this I've seen nothing conclusive yet to say this should be deleted, merely gut feelings and other parts of it not quite checking up. Hence a weak delete. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 17:53, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

Said books exist, follow that link to see them. I agree that the article doesn't simply reiterate what's written about the group elsewhere - but it did originally include a rather detailed summary of their writings (from the Tripod mirror, sure). There is recorded audio material by a member of the group out there too. And, I'd like to reiterate, the previous AfD for this article was started by a known sockpuppet, and the votes were 4-2 for a keep. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidicke_409e.html" title="User:Davidicke">Davidicke</a> 23:25, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> like I said in the first AfD, I had trouble verifying the sources. The fact that it's hosted on Tripod is also a concern. With domains being so cheap (less than $20 if you shop around), it's tough to imagine any notable organisation relying on Tripod to host its official site. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 19:29, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - it is obvious that not all the books listed under "references" have actually been used as references, or the article would be a lot longer. If no one can independantly verify this (or at the very least, track down one of those books) the article could certainly be deleted.-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 20:08, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. At least some of the sources are real. That said, this article needs substantial cleanup. The sources need independent evaluation, and the article needs to make note that much of the writings about the group from outside the occult community focus on concerns over how it hybridizes occultism with white supremecy. References to start with include <i>Investigating Religious Terrorism and Ritualistic Crimes</i> by Perlmutter, Dawn (CRC Press, 2003. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 978-0849310348</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm the one who put forward the deletion review, and I wanted to note that one person in the first AfD said, "The article clearly meets the Wikipedia criteria for notability given the range of published non-partisan sources listed."

<p>This article has a assertion of notability at the beginning which is the only reason I didn't place a speedy tag on it. I'm not sure if it is the language barrier or what, but much of the article is just silly: "His father attacked a cat in his own yard. Ian is said to have been traumatised, watching his father go mad after the cat. Ian's mother was really angry because the cat ruined their beautiful garden." Completely unsourced.

<li><b>Delete</b> hotels can be somewhat of a grey area, so I checked their website, and according to <a href="http://www.aquarius-guesthouse.com/roomrate.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.aquarius-guesthouse.com/roomrate.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> they have just 26 rooms.

<li><b>Comment</b>, is a gay hotel which means it targets a niche. As such I wouldn't be surprised if a review existed in a gay magazne somewhere.

<li>There's a difference between an encyclopaedia article on a particular slang, and a dictionary of slang words. A list of slang words is the latter, not the former. Notice that <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lankan_Tamil_slang_26b0.html" title="Sri Lankan Tamil slang">Sri Lankan Tamil slang</a> actually makes <i>some</i> attempt to discuss the slang.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> since it provides one source. The fact that the article discusses non-English words is <i>never</i> a valid deletion argument.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This is a tough one. Ultimately, it's just fancruft of the highest form. However, many, many other pages have sctions on pop-culture references and this would likely be in the AC/DC article itself except it's too long.--<a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVelvet_elvis81_65b4.html" title="User:Velvet elvis81">Velvet elvis81</a> 17:04, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - while the potential for inclusionary criteria may be limitless, it does not necessarily mean information is collected on the article indiscriminately. One-off live performances, for example, are deleted, as are other non-notable references to the band. Everything is well-referenced, and the information included in the article is useful — it shows AC/DC's influence over film and television directors/writers and also their influence over other musicians. Again, only the notable references to the band have been covered, not trivial/mundane ones. At the very least, if the editors here do not think the information warrants its own article, I think part of the article should be merged into the main <a href="../../../a/c/2F/AC_DC_2284.html" title="AC/DC">AC/DC</a> page, as in my opinion showing a band's influence on popular culture is quite important. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51"><b>ĤĶ</b><i>51</i>→</a><sup><a href="../../../h/k/5/User_talk%7EHK51_1c98.html" title="User talk:HK51">Łalk</a></sup> 23:20, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article does not establish notability. There are about 100 Playtech casinos, all pretty much identical. Casino Tropez is just one of many that is no more interesting than the rest. A search at <a href="http://online.casinocity.com/search.cfm" class="external free" title="http://online.casinocity.com/search.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://online.casinocity.com/search.cfm</a> will pull up a list. It would not be appropriate IMO to list this one, as it's hard to then argue against the inclusion of the other 100, which are no less (or more) notable.</p>
<p>Some Playtech casinos are more notable than this of course, such as Betfred (which has three wikipedia articles relating to sporting events it sponsors), as well as a substantial b&amp;m presence in the UK, and a notable founder, Fred Done (<a href="http://www.inside-edge-mag.co.uk/football/features/93/the_players.html" class="external free" title="http://www.inside-edge-mag.co.uk/football/features/93/the_players.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.inside-edge-mag.co.uk/football/features/93/the_players.html</a>). Golden Palace would be another example of a notable Playtech casino.</p>
<p>OTOH, a google search for "Casino Tropez" <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22casino+tropez%22&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22casino+tropez%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> brings up nothing but gambling spam.</p>
<p>The article will never become anything useful, and all relevant content is in the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playtech.html" title="Playtech">Playtech</a> page. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 23:24, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Redirect</b>. While the above is not accurate (the article establishes notoriety via the eGaming Review reference), and its pure nonsense to say the search brings up nothing but "gambling spam", since the company is privately held and does not have the more significant notoriety of, for example, Golden Palace, it doesn't meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> with any certainty. It isn't that far away though, so I would redirect it to <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playtech.html" title="Playtech">Playtech</a> until such time as the company plainly meets <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 09:40, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not sure that being number 40 in eGaming Review's top 50 establishes notability. Such publications are notorious for being advertising driven - pay for placement, there's not a single 'top x' casino article I've seen not driven by sponsorship. Here's a good example: <a href="http://online.casinocity.com/news/news.cfm?ArticleId=67959" class="external free" title="http://online.casinocity.com/news/news.cfm?ArticleId=67959" rel="nofollow">http://online.casinocity.com/news/news.cfm?ArticleId=67959</a> "Slotland.com has been nominated in the “Best Mobile Operator of the Year” category of the prestigious annual eGaming Review Awards". Hmm, really. Slotland casino is awful, horrible software, poor games, notable only for paying massive commissions of 25% of deposits (not profit - deposits!), and hence popular with affiliates.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, even if it is a fair source, I don't believe there are even 40 online casinos listed on wikipedia, and for good reason (spam with little to distinguish most of them, as they are just skins on the underlying software - all Playtech, Microgaming, etc. casinos are pretty much identical). <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 11:27, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Nominated as the question is how famous are really many of these listed cars are, also everybody has their different idea of how famous are these cars are and lets absolutely face it, even supercars like the <a href="../../../e/n/z/Enzo_Ferrari_%28car%29_97d3.html" title="Enzo Ferrari (car)">Enzo Ferrari</a> are far more famous that most of this lot which I don't see a list for as there it is rather pointless. Also this page is one day going to be littered with so-called famous cars that is going to be forgotten by the end of the year (eg all the cars from 2F&amp;2F which I had to remove is all now forgotten).

<p>First post was against the guidelines but it was more of a history of the guy. I found it and posted it. If I did it wrong I then tried to make it right but I guess you guys don't want it. Fits in with this: Notability on Wikipedia for people is based on the following criterion:</p>
<p>The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.1 This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles, books, scholarly papers, and television documentaries2</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> The major media references are enough. Whether or not he is noted as a scientist, or noted as a physician, he would be noted as a video personality on major networks. <i>Six</i> of them. And then, looking at what is called the "badly inappropriate" earlier version, I find in his CV sufficient documentation of notability as a physician. Sure, we don't want the whole thing, but I've added back the key positions, and awards, and editorships, and the over 50 peer-reviewed papers in top-rate journals; and the patents--I almost forgot the 4 or 5 patents. All clinical research, not fundamental science, but that counts just as much. I can get the PubMed citations if challenged. Good case for not relying on speedy for N, &amp; I'm glad someone contested it. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:43, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'd like to put Timeline of trends in music from the United Kingdom for deletion, along with all its subpages. These pages are really crap. Maybe redirecting to <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_the_United_Kingdom_0b09.html" title="Music of the United Kingdom">Music of the United Kingdom</a> would be good, but otherwise the page needs massive reshuffling - the music trends dealt with in these pages is just <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_music.html" title="Folk music">folk music</a>, and doesn't seem to mention any other sorts of music. I've talked with the <a href="../../../o/g/g/User_talk%7EOgg_5334.html" title="User talk:Ogg">article creator</a>, but deletion may be the best thing to do with this, IMHO <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontchav_896a.html" title="User:Montchav">Montchav</a> 14:26, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Its not a bad encyclopedia topic, its just badly organized and lacks much information. It also isn't written into sentences. This should be flattened to maybe three articles, one for 1500-1899 for all three regions, one from 1900-1959, and one from 1960 on. It needs sentences, complete with capitol letters, commas, verbs, and periods, like this one. But it doesn't really fall into an encyclopedic category or any other criterion for deletion.--<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECastAStone_9a4a.html" title="User:CastAStone">CastAStone</a>|<a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECastAStone_a48a.html" title="User talk:CastAStone"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:12, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems inevitable that occasionally you will find one whose original author has lost interest in it, and no one has stepped forth to move it ahead. It also seems inevitable that you will find a page whose focus has changed from what the originator had in mind. This may have happened to these pages. Neither of these events is grounds for deletion. Timelines for music, though, serve valuable indexing functions and serve the needs of human browsers. Not averse to merging the pages per CastAStone's suggestion. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 17:06, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's just ridiculous. I've seen many emulators that don't have a website and post all news and releases on big emulation boards. Keep in mind that we're not talking about the latest NASA shuttle here. It's an emulator. I'm fine with following Wikipedia's standards and all but sometimes you need to use common sens too. In the emulation scene, places like Emutalk and Emuforums are reliable sources. You can't expect the emulator to make the frontpage news of the New York Times. --Chrono Archangel 7 February 2007

<li>Maybe and maybe not, but that's covered by the fact that <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">inclusion is not an indicator of notability</a> anyway.

<li>"'Keep'"The claim is true, and can be backed up by either talking with celebrities or by referring to the myspace page for photos.

<li><b>Difficult keep</b> while Wikipedia <i>is not</i> an encyclopaedia or dictionary of slang, this is one of the more widespread terms. The citations aren't so bad (it actually has some compared to many slang articles). The word is not used in English, however it is very widely used (from my experience) in Greek. I'm open to being convinced otherwise, but I think it just about notable enough. However, is there a List of Greek slang that it could possibly be merged with? - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 16:50, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Of course it's used in Greek: it's a Greek word. That's hardly the point, though, given that this is an English-language encyclopædia.

<dd><i>Kolos tou theou</i> is not used not even in Greece... (where have u heard this term?). <i>Poustis</i> and <i>Poutana</i> are the Greek equivalents of English terms (no need to say which are they), and are used solely in Greece. But the word <i>Malakas</i> has a different meaning than any English word (and may be used in cases were different English words would be used). The fact remains that this is a word the foreigners know, especially those who have been in Greece, or those who live in the centers of the Greek diaspora (principally in USA, Australia, Canada, UK i.e. English-speaking world). <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 18:10, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is one of the most known modern Greek terms in the English-speaking world. For whatever reasons, it has become a very popular word in modern Greek culture, and is used in everyday speech, and not only. as a cultural phenomenon, its origins, usage and derivatives are presented and analyzed. Furthermore, we must have in mind that articles about slang words do exist (e.g. <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_of_a_bitch.html" title="Son of a bitch">son of a bitch</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole.html" title="Asshole">asshole</a>, etc), and I suppose none has called for their deletion... <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 17:31, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To my knowledge, this is the Greek word that most non Greeks know... At least, this is by far the most popular answer I get when I ask them if they know any Greek word (u know, the words 'acropolis', 'democracy', 'philosophy', 'mythology' are considered Greek loanwords in English).

<li><b>Keep</b>. I would definitely be a "delete" if we had an article concentrated on the etymology and the meanings of a word - Wikipedia is not a dictionary; we have Wiktionary. But "malakas" in Greece is something beyond that. Like <a href="../../../z/a/m/Zamanfou.html" title="Zamanfou">zamanfou</a>, this term has become a symbol of a neo-hellenic cultural phainomenon; it constitutes the symbolism of an every-day social attitude, and it illustrates a particular stance towards life. I understand that for a foreigner this is difficult to be understood, but in Greece the terms "malakas", "malakia" etc. are in the center of sociological, political, and even philosophical analysis. The current article may not successsfully illustrate the various aspects of this term, but there is room for improvement.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 19:21, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>WP is an <i>encyclopedia</i>, which means it deals with things and ideas, and with words primarly as a way of referring to things and ideas. The idea of a 'jerk' (for which, by the way, there is not a WP article...) is cross-cultural: compare French 'con', Yiddish 'shmuck', <i>etc.</i> Of course, the nuances of the various words and their usage vary from language to language, but I don't see that they need separate articles; perhaps the current <a href="../../../s/h/m/Shmuck.html" title="Shmuck">shmuck</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malakas.html" title="Malakas">malakas</a> articles should be merged under the <i>English</i> name, 'jerk'.</dd>

<dd>First of all, the search doesn't really tell you much. It includes lots of Greek-written-in-Latin (Greeklish) as well as Libyan, Ethiopian, etc. names. Secondly, frequency of use isn't the issue: there are lots of <i>English</i> words which are much more common, but don't belong in WP, e.g. "within", "putrid", "lukewarm", because they don't express an encyclopedic concept. Finally, even if the Greek word is somehow expressing concept that has a special place in Greek culture, say φιλότιμο or νονός, this is an <i>English</i>-language encyclopedia, so we put the discussion under the English equivalent, even if it isn't exact, <i>e.g.</i> honor, godfather, or in an article like "Anthropology of Greece" or "Pride in Greek culture" or "Greek social structure" or whatever. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 23:08, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So what is the "encyclopedic concept" in <a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole.html" title="Asshole">asshole</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dork.html" title="Dork">dork</a>, <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegitimacy.html#The_term_.22bastard.22" title="Illegitimacy">bastard</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_of_a_bitch.html" title="Son of a bitch">son of a bitch</a>, or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_dozens.html" title="The dozens">the dozens</a>?... And why shouldn't these be added to "Anthropology of English speaking populations" or "Pride in english speaking culture" or "English speaking social structure" or whatever? And why should there be five entries (!) for the same concept in English, and none for the most frequent Greek word? Especially when it's extensively used by the huge <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_diaspora.html" title="Greek diaspora">Greek diaspora</a> in English-speaking countries? And again, what is the <i>harm</i>?

<dd>The only one of those that is encyclopedic is <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_dozens.html" title="The dozens">the dozens</a>, because it is the English name of a very specific phenomenon. As for "bastard", it does <i>not</i> have an article; it is in the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegitimacy.html" title="Illegitimacy">illegitimacy</a> article, as you must have noticed when you made the link. I don't think the others belong in WP under those names. I'd think that at best they belong in an article on Insults (with subsections on U.S., U.K., Japan, Greece, etc.) or English Profanity or something. Use by the Greek diaspora is irrelevant. You can see that it doesn't behave like a normal encyclopedia article in that there are almost no links to it from other articles, except Talk pages. I think the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_profanity.html" title="Spanish profanity">Spanish profanity</a> article is a much better model for organizing this sort of information. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 00:12, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Article provides one reliable and non-trivial source (the Karamitsiou paper), so topic may be notable. "Not English slang" is not a reason for deletion. If a topic has non-trivial coverage in multiple reliable sources, then it's notable.

<li>I'll do my best, in order not to revert you (!), and I will not object this solution, although I'm not sure I agree (well, most probably I disagree!); I still believe that <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malakas.html" title="Malakas">malakas</a> can still stand as an article, maybe as a sub-article of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_profanity.html" title="Greek profanity">Greek profanity</a>, if you treat the socio-cultural(-philosophical) aspects of the term, and you include them in the current article. "Malakas" is not just "Greek profanity". It is something more, and something else; I understand it is difficult for a non-Greek to realize that, but when we see satirical TV shows or even modern Greek movies or even modern theatrical plays, we understand that we have to do with something more than mere "profanity". I think that encyclopedically we choke <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malakas.html" title="Malakas">malakas</a> putting it under the label of "profanity".--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 11:57, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don't question that "malakas" has a special place in people's, um, hearts. The question is simply how to discuss that in an encyclopedia. Interesting that there is no "jerk" article; on the other hand, it is understandable that there is a "nerd" article, because it is talking about an identifiable social phenomenon (which is cross-cultural, by the way). --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 16:30, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment-Arguments for notability</b>. Μελετητής said: "It's a Greek word, not in use in English-speaking countries." Well, I definitely disagree! It depends on how we use the term "use". We, the jurists, we know in our terminology a term "<i>lato sensu</i>". Well, <i>lato sensu</i> of course the word "malakas" is used in English-speaking countries. It is the most notable neo-hellenic word around the world, and, even for the non-Greeks who have visited Greece, "malakas" is something more than a simple word; they understand that they have to do with a socio-cultural term; a word-symbol. I don't say that everybody in the world knows the world, but, yes, many many people around the world, beyond Greeks themselves, know the term, and its broader aspects. Not many people in th world know the city of <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larissa.html" title="Larissa">Larissa</a>, but I haven't seen anybody here questioning its notability.

<li>Yanni, I agree with your reasoning 100%. However, the fact remains that presently the article does not reflect the anthropological extent of the word adequately (save Areti's paper).

<li><b>weak keep for greek profanity</b> - Even if the word Malakas isn't used in English speaking countries wikipedia should try to counteract systematic bias anyway by providing info from different cultures- a non-Anglo centric way of looking at the world. Remember it is english wikipedia not England's wikipedia. I agree with the redirect to the page. While the page is not exactly of the highest integrity if some of those highly offensive words in English have an article then why should a page on greek words not exist? It does have a cultural aspect to it but I would suggest more professional sources are used even more to discuss it further, making in more encylopedic rather than verging on a dictionary which wikipedia is NOT. Moreover I would feel an article on List of Greek slang covering the greek profanities such as Malakas would be better suited. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 11:55, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The reason for contesting so quickly is due in part to the fact that the person who asked for it to be deleted, did so as i was adding more to the page(i.e. i was still logged in, refreshed the page and saw the tag attached to this page. the significance of this page can be proven through the number of pages which already mention this duo on wikipedia and link here. it can also be shown through checking any other resource which mentions them or their work. therefore i think this page should stay. i would also like to mention the fact that their work on one of their 2005 releases was nominated for a music award and if needed i can add that reference to the page. other than that, the discography speaks for itself. i am still in the process of adding to their releases. i have a list of almost 40 major(i.e. charted) releases from them. --Superkat2 15:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

In that case, it may be more worthwhile letting the article stand and be improved over time, rather than deleting, to be recreated when the website has gone live.</li>

<dd>I feel I should also point out that User:Danielgrabham has edited the article and is possibly an employee of Future publishing, who run the site (the article itself lists a Dan Grabham as one of the staff). His edits seem to be minor ones, so I have just pointed out <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> to this user. However, given there are several possible single-purpose accounts involved, I am concerned that there may be further COIs and that there is some element of self-promotion going on. Of course, this is mere speculation, and I should <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. Plus, even if I am correct, this does not make for an inherently bad article. →<a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Brown_8bca.html" title="User:Oliver Brown">Ollie</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/l/i/User_talk%7EOliver_Brown_10c9.html" title="User talk:Oliver Brown">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Oliver_Brown_6e22.html" title="Special:Contributions/Oliver Brown">contribs</a>)</small> 23:54, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comments</b>. I am indeed the Dan Grabham that works for Future Publishing. I believed the minor edits I made to this article shouldn't be too much of a problem for WP:COI as they were largely error checking but of course I accept Ollie pointing it out to me. I have no knowledge of the users who originally made this article- they could, of course, be others in the company. Indeed, the article's existence somewhat surprised me a few days ago. I'm not surprised it's a candidate for deletion as we are still in Beta, but I would point out that the site will replace many others referenced on Wikipedia and will (hopefully) be noteworthy in a relatively short space of time.

<p>According to Wikipedia subject-specific notability guidelines, a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Salisbury_92d2.html" title="Mike Salisbury">Mike Salisbury</a> has been featured on a National Television Documentary <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, featured on several radio talk shows including the CBC, and CFRB <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> numerous regional and local print media including The Link <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> and The Toronto Star <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> and refferenced on numerous and authoritative web directories related to natural burial including, The Natural Death Center in the UK <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> the Alternative Funeral Monitor <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> and the Sapling Architecture, Planning and Landscape Information Gateway <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to Wikipedia guidelines, “What constitutes "published works" is broad and encompasses published works in all forms” Although Mr. Salisbury may not have been published formally; his thesis on natural burial has been subsequently referenced by several masters’ dissertations in the field of natural burial and related topics.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Salisbury is the president of the first and only organisation in Canada at this time developing natural burial products and services,<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> and serves on the board of directors of Canada’s only national association of natural burial grounds.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Independent authors, scholars, or journalists have decided to give attention to both the emerging trend of Natural Burial in North America as well as Mr. Salisdbury's role as the leading advocate of natural burial in Canada. Because Mr Salisbury and natural burial has been featured in multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, the primary notability criterion to determine whether "the world" has judged this individual and topic to be notable has been met.</p>
<p>The assertion that this research is in some way a promotional campaign or vanity article is totally unfounded, this article is part of a much larger area of research I am involved in regarding the emerging Natural Burial Movement in North America including <a href="../../../e/c/o/Eco-cemetery.html" title="Eco-cemetery">eco-cemetery</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Sehee_74c9.html" title="Joe Sehee">Joe Sehee</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Campbell_69cf.html" title="Billy Campbell">Billy Campbell</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Woodsen_3b51.html" title="Mary Woodsen">Mary Woodsen</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Harris_7ebc.html" title="Mark Harris">Mark Harris</a> and Tyler Cassity. While the merits of each of these articles will be debated individually, it is important to mention that these are WORKS IN PROCESS. It takes a remarkable amount of time to develop research and write these articles in order to clearly establish the notability and usefulness of these topics. I have identified these articles as stubs in order to encourage collaboration.</p>

<dd>You misunderstand the notability criteria guideline, or chose to not understand it the way it should be understood. This is aparent from you referencing <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> in the following way: <i>"a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself."</i>, while a proper referencing would be <i>"a topic is notable if it has been the <b>primary</b> subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself."</i> You fail to include only one word, but oh, is that word important. Surely, Salisbury is featured in the references you give, but not as the primary subject in a single one of them. The primary subject of all the references you give is the natural burial movement (which thus is notable), not Mike Salisbury (thus not notable). Being the president/CEO/leader/manager/whatever of an organization that is alone in its field is not in it self something that makes the person notable. –&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson">Elisson</a><small>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">C</a>&#160;•</small> 17:44, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ignoring the fact that you seem awfully hostile in your response, I will respond to your concern that Salisbury is not the primary subject of the references listed.</dd>
<dd>1. "Outside the Box" – a one hour documentary – ¼ of which featuring interviews with Salisbury about his work</dd>
<dd>2. The Nightside with Mark Elliot - 30 minute call in phone in radio interview with Salisbury</dd>
<dd>3. The Link - Feature Article by David Sheffield – an article about Natural burial featuring insight from Salisbury</dd>
<dd>4. The Toronto Star – an article about Natural Burial and interviews of Salisbury</dd>
<dd>5. The Natural Death Centre – web resource referring inquiries about natural burial in Canada to Salisbury</dd>
<dd>6. Alternative Funeral Monitor – Article about Salisbury and his company.</dd>
<dd>7. Sapling – independent review of Salisbury’s websites</dd>
<dd>8. Reference to research that references Salisbury’s work10. Natural Burial Co-operative – reference to appointment of Salisbury to president of Canada’s first natural burial co-operative</dd>
<dd>11. Natural Burial Association - reference to Salisbury’s appointment to Canada’s only natural burial association.</dd>
<dd>Now, I’m not an expert in all things wiki, however it seems to me that given the amount of media coverage referencing Salisbury’s work in establishing natural burial in Canada and the fact that Salisbury has been involved in conducting primary research in the field that has since been referenced by other researchers, arguably qualifies him as a notable person of interest.</dd>
<dd>I don’t mind debate, however it strikes me that editors could be just a little more responsive to authors who spend hours researching these things and trying to establish interesting and worthwhile articles. <a href="../../../e/u/l/User%7EEulogy4Afriend_64de.html" title="User:Eulogy4Afriend">Eulogy4Afriend</a> 19:01, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>weak keep</b> as per Duja (and, yes, he notified me.) - the argument that it's not English doesn't count for me. Enwiki is an encyclopedia <i>in</i> English, but not <i>about</i> English, so if there's anything encyclopedic to be said about the word, it is relevant no matter what language it's part of. But the article should be not about its usage in Modern Greek. That, like with "malakas", is really just for wiktionary. It should be about its status as a marker of the Balkan Linguistic Union. As such, it's been the object of specialised research and thus verifiable and (borderline) notable. I wouldn't mind a merger into the BLU article though. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 09:35, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Duja, thanks for the pointer to the Brian Joseph article -- interesting, but it doesn't change my opinion about having a "Re" article in WP. Joseph's article is an extensive and fascinating study of the etymology of re/vre/<i>etc.</i>, true, but I don't see why it argues for an independent article on the subject in WP. The article is certainly relevant to the Balkan Linguistic Union article, and probably to an article about informal terms of address (do we have one?). The fact that it is a Greek word is not central -- it is that it is not about a <i>concept</i>, but about a word. To be clear, I don't think we should have articles about individual <i>English</i> words and phrases like "you know", <a href="../../../y/27/a/Y%27all.html" title="Y'all">y'all</a> (which does currently have a WP article), <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irregardless.html" title="Irregardless">irregardless</a>, etc. To the extent they belong in an encyclopedia, they belong in articles about <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_English_130e.html" title="Southern English">Southern English</a> or English discourse markers or Prescriptiveness in English usage or whatever. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 17:16, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Note that I basically omitted the <i>weak</i> (keep) part just because I wanted to sound firmer in comparison to the opposers; personally, I lean to the deletionist side, and this is IMO a borderline case, with no clear precedents and policies to judge on. In this case, I find the phenomenon widespread and interesting enough (<a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>, I know) to deserve an exception (merging into the BLU article is also an option, though it's fairly long). The word (bre) is also one of Serbian cultural icons/stereotypes, and I myself wondered about its etymology until I stumbled upon that article. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 08:23, 7 February 2007 (UTC)<br />

<li>I'm very familiar with both guidelines you reference, but I'm not finding them too helpful in this specific sense, since they're mainly concerned with things like POV, verifiability, or notability. I've been looking for a guideline that says something like "Don't use lists to duplicate a category" or "Lists that offer no information beyond what a category provides are still totally awesome!". So, I can't really see how the guidelines justify either delete or keep. Lists vs. categories is an age-old debate, and I'd like to educate myself more if there's some guidelines I'm missing, or possibly help draft policy if there is some hole in the existing policy. If you know anything I'm missing, let me know here or on my talk. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdavidw_0345.html" title="User:Adavidw">adavidw</a> 20:38, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, a category can not feasibly contain the same degree of structure and information as that list shows. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 18:15, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I agree 100% that a list can contain more <i>information</i>. However, this list doesn't contain any more information than a category would. The list is just a list of Wikipedia articles without any expansion or clarification. As to the degree of <i>structure</i>, categories <i>could</i> offer just as much structure with the judicious use of well named sub-categories. However, the current category implementation in Wikipedia seems designed to discourage this sort of tree organization, so I will concede the point that a list can structure things in a tree better than a category could, and this list is indeed well-structured. However, it's not well-maintained, and provides no more information about the articles than a category would, so I would argue that it's only marginally more useful than a category. If someone maintained the list and expanded the entries or at least the headings with a little bit of context, I'd vote "keep" myself. (Note, although I nominated, I haven't actually voted "delete" myself. I nominate what I feel are bad lists because if they really are bad they should be deleted, and if they're not, the process &amp; consensus will help spur to make them better). --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdavidw_0345.html" title="User:Adavidw">adavidw</a> 20:38, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Being a member of <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_topics.html" title="Lists of topics">Lists of topics</a> which is one of the contents subsystems on that bar (and on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContents_3181.html" title="Wikipedia:Contents">Wikipedia:Contents</a> - Wikipedia's Table of Contents), makes the Finance list one of Wikipedia's sub-tables of contents. Another example of such a list is the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_mathematics_topics.html" title="List of mathematics topics">List of mathematics topics</a>, which is comprehensive -- it has grown so large as to have expanded to about 200 lists, and some of those are huge. The Mathematics department takes pride in its lists, and their lists are much better maintained than the corresponding categories. One of the main reasons for having lists is that they can be centrally maintained (that is, on the list itself). Categories can't. You can edit lists directly, but with categories you can't, which makes lists much easier to work with (and a heck of a lot faster). Lists can include planned pages (as redlinks), categories can't. Lists show when a page has disappeared (it's link goes red). Categories don't have this feature. Lists have histories, so you can see when someone has removed a link from the list, and this gives you the option to revert (to get it back). Changes to the contents of Categories are impossible to track, and can't be reverted from the category page. It is therefore easy for removals from a category to go unnoticed. Subject lists like the one on Finance are especially important to Wikiprojects, and are used by them with the Related changes command on the toolbox menu, which allows them to monitor for changes (and vandalism) to each set of pages, without worrying that they are monitoring a partial list (due to removals). List entries can be annotated, varibly formatted, and further organized on the page. Category entries cannot. Lists can be compiled by collecting terms from the field (via cut and paste) and then simply linkifying them - you'd be surprised how extensive Wikipedia's coverage is nowadays - often times most of the links turn blue! Categories are much harder to build (one link at a time). Tree structures can be displayed on list pages. Lead paragraphs can be added to each section, if desired. Images can be added to enhance the presentation, as is done on some of the math lists. There are so many reasons to keep lists. <i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="#808">Th<font color="#00F">e Tr<font color="#490">ans<font color="#D92">hu<font color="#D40">man<font color="#B00">ist</font> &#160;&#160;</font></font></font></font></font></a></b></i>21:31, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> categories don't replace lists and lists don't replace categories. If only for visibility of editing (changes in lists are detected by watchlist).

<p>This article was Prod'ed as "nn band" but I feel they are a borderline case and it could be argued they meet our <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">notability criteria for bands</a>. So I'm opening this for a broader debate without a specific recommendation. if the article is kept, it should probably be renamed to "Fletcher (band)" <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 17:38, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> "well received by UK music press" means nothing without supporting references.

<p>Keep: Agreed, references are needed. The following information will appear on the main entry (with references)as soon as I have sifted through the many magzines and press cuttings. Bear with me as I am still learning how to edit information on Wikipedia. The band had very good reviews for both of their releases in Metal Hammer, Big Cheese, Rock Sound,Fracture and Kerrang. These are the main rock magazines in the UK. Dexter Holland (The Offspring) personally reviewed the EP in Big Cheese magazine and gave it much praise. There are also many great reviews online. Big Cheese magazine also dedicated a double page spread to the band for an interview. All these statments will be backed up by references, but some time is needed.</p>
<p>Fletcher should definatley be considered 'notable.' They were the only band on an independent label, and the only English band to open the Deconstruction festival in front of 20,000 people, where they were also interviewed for Radio One. They were indeed a prominent figure in a prominent UK scene for 5 years. I believe it meets points (3), (4) and (10) of the 'notable' criterea</p>

<li>Note to administrator: It is noticed by Paul Connors that "ONLY AN ADMINISTRATOR" can delete a file. Well I would expect that as an ADMINISTRATOR you would be willing to identify yourself. Is there a phone number you can be reached at? If not I would have to ask what on Earth qualifies you to be an ADMINISTRATOR. ADMINISTRATORS have POWERS and with POWERS comes RESPONSIBILITY. RESPONSIBILITY means identifying yourself with your birth name and phone contact information. Or is all that stuff just too real for you?

The next is a band website <a href="http://www.thephiltres.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thephiltres.com" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>, proves existence, yes, but not notability, anyone can have a website.

<li>And this discussion is just that, a discussion on Wikipedia guidelines and trying to reach a consensus of many, either delete or keep according to the notability guidelines set forth by many. It is a fair system in my opinion, and your're right, only Admins can delete this article, but an Admin will come here and read the comments and delete only if consensus warrants. Admins are voted in by the same process by the way, by a fair consensus. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECricket02_ffdd.html" title="User:Cricket02">Cricket02</a> 19:36, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Look at the last entry from the troll..."you can talk to me on my talk page..." Please I'm not here to be your friend. Sorry troll not a taker. It is so pathetic that Wikipedia attracts so many trolls and lets these pathetically lonely nobodys be the gatekeepers for who is notable. Please. Wikipedia is crack cocaine for these patheticly lonely people. The sense of "power" these trolls get by entrenching their pathetic selves here at Wikipedia "deletion central" must be unprecedented across the web. Wikipedia please change your evaluation process. You are a haven for patheticly lonely and meaningless people. <small><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Paul Conners (<a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Conners_4049.html" title="User talk:Paul Conners">talk</a> •<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Conners_518b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Conners">contribs</a>)</small></p>

<p>It is clear that numerous independent authors, scholars, or journalists have decided to give attention to both the emerging trend of Natural Burial in North America as well as Mr. Campbell’s role as a pioneer in the natural burial movement.Because Mr Campbell has been featured in multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, the primary notability criterion to determine whether "the world" has judged this individual and topic to be notable has been met.</p>
<p>The assertion that this research is in some way a promotional campaign or vanity article is totally unfounded, this article is part of a much larger area of research regarding the emerging Natural Burial Movement in North America including <a href="../../../e/c/o/Eco-cemetery.html" title="Eco-cemetery">eco-cemetery</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Sehee_74c9.html" title="Joe Sehee">Joe Sehee</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Salisbury_92d2.html" title="Mike Salisbury">Mike Salisbury</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Woodsen_3b51.html" title="Mary Woodsen">Mary Woodsen</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Harris_7ebc.html" title="Mark Harris">Mark Harris</a> and Tyler Cassity. While the merits of each of these articles will be debated individually, it is important to mention that these are WORKS IN PROCESS. It takes a remarkable amount of time to develop research and write these articles in order to clearly establish the notability and usefulness of these topics. These articles have been identified as stubs in order to encourage collaboration.</p>
<p>While each of these articles are related by subject matter and reference each other as related articles they are also related to <a href="../../../e/c/o/Eco-cemetery.html" title="Eco-cemetery">eco-cemetery</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/e/Cremation.html" title="Cremation">cremation</a>, and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Promession.html" title="Promession">promession</a>. The body of information at this point may be specific in nature however they are certainly not a walled garden.</p>
<p><b>I would respectfully request that editors choose not to delete or merge these articles before they have been fully developed and referenced.</b> <a href="../../../e/u/l/User%7EEulogy4Afriend_64de.html" title="User:Eulogy4Afriend">Eulogy4Afriend</a> 17:57, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article itself does not show how the person is notable. It explains that he/she has been published in several presumably Turkish magazines, but there is nothing further of note. It also lacks sources. A cursory web search isn't able to find anything notable about this person (the results are either copies of the Wikipedia article, pages that don't say much, or pages I can't read). Finally, no updates were made nor sources added for several months after being tagged 'notability'. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaligron_d32d.html" title="User:Saligron">Saligron</a> 10:06, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>weak keep</b> not that I can add such information, but that there are a number of people here who do read Turkish &amp; they should be encouraged to find sources.

<li><b>Comment</b> The reason for my nomination is that the article has not stated for a long time how the person is notable nor cites multiple independent sources. If either of these are done (though both is obviously preferrable), I would have no issue with keeping the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Jimmy Wales comments, linked to above, appear to contradict Wikipedia's policies on notability. This school appears (from the information given in the article) not to satisfy the general guidelines for notability nor the proposed notability guidelines for schools. As far as I can see, articles on non-notable schools get deleted frequently. With the greatest of respect to Mr Wales, I don't agree with him. Wikipedia is accepted as not being a list of everything, which is why articles on non-notable schools or non-notable anything else get deleted. To my mind there is no difference between 1000 school articles on nn schools written by 1000 individuals and 1000 articles on nn schools written by one person.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>So far as this particular school is concerned, the information in the article does not in my view suggest that it is notable and therefore I maintain it should be deleted. Obviously if someone can improve the article to indicate that the school is notable then it can be kept. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules1975</a> 11:05, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Busted. I am Spartacus</b> - I am the author. I am the producer of the film. I believe in wikipedia. I want to fit in. Every single fact in this entry and the movie entry is true and is verifiable, but the links would be academic footnotes rather than hyperlinks to broaden the reader's understanding. On the other hand you will see links from mainstream, acting and career. i believe this is a justifiable entry. We are a small British movie that is about to be released in a tidal wave of publicity. People are going to expect wikipedia to explain who Candy Fiveways is, particularly as we will be wilfully blurring the line between character and actress. All I can say is that last night we had a screening for 450 people who laughed so long and loud that they missed some of the jokes. If the style is wrong tell me. I am passionate about this. That can't be too bad. Does someone want to come to a screening? On the issue of too much detail, I cannot agree. Are we running out of space? mynameispiers 21.13, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>A list of theme songs isn't that important. Lots of shows have many theme songs and so on, it doesn't mean it's notable (or even important enough to non-fans of the show) to be here. Listcruft better suited for a Pokemon wiki. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 19:41, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I say this because of the fact that, generally, a musician is deemed notable if they performed a theme song, and as the song is making them notable, then the song is notable too. Keeping them all in one place is much better than having a batch of one-line stubs. The theme songs are important, and there is obviously too much information there to have it in the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html" title="Pokémon">Pokémon</a> article. And no, I am not a Pokémon fanboy. Shame the article is unsourced. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 20:25, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, There's a difference between being not notable and "most won't care". Do I care? No, but theme songs are not on the same level as say.. List of pretty dresses that BlahBlah wore. People write, sing, and produce these songs, even if it's just for a kids show. I know it's a gray area for a lot of this stuff, and maybe theme songs is floating on that gray area, but we don't seem to have an issue with massive theme song listings and I can see how they are notable. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 03:36, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>, seems to me these ought to be attached to the main Pokemon anime series article. Lots of anime have a long string of different openings and closings (Maison Ikkoku springs to mind), but they don't require an entire separate music article. Take out the pics and this is quite the stub of an article. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnarfies_0d64.html" title="User:Snarfies">Snarfies</a> 03:46, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Alan, you failed to do proper due-dilligence prior to nominating this article. 90,000 plus G-hits should have given you a clue that this was merely a poorly referenced article in need of TLC and a new edditor who would have benefited from your guidance rather than rejection.

<ul>
<li>90,000 is an overstatement because a fair number of those google hits are duplicates of the same press releases covered in different papers. And once you get past the first few hundred, you also start getting a fair number of false positives where the company's name is coming up in a directory listing. That said, I did find enough independent, non-trivial sources to satisfy myself that a balanced, properly-sourced article is probably possible. <b>Keep for now</b>. The page is barely a day old. Give it a chance to grow. We can always revisit the decision if it proves to be unexpandable after a month or three.<br />

<dd>Is it really surprising that a list of 50 well-known people (notable enough to have wiki pages) is linked from about 50 wiki pages? And even if it were 10K pages, WP isn't just a self-referential asylum. The article itself really needs an explicit explanation of the selection and why it's notable, not just a listing with some un-explained refs. If it's cast as a list of people selected by peers, it might be notable enough and distanced enough from "some TV show" to survive.<a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 02:11, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result was <b>no consensus to delete</b>, default to keep. After substantial consideration of the arguments presented, that's about all I can say, except that the principal question - at what height should the lists start? - appears to me to be less an encyclopedic fact in need of sourcing, but a matter requiring the community's <i>editorial judgment</i>, i.e., consensus and discussion. Policy is of little help here, as several people have noted. I suggest a half-year moratorium on any further deletion requests. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 07:18, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yes, it is. "Notable tallness" would be established by any passing mention by any short journalist. Such statements as "Barack Obama stands above the crowd" or "Bill O'Reilly towers over his guest", recorded in media, will be "notable tallness". Are those guys tall? Yes, but where does this end? Damn near everyone over 5'10" has been called tall by someone, somewhere, and 5'10" is going to result in a list ten times as large as the current one. This will actually be a very big problem for politicians, because it is actually part of the spin system to drop mentions about height, since it's a fact that tall politicians tend to be elected more readily. Mentions of notable height are quite spammy for many occupations. As for "tallest people", if you mean only the tallest person in the world at any given time, this will have a very glaring bias for Westerners (Wikipedia already has a terrible problem with such bias), and if you start trying to break it up by geography you inevitably run into all the POV problems that border disputes bring in. Who's the tallest person from China? What if they live in Taiwan? It's just another invitation to different messes, no less tendentious, and no more useful for this encyclopedia. All the information about height can and should be noted in the individual articles of each separate person, so no information need be lost. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 23:43, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Tall is a relational adjective, by which I mean one that describes an objects in relation to others. Relational adjectives are a normal part of everyday English.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I most certainly agree: many, many names should be dropped from the lists. As for sources, not necessarily just record books.

<li><b>Very Strong Delete</b>. The lists, by virtue of their scope as proclaimed by their titles, are inherently POV. "Tall" is highly subjective, depending on where your POV lies. The "list of tall women" article, for example, has a lead entry that is U.S.-specific. Separating the "basketball section" makes the list even more subjective and POV. Why accord a special sub qualification for a specific sport? Because to use the article's own set "rules" would put too many names into the "basketball" section. Because of this, the article is internally inconsistent. Bringing the other list into consideration, one can see that they aren't consistent as sister-lists as well. As of now, the male list starts at 6'5", with a separate section once more for "basketball". NPOV is impossible with these lists, as with any list that uses a subjective descriptor. In order for the lists to be NPOV, they'd have to be named something along the lines of <i>List of men taller than 6'5"</i> or something similar, and by using a value-limiter in the title, the lists would then make no sense. Wikipedia is not a list of trivia, not an almanac, and it is definitely not Guinness Book of World Records. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 20:57, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep and rename to tallest. <i>. Frankly, I did not expect to vote this way, but I was judging from the title of the page. Upon actually looking at them, I find them exceptionally well done, and encyclopedic. The placement in the list is quantifiable--it isn't like a list of best known anything. Though it is necessary to pick where to stop, the inclusion of individuals depends on objective criteria. (i.e, there are no problem with</i></b> <i>POV<b>), in almost all cases the data is trustworthy, and the less-than-perfectly trustworthy ones are indicated, so it's</b> V'</i>) . Observably physical charactertics of people are of general interest, and people are interested in this particular property, for it is conspicuous (deliberate choice of word). As others have written aboutthem in multiple sources, they meet the general criteria for <b>N.</b> There is even N for the individual people, because there are WP articles for almost all, so it was demonstrated for each such article. The virtue of the name change is that it emphasizes he objective nature of the determination along a scale. Then do not in general involve questions of BLP, for the individuals here are here because the information is known publicly, and many of them have made it the basis of their career.</li>

<dd>Actually, there are POV problems, as I've pointed out the previous debates. One such problem is that any cutoff point favors 20th and 21st century Westerners, especially Scandinavians and to a slightly lesser extent, Americans. This has been noted by several other editors before I'm bringing it up here. The POV concern that I noticed and brought up in previous debates is that arriving at a particular cutoff point is arbitrary, and since there's no "good reason" to choose 6'5" <i>instead of</i> 6'3", someone who wants their favorite person included can always come along and change it, and no one else can have any legitimate argument why they're wrong. An example, below in this very debate, is <a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudo2_2bfc.html" title="User:Dudo2">User:Dudo2</a> who wants the list changed back to 6'3" so that <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Ferrigno_0964.html" title="Lou Ferrigno">Lou Ferrigno</a> can be included. Is Dudo wrong? If so, why? If not, why? There's no rationale argument one way or the other, so POV pushers will forever move the criteria around, just like they've done in the past. Now, as to the fact that this debate continues to be contentious, that's not an indication that there's no consensus for deletion. We've had many contentious debates result in deletion; the GIAA comes to mind. The fact is that one side here has consistently been arguing on basis of policy, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, while the other side wants to circumvent these requirements. A contentious debate can still reach consensus if only one side is backed up in policy. I do not believe that editors' passion is a basis for keeping articles. I've seen hundreds of very passionate AFDs go by, and the mere fact that there is a dispute should never be mistaken for "no consensus". Policy comes first unless there's a good case for invoking <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, and I've seen no such case here. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 23:29, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think we're moving toward retooling this as tallest or among the tallest. However "tall stature" is not a single height, but is instead a range that begins several deviations above average height. That beginning will vary by nation, but there should remain a subset which is tall in all nations. For example <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endangered_species.html" title="Endangered species">Endangered species</a> might be defined differently in differing placing, but there is almost certainly a limit that no nation goes below in defining the matter. What is tall in the tallest average nation, I believe that was the Netherlands, should be tall stature with all nations. That might sound ethnocentrically biased, but there's no reason every nation must be equally represented in all lists. In addition to that the 99,8th percentile of Vietnam would add up to about as many people as the 99th percentile of the Netherlands anyway.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>I think the idea is among the tallest. The standard can be raised if this is switched to tallest. If that occurs women and men should still probably be treated separately due to their being treated separately in anthropometrics or height studies. The Dutch starts women at 201 cm (6 ft 7) I believe. This might be too restrictive, but perhaps not.

<li>So you're going to replace the arbitrarily chosen height with an arbitrarily chosen centile? Sorry, that doesn't fix the problem. It's still arbitrary. T.

<li>I shouldn't have mentioned the Dutch standard, it was just an example. Anyway no percentiles and standard deviations are not arbitrary. It's the method medical science uses when defining "tall stature" and "short stature." I can get you the information from the National Institute of Health or Cornell or one of those if you need it. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22tall+stature%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22tall+stature%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Here's Scholar Google</a> results for tall stature. I think it's 3 SDs above average height. I need to learn more about standard deviation to quantify that, but it's not something I invented.

<li>Addendum. In normal distribution it seems 3 SD is the 99.73002039367% percentile. If I can find something on that, or 3 SD above average height, this would go along with the Pediatrics site.

<li>There are roughly 6 Billion people in the world. Assuming a reasonably normal distribution, three standard deviations would give us a list over 16 million long. Even 6 standard deviations would be a list over 12,000 long - and that's just for people alive today. That's not a maintainable standard. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 23:20, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>People seem to have trouble understanding lists of people and your statement is a good example of that. Lists are not intended to list every person in the world who fits the topic. Take for example <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_with_epilepsy.html" title="List of people with epilepsy">List of people with epilepsy</a>, which is a featured list. According to the <a href="http://www.epilepsyfoundation.org/answerplace/scope.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.epilepsyfoundation.org/answerplace/scope.cfm" rel="nofollow">Epilepsy foundation</a> 2.3 million, in the United States alone, had epilepsy in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_with_epilepsy.html" title="List of people with epilepsy">List of people with epilepsy</a> is not intending to list the millions of people in the world that have epilepsy, but is instead about notable cases. All lists are bound by Wikipedia rules on notability and verifiability. Maybe 4 SD would be better as even more limiting, only 1 in 15,000 people would fit that if I read it right, but I couldn't medical validation for that.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

In any case, no one is proposing to include all 8 million people who are three standard deviations above the mean (the remaining 8 million are below it)--either only those who are notable of their own right and are on WP or (more likely) only those who are notable for their height.

<li>Thanks for clarifying. I'm not sure that it fully solves the problem yet. What limits will be imposed to keep the classifications from proliferating inappropriately? "Tallest man in the world" - sure. "Tallest man in the 18th century" - okay (though I don't know how you'd ever prove it). But at some point you get to "tallest blue-eyed plumber in Akron with a mole on his left forearm". What criteria do you propose to define the limits of the parsing? Without some idea about possible controls, this appears to merely shift the subjectivity to a different area. Do you have a mock-up of how you think the proposed article might be laid out? <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 23:55, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I love the example! Here's how I propose we keep out plumbers with heterogeneously-pigmented skin from the list. If the title remains <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_tall_men.html" title="List of tall men">List of tall men</a>, then it should include only notable men above a certain cutoff point (specified by an internationally-recognized height institute). As this is somewhat difficult, it may be renamed List of the tallest men or List of men notable for their height (in which case <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_short_men.html" title="List of short men">List of short men</a> should be merged into it). In these two cases, subjectivity is removed by listing only those people who are notable for their height according to one or more <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. As for my "by time period" comment, I didn't mean to list the tallest man in each century (although I realize that's what it reads like). Instead, I meant having a section for historical figures who are notably tall (e.g., <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_the_Great_2494.html" title="Peter the Great">Peter the Great</a>).

<ul>
<li>You are mistaken. The DRV resulted in relisting <i>not</i> because the AFD had been incorrectly closed, but <i>only</i> because the two AFDs had come to separate conclusions and DGG and others asked for a bundled relisting only so the result would be <i>consistent</i>. Unless I'm badly miscounting, the DRV had 10 "endorse deletions" and only 5 "overturn/relists", at least two of which were only for the sake of bundling. In any other case, this 2:1 margin would be a clear endorsement of closure; the only reason this was relisted was for the consistency that would result from bundling the two. The "on the deletion block again" refers to this entire recent deletion, AFD4/DRV/AFD5 as a piece, and it is indeed here because the inclusion criteria are arbitrary, that's why AFD4 began. I'm not misleading anyone and I'd appreciate it if you continue to assume good faith instead of making insinuations about my intentions. Considering that multiple editors above have repeated the fact that the list is arbitrary, I see no reason for you to pick out <i>my</i> statement and say it's misleading, when I'm reiterating others' words. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 03:11, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

The DRV resulted in overturn/relist to bundle the two together for consistency <i>and</i> due to a lack of consensus on the closure. The actual count for the DRV is 12 "endorse deletions" and 12 "overturn/relists" (I think it comes to 10-5 if you count only those who typed <b>Endorse</b>, <b>Overturn</b>, or <b>Relist</b>). Again, I apologize. I should have assumed good faith. As it turns out, by pointing you to <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> (for the comment "You must have mistaken these for some other lists."), I did not follow a parallel policy (<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 05:13, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>No worries. Thank you for reconsidering my intent. I may also have counted the DRV wrong; and as we're here already I'm not going to go back over it again with a fine-toothed comb. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 05:43, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No (but it's an interesting page), more like: Back in the real world, people are interested in this, Wikipedia is inherently well placed to construct such an article and Wikipedia should play to its strengths. Knowing who is known for being tall and who happens to be tallest are both useful in limited circumstances (and Wikipedia is, if I may be allowed this heresy, <b>actually meant to be useful</b>, and all Wikipedia articles are only useful in <i>limited</i> circumstances), and no encyclopedia has ever been opened only for serious purposes. Wikipedia need not be quite as serious as Holy Writ or the instructions for defusing a bomb.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 03:51, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>And what would be the rationale for choosing 6'3" instead of 6'1"? Why is one more encyclopedic than another?

<li><b>Delete</b>, again. The proposal that we can og by "List of tallest men" is actually the same article, all these people are among the tallest in the world. The three letters don't make any difference. The proposal that this should be "notably tall men" is also going to be indiscriminate. Who's notably tall? What does this mean? I've seen men in America who are 6'1" be told "hey you're tallll." That's not particularly tall, but if someone wrote it down somewhere, suddenly "their tallness has been considered notable." This would probably make the lists <i>worse</i> instead of better, since when it was 6'5", while this was arbitrary, it wasn't painfully long. "Noted for tallness" would extend down under 6'. No way. Anybody can be claimed to be notable for anything; it would only take one short journalist to add heaps of people to these lists. Such citations of "notable tallness" can surely be noted in the subjects' articles if someone would like to include them. No need for that information to be lost, but it doesn't constitute inclusion criteria. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 22:59, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, let's turn Wikipedia into the driest of academic exercises. Squeeze anything interesting out of it. Let no reader ever crack a smile, raise his eyelids any higher or have her heart beat any faster than a dull thud. We truly need to squelch these eruptions of normal human interest. I'm sure that when we do, we'll all feel more important, more dignified, more <i>serious.</i> Of course, we'll still have the porn-star, pokemon and video game articles, so it won't be a total loss. (These comments don't mean to imply any description of the sentiments of Usedup or any other particular editor here, just a strong suspicion that these sentiments seem to be behind some editors' comments.) <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 03:51, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your strong suspicions are probably off-target concerning most of us here. I haven't got a problem with amusing or merely interesting lists or articles, as long as they are objectively bounded. These lists may be interesting to look at, but they continually erupt in very heated arguments and a lot of bad blood arises as a result of them. The reason is that there are no, and can be no, objective criteria for when to <i>stop</i> the list, and so arbitrary measures are taken to choose a cutoff. Because they're arbitrary, everyone's reason is as "good" as anyone else's. For example, I want the list of men to stop at 6'5" or 6'6" to keep it short, Dudo2 wants it to be 6'3" so <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Ferrigno_0964.html" title="Lou Ferrigno">Lou Ferrigno</a> will be included, and we've had others arguing that it needs to be low enough for <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Christian_Anderson_4d6a.html" title="Hans Christian Anderson">Hans Christian Anderson</a>, I've seen requests for 5'10" and 2 meters, and no one is "right", and no one is "wrong". If it were something objective, someone would be "wrong" and they could get over their pride and acquiesce to that, but in this case everybody's "right" and things get heated because no-one <i>should</i> have to back down and give in. On Wikipedia we have <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> policies that everyone has to abide by, and these policies are fair and apply to everyone so they defuse most situations. But these lists exist outside of policy. There is no verifiable objective way to bound the lists, and policy doesn't come into play to cool things. I'm saying that since the policies can't be made to apply to these lists, the lists have to go. I don't want to scrub Wikipedia of intersting content, but I do want our battles here to be about objective things that can eventually reach a conclusion, instead of screaming at each other in the dark. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 05:43, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Try leaving your bedroom and visit a library for real research. However, if you are housebound and insist on only using the Internet, you must be able to find more then one reference to Billy Byars.

<p>Dhartung:</p>
<p>I don't believe suggesting to someone that "Googling" is not the only possible research, nor even research at all, is being uncivil. I do believe that calling actual professional research a "hoax" is uncivil, childish and igonorant. Especially when all one has to do is send a message to the author and ask questions.</p>

Dhartung:</p>
<p>Please understand "ignorant" is not a pejorative. It means "lacking knowledge". It does does not mean dumb or stupid.</p>
<p>Since I am obviously "ignorant" of "wikiworld" I would still like to be educated as to why calling someone's research a "hoax" in not considered "uncivil", especially when the researcher could easily be "messaged" with any questions.</p>
<p>As for "trimming" the article, I understand we live in a world where young adults have a "child like" attention span and can't be expected to read an article that would take them longer than 60 seconds to read, but perhaps we can begin here today and show young people what articles should be. Finally, breaking-up articles into different pages with fun hyperlink clicking may be all the rage for a tiny minority, but it gives most people a headache.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../h/o/a/WP%7EHOAX_ea37.html" title="WP:HOAX">WP:HOAX</a> is a particular guideline at Wikipedia and a valid rationale for deletion. By raising it, RJASE1 legitimately asked the community for consensus on whether the article was valid and verifiable enough to keep. That is a label placed on the <i>article</i>, not on an <i>editor</i>. You can't be incivil to an inanimate object, but editors are assumed to be real persons and we should all respect that. My reference to trimming was not in regard to attention spans or for brevity, but because much of the article appears difficult to reconcile with our strict policies requiring verification from reliable sources. We can keep the article if a) the article can be trimmed to encyclopedic information about the man that b) demonstrates notability. Anything that cannot be cited, but could be considered libelous, such as accusing someone of manufacturing what would today be considered child pornography, must be removed immediately, and the person wishing to keep it has the responsibility of justifying it by coming up with sources. Anything that involves synthesis, conjecture, or conclusion that is not citable to a secondary source is considered original research, and is not permitted on Wikipedia, which is by design and policy a tertiary source. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 00:08, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I want to apologize for using the word 'screed' and will remove the 'hoax' tag, since I'm willing to concede that this person existed. But the only fact about this person that I am willing to accept at this point is that he produced/wrote the film mentioned in the article. I don't see how that makes him notable enough for Wikipedia inclusion if there is nothing else published about him. All the gay porn stuff has got to either be referenced or removed immediately because it's potentially libellous. - <a href="../../../r/j/a/User%7ERJASE1_c81d.html" title="User:RJASE1">RJASE1</a> 22:39, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, the internet sources don't back up any of the substance of the article. The book source appears to be difficult to obtain and amazon gives a different year of publishing, possibly a change of publisher or a plain mistake. I'm uneasy about having so contentious an article with only these sources on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">Malla</span></a><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMallanox_41c6.html" title="User talk:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">nox</span></a> 23:32, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> (changed vote). I have reviewed the article twice and as many of the sources as I can, and I find nothing indicating that Byars was truly notable. The only thing that might make it notable is the child pornography investigation, but the article states that the LA Times explicitly did not cover it. Many times the article relies on original research (e.g. tax records), conjecture, or weasel words to arrive at a conclusion. This article may be of interest to some publication, Ballog, but it is not something that belongs on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 00:41, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I freely admit I am not an administrator - I spend most of my Wiki-time on anti-vandalism patrol. That is, however, not relevant to this debate.

<b>RJASE1</b>: You continue to fail to cite <b>specifics</b>. Please cite any potentially defamatory claims which have not been sourced or referenced. You also confuse good sourcing with "convienence" of verification by you. Simply because <b>you</b> can't read the contents of a book or magazine online does not mean it's a bad source. The fact that <b>you</b> might need to pay a fee at a web site or visit a brick and mortar library to verify a source does not make the source invalid.<br /></p>
<p>Admittedly, there has been confusion about the term "original research" here. My original research (original because I am the first to research the material for this subject) is all of previously published materials. Items such as United States birth, death, social security records, etc. are official records and are just about the most reliable source available. So to are state sex offender lists. Wiki's definition of "OR" is information that has not been previously or seperately published. The information I cite has been previously and/or seperately published.<br /></p>
<p>Simply by repeating your false claims again..."If the non-complying material is removed from the article in its present state (and it needs to be, sooner rather than later, unless it's..", does not help your argument. Once again, you fail to cite <b>specifics</b>. This constant repeating of unsubstaniated claims can be viewed as evidence that your are simply being abusive and attempting to "flame" an article.<br /></p>
<p>I previously cited three books, a magazine article, an internet article and The Los Angeles Times as sources confirming that Billy Byars, who owned Lyric which produced pornography, was arrested in 1973 for charges specified in the article. Now, please explain to me how this does not meet the criteria for sourcing?</p>

<li><b>stubbify and recreate</b> , or delete. The problem here is that many of the occurrences are in fact notable, but they are notable as crimes. However, the subject of the article appears not to have been convicted of them, and the indictment was (according to the article itself) never prosecuted, so an attempt to discuss them from the standpoint of trying to demonstrate the subject's guilt is an obvious violation of BLP. Similarly the criminal actions of others are discussed--in some cases safely, because they have been convicted, but in some cases not, which is also a violation of BLP.</li>

<dd>BLP is not a technical WP matter--it is a basic principle of fairness in any encyclopedic source, and it is also the basic way of avoiding libel for any publication.</dd>
<dd>Personally, i would have deleted or at least blanked the entire article as it now stands as libel.</dd>
<dd>That does not mean an article cannot be written, for the subject of the article is unfortunately notable, and sufficiently notable that an article would be appropriate even over his objections, and enough verifiable non BLP material found. But the present article is so obviously full of prejudicial and unsupported testimony that it cannot reasonably stand.

<li>DGG, let's discuss notability. What we have here is: son of an oilman, "boy film" producer, apparently well-known as someone J.

<li><b>Comment</b> - First, I've independently verified a number of the sources the author cites: the L.A. Times on microfilm years ago (it's online now), the J. Edgar Hoover biography, the Warren Report, the best-selling Robin Lloyd book. The sources are all genuine. (On the other hand, they'd fail the quality test being demanded here: Lloyd sources nothing, the Hoover bio is where the now discredited story of Hoover in drag came from.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have read the Original Research policy. I´m not sure I fully understand it, but it seems more a barrier against people who take a handful of facts and conclude that everything's due to the Patriachy or the Illuminati. This merely takes scattered facts about a man and puts them together. There are no Big Theories involved, and no twisting of facts to a predetermined conclusion.</p>
<p>Yes, the article sounds strange. The subject is strange - and interesting. Style questions I won't address, it's easier to fix style and organization than content.</p>
<p>Regarding the statements that are potentially libelous, they are all from public sources. The Warren Report failed to verify its facts and see that the "child pornography ring" wasn't a ring and no charges were brought based on child pornography, and that the only movie mentioned in the L.A. Times was from the description entirely legal.</p>
<p>An analogous case, also from Los Angeles, was the McMartin school satanic sexual abuse scandal. One cannot argue that there should't be an article on it because the charges were false. They were false, and the first of many similar charges. The charges against Byars were false too, or at least never proved. Some of the charges were found false by a jury; part of the article is an interview by another of the falsely accused where he says that he pled guilty but the police were ready to frame him.</p>
<p>The persecution of child pornography has been a significant excuse for the attacks on civil liberties over the past thirty years in the United States, especially on the Internet. A great deal of the "original research" on which those policies have been based is, frankly, a crock. Byars was one of the first victims. A comparison of the facts, presented here, against the lies, in such places as the Attorney's General's pornography report, is illuminating. Keep.</p>

<p>Regarding libel, several references were removed to the late "pornographer" Guy Strait. It's not libel, since he's dead and it's famously true. According to the Chicago Tribune, Strait "was one of the nation's leading pornographers ... he had cornered the market on the production of ‘kiddie porn'."(Chicago Tribune, 17 May 1977, p. 1-8.) The articles are reprinted in <i>Sexual Exploitation of Children, Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Crime of the House Comm. on the Judiciary, 95th Cong., 1st Sess.</i> (1977) pp 428-42. The "statement of Guy Strait, producer of child pornography" appears in the same volume on pp 23-28. Mr. Strait was also the founder of the first gay newspaper in San Franciso in 1961, which at the time took courage.</p>
<p>There were objections to "the first child pornography ring [...] brought to public view." (Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) PART 3: Law Enforcement Recommendations. Chapter 3, paragraph 5.) I agree that the charge is false. However it was made by the Attorney General's commision, which failed to check primary sources or court records before perpetuating the accusation.</p>
<p>The article does not qualify for exclusion as "original research". While I agree that more footnotes are needed, I own or have read a number of the sources given, and the article is in line with available source references. The lack of footnotes is a correctable flaw. There is no ideological bias. I've read some "original research" - I recall something on the Ark of the Covenant being an electrical capacitor - but the only burning passion I see here is a desire for completeness.</p>
<p>Is it controversial? The man apparently has led an eventful and colorful life, and the article reflects that.</p>
<p>Regarding the notability of the subject, the scandal that ended Mr. Byars's company was one of the early events of the campaign against child pornography, still today used as the major argument for censorship and regulation of the Internet. The arrests were the first major appearance in the papers of LAPD sergeant Lloyd Martin who became one of stars of the 1977 child pornography panic, and who is now discredited.</p>
<p>One of the problems the author faces here is that the usual "reliable sources", aren't. The Meese Commission didn't bother to see if the charges were proved, but only that they were made. The headline in the LA Times said "14 Men Indicted in Sex Movies", there were no charges involving "sex movies" and the only movie mentioned was a nudist films legal then and now. The Chicago Times gives numbers for the child pornography market, and for Strait's income as the man with a corner on the market; the numbers are incompatible by an order of magnitude. The book by Robin Lloyd, a best seller with an introduction by a U.S. Senator, has no footnotes, but where one can compare it to the L.A. Times articles, Lloyd reuses the same incident three times, without telling the reader. His major contribution to the kiddy porn panic was inventing the number of "300,000 boy prostitutes" in the U.S.</p>
<p>The article is more accurate and even in its current state better sourced than the "research" on the topic that was the foundation for past and current public policy.</p>
<p>Child pornography may not be notable, but the attempt to repress it - or rather the repression done or advocated in the name of repressing it - certainly is. Mr. Byars was one of the first to be attacked under that banner. He's notable. Chapado 03:44, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Although the immediate BLP issue has been resolved, as the article has been stubbed, here are some specific example of unsourced, potentially libelous statements, Ballog:
<ul>
<li>"Some of the photographs and films were attributed to a "Harlan 'Slim' Pfeiffer" [7] whom may actually be Byars himself", referencing photographs that "featured extensive nudity of boys and young men."</li>
<li>"Other Internet rumors contend "Glawson", who was an obvious favorite of Byars, was given the "rights" to the Lyric works", which is part of a completely unsourced paragraph.</li>
<li>"One Internet poster claims "Terry Stuart" was "Byars first" (possibly meaning first lover or first model)".</li>
<li>"this person basically ruined the film under the direction of Byars who was really only interested in displaying the naked boys."</li>
<li>"One can be certain the writer obtained this biographical information from Byars himself who constantly felt a need to exaggerate his true experiences."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's only going through about half of the pre-stubbed version. I wouldn't be suprised if there's more in the second half. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 04:32, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Congratulations, you are the first of the people who wish to delete this article who took the time to actually read it (well at least half) and actually cite specific sections you have concerns about.</p>
<p>Now let us review your concerns:</p>
<p><i>"Some of the photographs and films were attributed to a "Harlan 'Slim' Pfeiffer" [7] whom may actually be Byars himself", referencing photographs that "featured extensive nudity of boys and young men."</i></p>
<p>First, the Pfeiffer photographs have never been considered illegal and have always been available legally, as they continue to be today. It can not be considered libelous to credit someone with photography that is not considered illegal. Conjecture by an editor is not prohibited so as long as it is clearly conjecture. For example, in numerous encyclopedic articles of the past thirty years concerning Watergate, there has been much conjecture about the identity of Bob Woodward’s “Deep Throat”. The current Wiki article about Rush Limbaugh contains open conjecture about his addition to prescription drugs being the cause of his temporary deafness.</p>
<p><i>"Other Internet rumors contend "Glawson", who was an obvious favorite of Byars, was given the "rights" to the Lyric works.”</i> "One Internet poster claims "Terry Stuart" was "Byars first" (<i>possibly meaning first lover or first model</i>).”</p>
<p>Again, these was clearly identified as a rumor and Usenet postings. Perhaps they do need a link to the Google archived source. (Note: The “favorite of Byars” issue is also contained in the book “Children in Chains”)</p>
<p><i>"this person basically ruined the film under the direction of Byars who was really only interested in displaying the naked boys."</i></p>
<p>This was clearly attributed to the 2006 interview with the Director of the film “Genesis Children”, Anthony Aikman. This sourcing question really isn’t even debatable.</p>
<p><i>"One can be certain the writer obtained this biographical information from Byars himself who constantly felt a need to exaggerate his true experiences."</i></p>
<p>This is a valid concern and should be reconstructed.</p>
<p><i>“ I wouldn't be suprised if there's more in the second half.”</i></p>
<p>Not a productive comment.</p>
<p>The article is nearly 10,000 words long. I’m sure you don’t think it should be reduced to one sentence because of the above few concerns. Ballog 15:34, 7 February 2007 (UTC)Ballog</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, actually conjecture by an editor <i>is</i> prohibited even if clearly labeled. Please see <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. If the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_Limbaugh_cc52.html" title="Rush Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a> article contains conjecture about his hearing loss, that should be removed as well. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> is very clear in the prohibition of original synthesis of thougth. Additionally Usenet postings are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and even if clearly identified as such should not be used as a source or even included in an aricle. Wikipedia is expressly not the place for republishing rumors, particularly those that come from Usenet threads. Something else I've noticed that I'm not sure anyone has touched on is the "What ever happened to…?" section, which is completely inappropriate in the context of this article. This is an article on Byers and off-topic explorations of what happened to individuals who are not Byers don't belong in an article about him. Beyond that, Natalies concerns are valid and are a good reason to see this article reduced to one line at this time per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:51, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I wish you would have indicated which of these sources you have actually read.<br />
<i>Children In Chains" by Clifford L. Linedecker - 1981</i> and<br />
<i>Official and Confidential by Anthony Summers - 1991</i><br />
are both used as sources for both Byars and Strait as well as other information. Are you actually saying that an article primarily about one man can’t contain information about anyone else?

<dd>What I'm contending is that large sections of an article that are about someone other than the subject should not be in the article, even if they are sourced. It is off-topic.

<p>I am entirely confused by this statement. The Salon article is a source concerning Detective Lloyd Martin and the prosecution of child pornography. I don’t believe it ever mentions Byars.

<blockquote>
<p>"Some of the photographs and films were attributed to a "Harlan 'Slim' Pfeiffer" [7] whom may actually be Byars himself", referencing photographs that "featured extensive nudity of boys and young men."</p>
</blockquote>
Not libel. First, Byars was unquestionably producer of a film that "featured extensive nudity of boys and young men". Second, there's a long tradition of that in Western art; see Germaine Greer's <i>The Beautiful Boy</i>. Third, photographs of nudity aren't illegal. The Genesis Children is on sale even now; at least one of Byars's magazines is in the New York Public Library.
<p>Regarding the Salon article: it's <i>wrong</i>. The reference is to a meeting that supposedly took place between J. Edgar Hoover and Byars after the Kennedy assasination; Byars was born in 1936 and 27 at the time of Kennedy's death. The Salon author, you see, was unable to check his facts in Wikipedia...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...it seems that the author is trying to pursue an agenda instead of sticking to verified fact.</p>
</blockquote>
What agenda? He seems to pursuing facts, lots and lots of facts. Perhaps they could be better organized. There may be a lack of a narrative thread, but I can't detect an ideological one.
<p>Several people have said the sources seem scattered. periferical, and unreliable. Yes. Who else appears in the Meese Report and one of the best-selling books focusing on the subject of the Warren Report? There's a real-life Forrest Gump quality to the man. And, as said above, while a lot of the sources are unreliable (Robin Lloyd, the Meese report, the LAPD accusations) an awful lot of public policy has relied upon them. --Chapado 18:01, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm just trying to learn and be cooperative. You have good points that this should not be a biography so I am attempting to comply. I'm sure it was just an oversight but you forgot to do that "WP" thing and cite the Wiki rule you are applying. Could you please "WP" and show the rule against renaming a page in the middle of an afd. I just want read it and continue my Wiki education. Thanks much. Ballog 00:24, 8 February 2007 (UTC)Ballog</p>

<dd>There is no rule to cite (we <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">don't have rules</a>)... it's just not a good idea to move a page mid-AFD as it simply creates a ton of confusion. I'm not doubting you acted in <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> but it is a good idea to let this run it's course.

<p>The goal here should be a good article. Not for some "process" to run it's course or for someone to save face in an argument. When this article was created, the author did not label it a "biography", someone else did. By changing the name and removing the "biography" label, 90 percent of the issues would have been resolved. It is important to remember the actual goal here and not to simply focus on "process". Ballog 00:39, 8 February 2007 (UTC)Ballog</p>

Like Ballog, I'm new here, although I have used Wikipedia for reference often in the past. I do not wish to tread on any toes or break any rules.</p>
<p>It would appear that a biography of a living person is particularly fraught with hazards for a new contributor. Nonetheless, <b>Notability:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Billy Byars, Jr. was one of the principal figures in what the Meese commission called "the first child pornography ring";</li>
<li>"Child pornography rings" make a lot of appearances in the media, a new one having turned up in Austria during this discussion;</li>
<li>The specter of child pornography remains the artument most heavily used to justify regulation, censorship and eavesdropping on the internet, even after the 9/11 attacks;</li>
<li>At least one of those who later became notorious in the crusade against child pornography first appeared in the charges against Mr. Byars;</li>
<li>Looking at the primary sources, then the secondary sources, as done here, leads one to the conclusion that the secondary sources, (e.g. the Meese Report) would never withstand a Wikipedia deletion review.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mr. Byars was an important if involuntary participant in an event that marked the start of a significant societal trend. That the charges against him appear unfounded only increases his importance.</p>
<p><b>Article quality:</b> Yes, there are missing footnotes. Having read many of the sources cited, I am aware that nearly all of the claims made can be substanciated.</p>
<p>I'm also aware that in an encyclopedia, and especially in an article on a living person, there's an enormous difference between claims being provable, and being proven. The editor offered to add in the footnotes. The article being stubbed I believe prevents him from doing so. I'm certainly not going to try because there are too many rules of which I'm unaware.</p>
<p>There may be a lack of narrative thread, and perhaps there is content not essential to the topic.</p>
<p><b>Original research:</b> Much of the world's knowledge is available in libraries, in microfilm or dead-tree format. Clicking a mouse can in seconds give you reams of information on something that happened last week or last year. Something that happened thirty years ago, however, requires you to get your hat and coat and go down to the library. Sometimes many libraries, as one defunct magazine may be in one, another in another, instead of bytes which are searchable from anywhere.</p>
<p>From the No Original Research policy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged. All articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research"; it is "source-based research", and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the exception of interviews he conducted with people involved in events that took place over thirty years ago, it seems to me that that is precisely what Ballog did. It also seems to me that he's getting ragged for having done it in the library rather than on-line.</p>
<p>It takes time and effort to research that way. What can be found for a recent event on Google in two seconds can take longer for information not on the Internet. Two years, say.</p>
<p>But to suggest that the information is somehow less reliable, or less important, or less significant, because it can't be verified by anyone without moving from their desks, is provincial.</p>
The article does not - with exception of the data based on interviews - violate the policy as stated above. The Policy also bars
<blockquote>
<p>"... any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position."</p>
</blockquote>
Several people have suggested that's a problem here. I've asked someone to explain to me what "theory" is being advanced by the article, but no one has answered. It's just a collection of facts. I've put some theory in above justifying notability, but I don't think there's that much theory in the whole article.
<p><b>Civility:</b> Ballog's civility or lack thereof has been subject to sufficent comment here. I will not add to it.</p>
<p>I did find that there's a "Please don't bite the newbies" policy. I like to ask the others here to consider that they have put considerable effort - effort, not just gazing into space to find the right phrase, but shoeleather, squinting at microfilm, scanning chapters and footnotes rather than using full-text search, etc. - into producing an article, on a person whose strange life you find interesting. You post it. Someone says, "Jeez, I can't verify this in under a minute online. Must be a hoax. Let's delete it."</p>
<p>The lack of footnotes in a biography of a living person is a significant flaw, which unquestionably must be corrected. Trouble is, with the article stubbed, the editor can't correct it. I'm sure this isn't a Catch-22, but if someone were to say what the usual way is to proceed, that might be productive.</p>
<p>Also, while I realize that a long-standing community develops a mutually understood technical shorthand, to a newcomer it's crypic gobbleygook. "ABC, DEF, GHI! Q.E.D.! Delete! HIP HIP Hooray!" is roughly how it reads to the uninitiated. I note that early on someone said "HOAX" which is a technical term meaning something different than "Hoax!" That editor explained and even apologized. Unfortunately, that didn't stop the flow of acronyms.</p>
<p><b>Libel:</b> This bears repeating. The material which Mr. Byars's company produced, of which his feature film <i>The Genesis Children</i> is an example, featuring nude young men and boys, was not and is not pornographic. Byars publicly defended the artistic merit of his productions. Much of his material freely and legally circulates today. No pornography charges were ever brought against him; none of his associates were ever convicted on pornography charges. One of his associates, the late Guy Strait, with whom he cooperated in distribution but apparently not production, was a pornographer and a child pornographer, but Byars himself was not.</p>
<p>There is a doctine heard in free speech circles, called the "chilling effect". If something is made illegal, people become very cautious about approaching the limit of what is illegal, and what can't be said because of fear of approaching the illegal extends the zone of what is effectively prohibited. Mr. Byar's work falls into the area of "chill" - it is not illegal, but rarely produced nowadays because the penalties for stepping over the line are so great.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion:</b> The subject is notable; the article well researched, but badly footnoted. The style and organization can perhaps be improved, but that is more easily done than adding facts to a fine piece of empty prose.</p>
<p>The author is perhaps abrasive, but he's also in his first effort been met by what appears less an open community than a closed club, with acronyms in place of secret handshakes. He's had his research disdained because it was conducted with two years of gumshoe work rather than via Google. He seems to be pissed off at that. I would be too.</p>
<p>The No Original Research policy has been unfairly invoked against the article. While the first-hand interviews violate it, the vast majority of the article does not. While people have suggested that there's an agenda, they won't say what it is. I think there's merely a collection of facts. An encyclopedic collection of facts.</p>
<p>If the article is kept - and I think it should be - I assume there's a standard procedure for these cases. Perhaps it goes back in sections as the editor footnotes the material. Maybe the original interviews get left out until the editor publishes them elsewhere. There seem to be a lot of policies about what not to do; surely there are some as to the best or easiet way to do this. Perhaps they could be shared with the same open-handedness as the "thou shalt not" policies have been. Chapado 00:39, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>_ _ G-test
<dl>
<dd>121 of about 376 for "Constantine Andreou" artist</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>_ _ My ProD nomination for it has led to moderation of the article's text that i called
<dl>
<dd>the claim "one of the most eminent figures in the international art scene" that is so absurdly applied to someone w/ the G-test i've also cited above.<br /></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As to that charge that the article overreaches,
<dl>
<dd>_ _ it was and is of course <i>not</i> the basis of deletion,</dd>
<dd>_ _ it should be seen instead as a "cautionary tale" to highlight the danger of uncritically crediting the principal author's assertions of notability, and</dd>
<dd>_ _ it remains relevant in that role, despite the newly moderated language.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>With similar significance, this editor requires scrutiny in the spirit of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a>, as one who either shares a surname with the subject, or has a sufficiently single-minded interest in him as to not mind the risk of being confused with a relative.</dd>
<dd>(In these matters, it would be reasonable to assume the "principal author" is essentially the <i>only</i> author: <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimonandreou_c50c.html" title="User:Kimonandreou">User:Kimonandreou</a> seems likely to also be 68.235.80.153 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.235.80.153_06e2.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.235.80.153">contribs</a>), whose interests 16 months ago -- in the IP's two hours and 7 edits of contrib history -- are essentially the early ones of Kimonandreou, whose first edit to anything came within the next 16 hours. There were 67 edits to the nom'd article before my ProD nom, with 51 of them by Kimonandreou, 3 by the IP, and 16 by others; excluding 7 self-described bots (<a href="../../../d/6/_/User%7ED6_9c90.html" title="User:D6">D6</a> is one) and 2 canceling pairs (each consisting of a vandalism and Kimonandreou's reversion of it), those become 49, 3, and 7; the diffs and "m"s show 6 of the 7 are appropriately "minor"-tagged edits like spelling fixes, lk re-targeting, or redund-cat removals, and the 7th appears to be simply thumbnailing of the pre-existing portrait.)<br /></dd>
<dd>_ _ The article name-drops some notables, without hinting at why we should regard their notability to be contagious.</dd>
<dd>_ _ The most interesting evidence is his receipt of 3 French-named awards and/or titles, in a 4-year period when he'd passed his 80th birthday. But awards so late in life raise questions about what they mean. Could it not be that the French hand out such awards to aging resistance fighters, not for excellence in their chosen fields, but in recognition essentially of suffering &amp; long survival? Are they part of the pursuit of <i>la gloire de France</i>, to be sure that <i>every</i> artist associated with the country bolsters the perception of Paris as the heart of the art world, by ensuring they have a means of getting counted in attempts to measure how many artists owe something to the country? I have relatively little experience with artist AfDs, and no idea how these honors have been treated in the past.<br />

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Google test is innappropriate for articles that aren't recent. Additionally, artist seems to have received important awards. Am I missing something? <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 21:26, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Nonsense. Only problem with Google test on old articles is that it can falsely suggest notability, due to unacknowledged copying from WP. What makes you imagine that lack of G-hits be <i>less</i> of an indication when the article is aged?<br />

<li><b>Keep</b> - The list of awards alone should have made it clear this artist is notable -- the French Legion of Honor is a (the?) major French award, period.

<p>Film director from Malaysia who is weakly notable against <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Two movies (one was an anthology shared with 3 other directors) with no evidence of independent reviews, or any other "non-trivial published works". But he has gained "bronze awards" (not a main prize) from Malaysian Video Awards in <a href="http://www.mva.com.my/Page02_09_archives.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mva.com.my/Page02_09_archives.html" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> and 2003 <a href="http://www.mva.com.my/Page02_08_archives.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mva.com.my/Page02_08_archives.html" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> and the question is whether that's enough.

<li>I agree. Per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, standards of notability include: <i>Multiple features in popular culture publications such as Vogue, GQ, Elle, FHM or national newspapers, a large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following, an independent biography, name recognition, and commercial endorsements</i>. We can't really measure "name recognition," but as for the others, I cannot find any features on Mr. Hann in magazines, I don't see any evidence of a huge fan base, I can't find any biographies (Amazon test), and I personally can't find any endorsements. Bronze awards (third place) at a notable film competition (for lack of a better term) do not make him notable, either. He would be notable if he had one first-place award and one third-place award, but the fact is that he only came in third place twice. Most of the information in the article cannot be supported by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> because almost none exist. <b>Delete.</b> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 14:24, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is no period referred to as the "Civil War of Albany and Cornwall" in Geoffrey's <i>Historia</i>, and no critical literature which calls it that either. The only sites on the internet using the phrase are Wikipedia mirrors. It contains no information that couldn't be accounted for under the names of the characters involved. Unless a non-Wikipedia-derived source can be found for the title, it should be deleted (.The same applies to other made-up articles like Interregnum of Severus, Civil War of the Five Kings, First War of the Two Brothers and Second War of the Two Brothers. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 23:19, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete all</b> per nom. I'm not 100% sure how this information should ideally be handled, but this seems incorrect (the analogy of in-universe history for a fantasy entertainment springs to mind). It is strange how the succession boxes are being used, too -- a war is not a "legendary king". I have added AFDs to the other articles pointing here. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 07:16, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I speedied this, but was asked by someone to restore it. Appairently they have been covered by newspapers (my talk page has some links now). Although A7 specifies "not-notable groups" as speedyable, there are as of now no policy/guideline/proposal on nobility of groups (or I couldn't find anything at least). So I'll leave it up to the larger community to decide whether this meets nobility or not in their eyes. -<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_b1fa.html" title="User:Royalguard11">Royalguard11</a><small>(<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalguard11_4f58.html" title="User talk:Royalguard11">Talk</a>·<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalguard11_Desk_a7bb.html" title="User talk:Royalguard11/Desk">Desk</a>·<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_ER_5b7b.html" title="User:Royalguard11/ER">Review Me!</a>)</small> 00:00, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
