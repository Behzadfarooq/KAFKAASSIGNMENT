<li><b>Keep</b> Deke Sharon is widely regarded as the most important and respected arranger in contemporary a capella, and that's just the beginning of his contributions to this musical genre. This clueless attempt to delete him and the Jacks is flat-out vandalism. CASA, Kid Beyond and Wes Carroll are also worthy of inclusion, IMHO, but omitting Deke and the Jacks would make Wikipedia's coverage of contemporary a capella woefully incomplete. Those pages need more info, but should not be deleted. Anyone who can't find hundreds of significant articles about these two subjects has no idea how to use Google. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.101.144.8 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.101.144.8_9321.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.101.144.8">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— 67.101.144.8 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.101.144.8_9321.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.101.144.8">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Deke Sharon is to a cappella what Vince McMahon is to wrestling. He didn't necessarily start it, but he brought it up to speed and made it contemporary. The Godfather of a cappella, if you will. Removing any of these subject, frankly, would be a glaring absence in the Wikipedia. As a cappella continues to move mainstream, references and information such as these are increasingly important.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.59.194.230 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.59.194.230_99bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.59.194.230">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— 24.59.194.230 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.59.194.230_99bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.59.194.230">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The issue is whether they've been "the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works whose sources are independent of the subject itself." I offer some concrete evidence. The <a href="http://www.rarb.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.rarb.org/" rel="nofollow">Recorded A Cappella Review Board</a> publishes album reviews independently of all the nominees. RARB has published extensive reviews of <a href="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/group-148.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/group-148.html" rel="nofollow">two House Jacks albums</a>, three BOCA albums (<a href="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/236.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/236.html" rel="nofollow">1</a>,<a href="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/191.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/191.html" rel="nofollow">2</a>,<a href="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/135.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/135.html" rel="nofollow">3</a>), and two compilation albums published by CASA (<a href="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/193.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/193.html" rel="nofollow">1</a>,<a href="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/190.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rarb.org/reviews/190.html" rel="nofollow">2</a>). Additionally, due to their prominence, all of the nominees are talked about in reviews of other albums. Here are how many album reviews each nominee is referenced in:
<ul>
<li>CASA 113</li>
<li>BOCA 105</li>
<li>House Jacks 34</li>

<dd>The RARB is not a "non-trivial published work".

<dd>Actually, myspace is the myspace of college a cappella. RARB reviews are written independently by its highly exclusive staff. Groups don't get to contribute to their own reviews, which is apparent in the negative reviews, which you wouldn't find in a PR puppet. A better comparison would be a monthly niche magazine with half a dozen feature-length articles per issue. --Infotrope 19:43, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>But is the RARB itself "non-trivial"? According to its own Web page, it has published 664 reviews since 1994. That's 55 per year, and hardly sounds like a sufficient quantum. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 14:05, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Publication frequency is achieved by having a team of writers. Each person spends two weeks on each album. At least three writers contribute to each review (each having spent two weeks). Every review has at least two more people edit it, and they end up around 1500 words on average. It's not somebody's blog about their cat. --Infotrope 18:34, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The "crap load" of google news articles is just twelve: some of which are satire or blogs and the rest of which are trivial references. Being the openning act to a notable performer is not sufficient for notability even if it warrants you a trivial reference in news coverage of the non-notable performer (e.g. "Bob Dylan performed at X univeristy...the "Non-Notables," a a cappella group at X university opened for him." <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 00:54, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

On Kid's web site, he has a link to a <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5683802" class="external text" title="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5683802" rel="nofollow">6 1/2 minute profile of just Kid Beyond on National Public Radio</a>, broadcast on August 21, 2006.

BOCA has been updated to show more notability, i.e., as a compilation series that tracks the evolution of a musical niche, collegiate a cappella. The House Jacks are the first true modern vocal band (cf. <a href="http://www.a-cappella.com/category/century_of_acappella" class="external text" title="http://www.a-cappella.com/category/century_of_acappella" rel="nofollow">history of a cappella at A-Cappella.com</a>. Kid Beyond was the first vocal percussionist with The House Jacks, and as such was the leader in bringing vocal percussion to a cappella. Wes Carroll produced two instructional DVDs that have been the most widely used method for teaching vocal percussionists. As of today, A-Cappella.com has sold cumulatively 2,945 videos and DVDs from Wes Carroll, just one measure of both Wes' notability and the spread of vocal percussion.</li>

The passing mention in news articles when they open for a notable artist is insufficient. I could start a website for my own a capella group or award and make claims. Unless a reliable source backs it up, self-claims to notability are worthless.

<dd>Regarding the "doesn't make any claim to their being known outside their campus", which I assume refers to the ICCA article; the individual group competing may not be known outside their campus, but the competition itself shows up <a href="http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2004/3/3/battleOfTheSingers" class="external text" title="http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2004/3/3/battleOfTheSingers" rel="nofollow">time</a> after <a href="http://dailycal.org/sharticle.php?id=10841" class="external text" title="http://dailycal.org/sharticle.php?id=10841" rel="nofollow">time</a> after <a href="http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=1998020604020" class="external text" title="http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=1998020604020" rel="nofollow">time</a> after <a href="http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/59163" class="external text" title="http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/59163" rel="nofollow">time</a> in <a href="http://www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2005/05/03/News/News-Brief.Divisi.Places.Second.At.International.Finals-1967208.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2005/05/03/News/News-Brief.Divisi.Places.Second.At.International.Finals-1967208.shtml" rel="nofollow">campus newspaper</a> after <a href="http://www.mcgilltribune.com/media/storage/paper234/news/2006/04/04/AE/Music.Singing.With.Soul-1782118.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.mcgilltribune.com/media/storage/paper234/news/2006/04/04/AE/Music.Singing.With.Soul-1782118.shtml" rel="nofollow">campus newspaper</a> across <a href="http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2006/02/02-02-06tdc/02-02-06darts-11.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2006/02/02-02-06tdc/02-02-06darts-11.asp" rel="nofollow">the country</a>. (For the record in the 3rd article, the NCCA is what the ICCA was called prior to it becoming international) At what point does the competition itself become notable? I'd hope that if it's showing up in multiple student newspapers nationwide (and if you notice the McGill university link, also Canada), the competition itself becomes notable. How do you show that kind of notability, where no single article can show it notable, but the aggregate of 100 articles from different sources show its notability? 70.143.69.177 10:25, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As for "Best of College A Cappella", its basically just an intermural CD colleciton, not an award. Groups have to <b>pay BOCA to get on the CD</b> in the form of pre-purchasing 50 CDs at $5 each. BOCA has a financial incentive to accept as many people who send them stuff as possible and does not have any discernable selection criteria.

<p>It seems like we have one person here (savidan) with a compulsive desire to get rid of some valuable information on what 99% of the people posting here see as totally legitimate, noteworthy, and significant.

<dd>Is there no provision for a work in progress? Contemporary a cappella is a relatively young field with little coverage, but that doesn't make the material any less interesting or less true. We should take what we have, run with it, and keep improving. --<a href="../../../h/t/m/User%7EHtmlism_e997.html" title="User:Htmlism">Htmlism</a> 22:07, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
