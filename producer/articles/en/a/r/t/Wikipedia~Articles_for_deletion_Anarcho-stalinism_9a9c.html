<li>Albert Langer is not a member of a Maoist Communist Party at present, therefore he cannot be a Maoist. Anarcho-stalinists like Langer do not join organised political parties. Brother No. 1 11:40, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> That's a <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">logical fallacy</a>. I'm not a member of any political party.

<li><b>Reply</b> Maoists are members of their own country's Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist-Maoist). Langer was a member, and is no longer, in line with his anarcho-stalinist viewpoint today.Brother No. 1 13:15, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Furthermore, anarcho-stalinism returns 98 Google hits, not 19 as stated above, and anarcho-stalinist returns 335 hits, including mainstream Australian journals such as 'The Age' and 'The Australian', Indymedia, Institutional Economics and Online Opinion, as well as messageboards and email lists across the world. Brother No. 1 11:53, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This article makes no sense to me, for sure. No proper sources, not wikified, not even spelt properly. Neither of the Google hits make any sense either. Away with it! <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> 12:29, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Could you point out the parts which you claim are not 'spelt properly', please. By the way, the correct grammatical phrase would be 'not properly spelt'. Brother No. 1 12:34, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I figured. Perhaps you should know that the sole reason as to why I've never written an article on the English Wikipedia by myself is that... english is not my mother's tongue, and I am quite certain any articles written by me would not be <i>properly spelt</i>. Otherwise, I would obviously correct all these errors. Furthermore; it's missing capitalization at beginning of sentences at least once, and the creator seems to be unable to decide whether to write anarchostalinism or anarcho-stalinism. (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> 12:57, 22 February 2006 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>Thank you for your admission that you were untruthful about my spelling errors. Brother No. 1 13:13, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also; I still don't understand why it's called "stalinism". To me, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinism.html" title="Stalinism">stalinism</a> is a marxist-leninistic ideology characterized by extreme oppression from the ruling party - gulags and all that. The article is also implying that marxism-leninism is the same thing as stalinism, which is obviously not true. ("marxism-leninism (often known as stalinism)"). Ah well. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> 12:57, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thank you for your individual opinion on the definition of 'stalinism'. The word 'stalinism' refers to people who deem themselves Marxist-Leninist-Communists. See the online lists of Communist Parties (Marxist-Leninist) for your further educationBrother No. 1 13:13, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For YOUR further education, you might also browse through the articles about <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinism.html" title="Stalinism">Stalinism</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism-Leninism_8ebb.html" title="Marxism-Leninism">Marxism-Leninism</a>. Then, it will become clear to you that Marxism-Leninism is not often known as Stalinism - such a wording would imply the two are synonyms, and the mere fact that there exists two separate articles for them contradicts this. And I've never even heard the term "Marxist-Leninist-Communists". Would you please point to a source where such a wording is used? Now, regrettably, I must leave you in order to do some proper work. I will return here tonight. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> 13:47, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect and merge</b> with <a href="../../../m/a/o/Maoism.html" title="Maoism">Maoism</a>. Yes, the article cites some invalid sources, and yes, the article is confusing, but the title appears to be a real alternative to Maoism (despite the articles assertions to the contrary), and in some contexts notable.

<li>Maoism depends upon a peasant class, therefore cannot exist in the modern, developed world. Non-party Maoists from the developed world use the term anarcho-stalinist.Brother No. 1 13:13, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, the sources don't support half of the article's assertions.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>One cannot be a Maoist if one is not a member of a Maoist Communist Party (usually denoted by the title Communist (Marxist-Leninist) Party. Maoism is based in areas with large peasant populations, e.g. India, Nepal, Peru, Bangladesh, China. Anarcho-stalinism is an industrialised, urbanised, non-party variant of Maoism, which only exists in countries where there is no peasantry. I'm not sure whether I am confusing you here, or baffling you, but political theorists will understand anyway. Wikipedia should appeal to specialists and experts as well as laypersons like yourself, in order for it to be truly in-depth and comprehensive. A catch-all 'Maoism' just doesn't work. How do you reconcile anarcho-stalinists belief in industrial and scientific advancement with Maoists' belief in iron-smelting furnaces in every peasant's backyard?Brother No. 1 07:56, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Am I confusing <i>you</i>? I think I've been pretty clear about my objections to the article, which are grounded in OR policy: "An edit counts as original research if... it provides new definitions of pre-existing terms; or... it introduces a synthesis of established facts in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing the synthesis to a reputable source." <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 09:58, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for your considered and carefully thought out response, young man - it's good that young people like yourself, especially young Americans, are beginning to take an interest in political issues. Please remember though that political theory extends beyond your university texts, which no doubt have a very norteamericano bias! Brother No. 1 09:10, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I've look through all the article's references and google searched it. I think it's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. It seems to me that the terms <i>anarcho-stalinist</i> has been used almost as a neologism/protologism in a couple of media or alternative media outlets.
