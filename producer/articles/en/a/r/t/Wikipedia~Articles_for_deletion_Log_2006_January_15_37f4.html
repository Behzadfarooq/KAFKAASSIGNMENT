<li><b>Keep</b> Give him some time to finish-your application of the "starting a new page" rules seems a tad strict. Then if its not long enough merge it. Theres no sense merging the content now (including the histories) just so that the article can be recreated once the section becomes too long. Not that I'm knowledgable about the topic, but it seems like there is enoguh on the History of Croation Serbs to justify a new article.<a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 01:53, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a common and widely recognized sub-genre of science fiction. As <a href="http://www.ku.edu/~sfcenter/teaching.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ku.edu/~sfcenter/teaching.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> (part of Kansas University's <a href="http://www.ku.edu/~sfcenter/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ku.edu/~sfcenter/index.html" rel="nofollow">Center for the Study of Science Fiction</a>) points out, science fiction can be subdivided into many sub-genres, including the science fiction Western. No less an authority than <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._B._Priestley_030a.html" title="J. B. Priestley">J. B. Priestley</a> defined the "Western" as one of the three most common science fiction types <a href="http://www.lafn.org/~ba213/tt/05chapter1-seg1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lafn.org/~ba213/tt/05chapter1-seg1.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Some examples, like <i><a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefly.html" title="Firefly">Firefly</a></i>, wear the Western influences on their sleeves, while others show the influence only in concept development (viz. Roddenberry's description of <i>Star Trek</i> as "Wagon Train to the stars"). Whether <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steampunk.html" title="Steampunk">steampunk</a> set in the American West falls into the same category is perhaps debatable, but the existence of the science fiction Western genre is not. Finally, if this were original research, why would it be widespread enough for the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey_City_Writer%27s_Workshop_ba0f.html" title="Turkey City Writer's Workshop">Turkey City Writer's Workshop</a> to condemn it as a cliché? —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 01:08, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename</b>: "Space Western" is a term that has been broadly used for over sixty years. "Space" is an adjective that describes the setting. "Western" is a noun that describes the type of story. The <i>setting adjective</i> always precedes the <i>type-of-story noun</i>. In the case where a Science Fiction story is told in a Western setting (i.e. "Wild Wild West"), the adjective would be "Western," and the noun would be "Science Fiction." The only logical name for this genre is "Western Science Fiction." --Blindingly Glowing 17:05, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Appears to be a schismatic Catholic group originating in Brazil. Would be inclined to give a group like this the benefit of a doubt, at least with regards to notability; the group may not have a big web presence. Probably ought to <b>move</b> to Catholic Apostolic National Church. A general account of their beliefs, with particular attention to the grounds for their separation from Rome, would be more helpful here. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 21:39, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems to be a genuine religious community. Google for "Dom Luis Fernando Castillo Mendez", their "Patriarch", and see especially here <a href="http://www.oldcatholic.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.oldcatholic.com/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. The article now references a source, a website, and the website claims over a million adherents worldwide and has some photographs of church activities, including services with bishops and what might be construed as a church building. But that website is a sorry business, hosted on a commercial web provider with lots of ads, evidently pieced together quickly with lots of empty stubs (including a stub contact page). And the guy they have a photograph of in a priest's costume looks as if he might just as well be some student posing for a hoax. If that's the official site of the British branch of this church, then that branch at least hasn't been doing much publicity work so far. I would give them a few days time to collect more serious references. Also, the authors of the article need to make up their minds whether they want the article to deal with only the British branch, or the worldwide church it represents. As it stands, the article text doesn't match the title. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> 22:38, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Move</b> to <i>Catholic Apostolic National Church in Great Britain</i>. Apparently there are other churches that call themselves <i>Catholic Apostolic National Church</i> which are not associated with these folks or <i>Igrejas Católicas Apostólicas Nacionais</i> (the originating organization in Brazil). But agree with <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a>, these guys should stay in. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 04:22, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> or maybe move and extensively refactor. This is a national chapter of the Catholic Apostolic Church of Brazil, a spinoff founded by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlos_Duarte_Costa_3976.html" title="Carlos Duarte Costa">Carlos Duarte Costa</a> after excommunication, which itself scores a princely 173 Google hits in English and about twice that in its native language; this does not appear to be an organisation of any real significance, as evidence the redlink for the church in the founder's own article.

<li><b>Delete</b> author of four books by a very minor publisher, with no indication of their criteria for seleciton (other than that submitted works conform to editorial POV, aka "the truth"), only one of which is even in the Library of Congress catalog, all of which are available free to download (which is vanishingly rare for any mainstream author). Zero evidence of an audience &gt; 5000 per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and much of what is written is unverifiable from neutral sources. So unless someone can cite me a profile from the New York Times literary section I say this is not so much an author as an evangelist who writes books. On the plus side, according to the author the books are "clear, concise, well written, and precise."

<p>Hello, I wrote lots of this article, I can see your point about deleting it, just thought it would be nice to have a reference article defining exactly what it is for people. Have downloaded page so contents can be hosted on the MP website instead if it goes. What criteria would it have to meet to be a valid entry? Jonnisr 17:24, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a valid article clearly describing the history of the website and was not intended to be for promotional purposes. We don't see how it can not qualify as important enough, but would like some clarification on why it isn't important enough to keep.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The assertion that it is a valid article is begging the question. We are here to determine that very issue and we go by some standards that have evolved to try to separate what is wheat from what is chaff with regard to an encyclopedia. The main criterion is <i>notability</i>. For instance, on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents</a>, under the category Internet, it is stated that "Communities, message boards and blogs are generally not notable." Some other criteria include whether a website at issue has over 5,000 members, and whether it has achieved a degree of fame through other outlets such as being featured in the media. Your community exists, the article may be brilliantly written, it may be factually correct, but what makes your community notable such that it deserves entry in an encyclopedia? That's what's at issue. <a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 04:31, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The same specious arguments have been made, and the same vandalisms done, on a variety of magic-trick articles.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> - Claiming that alleged "copyright" on a trick means others cannot discuss it is a common trick by magicians hopin to keep their routines secret. It, however, has absolutely no basis in law and depends upon them tricking people who don't know better into erasing perfectly legitimate discussions and information. Copyright covers text, images, music, computer code, etc. but not magic tricks or other procedures. Procedures need a patent. Claiming "trade secret" is just using words that relate to patents without evidence of patents. Patents (assuming one would even be granted for something like this, which is highly doubtful) only prevent one from using the procedure oneself in business. By all intellectual property laws anyone and everyone can discuss how any magic tricks are done. Same thing happened on other websites (like the Straight Dope messageboard) with false threats but are ignored once any legal checking is done. Plumbers, for example, might wish to keep everyone in the dark about how to repair plumbing to protect their financial success, but they have no legal right to demand secrecy, same thing with stage magicians. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 23:25, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To begin, I never claimed they were policy. As you correctly stated they are guidelines and should be given serious weight. I don't see how selling 5,000 copies of a porn video makes someone notable. That wouldn't get any other indepant film in unless it won an award. Did she win an award? The guidelines are derived from policy and community concensus. I agree that they may not always address the subject of internet porn very well and, as I suggested in my first comment, it may be worthwhile to find a community concensus for thier inclusion (i.e. WP:PORN). My biggest problem is that people have not even tried to establish why she merits inclusion beyond arguements claiming personal knowlege of the website, which is not consistant with <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> (you are, of course the exception to that statement). Whilst I agree that guidelines need not be followed as strictly as rules, they cannot be completely ignored either. <a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMovementarian_d2cf.html" title="User:Movementarian">Movementarian</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/v/User_talk%7EMovementarian_393b.html" title="User talk:Movementarian">Talk</a>) 04:24, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The 5,000 test is analogous to "Recording musicians who have sold more than 5,000 albums, CDs, or similar recordings" in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I don't know about the prices of CDs and porn movies or the relative sizes of the two industries but that doesn't sound like a bad test to me.

<p>Original research essay that doesn't seem to be encyclopedic. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 03:14, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Why would you keep an entirely unsourced article about the unencyclopedic "general concept of "sports betting forums"? <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 04:27, 15 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Basically, that's what the "serious cleanup" is for. I don't think this article is entirely hopeless, as it explains a type of culture. <a href="../../../s/y/c/User%7ESycthos_ff74.html" title="User:Sycthos">Sycthos</a><a href="../../../s/y/c/User_talk%7ESycthos_0fbd.html" title="User talk:Sycthos"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 04:34, 15 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then I would vote <b>delete</b> unless cleanup is done, because I sure as hell have no clue where to start tackling this article, and if it gets kept it's just going to sit there for another six months with nothing ever done to it. To begin with, the name is all wrong, if we're trying to describe a culture. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 04:53, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please explain to me how this can be cleaned up at all. It's a completely unsourced OR essay - and are you going to do the cleanup? Again, slapping a cleanup and citation tag on this article will mean that it will sit around for the next six months with nothing done to it. Have any of you even LOOKED at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_cleanup_9d23.html" title="Category:Wikipedia cleanup">Category:Wikipedia cleanup</a> lately? There are over 14,000 articles in there.

<p>I must be blind because I checked <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_cleanup_9d23.html" title="Category:Wikipedia cleanup">Category:Wikipedia cleanup</a> and could only see about 400 articles. Can somebody tell me how to see all required articles?</p>

<li>Ginar, take a look at all the subcats, or see <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_89e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup">Wikipedia:Cleanup</a>. As of Dec. 3, 2005, there were 11,328 articles tagged for some sort of cleanup. And by all means, please clean up anything you see!

<li>Seriously, <b>abstain</b>. It doesn't have the ring of self-promotion and speculation that most OR articles do, but I'm not sure whether this is the right place to cover Internet sports betting, and with so many 'keep because it's worth cleaning up' arguments you'd think at least one editor would actually offer to clean it up. If someone did clean the article up it might clarify the issue. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is also known as 'female bullying', or family bullying or workplace bullying, it is a new area of research so be patient until someone cleans up article.</li>
</ul>
<p>If kept then needs to justify characterising this as female aggression. At present seems based on sexist stereotyping. States boys carry out a physical form of this and yet then includes physical aggression under definition for girls.</p>

<dd><b>comment</b> I believe the term was coined specifically to refer to the type of bullying that occurs in female relationships. Being a parent and having children, I know that girls bully differently than boys and I think that's what the article should try to capture. Its not necessarily sexist to point out existing differences in gender behaviour.<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinar_66e3.html" title="User:Ginar">Ginar</a> 14:17, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cimage book is also advertising, as this is a term that Particle9 invented for its work to make it sound unique, when the given definition describes most modern comic books ("an illustrated film in comic book format that is neither comical or satirical"). 0 google hits for "cimage book." <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 04:09, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> In response to the previous weak keep comment, this article has not been stubbed. No worries, I have stubbed it accordingly to give it a chance. A one sentence article about a Red Sox statistician is not encyclopedic, and the information presented in past versions from the <i>history</i> section were arguably useless.

<li>Although I recognize that such a list can be problematic, I don't see it as a delete per se. Here's why:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>There are a significant number of people for whom an ongoing debate about their sexuality is a pretty central part of understanding their historical and cultural context. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, for example, wrote a large number of love sonnets addressed to other males; it's <i>impossible</i> to understand his context without at <i>least</i> acknowledging that an unresolved debate about the deeper meaning of that fact <i>exists</i>.</li>
<li>There are even a significant number of people (e.g. <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morrissey.html" title="Morrissey">Morrissey</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Manson_e590.html" title="Marilyn Manson">Marilyn Manson</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bowie_5100.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a>) who've <i>deliberately</i> cultivated a sense of sexual ambiguity as part of their marketing strategy. In Morrissey's case, particularly, the debate isn't just a part of his cultural context as with Shakespeare — to a very large extent, that sexual ambiguity <i>is</i> the cultural context of his work, and divorcing him from that context would be entirely wrong. (And yes, Bowie later recanted and therefore shouldn't be listed as "debated", but that doesn't change the fact that an ambiguous sexual presentation was part of his public persona at one time.)</li>
<li>It is not original research to report on the existence of a debate that's already been placed in the public sphere by other people outside of Wikipedia, so characterizing this as OR is a misrepresentation.</li>
<li>Deleting this list actually increases the likelihood of people being inappropriately added to the "confirmed" lists. We <i>already</i> have an ongoing problem with people being listed as confirmed GLBT based on circumstantial evidence, even <i>with</i> this list available — without this list that problem will become even more uncontrollable.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>My bottom line, basically, is that I don't see why this needs to be held to different standards than the confirmed list: names listed should provide some support, either in the article itself or through listed sources, that a debate about the person's sexual orientation legitimately exists in the public sphere, and otherwise a name shouldn't be listed at all. If that standard is properly met, however, I don't see why this can't be a <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 22:14, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>FWIW, I definitely see Bearcat's point. In the examples he names, there's something notable about their sexuality being "debated". There are a couple reasons this doesn't quite persuade me to change my vote though:
<ol>
<li>Given that just <i>what</i> is notable in each debate varies widely, do we really lose anything in having these discussions only in the subject articles? I definitely think it's worth mentioning that <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bowie_5100.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a> said he was bisexual in the 1970s, but said he was straight in the 1990s (and it's not hard to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> on this fact). If the list had meaningful annotations about exactly what the nature of the "debate" is in each case, I might be more sympathetic; but it doesn't, and I'm not up to the huge effort of making it so personally.</li>
<li>The quality of the list as it stands is absolutely terrible. Names are added almost at random, or on "a friend-of-a-friend told me" basis. Not to say that some of the same problem hasn't applied to the "confirmed" lists; but we've made a good start at improving the quality of those others (and cites are more straightforward: e.g. the person really said something to so-and-so newspaper). But this "debated" one seems even more gossipy, and more or less certain to stay there if it is kept. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 23:21, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Its not a dicdef. After a little googling, it quickly became appearant that "silent keyboard" isn't a term that stands on its own to be defined. That is, it is merely the word <a href="../../../k/e/y/Keyboard.html" title="Keyboard">keyboard</a> with the adjective <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silent.html" title="Silent">silent</a> in front. I had a hard time finding "silent keyboards" as a recognized type of keyboard at all. Many sites advertised keyboards that are silent, but also added on other adjectives like "waterproof", "rugged", "portable", or "bendable". (As an aside 'silent keyboard' has 714 Google hits as 'waterproof keyboard' has 23,800.) Because "silent keyboards" are not recognized as a standalone species of keyboard, I feel that makes this article unencyclopedic. <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">-- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinmawa_8829.html" title="User:Shinmawa">ShinmaWa</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShinmawa_fb4c.html" title="User talk:Shinmawa">talk</a>)</sup></font> 16:12, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Originator</b>: This article can be changed to address the fact the info changes. The article can also be made to change with changing facts. Nonetheless, there is one fact: there is no easy way for average people to know the real price of things. Wikipedia, as well as being informative in an archane way, must be informative in a subversive way. Advocates for deletion should not be against the article for reason of quality: the initial submission is only an idea. To delete, you must accept that Wikipedia stands for the "Middle man": he does not want discussion of wholesale prices and real costs, except in expensive journals. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony717_7fd0.html" title="User:Anthony717">Anthony717</a> 11:29, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Originator</b>: I can accept deletion by votes, but I don't accept deletion is a good idea. Wikipedia is not a static book of facts; it is a dynamic set of currently accepted truths. One truth, in my opinion, is that retail prices for many things are too high because wholesale prices are kept somewhat secret. Yet there are no well kept secrets. There are only secrets kept from most people, not including eager Wikipedians. We can, together track the prices, month by month, of thousands of goods and services.

<li><b>Originator</b>: I know it is a big ask, but just imagine what is possible.

This article demonstrates the difficulty of trying to maintain an open-source encylopedic article about Internet forums where members can persistently mobilize to effect content of the article about their forum. Though most of the content was contributed by forum members and by the psychiatrist who owns the forum, a member of the forum continues to argue here against independent edits, claiming contributions from independent editors dominate the article. Regular Wikipedia editors have better things to do than persistently reviewing, mediating and arbitrating controversies that inevitably arise from promotional efforts such as this article. I have better things to do than trying to balance promotional articles about a psychiatrist's experimental on-line therapeutic models.

Compare the citation you linked ostensibly verifying the forum as the second most-popular mental health site with the actual Alexa pages for most popular mental health sites <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=1269529" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=1269529" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> and for the top 10 mental health self-help sites <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=26645" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=26645" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>.

The category among which Psycho-Babble was ranked second includes only 20 other sites <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=492330" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=492330" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>. Ranked among the broader group of 53 mental-health support groups that include "stress" the forum falls to third<a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=492330" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=492330" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. Among 401 listed health support groups, Psycho-Babble ranks 8th, but with an overall traffic rank of 86,486th, it falls far behind the leader, which is the National Institute for Diabetes and Kidney Disease site, which is not the topic of a Wikipedia article. The site is not ranked along with self-help groups, or self-help support groups, perhaps because it is administered by a medical doctor. The top mental health self-help support group outranks dr-bob.org/babble 11,406<b>:</b>86,486, and outranks by 11,406<b>:</b>24,164 the top site in the category of 20 sites in which dr-bob.org/babble ranks second. I suspect none of the more notable mental health, self-help or support sites listed by Alexa is the topic of a Wikipedia article.</dd>

<dd>I'll again correct the article to reflect the fact that the site is second among a narrow group of 20 sites, but my continued concern for the article's accuracy does not temper my strong vote for its deletion. The most popular mental health sites are associated with well-known organizations, such as that of the American Psychological Association. The 10th most popular mental health site, with a rank of 27,689, far outranks Psycho-Babble, today at 86,486th. A member of Robert Hsiung's forum selected its standing in a subset that comprises less than 1 percent of the sites listed in Alexa's mental health category and represented it as among the most visited of all mental health sites. Unless Wikipedia plans to include non-vanity, NPOV articles about the 100,000 most visited Web sites that use the Alexa toolbar, Psycho-Babble fails to rise to a level of notability except among a minor category in which many similar sites do not seek to be listed. Second among 20 hardly comprises notability, though inclusion of the claim to suggest second-among-5710 offers notable evidence of promotional editing contrary to facts. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProveReader_b1b6.html" title="User:ProveReader">ProveReader</a> 23:00, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Thanks for clarifying that, ProveReader. I was working, from memory, from an older version of WP:WEB; the criteria have become stricter (a good thing, IMO.) Thanks also for pointing out the selective nature of that linked alexa ranking; going to the "top in all mental health" list <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=1269529" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=1269529" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>, I can't even find it listed in the top fifty. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 01:00, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Could I present my point of view? I think Psycho-Babble is notable. Not the #1 site on the web, but notable. I'm not sure how to make a case for that without running the risk of sounding promotional, but here are a few thoughts.
<ul>
<li>There aren't many online communities that have been sustained for 7 years and grown to 17,000 members and 600,000 posts. I think that's noteworthy. Especially, perhaps, given its mission of peer support and education in mental health.</li>
<li>I think rankings also make it clear that it's not a typical message board. As mentioned before, it's ranked #8 of 401 (in the top 2%) in the <i>Health &gt; Support Groups</i> category by Alexa <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=191" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=191" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>. It's also ranked #4 of about 2,500,000 when you Google <i>effexor xr</i> (an antidepressant medication) <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=effexor+xr" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=effexor+xr" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> and #1 of about 116,000 when you Google <i>therapist self-disclosure</i> (an issue in psychotherapy) <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=therapist+self-disclosure" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=therapist+self-disclosure" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>. It's not Wikipedia &#160;:-) but I think that breadth of information is notable, too.</li>
<li>I'm biased in favor of the site, but others are biased against it. For example, see that blog that ProveReader repeatedly links to <a href="http://dr--bob.blogspot.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://dr--bob.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>. And judge for yourself, from the history, whether the edits I've made have had more positive spin or hers have had more negative. If it would be helpful, I'd be happy to respond to her comments one by one. But I'm not here to make accusations, just to ask you try to be neutral and to consider both sides. <a href="../../../h/s/i/User%7EHsiung_199b.html" title="User:Hsiung">Dr. Bob</a> 11:01, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I originally suggested that, after substantiation of the contents (which was unclear at that time) portions of this article be merged into two seperate articles <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narcissism.html" title="Narcissism">Narcissism</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schizoid_personality_disorder.html" title="Schizoid personality disorder">Schizoid personality disorder</a> and perhaps a third <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schizophrenia.html" title="Schizophrenia">Schizophrenia</a>. Partly because to create articles linking topics covered seperately by existing articles seems excessive.</p>
<p>However, I cannot seem to verify any of the information in this article as it relates to the topic, beyond the original hypothosis (nothing wrong with that, but not in wikipedia) of Sam Vaknin who originally posted it, and, even as such, the entire hypothesis of a link between Narcissism and schizoid disorders remains to be established.</p>
<p>So, I suggest that this article be deleted --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 12:36, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thought I'd better say that I have tried to verify statements specifically relevant to Narcissism and schizoid disorders attributed to Klein, Freud et al and cannot find a trace of them anywhere. I can't verify the reference to Narcissism and Schizophrenia, but even if I could it doesn't belong here (The relationship between schizoid and schizophrenia is purely semantic). There are verifiable statements concerning Narcissism, verifiable statements concerning schizoid, but not a single verifiable statement connecting the two. It is that connection (the title of the article) that would appear to be original research --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 10:14, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a concept so fringe it's non-encyclopedic.

<p>Jimbo Wales - 'fame' and 'importance' are not the right words to use, they are merely rough approximations to what we're really interested in....Consider an obscure scientific concept, 'Qubit Field Theory' -- 24 hits on google. I'd say that not more than a few thousand people in the world have heard of it, and not more than a few dozen understand it. (I certainly don't.) It is not famous and it is arguably not important, but I think that no one would serious question that it is valid material for an encyclopedia.</p>

<p>Also, a search on google that combines "productivism" with its major critic Amartya San gives several page hits on the concept</p>

<li>Well, it seems to mainly come up with documents where Amartya Sen is present, but 'productivisim' is hard to find: except of course for the Wikipedia mirrors, of which there are many. I'd suggest that most of the article we have is a synthesis of occasional uses, for which there is no clear definition. The article constitutes original research and the best way to deal with the concept is in a a note or two in some other articles. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 15:34, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Perhaps a tag asking for sourcess should be added.</p>
<p>If you go beyond the first couple of pages in google, you can actually find the term used copiously. I have traced it to Christopher Lasch and Anthony Giddens</p>
<p>and this essay</p>

<p>cites this book</p>
<p>Giddens, A. (1995) Beyond Left and Right: The future of radical politics. Polity Press.</p>
<p>as a source of the concept.</p>
<p>in fact, a google search pairing Giddens with Productivism <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=com.netscape%3Aen-US&amp;q=anthony+giddens+productivism&amp;btnG=Search" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=com.netscape%3Aen-US&amp;q=anthony+giddens+productivism&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=com.netscape%3Aen-US&amp;q=anthony+giddens+productivism&amp;btnG=Search</a> leads to a lot of google references. *bingo*</p>
<p>For me this really raises the issue of the limitation of using google as a test. All the WIKI entries percolate up to the top leaving the legitimate sources buried. I think we have to be careful.</p>
<p>That is, this concept seems to be obscure only to google<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinar_66e3.html" title="User:Ginar">Ginar</a> 23:53, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>that's not what's happening here. This isn't trying to explain the meaning of life, its pointing to a common sociological term used to describe a very specific economic perspective (i.e., productivism) This entry explains the concept relatively well I think and all we need to do is find an appropriate source. I think it will be easy to find some material by giddens to save this one so <b>KEEP</b> I can't do it now but I will clean this article up and find an appropriate source for it in the next day or two. <a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinar_66e3.html" title="User:Ginar">Ginar</a> 00:42, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you JzG for the clarification. However, I believe this article has already been throught <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Garneau_User_Group&amp;oldid=34268059" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Garneau_User_Group&amp;oldid=34268059" rel="nofollow">the verifiable</a>] test and reliable source test. This discusion should be happening on the talk page. Any further reference to verifiable should be put there. Apparently the GUG still exists and has joined the internationally renowned APCUG. This nomination is pure deletionism and abuse of the wikipedia deletion system. I sugest that voting be clearly explained. why is this subject "obscure"?
<dl>
<dd>Pure deletionism? The club has demonstrated no notability outside its own sphere, meaning the high school. The fact that it is a "chapter" of some umbrella user group organization does not make it more inherently notable. It should be merged to the high school, where it has context and impact. I note that on the talk page, the nominator is being threatened with an RfC over this issue. Pure frivolity. "Garneau User Group" gets 73 Google hits and should be merged. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 20:13, 15 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The issue of Neutrality's conduct is being discussed on the talk page and doesn't really have much to do now with this process. If he fails to answer and deletes one more users request for comment on his user page, I will be obliged to follow through with that RFC. Now it is perhaps understable that notability may be at issue. I did a search on google and only came up with about 20 some hits in french. I think it doesn't realy mater but if you want to waste your time on that (googling) did you try the french version too? Groupe d'utilisateurs Garneau. So back to the question, what makes this subject "obscure?" (aside from the lack of Google ability) I mean this is a mostly a french language run club. Did you also check the links at the bottom of our article (sources). The information is verifiable. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 21:13, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>comment:</b>Can you imagine! There is a deletion nomination that is currently happening for this page Garneau user group. It was nominated by <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">user:Neutrality</a> and for reason of being no-notable. "The problem with writing "Delete, non-notable" is not about whether the articles should be in Wikipedia, but that it is a quick phrase that does not tell another person why the article is non-notable." And though I may currently be torn between some issues found at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> (reasons for not deleting this article), I must, on my first impression, agree that it makes sense to merge with the High school. I however am flabbergasted and disagreeing on the fundamental principal behind the nomination. The nominee has failed to follow procedure. What I mean by that is, I believe that there are other processes he could have used. For example: Instead of going directly to a deletion he could have put a merger request or even an information validity... I would have probably happilly gone along and merged the articles. Secondly why is this article, "obscure?" (The thing is we really don't know). I've attempted to contact <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">user:Neutrality</a> on 2 occasions and he has totally ignored my requests. Is this normal? On both times he has even reverted his talk page. (For supporting evidence see section 1 of <a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_building_a_case_for_RFC_5fd3.html" title="User:CyclePat\building a case for RFC">User:CyclePat\building a case for RFC</a>). This issue is being discussed a little more in detail at talk:Garneau user group however your feedback, and knowledge of wiki, would be appreciated. All this to say, deletion reform is necessary, and lets not allow such actions to go on without repercusions. Please, I ask, can anyone ask user:Neutrality the questions I have asked. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 06:04, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The reason being it demonstrates one of the possibilities he could have done instead? Again, I'm not sure. I guess I could always request undelete later on if really necessary (That's if we do delete this page. It appears like we might be merging.

<dd>Actually, once a merge is done, we can't delete in order to keep the GFDL-required attribution history. A redirect is put in place, but the old contents are kept in history. Merge is quite different then delete, and this article is doing better then most such clubs, which would simply be deleted. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 16:44, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Easy bit first: that information which is verifiable from reliable external sources should be summarised in <a href="../../../%C3%A9/c/o/%C3%89cole_Secondaire_Catholique_Garneau_b567.html" title="École Secondaire Catholique Garneau">École Secondaire Catholique Garneau</a> (being, that it has a chapter of the national association of user groups, that it has taken part in conventions etc., that it publishes an occasional magazine). Don't forget about <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and if you're at all uncertain read <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> twice very carefully to see the precise circumstances in which certain types of information can be used as a source; for preference then <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite the sources</a> although if it's trivially easy to verify the information a comment on the talk page is probably sufficient.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Technically the GFDL forbids deleting of merged content; that depends I guess on whether it is <i>merged</i> or <i>summarised</i> from a review of those reliable sources which can be found (if it's summarised from sources, arguably the GFDL restriction does not apply; also if the original editors enter the new, slimmed-down, verified content the rstriction may not apply - it's a grey area in my view, but Uncle G will know the formally correct answer).</dd>
<dd>Now to the issue you have with <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">Neutrality</a>. Frankly you are wasting your time. <i>Anybody</i> can nominate <i>any</i> article for deletion at <i>any time</i>. Articles nominated in error should not get deleted (and when this is really obvious the nomination is sometimes withdrawn, at others there is an early closure with consensus speedy keep or some such). But that does not change the fundamental fact that bringing an article to AfD is not, in itself, a big deal; it's the AfD debate that matters. Excessive, frivolous or contentious nominations might be construed as vandalism, but there is no evidence of that here, Neutrality is a prolific and widely-respected editor, a long-time admin, a member of ArbCom. This AfD was not contentious in any way, there is established precedent for merging school clubs to the school article or deleting them altogether (and very little precedent for anything else). This is addressed in a light-hearted way in <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/i/WP%7EBAI_39d0.html" title="WP:BAI">WP:BAI</a>. Neutrality states on his Talk page that he does not get involved in minor disputes - and he's not getting involved in this one either. You now know what the score is with respect to this particular AfD, so you have the information you wanted, and I would suggest that should be enough. His lack of response could be construed as "why the hell <i>shouldn't</i> I nominate it?" - and given precedent, there is no reason why not. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_AfD_78f4.html" title="User:JzG/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 17:21, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Laird is a Scots title meaning "lord" in the sense of "landowner" - it's not a title of nobility, nor does it essentially assert any importance beyond that they had fifty quid to spare. You can easily find somewhere on the web which will sell you a square foot of land in the Highlands, allowing you to call yourself Laird of Somewhere... and, indeed, the Laird of Glencairn is currently a prolifically-retailed "title". (I know someone who got one for Christmas...). Bio, no real assertion of notability - he's someone wealthy, probably under 30, who hasn't done much if anything - so probably speedy-deletable.

<li>Not sure I understand your point. Are you saying just because he's a professor, he is notable enough for inclusion??

<li>Perhaps people shouldn't unilaterally change the procedure for making a nomination, without first gaining consensus, and updating the written procedures. Also, don't ever tell registered user's they're not welcome here. Bots have no role in the decision to make a nomination. That should be obvious. Anons are prohibited from making pages, and bots should not bypass that restriction on their behalf. This nomination is invalid. A non-bot registered user wishing to make one is welcome to. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 19:39, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>What exactly is CSD G1 and why do you people keep trying to delete my article, which, believe it or not, is completely factual. Some little kid in Bulgaria doing a school report on Beer bogganing is cursing your names because you have denied him the knowledge he needs because of your overzealousness.</li>
<li>First, it might behoove that little kid in Bulgaria to learn Canadian English first. Secondly, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_for_things_made_up_in_school_one_day_29ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day">Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day</a>. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">King of All the Franks</a> 15:50, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hello? Are you not hearing me? Beer bogganing is <b>not</b> "made up". It is an actual tradition. Know anyone between the ages of 13 and 22 who lives in southern Canada? Call them, and ask them. Maybe you'll take their word over mine. I find it offensive and rude that you would question something that I've posted in this manner.
<ul>
<li>Okay, we're talking about sledding and drinking at the same time. That's it, nothing else. It has no place in an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">King of All the Franks</a> 16:01, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another thing, look at these links: <a href="http://high-fructose-corn-syrup.blogspot.com/2005/12/beer-bogganing.html" class="external free" title="http://high-fructose-corn-syrup.blogspot.com/2005/12/beer-bogganing.html" rel="nofollow">http://high-fructose-corn-syrup.blogspot.com/2005/12/beer-bogganing.html</a>
<p>Just sledding and drinking at the same time? Isn't that a bit like saying that a lasagna is the same as eggs noodles and tomato sauce? By saying that, you're insulting a Canadian tradition. That's called racism. Had I posted anything so foul as what you have been saying about my beliefs and traditions in one of my articles, I'd have been banned.</p>
<ul>
<li>But it's nothing more than a hobby. It has no notability outside of some small parts of rural Canada. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">King of All the Franks</a> 16:19, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>To be fair I've heard of it and I'm in England. Maybe not exactly matching the description in the article but something quite similar.

<li>I will admit that I am the one who posted the article, and I had to create this second account because admin "Borg Queen" banned me because of what I guess she thought was my "overzealous" defence of the article. "Can this be referenced in a sociological study of Canadian teenage practises?" see <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=beer+bogganing" class="external free" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=beer+bogganing" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=beer+bogganing</a> I don't think you need much more proof. (And I did not create this second account out of any malicious intent, I merely want my point to be heard. The practice is verifiable, and I did not create the term. Nor is it "unimportant", any more so than enything else on Wikipedia, that is.)
<p>And- in response to Tearlach's earlier comment- "has it been documented in any reputable publication? No." I think you are forgetting that anti-elitism is one of the cornerstones of Wikipedia. If the only things in Wikipedia were things that had been documented in a "reputable publication", it would just be a lacklustre copy of the Encyclopedia Britannica. Wikipedia is about evolving and constantly changing. Everything has to start being "documented" somewhere, you know what I mean? In this way, your comment is fundamentally flawed in terms of Wikipedia's mission and goals.</p>
<p>And krispymann? I'm sorry but your statement was very foolish. "OFFENSIVE! Wikipedia is not here to promote or define destructive actions or decisions, no matter how traditional. " Does this mean the extensive Wikipedia article on hanging promotes capital punishment?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The reference you've provided is to the <i>Urban Dictionary</i>, which describes itself as: "a slang dictionary with your definitions. Define your world." Frankly, <i>you</i> could have added this definition (are you in fact Greg Wester?); this isn't a good enough citation, especially as it seems to be the only one available.<br />

I wasn't sure whether to tag it for cleanup or nominate it here, but I have gone for the latter as the article is frankly useless as it stands.

<p>This topic is inherently PoV; furthermore, this text does not <i>discuss</i> the studies but is a defense of one particular DPT.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I would suggest that the a better alternative would be to mark this as possibly not neutral and then attempt to insert are more NPOV view. I was the person who called for this article's creation as I felt the main DPT article was being swamped by the statistical studies section. I am far from an expert on the subject, so I don't feel that I am able to comment on its neutrality, but bias is not a basis for deletion.</dd>

<li><b>strong keep</b> or <b>move</b> to Democratic peace theory (statistical studies) at least a NPOV name, which would allow any counter studies to appear. I think this article needs to be viewed in terms of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_peace_theory.html" title="Democratic peace theory">Democratic peace theory</a> as a whole. This article seem to be a good way of splitting of a technical section from the main article. The main article does contain a reasonable critisism section. In man way this is a very good wikipedia article, it is one of the most well referenced article I've come across and the references come from many authors so its not just a one man band.

<li><b>Keep</b> I was disappointed to see this page deleted also. If it was just self-promotional, it would have probably been on an island, but there were actually several other Wikipedia articles linking to it before it was deleted. 68.97.35.20 21:49, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>User has six contributions, all of which went to restoring this article. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 23:40, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are 40,000 records in the Guinness Book of World Records. Which ones are "notable" and which ones aren't? Surely we're not going to list them all. With that said, should the records that <i>Guinness</i> thinks are worth mentioning be used as a resource? <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/" rel="nofollow">GuinnessWorldRecords.com</a> does not even mention the category. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 23:40, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>keep</b> I vote 'keep' because singing the lowest ever recorded note for a human is similar to records for being tallest or most massive, but different from records such as making the largest pancake or longest continuous juggling, because it is directly related to a single physical characteristic shared by all normally functioning humans. If Wikipedia wants to make a distinction as to which record holders are worth including, this seems like a good option. (I wrote a large part of the text for the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Acappella_%28group%29.html" title="Acappella (group)">Acappella (group)</a> article, but I had no idea who Tim Storms was before I clicked the link to his name because I am not a fan of his era of the group, and thus do not feel that I am biased because of it). <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolding_Chair_2456.html" title="User:Folding Chair">Folding Chair</a> 01:28, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> As Tim Storms' record is mentioned at <a href="../../../v/o/c/Vocal_range.html" title="Vocal range">vocal range</a>, and there is a page for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_world_records.html" title="List of world records">List of world records</a>, is this separate article warranted? I agree that there's merit to recording the record and the record-holder, but when everything there is to say can be presented as:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Lowest voice</b>: Tim Storms (formerly of singing ensemble <a href="../../../a/c/a/Acappella.html" title="Acappella">Acappella</a>)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>is a separate page appropriate? Incidentally, I'd say your having written part of the Acappella article doesn't affect at all the merit of your argument -- Your argument doesn't even mention the group, so I don't see how it could at all be biased by it -- though hey, cheers to full disclosure. . <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 03:27, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Don't keep</b> This is an excellent point. I withdraw my vote for keep. If Tim Storms' name can be linked to the page for Guinness world records on the Acappella page and anywhere else he is listed, then I do not think he warrants his own article.<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolding_Chair_2456.html" title="User:Folding Chair">Folding Chair</a> 01:10, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There's probably no such thing as a probationary keep, but I think it should be kept for the time being. It seems like if months later there is no major changes to the article, then it should be deleted. I think one of the criteria for an article is that it has to have the potential to become more than a stub, and that's something that probably can't be determined right now. Beisnj 06:34, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article is eight months old; the only changes since first being written (besides stubbing and categorization) is the addition, and removal, of information regarding Mr. Storms' affinity for donuts. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 16:50, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is - or can be - covered in detail on the Bashkir language page.

<p>I apologize if I'm putting this in the wrong place, but we are trying to have all of the non-Slavic Cyrillic letters covered in the same detail as the Slavic ones. The Bashkir language page only states that it uses a modified version of the Russian alphabet, and that it contains several letters like this one. I don't have very much to contribute at the moment, since I don't speak Bashkir (and it doesn't seem like many Wikipedians do, judging from the 24-article Bashkir Wikipedia). As for the name of the article, usually I try to assign it its name, like the other Cyrillic letters (A, Be, Ve, Ge, etc), but I don't know what Bashkirs, or anyone, calls this letter, and it's not in my Character Map. <a href="../../../w/a/y/User%7EWaynem_8d34.html" title="User:Waynem"><b>Waynem</b></a>|<a href="../../../w/a/y/User_talk%7EWaynem_ef83.html" title="User talk:Waynem">talk</a> 17:57, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, for paralellity with other letter-articles (not just Cyrillic but also Greek and others), but move to a descriptive name.

<li><b>Merge</b> into new article, perhaps Key card (card trick) or some similar title?... and then redirect, because I agree with nom that we don't need an article for every Key card variant.

(<a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading_The_Cards_b0e6.html" title="Reading The Cards">Reading The Cards</a> might be another candidate article to merge/redirect?) Key card is an important mechanic and deserves an article, along with forcing...

<li><b>Comment</b> An article on what Read Codes are, and why they are important, and how they get determined, how long they've been around, how many there are, etc. might well be encyclopedic (the 64K hits on the term suggests that they indeed are an important concept). BUT, an incomplete list, non authoritative, with an authoritative source elsewhere, and with no hope of being kept current without herculean effort, is not.

<dd>Whats wrong? Ben Burch, by his own statements attests that he is not notable. He just doesn’t fit the bill for those important enough to be listed in a encyclopedia. Given his accomplishments to-date will he be remembered in 100 years? What about another benchmark... if I asked 10,000 people on the street who "Ben Burch" was, would any of them know anything? Maybe Mr. Burch will become one of the most influential people of the 21st century. But we can't judge the articles worthiness on "maybes."

<dd>You're right. Burch is pretty much an unknown outside a small group of people. I would guess that most on DU and the opposing website CU know about him and his website. There is a minority that have heard of him on FR. However, one of the criteria to determine whether to keep an article or not is whether they contribute regularly in a publication that reaches 5000+ individuals. I would argue that that number is too low, but AVN's circulation number of 40,000 and that he contributes monthly qualifies him.--<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinOne4TheGipper_5997.html" title="User:WinOne4TheGipper">WinOne4TheGipper</a> 22:08, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yellowikis doesn't "grab" articles, Uncle G's bot transwikis them. Yellowikis has been around for just over one year. Most of the articles are considered incomplete in some way so they are marked as stubs - and for that reason they are not included in the count of legitimate pages. Yellowikis isn't a business. The use of the "rel=nofollow" tag prevents the external link from acting as linkspam.--Yellowikis Admin 01:33, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

DELETE the spamming links to it seen in other articles and see if it can't be rewritten to be more POV. It seems to have grown somewhat since the first nom. On the other hand, if it keeps growing, maybe even if it gets deleted this time, it can always come back later.

<li>WP has lots of links to other WikiMedia Projects that are in construction - We thought that it would be OK to link to a FDL, non-profit, (but non-foundation project). Uncle G advised against it so we stopped. But I still think we should be able to encourage people to add information to Yellowikis. Just as some articles point people at WikiBooks or WikiSpecies. --Yellowikis Admin 01:33, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've now read the first and second discussions, as well as reviewing the article history. I'm confused as to why some of the cite material was redacted, and now aware it's you that causes semiautomatic transikification to happen (and if you have any ins with the team there, you may want to recommend they take some antivandalism steps!). But I have not seen anything to change my vote from keep as noted above.

Even if it's just bot-work, that's still disk space and server time being used. And "our resources" are those that go towards the aims of the project.

<li>Er. I didn't say <i>"here are a bunch of resources that are <b>going</b> to be used,"</i> but I could have been more clear in that. I also said that bot work still consumes resources. It's a minor point, but I'm not seeing any indication that I'm wrong. The bot runs on Wikipedia servers, it's consuming a Wikipedia resource, albeit a tiny amount. Clearly there is such a thing as "our" resources, which is why I can't use my user page as a <i>de facto</i> myspace and why we eliminate spam. I now yield the floor.<br />

<li>What makes you think that "the bot runs on Wikipedia servers"? Was the hint from the person who runs the 'bot that <i>there are no such resources</i> perhaps too subtle an indication that it <i>doesn't</i> run on Wikipedia servers? ☺ And I didn't ask what "our resources" were in general.

Based upon clues in the discussion there, I actually located several articles myself at the time. More have been added since. Whether content is copied from here to Yellowikis is irrelevant to whether this web site is notable. But so, too, is discussion of Alexa ranking, Google hits, and article counts. Such considerations no longer form part of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and rightly so because they are <i>bad</i> metrics. WP:WEB asks for non-trivial published coverage of the site by multiple sources independent of the subject, and the article links to several such published works. True, this web site is at the bottom of the notability scale. But it <i>does</i> satisfy the WP:WEB criteria. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 07:00, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'm a long time wikipedia user, been using wikipedia for the longest time, even though most of my edits are done without logging in. I don't understand the fuss about yellowikis, since wikipedia is full of other junk stubs of companies that probably needs clean up. Most are even under the wrong name. Furthermore, currently Yellowikis is not for profit, thus a place to advertise start up businesses should not really classify into this argument. Also, why aren't other articles like wikicompany etc. not being considered for deletion, seems like utmost bias to me on part of the users of wikipedia towards other wikis. --Stabani 20:25, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. On closer examination, it appears that Stratford exists solely of <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratford_Hall_Plantation_f4f8.html" title="Stratford Hall Plantation">Stratford Hall Plantation</a>, which already has a fairly complete article. I'm not sure if it's in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montross%2C_Virginia_6416.html" title="Montross, Virginia">Montross</a> (pop. 315), but that's the nearest town. And I'm also not sure there is anything else to say about Stratford. Maybe a clarification on the Stratford Hall Plantation article that Stratford consists solely of the plantation and a redirect from Stratford to Stratford Hall Plantation. Has anyone been there who can verify this? <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 01:58, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratford_Hall_Plantation_f4f8.html" title="Stratford Hall Plantation">Stratford Hall Plantation</a> per my explanation above. Stratford has its own zip code, but other than Stratford Plantation, there is nothing else. It's not a real town. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 13:23, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I strongly recommend a <b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratford_Hall_Plantation_f4f8.html" title="Stratford Hall Plantation">Stratford Hall Plantation</a>. Like Crunch, I haven't been able to find any evidence at all that it is a real town (with inhabitants or government or recognition from the state). It is in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westmoreland_County%2C_Virginia_ef3c.html" title="Westmoreland County, Virginia">Westmoreland County, Virginia</a>, which is itself very small, with only 16k residents. I looked-up Stratford's zip code at the <a href="http://www.usps.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.usps.com/" rel="nofollow">Post Office web site</a>; It does have its own code, 22558, but it consists of only a single PO Box (likely the <i>Robert E. Lee Memorial Association</i>, who run the plantation as a museum, since they list that zip code on their <a href="http://www.stratfordhall.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.stratfordhall.org/" rel="nofollow">web site</a>). If, in fact, Stratford refers solely to the plantation, it should not have a separate article. <i><b>×</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 10:17, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>More Comments</b>. Well, in an effort to try to clarify things I actually phoned Stratford Hall Plantation today (804-493-8371) to see if someone there could help me figure out the relationship between Stratford and Stratford Hall Plantation. I spoke to a person in their Visitors Center who told me, "Stratford <i>is</i> the Stratford Hall Plantation. We have our own zipcode but that's it. It's just for the Plantation." I asked if there were any residents of Stratford and he said that there were a few employees of the Stratford Hall Plantation who live on site, but no one else. He also sounded like he gets asked this a lot. Based on this I think it doesn't make sense to have two separate articles. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 17:22, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, no matter how....Moronic...It seems. Just....Trust me on this one. Lincolnism is an actual religion. As I said on the topic articles page, it's by no means a MAJOR religion...But some odd folks actually practice it by my high school, at a "church" called First Lincolnist church. That stuff about Francis Bacon and space whatever makes me doubt this particular author's credibility, but if you guys want, I could pick up a copy of <i>G Dawg</i> tommorow and update it. But, again, as I posted in my article, the prophet information (and every time they called it radical) was true, from what I've heard about Lincolnism.

<dd>Sigh. If we <i>must</i> do this yet again. Encyclopedic: Of, relating to, or characteristic of an encyclopedia. That's not that confusing. An encyclopedia's job is <i>not</i> to provide users with acess to "all the information they would hope for". Speculation about the next Pokemon, day-by-day acounts of the size of Katie's baby bump, who's gotten bone-thin this week: the ephemera we do not include is almost endless. Every time we <i>do</i> include a sterling example of fugacious nonsense like this, it crowds out <i>real</i> information (you know, like <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art.html" title="Art">art</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculus.html" title="Calculus">calculus</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a>) in several ways:
<ol>
<li>It takes up a small but real portion of disk space. That actually costs money. We have fundraising to pay for things like new servers in part because articles <i>take up space</i>.</li>
<li>It takes up a small but real portion of people's time. The "don't like it? don't look at it." argument is completely fallicious. Shall I somehow expunge this article from my recent changes list? How then will it be kept free of vandalism and innacuracy? Leading to...</li>
<li>It erodes in some small way our reputation. Little crufty corners <i>can</i> get ignored, and that's actually a <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_thing.html" title="Bad thing">bad thing</a>. Every time it hits the news that we've dropped the ball on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> it means that any real information we give to our users will have just a little bit less value.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Delete the crap, the unsourced, the trivial, the mundane. Let us cease the endless bickering and how we cling like drowning men to these tiny articles of little utility, and concentrate on doing something meaningful instead.</dd>

<dd>This project job's is to provide every human being with all the knowledge they would wish for. As the encylopedic branch of the project, wikipedia's job is to provide the portion of that information that fits inside an encyclopedia of some sort. The amount of money that the storage of homerunner pages costs is probably about a cent per decade and falling. The time it takes up on 'recent changes' is outweighed by the time Homestar Runner contributors would give back to wikipedia, if their work wasn't being destroyed. I find it hard to believe that USA Today or Nature magazine would run a headline story saying "Wikipedia gets Homestar Runner character wrong", I kinda think they are more likely to be interested in more significant topics. What you consider crap, trivial or mundane may be the most important thing to some users, for example my favorite band doesn't pass <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> any more, and I would really, really like to be able to read about my local churches. If an article has utility, however little, why not leave it alone and concentrate on doing something meaningful instead? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 23:49, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Not to mention that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Homestar_Runner_characters_f77f.html" title="List of Homestar Runner characters">List of Homestar Runner characters</a> is not only incomplete, but a factual and grammatical mess with a subpar reading level which no one wants to fix, because they can find it all on HRWiki anyway. —<a href="../../../b/a/z/User%7EBazookaJoe_466f.html" title="User:BazookaJoe">BazookaJoe</a> 22:40, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm confused. If this is a 'minor' character, is the character notable enough to warrant their own article? I think merging this in seems a good idea, regardless of dialup users.

<li><b>Delete</b>Non notable character. Of course it gets lots of hits. Everquest is a widely played game, and there are databases and websites galore tracking all the information. Everquest has many thousands of NPC (Non player character) with many indeed more notable than this guy err dog. Thinking of the users, it will be helpful if their searches do not bring them here but rather to a site with lots of information. This a slipperly slope of a very steep kind. The number of EQ articles (and DAoC, EQII, etc) will be large, 'Dwarf'ing Star Trek, and be a Ogre of a task.

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm very inclusionist when it comes to fictional/game characters, but this should go. Unless I'm remembering wrong, it isn't an NPC (non-player-character), but a named mob (basically a slightly more-powerful monster with a name). There isn't a way to interact with it, you just either kill it or avoid it. Trying to cover every single named creature in a huge and ever-expanding game like Everquest is beyond the reasonable scope of an encylcopedia. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 16:36, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Everquest has hundreds of named monsters who are not characters but simply one-off enemies players must defeat. (Open that up to include games like World of Warcraft and EQ2 and the other MMOs...ow, my head hurts). This character has no personality, and is of little interest to anyone who hasn't killed him already (and already knows all of the meager info in this article).

<p>I nominated this page for speedy because it is merely an advertisement, but an anon reverted it. Rather than get into a revert war with an anon who seems to be bent on contributing to this article, I'm going to post this here.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> I tried removing a lot of the uncyclopedic text, but the page wound up being about one line long. I posted as much on its talk page. Also, the anon that removed the speedy delete tag technically engaged in vandalism, though perhaps it was wrong of me to put the tag there in the first place. --<i><a href="../../../d/c/r/User%7EDCrazy_776f.html" title="User:DCrazy">DCrazy</a></i> <span style="font-size: 8pt"><a href="../../../d/c/r/User_talk%7EDCrazy_1571.html" title="User talk:DCrazy">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DCrazy_4983.html" title="Special:Contributions/DCrazy">contrib</a></span> 02:52, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've taken out some material. Maybe a couple more sentences could go, but it is full of solid information. The "one line" claim is ludicrous.

<li>Check the edit history and you'll see that there was virtually no information in the article when I posted the speedy delete.

<li>It was 355 words long, which is slightly longer than the average wikipedia article, and it was full of solid information. It is hard to believe that we are talking about the same article.

<li>That's a ridiculously over the top interpretation of policy imo. We want as much true information in wikipedia as possible, and there is no reason to doubt the information about what courses are offered and the like.
