<li><b>Strong keep</b>. An enormous, notable reference source for a great many Australian articles. A lot of work has gone into producing this, and it shows in the result.

<ul>
<li>They've occupied important national or statewide offices, and during their terms have appeared quite a number of times in the media speaking about relevant issues. Quite a number of these people have gone on to other notable careers, often in politics, and this list serves as a useful source regarding their time in the NUS. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 05:08, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That makes no sense. The list is limited to a very, very small subset of people - those who have held a major office in the National Union of Students. What is it with this new fad of trying to bizarrely stretch the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> criteria to cover all sorts of situations? <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 05:39, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Uhh, the list is/are 43 lists if I counted correctly. I call that pretty indiscriminate -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 05:53, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>And, I can understand a list of presidents being included in the main article, but a list for every type of office they have? -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 05:59, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Union_of_Students_of_the_United_Kingdom_b0b1.html" title="National Union of Students of the United Kingdom">UK NUS</a> is a significant launching pad for politicians, with people like <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Straw_%28politician%29_822f.html" title="Jack Straw (politician)">Jack Straw</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Clarke_33ec.html" title="Charles Clarke">Charles Clarke</a> starting their political careers there. From what I can tell, the Australian NUS is similar, and the currently smaller proportion of notable people is probably due to the fact that the list goes back only to 1988. I think the list is valuable for that reason and because these officers led an organization of 700,000 members. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneVeryBadMan_2984.html" title="User:OneVeryBadMan">OneVeryBadMan</a> 05:51, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Only two have articles on wikipedia, and one is prodded. As the above user noted, the group is notable, but each individual representative is not. Honestly, it's like naming every representative of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Association_of_Fire_Fighters_9a1d.html" title="International Association of Fire Fighters">IAFF</a>, it's just not necessary. <a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmopkisn_365a.html" title="User:Tmopkisn">tmopkisn</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmopkisn_1dc1.html" title="User talk:Tmopkisn">tlka</a></sup> 05:57, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you must vote to delete this article, at least learn to count the number of articles. Eight of these people have articles, and several more need them but haven't got them yet. If nothing else, the list highlights some notable people who need articles and is a useful reference when they are written - it is thanks to this list, for example, that I realised <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louise_Pratt_bc03.html" title="Louise Pratt">Louise Pratt</a> had served in a major NUS role. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 06:03, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong delete</b> - about two of these people are proper politicians, the other guys like <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felix_Eldridge_56d7.html" title="Felix Eldridge">Felix Eldridge</a> are only notable for organising a rally against <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">John Howard</a>, etc, which isn't notable. Some of the recent SA guys have spoken to me personally (at <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide_University_bcc4.html" title="Adelaide University">Adelaide University</a> trying to get me to vote for them etc,) and they command crowds of about 50-150 people who lined up for a free sausage mostly. Non notable people, about as notable as some a7 bands, random people. Plus there is about 10% turnout for student elections, despite all this cajoling during election week, and most students don't know the name of their leader and then forget after election week anyway. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 07:15, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think a proper distinction, in terms of notability, is being made between the whole and the parts. A list of famous and notable people may be deleted because the list itself is useless. This is the opposite case, because the list as a whole is notable, even though many of the individuals are not. Virtually every student and graduate in Australia has been represented by these officers at some point. I think the list is a useful reference which will increase in value as these people progress in their careers.<br />
Also, it is not merely a list of names, but includes their party affiliations, which is very important for people researching the political development of the organization. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneVeryBadMan_2984.html" title="User:OneVeryBadMan">OneVeryBadMan</a> 07:20, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>People who have held these notable roles, not the individuals</i> Individual people hold these notable roles, is that not correct?

<dd>I am unclear why you have to drag Good Faith into this. A slight majority of the people responding here agree with the nomination, which makes the encyclopedic merit of this list tenous at least. I am well aware AfD is not a popularity content or a vote, but this level of support is saying something.

<dd>So far as I can remember, this is the first time I have run across this list. It didn't come up as a repeat AfD when I put the afd tag on it, and I did ask above for a link to the previous one. I have no interest or involvement in Australian politics, student or otherwise, this is merely, to me, a completely silly list of non-notable people. Which is why I listed it. Obvious bad faith, of course. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 18:26, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Not bad faith, no, but rude and bloody-minded to push through its deletion when there are people who clearly find it useful, and have expressed above good, unaddressed reasons for it being kept. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 00:14, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It would be good to keep this civil, think of your blood pressure&#160;:) No doubt people find this list useful, that's not open for debate. But it would be equally useful in userspace. But does it belong in an encyclopedia? I say no. And none of the "unadressed reasons" are maybe addressed as they're not perceived as very good ones by the supporters of this AfD. If these people are really so important, how come almost none has an article in Wikipedia? <a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomedae_bf2b.html" title="User:Lomedae"><font color="#0000CC">L</font><font color="#0033CC">o</font><font color="#0066CC">m</font><font color="#0066FF">e</font><font color="#0099CC">d</font><font color="#00CCCC">a</font><font color="#00CCFF">e</font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../l/o/m/User_talk%7ELomedae_0349.html" title="User talk:Lomedae"><font color="#3399FF"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 00:46, August 4, 2006 (UTC).

<dd>Which just shows that you haven't read the objections, since no one is claiming that everyone here is individually notable <i>outside</i> of having held a <i>notable position</i>. Wikipedia is not paper, and there is absolutely no reason why this could not go in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 00:50, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm sorry, rude? Listing an item for AfD is rude? Then we might as well just shut down AfD altogether, we'd hate to be rude to anybody. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 02:30, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I appreciate the obvious work that has gone into this list but I don't think it belongs in the mainspace. If some people find it useful as a reference source for article writing, userfy it. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 03:30, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. In my opinion, it is possible that someone may one day need this list for some kind of research, but this sort of information belongs in one place: the NUS website, not Wikipedia. I don't see why anyone would look on Wikipedia for this other than looking for the NUS website link here. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 03:35, 4 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But it isn't on the NUS website. You're admitting that it's a useful article, and then voting to remove it from the internet altogether. This is not helpful. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 03:54, 4 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I know it isn't on the NUS website, and I think it should be. I will write to them and suggest this is added, but I still don't think it belongs on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 05:59, 4 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why not? We have many lists, many of which are far less useful than this, and it interlinks well with the people that do (and those that should have) articles. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 06:03, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This utter blip on the radar doesn't even deserve a sentence. Feedyourfeet 13:55, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Simply listcruft. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 21:55, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> - as per <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> - this is a massive list for which a lot of work has been done. NUS is important in Australian student politics and its list of office bearers should have an article. If this is to be deleted, at the very least it should be a section of the NUS article. (<a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 12:27, 6 August 2006 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: a list can be notable in itself without each and every item being notable. HTH HAND —<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Boswell_c574.html" title="User:Phil Boswell">Phil</a> | <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhil_Boswell_f2d3.html" title="User talk:Phil Boswell">Talk</a> 09:05, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Phil Boswell. Has reference value, and much greater than the sum of its non-notable parts by a <b>very, very long way</b>, although I would hack it down to just the President and perhaps General Secretary, as the others are, well, NN. Not a difficult list to maintain, changes but once a year. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 10:08, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Notable people on the Australian student politics scene. How is this page actually against any policies. It is not simply an indiscriminate list, it is verifiable, and people reference the page so it will not always be the virtual orphan that it is currently. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 13:32, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I appreciate that some people find this list useful, but Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a database of all facts that someone, somewhere, might find useful. This list doesn't strike me as encyclopedic at all. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 04:30, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
