<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> unless better information is dug up and cited for this article, which bears an uncanny resemblance to the garden-variety "we've done the impossible, but we aren't going to tell you how just yet" claims of scam artists. I see two possibilities for the article's continued presence: (A) it is so widely reported (by gullible news agencies more interested in ratings than verifiable truth) that it should be included as a well-known swindle; (B) the company has actually done something that forces a change in the laws of physics, which would require "extraordinary proof", which is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Either way, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> are needed for us to write about it. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 20:01, 19 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep now</b>. I still have misgivings about this being a manufactured news event, and the claims that there is "massive" news coverage are not yet borne out by either Google's search engine or the links provided in the article. (Where is AP? Reuters? BBC? Other internationally known news agencies? This is, after all, a potentially world-changing event. Perhaps organizations with reputations to protect are actually investigating, rather than parroting unsubstantiated press releases.) But I concede that there will likely <i>be</i> enough material eventually, given the "buzz". ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 07:13, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for the links, Orangehues. None of these articles offer any new substance yet, just the brief challenge, the appropriate skepticism of age-old unproven claims, and Steorn testimonials. But it does make the case for notability, whatever the truth behind the noise.

<li><b>Keep.</b> I have a fairly simple criterion that's relevant here: if I came to Wikipedia specifically looking for this article, it should be kept. While they probably haven't really rewritten the laws of physics, they are getting a lot of news coverage. <a href="../../../l/i/z/User%7ELizardWizard_a997.html" title="User:LizardWizard"><sup>L</sup><sub>W</sub><font size="3">izard</font></a> <a href="../../../l/i/z/User_talk%7ELizardWizard_e172.html" title="User talk:LizardWizard">@</a> 20:10, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep.</b> Steorn is a technology risk management firm that has been around for several years and although this wiki article is currently biased to their recent developments and announcements, there is a significant amount of information relavent to the company which could be written here as well. The Internet Archive has <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.steorn.com|" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.steorn.com|" rel="nofollow">pages as far back as 2001</a>, long before they developed their "free energy" device. I vote that we keep the page and add more information to it. <a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJared81_0ab9.html" title="User:Jared81">Jared81</a> 20:22, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> at least for now, due to massive media coverage. If it turns out to be nothing special and nobody remembers the whole thing in a year's time, we can always re-evaluate then. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 20:26, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I came here looking for information on this company as well. However, I suggest that, eventually, this could be merged into <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_perpetual_motion_machines.html" title="History of perpetual motion machines">History of perpetual motion machines</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightwatch_8a25.html" title="User:Nightwatch">Nightwatch</a>Ôºè<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENightwatch_7a38.html" title="User talk:Nightwatch">respond</a> 20:30, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but clean way up. If it's a scam, it's going to scam people whether or not wikipedia has an article on it, and wikipedia can at least help to clarify the nature of the scam. People on web forums are linking to the wikipedia page about this thing already. I do think the article *needs* some kind of section for concerns that this company possibly doesn't even exist (and, say, a marketing company just bought up a defunct Irish company's website and put some nonsense about perpetual motion on it that will later turn out to be promotion for some video game or something).

<li><b>Keep</b> It's NOT a perpetual motion machine as mentioned in the article.

Please see <a href="http://www.steorn.net/en/downloads.aspx?p=6|" class="external text" title="http://www.steorn.net/en/downloads.aspx?p=6|" rel="nofollow">Steorn's video</a> which clearly demonstrates that this has something to do with magnetic induction.

<li>The "independent company" cited in the above link (which is an alternative-energy wiki, not a reliable publication) is apparently Magnetic Power Inc., which "claims to be close enough to have some demonstration modules, which extracts energy from the vacuum of space, ready for market by end of 2006". In other words, this is like <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Edward_0cf9.html" title="John Edward">John Edward</a> testing <a href="../../../u/r/i/Uri_Geller_f080.html" title="Uri Geller">Uri Geller</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> They may not have changed the laws of physics; maybe they're just siphoning off some previously unknown energy source. I'm not a physicist, I don't know. However, if they are a legit company and have a legit claim we ought to keep a record of it for history's sake. If they are a scam, we could have a spectacular record of that too. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpahi_b7f5.html" title="User:Spahi">Spahi</a> 22:42, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> My name's Cathal, I think that this article should be kept on Wikipedia. If the whole idea is a hoax(which I think is hard to believe, from what I've seen) having it or not having it on Wikipedia won't change that. Just as many encyclopedias have detailed articles on ideas and things which later turned out to be false (flat-earth, the geocentric Solar System et al.) so too must Wikipedia, another encyclopedia report on this (potential) falsitude.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Steorn very much deserves an article, if not only for the fact that it can link to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perpetual_Motion_eba9.html" title="Perpetual Motion">Perpetual Motion</a> and similar articles. It would also be a good place to have the results of their testing, etc.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is either a major scientific breakthrough or a notable act of kamikaze P.R. which should be a permanent part of the story of free-energy research and claims. The bold, public "challenge" advertisement Steorn has placed in The Economist gives this story political significance, as many people suspect that successful free-energy devices which may have been invented in the past have been suppressed by industry or government interests. Steorn's strategy may be an attempt to circumvent this kind of suppression. RockPoet 19:13, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It appears that the company's claims will be tested in the near future (see <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1854305,00.html" class="external text" title="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1854305,00.html" rel="nofollow">The Observer</a>). Should the claims be validated, the entry should remain given the obviously extraordinary historical significance of this alleged discovery. Should the claims be refuted (as we all seem to suspect they will be), the degree of attention it has received from both the public and the scientific community will still warrant an entry, though it should be revised to conform to the Wiki's <a href="../../../h/o/a/Wikipedia%7EHoaxes_ebc9.html" title="Wikipedia:Hoaxes">hoax</a> guidelines. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.30.95.182 (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.30.95.182_ae26.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.30.95.182">contribs</a>).</small></li>
