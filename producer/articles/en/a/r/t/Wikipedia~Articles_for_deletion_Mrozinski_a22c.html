<p>It happens all the time. A person who is non-notable by Wikipedian standards creates a website or webpage. To create some traffic, (s)he creates an article here. The vanity page consists of ravings, exaggerations and unverifiable facts. Basic demographics are not included. Next we, Wikipedia editors, start looking for leads about this person, demographics etcetera, for verification, NPOVing and notability. The page becomes a knowledge-base on the person. However, the person does not like his birth-names, birth-date, a linked page with information about the dip in his career and/or other biographic facts and (s)he starts trolling through <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a>, <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">edit wars</a>, sockpoppeting, dumping ridiculous threats of legal action etcetera. In some cases, e.g. Monica de Bruyn, notability is then stretched somewhat to prove the point that the person cannot remove the page and we decide on the content. I have always claimed that this is a wrong course of action. A biography of a non-notable person should be deleted regardless of his behavior. We have not succeeded verifying Mrozinski's "nr 1 hit" in Italy, his implying that he was part of Cats was imprecise and he is not mentioned anywhere in the <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Music_Guide_0e49.html" title="All Music Guide">All Music Guide</a>. <b>I suggest deleting the article for non-notability.</b> <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 17:42, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> for the closing administrator: Please note that this has become a forum and as a result, an indictment for the flaws in the system. Allowing anyone to become an "editor" is obviously unworkable, as anyone with access to a PC can change information, give misguided opinions and/or allow themselves to be self-appointed watchdogs of information for the "public good". I feel that <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> and GentlemanGhost and their ilk have turned Wikipedia into a public forum rather than a source of information. Sorry that this once reliable source has become bastardized, but I suppose that's what happens when you allow access to anyone, however unqualified. <a href="../../../m/r/o/User%7EMrozinski_fce4.html" title="User:Mrozinski">Mrozinski</a> 21:52, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>To all above: None of this would be a problem if you didn't insist on undoing my edits. I have attempted to comply repeatedly by editing and/or deleting information that is unverifiable by your standards. Yet everytime I edit the page, another "editor" comes back and reverts it to pre-edit status. I'm sure that you would not want to be represented by erroneous information (such as my "full name" which is incorrect). Anything that cannot be cited or "proven" I have tried to remove, but "editors" keep putting it back. What is the point of this? I would much rather have the article deleted than to have unacceptable info be replaced repeatedly after I have deleted or changed it. If you take exception to my previous tone of frustration and indignation, imagine how you would feel if you were forced to be misrepresented by people who have no clue as to the facts. When these edits are constantly changed by various "editors", I have no choice but to change them again, and as aresult I get blocked and unable to represent myself or state the facts as they are. I have been insulted, condescended to, purposely baited ("just to annoy Mrozinski"), blocked, banned and otherwise dismissed all in regard to an article that is supposed to be about me. Please, guys, give me a birthday present today and just delete the whole article so we all can use our valuable time by attending to other more important matters. Thanks <a href="../../../m/r/o/User%7EMrozinski_fce4.html" title="User:Mrozinski">Mrozinski</a> 22:41, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I can't promise you that you will get your birthday wish by today, but it should come shortly, probably by Thursday. According the article on the deletion process, it usually takes about five days for a consensus to be reached and appropriate action taken. Since the votes are currently strongly in favor of deletion, I anticipate that the page will be deleted, albeit more slowly than you desire. GentlemanGhost 23:33, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
