<li><b><s>Currently undecided but leaning to</s> Delete</b> - Claiming it to be a phenomenon without reliable sources is original research, and I hate that "top 20 comic book films" by Empire because we are choosing one site over many that have ranked these films. Otherwise, with no additional information to this page, it's really just an article form of a category that already exists. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole"><span style="background:Gold; color:Maroon">&#160;<b>(Question?)</b>&#160;</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bignole_3f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bignole"><span style="background:Maroon; color:Gold">&#160;<b>(What I do)</b>&#160;</span></a> 19:20, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Seems to be original research possibly based on a misunderstanding. References to "Comic Book Movie Age" are used to discuss our current "Comic Book Movie Age" not that now is the only one. I assume this is used to parallel the various ages of comics. So it isn't that we are in a "Comic Book Movie Age" there have been a number of which this is the most recent one. However the term doesn't seem enshrined like the actual comic book ages and seems to be used in a rough way. The rest of the entry is already largely covered in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_based_on_comics.html" title="List of films based on comics">List of films based on comics</a> and sub-entries.

<li><b>Very, very, very weak keep</b> There is a recent phenomenon in about the past 10 years of the production and popularity of many films based on comic books, and there is room on Wikipedia for a well-sourced article that recognizes this. However, the name "Comic Book Movie Age" seems to be made up wholesale, and the unsourced (<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>) article does not reflect anything but a list of recent films. I expect that mass improvements to this page will not be feasible in time to prevent deletion, but I would not object to recreation if another higher quality on the same subject were to surface in the future. <a href="../../../c/s/4/User%7ECS42_8631.html" title="User:CS42">~CS</a> 20:07, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b>. A minor character in the Austin Powers canon. While major characters like Austin, Evil, Nigel etc are notable enough for their own articles, characters like Alotta Fagina are just jokes and aren't that notable. I am also nominating the following related pages because for similar reasons in that they aren't notable enough for their own articles. They're minor characters who serve to tell a joke.</p>

<li>The first two are just lists comparing similar names, of which Alotta Fagina is one of them. The third article has one sentence that reads "In dated and unapologetically sexist '60s-style, Austin Powers can't claim Pussy Galore, but does boast Alotta Fagina, a cleavage-heaving role assumed by Fabiana Udenio". Ebert's review states "And, of course, those who remember Bond's adventures with Pussy Galore will be amused by his female antagonist this time, the sinister Alotta Fagina (Fabina Udenio)." So for both of those articles she's only mentioned briefly in passing.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html" title="User:CyberGhostface">CyberGhostface</a> 21:36, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I also took a look at the references and have to say that they are about as passing as one can get. They amount to about two sentences that deal directly with this character. Why a brief mention of Alotta in the main Powers article with reference to her parody of Pussy Galore is not enough I can't understand. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<p>Article is little more than a short self-description of someone who is a TV show host (perhaps) in New Zealand and a red link to the name of that show. This is too little informational context for even a stub article entry. If "Mai Time" had an article (it doesn't), then this sort of information would belong there instead. <a href="../../../b/u/m/User%7EBumm13_d24e.html" title="User:Bumm13">Bumm13</a> 01:01, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> with Mai Time (after creating it) — the show itself seems to be more notable (judging from the titles of the articles added as sources). IMDb verifies the show's existence,<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0186761/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0186761/" rel="nofollow">*</a>. and that of "Fiona Apanui" as a "presenter" in "unknown seasons." Other than that, no notability information on Fiona Apanui seems to be available. I would say delete, with no prejudice as to creation of a sourced article about Mai Time, or merge with Mai Time if created prior to deletion. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolfrog_505f.html" title="User:Carolfrog">Carolfrog</a> 01:43, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Every American high school nominated for deletion ends up with the same discussion. People who don't think high schools are inherently notable vote delete and people who do think they are inherently notable vote keep.

<li><b>Keep</b> As a former student, I would not consider this school non-notable. If you need me to write something about it to turn the "delete" votes into "keep" votes, give me a list of topics and I'll do some research. I can also take photos. I also noticed the vandalism; I have no idea why that has happened, as when I attended people would not have been prone to such blatant, idiotic edits. I believe if something substantial were written about the school, it would stand up to the vandalism much better. But I don't think it should simply be deleted.

<li>It's not an article, it's a tourist website which advises tourists about something that they may see and links to the wikipedia article to provide more information. That seems to suggest that the article as it now stands does, in fact, come fairly close to reality. I agree with you that reliable sources are needed here; Dhartung's paywalled article seems to be just such a source, but of course it doesn't seem to be available... <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 10:07, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and Improve</b>. As the original creator, I think this is a decent article documenting a real phenomenon that isn't documented anywhere except for small fragments of information. I'm fully aware this to some extent makes it original research but this is by no means unique to this article. Many articles about curiosity topics like this don't fit within the framework of other websites and thus end up being Wikipedia articles. By necessity, they do contain some original research. My impression is that many users of Wikipedia enjoy Wikipedia exactly because of the presence of such articles. The article has been here for 1½ years and I've found it referenced from other non-Wikipedia-related articles on the net. Many other users have contributed to the article including a video clip which was removed by another user. I also think it is worth noting that 'Croxley' - who is the one that nominated this article for deletion - joined Wikipedia on February 15th 2007 and so far haven't contributed any content to Wikipedia. He seems, however, to have made it his mission in life to put articles up for deletion. While I think it is good some people are keeping Wikipedia clean I have little respect for people who don't contribute content but who don't mind taking down well-written articles just because they don't fit a narrow interpretation of Wikipedia's rules. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 195.249.189.200 (<a href="../../../1/9/5/User_talk%7E195.249.189.200.html" title="User talk:195.249.189.200">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_195.249.189.200_0f1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/195.249.189.200">contribs</a>) 14:40, 4 March 2007.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep and Improve</b> This article seems be the only detailed description on the net, so I think we shouldn't be overzealous and delete it because of a few flaws.Woodward 21:23, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Another mention: <a href="http://www.bootsnall.com/travelstories/europe/nov02trouble.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.bootsnall.com/travelstories/europe/nov02trouble.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bootsnall.com/travelstories/europe/nov02trouble.shtml</a>. I hope everyone can agree (based on the links that have been posted) that the trick exists. I've seen it year after year since I was a kid and I've heard many people mention it. I think it's notable and worthy for inclusion in Wikipedia. Thus, deleting the article is not the solution. Rather people should focus on improving it. The main problem seems to be references. Apparently no authorative online media has covered it yet or that it is at least hard to find. Does that mean it shouldn't be in the encyclopedia? No. I think the article should be cut down and be less instructive and references added where possible even though it might have to be some in passing references. Hopefully, in time people will find more references. Deleting the article seems to be totally unfounded.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 195.249.189.200 (<a href="../../../1/9/5/User_talk%7E195.249.189.200.html" title="User talk:195.249.189.200">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_195.249.189.200_0f1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/195.249.189.200">contribs</a>) 19:33, 5 March 2007.</small></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The "films" are mostly shorts. I've been trying to verify that they've won anything, as there are no specific references in the article. (You'll note that the Sheilds Films articles, in particular, shotgun links with no specific target.) I can't figure out if individual shorts have won awards, or if the collection has. Either way, Shields Pictures didn't produce the films; they just bought the rights to them. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 02:40, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Indeed, it turns out that only <i>Who's Who in Animal Land</i> and <i>Speaking of Animals and their Families</i> won anything. These are shorts of less than ten minutes, each; the articles are about the series. If we believe winning poularity contests is a sign of notability, then we probably should be left with only the "Popular Science Film Series" article and nothing else. In particular, since Shields Pictures was completely uninvolved in the production of the pieces and fails <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> badly, it should go. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 03:12, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> [[Popular Science Historic Film Series]]. I have seen many of these excellent 1930's color films rebroadcast on TV, which were Academy Award nominated and shown to hundreds of millions of theater viewers.

<p>Sorry for starting on such a bad foot. I rewrote most of the text so that it is neutral in tone and unique to Wikipedia (an administrator helped clarify Wikipedia's copyright concerns to me, fully understandable). I have also done the same on "Popular Science Historic Film Series," "Unusual Occupations" and "Shields Picture, Inc." (some work on the "Jerry Fairbanks" article as well). I also did my best to cleanup the inventory lists and random links (as requested) on all three film series, and added many facts and dates. I have also I have done my best to de-PR them as well, and am now getting some help from the Wikipedia adoption program. Please let me know what else I can do to make these strong Wikipedia Articles. Once I get the OK, I'd like to add some photos (a 1943 picture of Bob Hope presenting Jerry Fairbanks with one of his Academy Awards, a photo of the Coat of Arms/Shield MGM prop from the 1952 film "The Bad and the Beautiful" that is referenced in the Shields Pictures, Inc. article, and a photo or two from each of the film libraries. Should I get approval of these pictures before I add them? Thanks for the help, CCBear 23:39, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I previously speedily deleted this as A7, but it now asserts notability. These are articles about a musician, his band, and his record label. However, none appear to be notable per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Searching for all of these bring up forum posts and download pages, but nothing that would satisfy the notability guideline.</p>

<li>Deletion? I have posted updates to a page a previous author had posted on Wikipedia years ago for one of my recording projects Kill Switch...Klick. Now it is being considered for deletion. This is odd.</li>

<p>I added two complimentary pages about my discography outside of Kill Switch...Klick and my Label and Film Company. These are also being considered for deletion. I was not using these as Vanity Pages. My own websites get thousands of visitors a day.

<p>Print citculation is 300,000 in the Chicago and Mid West. The article also explains my progression from musician to film maker. I also have the MTV pay stubs (through ASCAP) for material on the Made Show if need be, as well as an archive of Kill Switch...Klick press including cover mention on Outburn Magazine, full pages in A.P., The Stranger, The Rocket, Seattle Times, etc. Most of this was pre-internet. The reason to keep the pages separate, is- they are separate entities. I constructed the D.A. Sebasstian page, as Discography, Writting Credits for national magazines and Film Creds. These are a separate things from Kill Switch...Klick and people who want to know who the band is/was may or may not be interested in the Surf &amp; Twang music I'm making now nor the articles I write for Ol' Skool Magazine or CK Deluxe. I have also progressed into a film maker. The film Hot Rod girls Save The World is getting a huge underground buzz and is due out in mid 2007. It seems jumbled to have all this under one heading.

<li>What I see here are three links to your own web page. The only source that comes close to being acceptable is the first one from maximumink, but it in and of itself does not assert notability because it doesn't really contain enough info to create three articles let alone one. In order for a subject to meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> there must be sufficient external sources to write an article on the subject. You may well be on the rise and soon there may be sufficient info to justify the article but for now it doesn't appear to be the case.

<p>BTW how long has the Kill Switch...Klick article been up? Who originally created it? I had never heard of Wikipedia until a year or so ago- I was Googling Kill Switch...Klick to quell rumors that we broke up- and Wiki came up. I checked the page and there was quite a few bit of mis-information. I found that I could correct the info. Later I heard a piece on NPR about the Wiki experiments in Encylopedic information and it made sense. Why wasn't the Kill Switch...Klick article put up for deletion a year ago? Why didn't anyone delete it a year ago? It's virtually the same, except for a few corrections. --<a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebasstian_d33c.html" title="User:Sebasstian">Sebasstian</a> 04:48, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>This is an excerpt of a letter back to a concerned individual I just received about the deleting of the Kill Switch...Klick article on Wikipedia-</b></li>
</ul>
<p>“Thanks bro. I try. I tried arguing with Wiki about it. Doesn't look good. They said because I amended the page (for some info corrections) that it's a conflict of interest or "COI." I had added a D.A. Sebasstian page (as a CD and writers list- I also write for CK Deluxe and Ol Skool Rodz Magazines once in awhile) and one for my label (Go-Kustom Rekords) with the intent of taking that info off of the KsK pages, keeping the KsK page purely about the band, and not me or the label. Makes sense to me, but not to Wiki. They say that all the pages should be condensed or deleted. If they condense the three pages- my understanding is they will nix the Kill Switch...Klick page and put it all under my name. I don't want this as KsK has/had other members and has a life of it's own- plus there are many links back to that page from other "industrial and electronic" Wiki pages. I tried forwarding links from my web site, where I had archived the print media (as proof that all three entities - KsK, D.A. Sebasstian &amp; Go-Kustom Rekords had separate magazine and newspaper articles, but they said that was not acceptable because I had collected them on my site (another COI). These articles were in magazines that do not put their content on the web. I also offered to send hard copies for review. They would not address that...“ --<a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebasstian_d33c.html" title="User:Sebasstian">Sebasstian</a> 16:38, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, heres the deal. Editing minor details on your bio page is not too big a deal. The COI lies somewhat in the comments on this deletion discussion, but the real problem is your creation of pages related to your other projects, like Go Kustom Films, and Ol Skool Rodz. I definitely see that KsK is a notable act. However I have yet to see how we can source a biographical article about you. It is not a problem to source it from printed material, magazines and books can be cited just like webpages, however I caution against writing an autobiography on Wikipedia, some one will come along and do it eventually if you are notable enough. I know that you did not start the article on yourself but you have argued to protect it from deletion. I think it would be perfectly acceptable to merge any relevant info from the D.A Sebasstian article into the KsK article as sourcing the D.A article may be difficult. If I could make a friendly suggestion, I would stick to editing and creating articles about subjects you are interested in but not directly related to. Your <a href="../../../k/u/s/Kustom_Kulture_5323.html" title="Kustom Kulture">Kustom Kulture</a> page is a great start.

<p>Daniel- Honestly I am not taking it personally. Ive been in the media business since the 1980's so I have a thick skin. I've made my money and made my mark and been lucky enough to have complete artistic freedom. My whole argument is to make an information flow relevent to the Article's subject title. Something that Wiki sometiems lacks (but obviously strives for). I saw the Kill Switch...Klick Article becoming an "achivements of D.A. Sebasstian Article." I didn't think that was fair to Mike Ditmore and Jeremy Moss and others who have worked in KsK. After the other two pages were established (Go-Kustom Rekords and D.A. Sebasstian) I had planned on editing out the Go-Kustom Rekords info and D.A. Sebasstian info and keep it about the band. To me it was a design issue. The links I had provided on my site were for the D.A. Sebasstian citations in Seattle Magazine, Fangoria Magazine, Hemmings Motor News, etc. National press. If as an editing decision- you guys decided to condense, I would rather you just delete the D.A. Sebasstian Article and Go-Kustom Rekords. There is already too much info about me in the KsK Article. It has become convoluted. Also I would not delete the <a href="../../../o/l/27/Ol%27_Skool_Rodz_2916.html" title="Ol' Skool Rodz">Ol' Skool Rodz</a> or <a href="../../../c/k/_/CK_Deluxe_d7fd.html" title="CK Deluxe">CK Deluxe</a> pages. You can go down to any (and I mean any) store and buy those magazines. They are a Godsend to Kustom Kulture and a true resource. The fact that I have written an article or two in the magazines does not make it a COI. I gain nothing by their inclusion on WIki. --<a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebasstian_d33c.html" title="User:Sebasstian">Sebasstian</a> 17:57, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cool I think we are in agreement. I think it would be best to actually redirect D.A Sebasstian and Go Kustom records to KsK that way if some one searches for you they end up finding something. The magazines are fine to keep too. I think I will probably nominate Go Kustom Films for deletion and see what the community says though.

<p>My opinion is that it should remain as is. All the info is current and for the most part acurate. I don't feel there is a conflict of interest at all. You have a person who has projects that have bled into each other. Hope you can work it out.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually the conflict of interest is very clear. D.A created an article about himself, it is very hard to write objectively about oneself and even if some is able to people who read the article and see who created it will suspect an attempt at self promotion. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<p>To chime in- Daniel the D.A. Sebasstian page is only a list. So no real writing was involved as a COI. One of the ways to avert a COI is by Disclosure- and I have been very forth wright. Personally I would say 90 percent (unverified number) of ALL musicians Articles On Wiki are created by The Band, Artists, Record Label or Publiscists on Wiki. I'm sure fans add to the pages or add articles on older obscure bands all the time, but the level of information on most is beyond what the average fan could ever know. I have read dozens of Band Articles that look exactly like press releases. BTW If you delete the pages and do a redirect (as you stated above- and yes I could live with that) and then a fan or interested party tries putting the D.A. page back up again, will it stand or be deleted? I am an extremely honest person (verifiable) and would not try this under an anonymous log in. However word is getting out about this and quite a few people are very pissed (very verifiable). Also if anyone makes a comment please sign you name. --<a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebasstian_d33c.html" title="User:Sebasstian">Sebasstian</a> 22:38, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The other things is- is it possible to ammend the COI guidelines? Who would I talk to about this?--<a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebasstian_d33c.html" title="User:Sebasstian">Sebasstian</a> 23:01, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First I don't see any pissed off people, why should they be upset? If they want to help out and improve these pages they are welcome to. I would also have to disagree with you, I would say that only a small portion of musician articles are created with direct COI. Fans or just editors create most of them (as is the case with KsK). This can be verified by looking at the page history. Most of the music articles that have COI problems are about bands with limited or in some cases no exposure. It is true that there are some articles that read like press releases, but this is a problem not a reason to let this section of pages have COI. If you want to change COI policy you can discuss at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EConflict_of_interest_a17c.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia talk:Conflict of interest</a>. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<ul>
<li>I'm hearing it from friends and associates who think the who COI policy is silly. I don't want to post their e-mails without permission, and yes they are upset. I also know several bands with Wiki pages that (after talking to them about this) told me they put their own Articles up. I do not want to name names as you'll pull their pages. In my own instance it may have been Cleopatra Records (or one of their street team members) who originally put up the KsK artcile- I really don't know. I hope your not ignorant to what label's street teams do? They get free promo (CD's, stickers, concert tickets) from the label to saturate the web with press releases and info. They look for every opportiunity possible. If they list on Wiki that is a definite COI (under your current guidlines) as they are paid by the label. That is a very very common practice with almost ALL mid-sized indie and up labels. Many labels also pay publicists to do the exact same thing. I remember getting a publicists e-mail with a list of all the websites he posts to...it is incredible. All for $200! I'm sure Wiki is on alot of lists. My understanding of a COI is if the person or company benefits from the process. On Public Access TV we had a COI policy that forbade us from putting up commercials for local companies. It was a very fine line. If for example you did a feature on a local company and you posted their website at the end of the interview, and people could buy things on the website, are you using Public Access in a commercial way. The SCAN solution was that the purchased products had to be at least two klicks away from the websites entry point. Now understand that Seattle Public Access has a huge viewer base, second only to NYC with 500,000 regular &amp; consistant viewers a month (statistic provided by SCAN). My TV Show featured many car builders, pin-ups and bands, some of which were on my label. THIS WAS NOT CONSIDERED A COI. The bands probably benefited from the exposure, as did the label (in small ways). We also played music videos provided to us from Mute Records, Metal Blade Records, Beggars Banquet, etc. Given the viewer base and amount of e-mails we received we esimated 10-20 thousand watched our show each week. Were these music videos really TV Commercials? Yes and no. In the same way if a label posts on Wiki about a band they signed, is it a COI? I would say over all no- not unless there was an MP3 player embeded in the Wiki Article with a "Buy This Here" button next to it. I really think if an artist, poet, band, writer, film maker, politician, activist, scientist with a decent body of work or achievments wants to post an Autobigraphical Article on Wiki- as long as it doesn't contain things like "the best band ever" (unless from review etc.) it should stand. The horses mouth is the best source.</li>

<dd>I think we will probably have to agree to disagree on the COI issue. This isn't the forum to argue about it anyway. In regards to the AfD, I hope that we have come to a compromise: redirect <a href="../../../d/2E/a/D.A._Sebasstian_8eca.html" title="D.A. Sebasstian">D.A.

<li>Like I said I can live with a redirect. The listing is not such a big deal (as long as it's accurate). What's bothering me (and others) is Wiki policy as far as COI. I am an arts advocate and want to make sure that Wiki policy is effective to listing the arts. Do what you will with my pages, but I will not be satisfied until a change in policy occurs. It's a matter of principle. I hope you understand- who are the senior policy makers on Wiki? Is it strictly consensus?</li>

<p>Thanks. If your looking for notoriety for Go-Kustom, try typing the word "Kustom" in Google. I think it comes up in the top 10-13.

<p>As per the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sped_0737.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sped">first AfD</a> back in 2005, this is an unsourced dicdef, which violates <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. As such, and just like the result of the original AfD, I'd recommend deleting the content and placing a {{wi}} tag to link to wiktionary, which <i>is</i> a dictionary.

<li><b>Delete pending future possible references</b> I think I can sum this up as "The Pokemon franchise as a whole is extremely notable, but <i>this</i> game currently isn't".

Delete the article for now, and recreate if and when some reliable, independent published articles about the game are cited. (P.S.

<li>I am in the process of adding citations as we speak. I am in control of exclusive content from this publication that is relevant to many existing Wikipedia pages, and could prove valuable in adding quality content to the site. The so-called 'link farms' was a list of a half dozen other magazine publications owned by the same company, and was placed under the external link category as to not confuse site visitors of its relevance. Before considering this for deletion, consider the 'Forbes' Wiki for deletion, as it's overview section is literally overflowing with outbound links directly to the various Forbes websites.--<i>Dbusiness'</i> <sup>Talk</sup> 22:52, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is a lot of jargon that gets thrown around in these deletion discussions. I'm sorry if it can seem confusing Link farms are a problem in any article but an article will not be deleted because it contains a link farm. It will be deleted if the subject of the article does not meet wikipedia's notability guidelines (<a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>) or if it is autobiographical (<a href="../../../a/b/_/WP%7EAB_9fd9.html" title="WP:AB">WP:AB</a>), which includes articles on a corporation written by or for the corporation or its representatives, or if the author's of the article have a conflict of interest (<a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>). G11 referes to <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a>, general criterion 11, "Blatant advertising," and includes, "Pages which exclusively promote a company, product, group, service or person and which would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become encyclopedic." Forbes lists are well established and recognized by readers of in English language countries around the world. To keep this page from being deleted for <b>notability</b>, you should add to the page references (see <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>) to demonstrate that this publication is sufficiently notable to be included in an encyclopedia. --<b><a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/l/User_talk%7ESelket_51a5.html" title="User talk:Selket">Talk</a></sup> 23:05, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>First of all, I would like to mention that this article has been pointed out to me by <a href="../../../k/n/e/User%7EKneale_6d6c.html" title="User:Kneale">Kneale</a>. Before you post your recommendations in this discussion, please send some kind words to him, who seems to have left Wikipedia without warning.</p>
<p>I am copying some of my own comments to above user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kneale&amp;oldid=107718869" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kneale&amp;oldid=107718869" rel="nofollow">here</a>:</p>
<p>Jimmy Urine is not notable according to Wikipedia standards. He violates <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.</p>
<p>After a brief <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Little+Jimmy+Urine" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Little+Jimmy+Urine" rel="nofollow">google search</a> on "Little Jimmy Urine", you can see that the web pages already violate <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, since some of those pages are <i>interviews and reviews</i>, sources that are biased in favor of Little Jimmy Urine, thus violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Also, a quote from <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> states:</p>
<ul>
<li>"This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, magazine articles, and television documentaries except for the following: Media reprints of press releases, other publications where the musician/ensemble talks about themselves, and advertising for the musician/ensemble."</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, the Little Jimmy Urine article cannot be supported by such web sites, since the interviews involve Jimmy Urine talking about himself, giving us biased information for the article in question.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">guideline on notability</a> requires that:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person."</li>
</ul>
<p>I did a broader <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=jimmy+urine" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=jimmy+urine" rel="nofollow">google search</a> on "Jimmy Urine". Do you see how only 3 web pages on "Jimmy Urine" appear? Afterwards, a search on "Mindless Self Indulgence" continues. This tells me that Jimmy Urine is only notable because of his role in Mindless Self Indulgence. If he has any notability <i>outside of MSI</i>, then that <i>might</i> warrant an article. In addition, I did a search on my school's Proquest Platinum database, and there was only 1 periodical that mentioned Jimmy Urine's name, and in passing. That's the trouble with this Wikipedia article. Sources on this guy only mention him in passing. The main subject is MSI.</p>
<p>Look at this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Little_Jimmy_Urine&amp;oldid=107702185" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Little_Jimmy_Urine&amp;oldid=107702185" rel="nofollow">version</a> (current during the time I post this message), and you will see that the article is not backed up by sources. It could potentially be filled with <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. The article does not <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliabe sources (RS)</a> (or any sources for that matter).</p>
<p>The article also violates <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.</p>
<p>the article should be merged with the mindless self indulgence article</p>
<p>Therefore, I request that this article be <b>deleted</b>. <i><b><a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_06df.html" title="User:Ed"><font color="blue" face="comic sans ms">Ed</font></a></b></i> <sup><a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_8c3a.html" title="User talk:Ed"><font color="maroon" face="comic sans ms">¿Cómo estás?</font></a></sup> 20:53, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - easily meets the requirements set by <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>: Mindless Self Indulgence has performed in numerous national and international tours, released four albums on a major record label, been featured in rotation both on radio and television, etc. Jimmy Urine, in particular, is the driving force of the ensemble, responsible for writing and arranging almost all of their music. He is also responsible for releasing a record under the monicker of <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:f9c8b5p4zsq0" class="external text" title="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:f9c8b5p4zsq0" rel="nofollow">The Left Rights</a>. This gets right to the issue of sourcing concerns, which are constrictive and flawed. There are numerous non-trivial publications that concern Mindless Self Indulgence, but more importantly their cultural impact<a href="http://prod1.cmj.com/articles/display_article.php?id=29547353" class="external autonumber" title="http://prod1.cmj.com/articles/display_article.php?id=29547353" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> and unique musical arrangement<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/mindlessselfindulgence/albums/album/114449/review/5940829/frankenstein_girls_will_seem_strangely_sexy" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/mindlessselfindulgence/albums/album/114449/review/5940829/frankenstein_girls_will_seem_strangely_sexy" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> - both of these aspects are spearheaded by and directly attributed to Jimmy Urine.

<p>I am puzzled by this entry. If I understand right, an anonymous editor has nominated this article for deletion, but has indicated no grounds for the proposal. It is hard to see why an article on a topic harped upon on several Web sites should be excluded from Wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 05:06, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>At last a reason is proposed. However, the websites present the oath not as a rumour, but as a fact. Just look up the sites mentioned in the article. It is also published, as fact, in at least one fairly widely read book. One of the websites is that of the somewhat important <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_St._Pius_X_8d3f.html" title="Society of St. Pius X">Society of St. Pius X</a>. Another, to which Wikipedia does not allow links (but whose name includes "fisheaters"), no longer gives the oath as an undoubted fact, but it still says: "You should be familiar with the above form of the oath because it is often seen in traditionalist circles." "Often seen in traditionalist circles" - surely a very good reason why Wikipedia should speak of it. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 09:02, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>The article does not start out with "The Papal Oath does not exist." It starts by saying the Papal Oath is an oath (in fact a concrete existing oath, whose concrete existing text is quoted) that some (many, to judge by the number of times the text is quoted) Traditionalist Catholics firmly believe was until recently taken by all Popes at their coronation.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The article thus treats of an existing text and an existing belief. There are articles on other people's beliefs, e.g. Apostolic Succession, Papal Infallibility, "Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus" etc.</dd>
<dd>Kendrick's idea of moving the article to another title might be a good one. But what title? "Traditionalist Catholics' Belief in a Papal Coronation Oath Used from Agatho to Paul VI"? On the whole I prefer the present title.</dd>
<dd>Interesting the reference to the 1845 book. Does that book speak of the <i>Liber Diurnus</i> profession of faith published in 1680, or of the quite different text that today's traditionalist Catholics believe in and that the Wikipedia article is about? (In view of the ignorance of Latin displayed by the author of the oath the article is about, how could it have been written by any educated person of 1845?) Does that book say that the text it speaks of, whether or not it was the oath the Wikipedia article deals with, was used in nineteenth-century papal coronations? Unfortunately, Kendrick only gives a link to and quotes from a text (by the same author) that makes no mention whatever of any oath by any Pope. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 22:01, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Copying a quote from the link. The latin text in the article seems to be the "solemn oath at their accession" mentioned here, given its specific mention of the sixth ecumenical council.

<dd>An œcumenical Council, universally acknowledged in the East and in the West, held in Constantinople, 680, condemned and excommunicated Honorius, 'the former Pope of Old Rome,' as a heretic, who with the help of the old serpent had scattered deadly error.... The succeeding Popes down to the eleventh century, in a solemn oath at their accession, endorsed the sixth œcumenical Council, and pronounced 'an eternal anathema' on the authors of the Monothelite heresy, together with Pope Honorius, because he had given aid and comfort to the perverse doctrines of the heretics. The Popes themselves, therefore, for more than three centuries, publicly recognized, first, that an œcumenical Council may condemn a Pope for open heresy, and, secondly, that Pope Honorius was justly condemned for heresy.

<li>Looking further at the Dowling passage, it seems to be talking about an oath of allegiance made to a Pope by someone else (there, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Gregory_II_e856.html" title="Pope Gregory II">Pope Gregory II</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Boniface_719b.html" title="Saint Boniface">Saint Boniface</a>).

<dd>As for "original research", surely <i>ungainsayable</i> statements are permissible. Do we need to quote a source for a statement like "two is more than one"? By the way, I have noticed that a recent (9 February 2007) contributor to a blog has written: "In response to Traditio in Radice's call for additional information on the papal coronation oath, we have done a little here in Rome. From an initial survey of the 'Liber Diurnus Romanorum Pontificum' as it appears in Migne's Patrologia Latina, it would appear that the information given at Wikipedia, concerning it is more or less correct. I will try to see if I can find some of the more accurate versions of the document; otherwise I will simply send the text as it is found in PL." Would that count as a source, were one needed? But this source will, I suppose, soon disappear from the Internet.

<dd>My reading of the Papal Oath - not the profession of faith that at least one Pope sent to the representative at Ravenna of the Constantinopolitan emperor to ask for recognition of his election as Pope (and for how long did Ravenna and Rome remain under the emperor's power? certainly not "until the 11th century") - is that it was in part a "translation" from the <i>Liber Diurnus</i> text by someone with a very limited knowledge of Latin with just a few wishful-thinking additions.</dd>

<dd>Er, why do we need a disambiguation again? This article isn't about the Liber Diurnus, but about one text in it. I see the article structured like:
<ul>
<li>Intro: There is this old text which some sources say may have been used as an oath before the 11th century.</li>
<li>Text: Give latin text from Liber Diurnus / Migne. (or links to wikisource if appropriate)</li>
<li>Popular story: There is this story/legend that this text was used until recently.

<dd>I agree with Gimmetrow. "Papal Oath" does not "refer to" the <i>Liber Diurnus</i>. There is no need for a page to say that "a papal oath" can mean an oath taken by a Pope. Popes must have taken many different oaths in the course of the centuries. None of those oaths, not even the profession of faith that one or two Popes seem to have taken when Constantinopolitan emperors ruled Rome, can be referred to as the Papal Oath. I have reverted the disambiguation change. I have not reverted the move from "Papal Oath" to "Papal Oath (Traditionalist Catholic)" - by the way, shouldn't it be "... (Traditionalist Catholic<i>s</i>)"? But shouldn't we first settle the question "Delete or not delete" before taking any action whatever?

<dd>Google "pope swore" and you'll find a number of cases. So, again, why single out as "the" Papal Oath a text in an obscure source about one particular oath that formed part of a communication from one newly elected Pope, or at most a very few newly elected Popes, to the Imperial Exarch at Ravenna? According to <a href="../../../e/x/a/Exarchate_of_Ravenna_e052.html" title="Exarchate of Ravenna">Exarchate of Ravenna</a>, the last such Exarch was killed in 751, long before the eleventh century!</dd>
<dd>There is no oath whatever that can be called the Papal Oath apart from the one in the urban legend spread by traditionalist Catholics in writing (paper and Internet) and by word of mouth. The text of this "Papal Oath" is obviously loosely based on the text in the letter to the Imperial Exarch, both because of the similarity of some of its expressions and because the letter that the (one?) Pope sent to the Exarch mentions his predecessor Agatho, and this mention has been completely distorted to mean that it was Agatho who took the oath!</dd>
<dd>[The <i>Liber Diurnus</i> text mentions "Constantino <i>piae memoriae</i>", which shows that the Pope who wrote to the Exarch, giving him the text of his profession of faith, was elected after the death of Emperor Constantine IV in September 685; so the Pope in question was probably Conon (686-687) or Sergius I (687-701). (This comment is not mine: it is in one of the notes in the <i>Patrologia Latina</i> volume.) At latest, the Pope who wrote can only have been John VI (701-705), John VII (705-707), Sissinius (January-February 708), Constantine (708-715), Gregory II (715-731), Gregory III (731-741) or Zachary (741-752).] <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 11:24, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I see now that Kendrick has restored his disambiguation page on the grounds that "Papal Oath shouldn't redirect to a myth." What else is there to direct to? <i>All</i> of the oaths that Popes have taken over the centuries? Or just one arbirarily selected oath from those that were really taken? Which one? There is really nothing whatever to direct to as "the Papal Oath" except the "myth" (in the non-technical sense) or urban legend. There never was anything else, even among the oaths that Popes did take, that could be referred to, with capitals, as the Papal Oath.</dd>

<li>I'm not going to argue against what I think you were doing any more, since you've already mocked me once for that. There are many many other options that you could have chosen within <a href="../../../d/a/b/WP%7EDAB_f303.html" title="WP:DAB">WP:DAB</a>.

You did mention the article should be about <i>Liber Diurnus</i> anyway, but that already has it's own article, as Lima then pointed out, so I thought your objection was sensibly settled. "Papal oath" can clearly have any number of meanings and a disambiguation page is the correct way to handle this. -- <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKendrick7_a50a.html" title="User talk:Kendrick7">talk</a></sup> 22:52, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>"There is no reason to rename this with some arbitrary parenthetic disambiguation." That's about as blunt as can be.

And as far as I know, I never said this article should be about the Liber Diurnus (which would be absurd, as there already is an article about that at an obviously more appropriate name), but that it should be about <i>a specific text</i> from that document and the legend that has grown about it. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 23:06, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I wouldn't call this a legend, more like a 50 year old (or less) unconfirmed rumor. That's hardly as notable as a religious rite which was practiced by the leader of what is now the world's largest religion for 600 years.

<p>Kendrick has gone too far, making unilateral changes in complete disregard of others, indeed against the opposition of others and without the support of even one other person. Now he has gone further: inventing pages that claim that "the Papal Oath" can mean various other things. Can he quote a single source outside of Wikipedia that says the profession of faith found in the <i>Liber Diurnus</i> is called "the Papal Oath"? ...</p>
<p>I trust I do have support for moving the article this discussion is about to "The Papal Oath". This is unambiguous: no papal oath other than the one attributed to the Popes from Agatho to Paul VI is known as "<i>the</i> <i>P</i>apal <i>O</i>ath". It is NPOV, while "Papal Oath (Traditionalist Catholic)" contradicts the POV of those Traditionalist Catholics who claim that the text in question is not just a Traditionalist Catholic Papal Oath, but a genuine oath actually taken by the Popes.</p>
<p>The question of keeping or not keeping the article has been settled long ago, and there was no real need to continue that discussion. The discussion now is on the name of the article that we are keeping. Do we support the move to "The Papal Oath"?</p>

<dd>Kendrick is right in saying that according to the strict rules there is a proper procedure for proposing possibly controversial moves. Kendrick chose not to follow that procedure, and we have been discussing here the unilateral action he took in breach of those rules. Why should we not continue the discussion, and find out for certain what support if any Kendrick has for his POV renaming of the article? If Kendrick prefers, let him revert all the changes and return to the status quo ante, and then we can put into operation the <i>normal</i> method of deciding whether to move an article. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 08:35, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I substantially agree with Lima. The article discussing the story/legend should be at "Papal Oath" where it started. If that means the article needs to expand to mention that there have been other "papal oaths", so be it; that should only add a paragraph or so of verifiable material. If any disambiguation was necessary, it should have happened at Papal Oath (disambiguation), per <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html#Primary_topic" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation#Primary_topic</a>. The Schaff book is a non-Catholic source arguing against papal infallibility, but it seems to cite the Rozière text, if that helps. I would still really like to see the article have at least one citation to a reliable source, aware of the story/legend, that says it is a legend.

Yet he has now gone and retouched I do not know how many other articles to make them fit his unsupported personal idea. Is this a proper way to act on Wikipedia? Can anyone give an authoritative ruling on this? I wonder if his action can be classified as vandalism. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELima_e07b.html" title="User:Lima">Lima</a> 05:37, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><i><b>Do not delete</b></i> CSI has been for a long time the number one show on American television and GSR is the first and only canonical relationship portrayed in it. It has caused much debate among fans and attention from the media. Moreover, having read the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> page, it does not break any of the guidelines or rules that wikipedia use. All CSI communities and discussions talk about GSR, either for or against, and if they don't it's because the topic has been banned because it's so controversial. It is definitely relevant to the subject matter. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#When_you_wonder_what_to_do" title="WP:NOT">Here</a> it says that if you expect something to be in a real encyclopedia then it should be in wiki. If I were reading an encyclopedia that had a CSI entry but nothing about GSR, I'd think it would definitely be lacking. It is not a fanfic at all. It's canon CSI and there's no disputing that. It does, however, need a clean-up.

<li><b>Comment</b> The question becomes whether this particular subplot of the series has any real world independently published articles about it. If the article contains ONLY plot elements, then it doesn't meet WP:NOT#IINFO's requirement that plot summaries include verifiable analysis or real world context. Now all that being said, I vaguely remember one or two TV mags having cover pictures and stories specifically about this fictional romance. <i>If</i> the article can cite some of those published articles, it would go a long way toward vindicating keeping it as a separate article. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:16, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

The "timeline" apparently consists of cryptic references to every scene in every episode in which the characters might be perceived as flirting with each other, which is both far too much detail for an encyclopedia article and also completely incomprehensible to non-viewers of this series. For example, among the entries is "2x03: Pickle scene." Once the timeline is gone, it will be easier to merge the remainder.

<li>Changing my recommendation to <b>delete</b> per Ohconfucius, to avoid a "no consensus" result and because the timeline is just too embarrassing to allow to stick around. By "embarrassing", I mean that keeping a record of how they "exchange a flirty smile when Sara matches the paper to the printer" and Grissom "helps Sara with chess" makes the article look like a junior high school student's diary of a <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limerence.html" title="Limerence">crush</a>. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 16:30, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><i><b>DO NOT DELETE</b></i> Significant pop culture fan following of a slowly developed relationship on the program. (For example, currently there are &gt;1800 videos dedicated to this relationship on YouTube.) This is not fan fic, it is an explicitly demonstrated part of the program's canon. As previously mentioned, there have been magazine articles on this precise topic (including Galaxie Magazine July 2005 and TV Guide September 14, 2006's cover story). First choice is keep the article with a revised or eliminated timeline. Second choice, merge the two articles. Any article on the series which excluded mention of the only relationship between two major characters on the show would be incomplete and would misrepresent the nature of the show as being solely work-place focused.Abcadog 05:54, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article merely details the sexual tension present between Grissom and Sara <b>in the TV series</b>, and <b>has nothing to do with fan fiction</b>.

<dd>Just to reply, there <i>are</i> policies and guidelines though for handling articles about plot lines in fiction. <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> both specify that for plot summaries, "Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger topic." Thus while a plot summary can be a valid part of an article on a topic, it should not be the <i>only</i> aspect of the article. In addition, articles should also meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> standards which require multiple, independent, verifiable published references for verification and to establish proper notability of the subject of the article in question. In this case, the article hasn't yet provided those references.</dd>
<dd>Now mind you, I think it <i>might</i> be possible to correct those issues and save the article. The reason is because I think that there have been reliable independent real-word articles published specifically about this fictional romance. So if a few of those sources are cited in the article, and the article presents some real-world analysis of the romance (aside from just listing plot details) then it would I think satisfy all the requirements of WP:NOT, WP:N and WP:V. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:22, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>KEEP</b> Having now read the Kirk/Spock article (which is apparently well accepted and non-controversial) I'm not even sure why we're having this discussion as the topics are quite comparable. If anything, CSI has now been on the air for four years longer than Star Trek was, and the relationship between the two characters is actually show canon, and not just a fan phenomenon. (I did not know the origin of the term "slash" and was very interested to learn it, btw.) Both shows have had a significant impact on popular culture, and each features a relationship (either among the fan following or within the context of the series) between two of the lead characters which has developed a life of its own and for which there is a widely used descriptive term. If the Star Trek article, which I found interesting and informative, is appropriate on Wikipedia, then so should be the article on GSR. I've made some fairly significant edits to the material, in particular replacing the timeline with a narrative of the relationship. Abcadog 05:15, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've been watching this page for a while. A google seach for "speak no more war hungary" only returns a youtube page, the sources quoted are a Hungarian myspace-type page and youtube. Can anyone confirm this is legitimate and/or notable&#160;? <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETravelbird_9a21.html" title="User:Travelbird">Travelbird</a> 06:46, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree, the source quoted is not a "myspace-type" page at all, but a Hungarian celebrity page which includes information about Tom Deak, that is featured in the article such as his name and birthday, and information about the song, and that it was a sell-published release. The other source are from a forum post, by a hungarian, but is relied upon for only a few facts in the article, such as his unemployment and bankruptcy. the information is cited as alleged and according to some sources, and is not stated as blanket fact. I don't see why an extrnal link to the ytube viral video is inapprioprate either. also, The page is obviosly being worked on, and is not yet complete. secondly, your major complaint seems to be the sources, this seems strange to me considering thousands of wikipedia articles which lack any kind of source, but ar not immediatly or ever put up for deletion. If your questioning whether the subject is legitmate, I think this viral video star deserves a wikipedia entry, should we also delete zladko's page also? I seriosly question the legitmacy of this deletion request. <a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpetyan_bfae.html" title="User:Opetyan">Opetyan</a><small>— <a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpetyan_bfae.html" title="User:Opetyan">Opetyan</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Opetyan_7f19.html" title="Special:Contributions/Opetyan">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>
<p>I second Opetyan's comments. The call for deletion is unjustified, especially for such an incipient article. If this article is considered up for deletion, you would also have to explain why most other viral phenomenon pages on wikipedia (like this one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlad" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlad" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlad</a>) are still up. The fact that the formally obscure video originated in Hungary doesn't help you out much on a google search.

<p>I have already answered allegations that I am a single purpose user with a hidden agenda, that is not true, and shouldn't be used as a basis for questioning the legitimacy of the article. I don't know why this was brought up again. I want to point out that there are hundreds of wikipedia articles with little or no sources, and they are all not up for deletion, but marked with "citiation needed" or "reference needed". It least give Rikozzik and myself some time to come up with what newspaper or magazine articles, if hungarian celebrity websites are not considered a credible source (for some reason). again, I find myself in a very funny situation having to defend Speak.

I can find hundreds of sites in English discussing him, unfortunately they are all blogs. There must be people who speak Hungarian here (that aren't involved in this article) who can check these references? <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroxley_5f28.html" title="User:Croxley">Croxley</a> 05:53, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> According to index.hu, probably the most famous internet news website in Hungary, Speak has already become world famous due to its video-clip.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Falsely claiming someone is bankrupt can be libelous potentially.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I could restrict it to a list of dead people as a compromise but since there is a legal status involved I just don't see the point. However, if the consensus is to delete this list I will move this list to the BBC website. I can still link to the wikipedia or answers.com entries from there anyway. I worked on the category and I thought that was the best option because bankruptcy is a legal fact not hearsay, not prurient and can be categorised.</li>
</ul>
<p>Categorisation would seem to me best research tool.</p>
<p>I was overruled and people suggested it be listified. I find the subject fascinating - far more than a list of billionaires (and I have growing sympathy with the person who created "people who have been pied" - I wish I hadn't voted to delete it now!) There is pathos, redemption, revenge and hubris in these stories. The articles on wikipedia don't always reflect this aspect of a person's life and i would either like to flesh this out within the articles or do some pen pictures on this list which deal with it (rather than the artistic or other career of the subject).

<p>This is an article about a private airfield, which seems to be little more than a long piece of grass, and seems to be one of many similar airfields in existance. I don't know much about private airfields but I would venture that this is not notable. Also, the creator of this article, Haz kk (<a href="../../../h/a/z/User_talk%7EHaz_kk_86ea.html" title="User talk:Haz kk">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Haz_kk_afb9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Haz kk">contribs</a>), also created Atlantic International Airways (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Atlantic_International_Airways_2dc2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Atlantic International Airways">AfD discussion</a>), which was deleted as unverifiable (possible hoax). <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2007-02-26 07:56Z</small></i></span></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Firstly Atlantic Internation Airways is a fictious airline from the film <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passenger_57.html" title="Passenger 57">Passenger 57</a> and referenced in other articles in WP - So that wasn't a hoax article, but a badly defined article (perhaps it should have been a redirect, rather that delete?) I take the view that a real geographical place is worthy of retaining in WP - especially as there is probably a long history related to WW2 for this particular airfield given it's geographical area. The article is referenced, and quite frankly, there's probably a million other articles of similar notability which should be also deleted if this is. My favourite articles for deletion are most of those "famous for 15 minutes" musicians and bands.</li>

<dd>Hi Richhoncho, regarding Atlantic International Airways: The thought had crossed my mind that it might be an in-universe fictional airline, but I doubted it because the details didn't seem congruous with something from a film or other fictional work. For example, it has extensive fleet manifest with model numbers and plane counts as well as merger &amp; acquisition history, names of founders, libel lawsuit, alliances with real-world airlines... in fact, the article talks about <b><a href="../../../e/a/s/EasyJet_1140.html" title="EasyJet">easyJet</a>, which was founded in 1995, so that article can't be about the 1992 film <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passenger_57.html" title="Passenger 57">Passenger 57</a></b>. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2007-02-26 11:43Z</small></i></span></dd>
<dd>Back to the article at hand, I agree that real geographical places are worthy -- but only to a point. Do we keep articles on all streets? Of course not, we have to draw the line somewhere. As to non-notable bands - I agree non-notable bands should be deleted, and the existance of articles on non-notable bands doesn't mean we should have articles on non-notable airfields. See also <a href="../../../a/r/g/Wikipedia%7EArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions_1a86.html#What_about_article_x.3F" title="Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions">Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions#What about article x?</a>. I checked the website listed as a reference before nominating -- it essentially just says that the airfield exists along with 10 or 20 others in that city, which makes me think that worldwide there are countless of these. I searched and didn't find anything notable currently or historically about this airfield, so if you found anything, please say so. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2007-02-26 11:43Z</small></i></span></dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> If I had better information about the airfield I would have added it already - far more practical than discussing hypotheticals at the AfD. I would assume because of the location this airfield, and probably most of the other airfields in Devon, was established for the D-Day landings and would have relevant history accordingly. If there was a logical place for a redirect for the article, thats what i would vote for - in the meantime it seems more appropriate to keep.

<dd>I agree with much of what you said. I never said that the article was <i>about</i> a neologism. There are two separate problems with the article as it is currently written: (1) The article title is a neologism - which isn't cause for deletion, but something that needs to be changed if its kept, <i>and</i> (2) most of it seems to be original research.</dd>
<dd>As an aside, this article is <i>not</i> about Interchange 14 on the New Jersey Turnpike. It's about the interchange just west of there between I-78, US 1/9, etc. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 22:48, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On second thought, perhaps the confusion on whether or not Turnpike Exit 14 is included indicates that <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> <i>does</i> apply. To quote the article itself, "Interstate 95/ Turnpike <i>may not</i> be involved." (emphasis added) By the same logic that would include the Turnpike - that the ramps all feed into each other, and there's no clear boundary between the two interchanges - we should include where the Airport entrance actually interchanges with US 1/9 south of I-78, but then those ramps weave in and out of the ramps to <a href="../../../r/o/u/Route_81_%28New_Jersey%29_bfa9.html" title="Route 81 (New Jersey)">Route 81</a> south of the airport, and Route 81 is just a whole big mess of ramps that are indistinguishable from each other all the way to Turnpike Exit 13A. But 13A is by definition a totally separate interchage from 14...</dd>
<dd>Basically what I'm saying is maybe this article <i>is</i> about a neologism that's poorly defined. It's true that the "complex" shares many things in common with notable interchanges, like the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Los_Angeles_Interchange_6cd5.html" title="East Los Angeles Interchange">East Los Angeles Interchange</a>, but IMHO it's missing the two most important things: a name, and defined boundaries. The first link NE2 cites calls it a "complex project", but doesn't necessarily mean that it's meant to be viewed as a single interchange complex. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 04:56, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The NJDOT does call it a "confluence" in that court case, and includes the Turnpike.

And I suspect, but can't be sure, that there is a common name for this - "the airport", as in "I-78 is backed up to the airport". --<a href="../../../n/e/2/User_talk%7ENE2_13fa.html" title="User talk:NE2">NE2</a> 11:53, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I would think that "the airport" would refer to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newark_International_Airport_32ca.html" title="Newark International Airport">the airport</a>, not any specific roadway junction near the airport. The word "confluence" to me indicates merely that a bunch of roads are flowing into each other, but doesn't necessarily indicate that they're flowing together in a single complex, and does nothing to define boundaries.</dd>
<dd>Surely if this interchange had a valid name and defined boundaries, there would be a better source than a decades-old court case that doesn't even mention I-78 (although likely only because it wasn't completed at the time). -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 22:12, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Articles are retained based on satisfying criteria of notability. The fact that this is not mentioned in your nomination might well have been indicative of an apparent failure to understand that fact, which is why I stated so in my explanation. Your response makes it clear that you have indeed ignored issues of notability. The rationalization for deletion is simply not valid, and no reference to the existence (or non-existence) of other crap was made. Creating running arguments with each person differing in opinion is not going to help your case, not that it matters.

<li>The SLDs verify only that the routes mentioned all flow to a single point. They don't verify that those routes form the "Newark Airport Interchange", which according to NE2's sources, they don't, since the NAI is Exit 14 on the Turnpike – and according to the article, the Turnpike <i>isn't</i> part of the NAI. They also don't verify that the main use is to access the Airport (which seems like common sense, but if Exit 14 is part of it, maybe the main use is to access the Holland Tunnel instead?) and to access the ports (which definitely isn't common sense). The sentence about the many lanes, twists, curves, etc., being a "problem for motorists" besides being unencyclopedic, is original research.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As I said before, the only source we have so far about the <b>interchange</b> (not SLDs of the individual routes) contradicts the article regarding the inclusion of the turnpike. The only thing left after removing the original research is a single sentence about each highway that belongs in the individual highway article – and in most cases that sentence is already there. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 20:42, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You can repeat it as many times as you want: The sources support the existence of a "Newark Airport Interchange" going back fifty years, which you insist violates <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. The content is based on material available in public sources that supports all of the statements made in the article. Despite the fact that all the necessary sources have been added to the article, not one of the skeptics has stated which material constitutes original research. Repetition does not make it so. Whatever arguments have been made have been rather poor and don't stand up. You have not made your case to me, or to anyone else, and I stand by my original vote. Give it up already.

<li>So let me get this straight: We hear a complaint above that "The article has been up for deletion since Monday and no one has put in the sources as now." Now, a full business week after creating the AfD, we're finally seeing the claims of original research? Please attack someone else.

<ul>
<li>The sources from 50 years ago supporting the existence of an NAI are talking about Turnpike Exit 14, a completely different interchange. Thus using it to describe I-78 Exits 57-58 <b>is</b> a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a>.</li>

<dd>You claim that "not one of the skeptics has stated which material constitutes original research." Interestingly, that's <i>immediately underneath</i> where I specify which statements are OR, and right after I tagged those statements in the article. Now that you've removed those statements, maybe you can see that all that's left is a single sentence about each individual highway. And since the term is a neologism, those sentences are best placed in the articles on the individual highways.</dd>
<dd>And by the way, changing the words "Newark Ports" to "Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal" does not make that statement not OR.</dd>
<dd>Also by the way, <i>absolutely no one</i> has attacked you.

<li>So now we have acknowledgment that we have a fifty-year old source, but the article is not what it's really about.

As I stated "Now, a full business week after creating the AfD, we're finally seeing the claims of original research?" You waited, day after day after day, and after repeated requests you finally marked the article with your claims of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, all of which have been addressed. The statement that you insisted was [{WP:OR]] "The main usages of the interchange is to provide access to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newark_Liberty_International_Airport_4761.html" title="Newark Liberty International Airport">Newark Liberty International Airport</a> and the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Newark_57f0.html" title="Port Newark">Newark Ports</a>" was changed to "The interchange provide access to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newark_Liberty_International_Airport_4761.html" title="Newark Liberty International Airport">Newark Liberty International Airport</a> and the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Newark-Elizabeth_Marine_Terminal_2092.html" title="Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal">Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal</a>." I'm not sure what it is about the amended version that "does not make that statement not OR". I'm not sure what the source is of this tag team effort, but I have been convinced to change my vote from <b>Keep</b> to <b>Strong Keep</b>. You have made tour case; I have made mine.

<li><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> argument has been long demolished; the sources go back over 50 years using the term, including a dozen or two uses in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, three of which are included in the article as references. The article needs to be addressed based on its content, not its long lost creator who hasn't touched the article in over two months, and the article has been extensively expanded since his departure from the scene. The original research issues have been addressed as raised, and the last artifact of tagged <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> has been removed.

<li>Despite the partial rewrite, portions of the article (particularly <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newark_Airport_Interchange_f1ef.html#Routes_involved" title="Newark Airport Interchange">#Routes involved</a>) still refer explictly to I-78 Exit 57-58 excluding the Turnpike, which makes the <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> claim still valid, since all those sources are using the term to describe explicitly NJTP Exit 14. I've tagged an additional two sentences as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. (Does it provide access to the Marine Terminal?

<li>As fast as you have tagged <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> issues, they have been rewritten or removed.

But I think that we're well past the <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> argument. It's clear that the term exists and has been used -- and documented -- for several decades. When the Newark Airport Interchange was created, there was no I-78, and there was direct access from the Turnpike to 1&amp;9. Now that I-78 exists, what happened to the interchange that it no longer exists? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 07:08, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: <i>Edit conflict</i> -- But is this a term that NJDOT uses?

For instance, with the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_Interchange_c2e5.html" title="Kennedy Interchange">Kennedy Interchange</a> in Kentucky, there have been references by KYTC towards its naming -- however, I can't find a NJDOT doc that uses it yet. I guess my weak case for OR stems from this -- "The interchange is one of the largest and most complex interchanges in New Jersey." -- however, that isn't really much OR as just an uncited or unverifiable statement, so I'll retract my OR comment above. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 06:27, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

The fact that there are multiple <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable sources</a> to support its use -- and I could pile on a dozen more -- backs up the use of the term in the title. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 07:08, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Sources that support its use for <b>NJTP Exit 14</b>, which originally this article was specifically <i>not</i> about, and the article now is still talking about a complex much larger than just that interchange. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 07:33, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that the exclusion of the Turnpike from the interchange as described in the original text of the article was a major mistake. This mistake has been long corrected. As constructed, the Newark Airport Interchange connected the Turnpike to US 1&amp;9 and on to the airport, with NJ 21 and US 22 intersecting as well. Nothing has changed since 1952, other than adding I-78 into the mix as the connector between the Turnpike and US 1&amp;9. The sources more than adequately document that the term exists; <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> is irrelevant. Are you now arguing that 1) the Newark Airport Interchange never existed, 2) it existed once, but doesn't exist now that I-78 was constructed, or 3) it exists, but it only refers to Exit 14 of the Turnpike. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 07:42, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>As I've made explicitly clear several times, most recently with my bold type above, #3. This is also what NE2 said the day this AfD opened. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 07:44, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it only refers to Exit 14 of the Turnpike, how does it interchange with Newark Airport? The sources included describe improvements to the interchange negotiated between the Port Authority (operator of Newark Airport) and the Turnpike Authority. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 07:49, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Where are the sources from NJDOT that <i>explicitly</i> state that the interchange along Interstate 78 is the 'Newark Airport Interchange'? Or that it is the 'largest' interchange or one of the most 'complex'? It's not a NJTPK interchange, its one thats maintained by NJDOT... <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 12:54, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia requires sources. Reliable and verifiable sources regarding the interchange are provided. What does what the NJDOT calls or does not call it have to do with the notability of the article? Statements regarding relative size and complexity of the interchange had been removed well before your reply was written.

<li>Thanks, Kub, that looks like it might be a second good reference for the article (it's a reprint of a published article about the place).

<li>I believe you are following guidelines to the letter and ignoring their intent: in this case, your concern has been addressed in the previous <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Symmetry454_1137.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Symmetry454">AfD discussion associated with this article</a> that this discussion is now effectively ignoring.

<li>Firstly, you are incorrect that there has ever been a previous AfD associated with this article. It was added to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Symmetry454_1137.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Symmetry454">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Symmetry454</a> after that AfD had been running for 7 days, but removed after half and hour (and before any comments had been made) because it was a silly idea to try making that into a mass AfD. Secondly, to further quote <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html#Reliable_sources" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT#Reliable_sources</a>, "Edits that rely on primary sources should only make descriptive claims that can be checked by anyone without specialist knowledge." This article goes far beyond that. Thirdly, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> suggests that "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources"; this article certainly hasn't. This article <b>is</b> <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, pure and simple. --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 08:45, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The list is a loose association of reality show winners by program. Even if the list was expanded to include all winners of all reality TV series (not just "the most popular, big budget, ongoing North American Reality TV series" as of this writing), I don't see how that would be valuable. An example: how would a winner of <i>Survivor</i> compare with a winner of <i>Project Runway</i>? In comparison, a list of all game show winners would really appear as being loosely associated; although a list with a limited criterion, as with <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_game_show_winnings_records.html" title="American game show winnings records">American game show winnings records</a>, would have some meaning. There is also an existing <a href="../../../r/e/a/Category%7EReality_show_winners_dd8e.html" title="Category:Reality show winners">Category:Reality show winners</a>, but I am not necessarily nominating for that reason. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 09:39, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just to reply, the requirement that every person on a list has to be notable for the list itself to be notable is incorrect, nor I believe do you find it in any guidelines or policies. A list can be notable <i>as a whole</i> without every individual entry on the list being notable. For example, many notable movies include non-notable actors, but their cast list <i>as a whole</i> is a notable item worth inclusion either in their article or as a subarticle depending on the space. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:39, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The article's flaw isn't notability, as I mentioned above. It's that it is attempting to collect into a single list a wide variety of otherwise basically unrelated people. It has selected four game shows, apparently arbitraily as a result of the original author's opinion, and lists the names of the winners with no attempt to explain exactly what these people have in common that justifies being on the same list. It's a bit like trying to make a "List of Sitcom Stars" by listing the regular cast of Friends, Cheers, I Love Lucy and Taxi. Sure, all those shows are popular and notable and the cast lists are notable individually, but they have nothing in common so why should they appear in the same article? I probably wouldn't have a problem with the individual lists appearing as subsections of their related game show articles, though, or even as subarticles for those game show articles if the lists are large (provided everything is properly referenced). <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:39, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia rocks! I started adding names and links to this page as a way to kill time while at my workplace. (Yeah, I know, the boss could have caught me and given me the boot, but what are you gonna do!?!) The fact is I had never intended on adding much more because I don't have a lot of free time outside work. For the most part, I just wanted to familiarize myself with how wiki pages are edited. The fact that this has generated into any type of discussion is awesome. Sure, I guess I’ll agree with deletion because it doesn't include every reality show ever conceived. Doesn't matter much to me. Although in all honesty, most of the other trashy TV winners out there don't warrant much mention. Besides, I personally like how having a limited list provides a quick access to the history of each show's relevant season, and it helps viewers reminisce about who won, and when. Well, there's my 2 cents. Maybe if the boss goes on vacation I will try to add more shows.... <a href="../../../b/b/l/User%7EBBlze1_ab0d.html" title="User:BBlze1">BBlze1</a> 02:39, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm puzzled by the above statement. If the actual on-screen credits of the television series aren't sufficient for verification, may I ask what is? It's not as if there are "multiple third-party sources" listing the names of the people working on this show. And if there are, guess what, the names come off the on-screen credits. Or are you suggesting such articles are simply impossible to do under Wikipedia's WP:V rules and should not be attempted? No opinion on this particular article, I'm just curious. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:37, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Looking back, I'm puzzled myself. <s>What I think I mean to say is that outside of the credits lists and places where the credit lists are transcribed, I believe that nobody independant of the subject has chosen to write <i>about</i> the crew of SS and related shows. Therefore, the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> of the article is questionable. Also, the list can be <i>sourced</i>, but it cannot be <i>verified</i>, unless attribution indicating the individual episodes person X worked on is provided. Also, for the list to be completed, somebody would have to sit down, watch, and transcribe <i>every single episode's credits</i>. To me, the article as it stands does not meet any of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html#Purpose_of_lists" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">list purpouse guidelines</a>, as it provides minimal information with ninimal context, no navigational assistance, and minimal framework for development of individual articles (although I do concede that a significant rewrite may address the first or third purposes).</s> After sitting here for an hour trying to justify my above claim, I give up. I can't justify my stance beyond "Nobody that could be considered a reliable source has written about the Crew of Sesame Street, so why should we?" -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 22:25, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep pending proper references</b> The cast and crew list for a notable film or television series is vital to an informed discussion of the work. No article about a film or television series should fail to include a cast and crew list. For some long running series the cast/crew list becomes so large that incorporating the entire text in the main article becomes unwieldy, and in such a case it is perfectly appropriate to split that information off as a linked subpage of some sort. "Not a directory" is irrelevant when it comes to listing the cast and crew of a notable work of media.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>So I have no problem with a cast and crew list for a long running series being split off into its own article, provided it has proper referencing. The references are important, though, because without reference references editors can check we have no way of knowing whether this list is accurate. Therefore I'm ok with keeping a list article for the regular cast and crew of Seseme Street, but only provided we referencing for it that editorial consensus can agree is accurate. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:51, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I was led to this article from <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Crew_of_Square_One_TV_3a68.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Crew of Square One TV">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Crew of Square One TV</a>, which I also nominated and in which no objections were raised. A big problem I have with that now-deleted article and with the currently nominated article (or fork of <a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesame_Street_dd3a.html" title="Sesame Street">Sesame Street</a> as you could see it) is context. Why is <i>the crew</i> and <i>the list of the crew members</i> notable? I do not doubt that <i>Sesame Street</i> is notable and successful, and the most responsible people involved in its production should be mentioned somewhere—but should all people of varying responsibility be necessarily listed in Wikipedia? Is listing any film, television, or any media production crew appropriate in Wikipedia? I will not give a direct answer to that question, as others have stronger feelings than I do, but I would say I have not encountered another article that solely discusses a production crew of any film, television. or other media work. Some editors would think that such a list, although true, looks <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate</a>, and I tend to agree with that.</li>
<li>This article, as with most of the other articles in <a href="../../../s/e/s/Template%7ESesame_Street_3e9b.html" title="Template:Sesame Street">Template:Sesame Street</a> under the "Characters" and "Production" groupings. suffer from a lack of references and sources. The only source that would support all of these articles is the TV series itself, and it would definitely be a challenge to find secondary sources in order to sastisfy the sentence in <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> that says "Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable, published secondary sources wherever possible."

<li>Just to reply quickly, Tin, you incorrectly cited <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> as dealing with a cast/crew list. In fact, that section of policy is very specific on what it covers, and this isn't part of it. (It's a common misconception that WP:NOT#IINFO covers "trivia" or "alamanac listings", which isn't the case. See the talk page on WP:NOT for more discussion on that topic.) Rather, the section of policy that a list of people could fall under is "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>".</li>
<li>That being said, the bottom line for films and television series is that the regular cast/crew list is crucial because it is the only way to properly cite and attribute the collaborative artists who create the work. Any serious article about an art work has to properly attribute the work's creators. Now you can debate whether or not guest stars should be included in the main article, or which crew members are minor enough participants that they don't have to be included. But for sure the regular cast and major crew on the project need to be listed, and if that list is large enough it probably ought to be split into its own subarticle to keep the main article easier to read. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:55, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I didn't know <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#INFO</a> has to fall into one of the stated examples. But I digress. Maybe it doesn't fit in WP:NOT#INFO after all. I still have the problem with context, though (how should I assert there is a story or notability behind the job titles and beyond the link to the main article), however the problem's clearing up slightly with the subsequent comments. Selecting which positions are the most notable will help here. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 04:59, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> for reasons given above. Highly notable shows like <a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesame_Street_dd3a.html" title="Sesame Street">Sesame Street</a> have a lot more notable material associated with them, and this needs to be split off into sub-articles because of length reasons.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I haven't been very active here of late, but I've done a lot of work on <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:Muppets" class="extiw" title="wikia:Muppets">Muppet Wiki</a>, where our sole focus is on everything and anything relevant to the Muppets. And you know what? Even we, obsessed Muppet <i>Sesame</i> fans/historians as we are, felt these kinds of huge lists are excessive and not at all useful. Take a look at some of what's in there: production secretaries, accountants, transportation coordinator, boom operators, stagehands, and the like. I don't think a Wikipedia article on something like <i><a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Kane_0ced.html" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a></i> even would/should be that exhaustive in just listing names (and it isn't), so why such a list here? The above are all necessary people to the production of the show, sure, but that doesn't make them encyclopedic; I say this as a film credits junkie myself, with lists and word docs for my own research, but an enormous credit list in and of itself, even if it can be verified, isn't especially useful in a format like Wikipedia. What *is* useful is either selective inclusion of the most crucial crew members, the original creators, or a text paragraph, sourced and with quotes if possible, about exactly how or why the specific people shaped the program, or any unique aspects to production as a whole; an article on <i><a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasia_%28film%29.html" title="Fantasia (film)">Fantasia</a></i>, for example, has a longer credits list than other films, but a) it's an animated feature, where the technical artists and crew are instrumental to a greater extent than, say, stagehands, and b) even then, it's not a full credit transcription, just the key storyboard artists and animators who shaped each segment. Part of the problem is <i>Sesame Street</i> has been on the air *38* years. Which is a long time, with a lot of change-overs. The current list is a mixture of anonymous contributions and actual direct transcriptions from credits, but so many names are without specifics on years, and it's also rife with misspellings of names. For myself, if it were up to me, Id's say delete as a list; merge the more notable aspects, maybe the key producers, directors, and writers, or better yet, actually write something about them. Add a paragraph summing up these key crew members, in a way that's both encyclopedic and interesting (production stage manager Chat O'Brien, for example, was also a semi-regular as fruit vendor Mr. Macintosh, and was with the show for more than 20 years). -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAleal_7f5c.html" title="User:Aleal">Aleal</a> 21:43, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I guess. <i>Sesame Street</i> is obvioulsy notable and why shouldn't we record this info. But, I gotta wonder if there would be a better way to go about this.

<li><b>Comment</b> There's a difference between an <i>article</i> about the crew of <i>Sesame Street</i> and a <i>list</i> of the crew of <i>Sesame Street</i>. The page is currently the latter. As it is now, the page is just as good as having the title List of crew of Sesame Street, and I probably would have taken that to AfD. A link to the main article via {{<a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">main</a>}} technically adds nothing: the notability of this topic needs to be stated clearly within this article. Now, an article about the production of the show and the awards given to the crew and anything else related (specifically per Aleal and MrFizyx) is worth reading. Whether the title of that article should be "Crew of Sesame Street" is another story. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 04:59, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think the difference of opinion is stemming from you seeing it as a completely seperate article from the main article, when in fact I think it's a subarticle intended to split off an otherwise large list section from the main article to make the main article more readable. It can be acceptable to divide a main article into smaller subarticles if the information in the subarticles is important to the main article but the size of the undivided main article is unwieldy. In this case, the cast/major crew list of a television series is a fairly important piece of information. So it's a question of style whether that list should be included in the main article entirely or split off into its own subarticle.</dd>
<dd>By the way, a possible alternative method for handling extremely long cast lists is to move the entire list to Wikisource and provide a transwiki link from the main article. I could see an argument that the cast/crew list for a show could fall under the realm of Wikisource, since it's basically a data set intended to supplement an article rather than act as an encylopedic topic on its own. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:03, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think its more than that, the list seems to be hit or miss as to whether it is covering only the most recent cast or has years associated with the individuals. Also, I hate to belittle the contributions of hair stylist and stagehands, but... Just what will one find useful in this list of names? -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 16:12, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

He is already discussed in the articles on the films, which, since the films have sufficient reliable and reputable sources written about them, satisfy NPOV. However, there aren't sufficient sources to have an NPOV article on Wolf, and as can be seen, the article currently uses only his website and the WTBDWK website as sources.

<li><b>Comment</b> The nomination claims his views on physics "fundamentally conflict with those of the scientific community" but in fact per <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/ferminews/reading.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/ferminews/reading.html" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> his book "Taking the Quantum Leap: The New Physics for Non-Scientists" is on a very select recommended list provided by Fermilab, a major U.S. government high energy physics research lab of 26 books on quantum physics for "regular people", right there next to Gell-Mann, Hawking, Feynman, Teller, Lederman, etc., and their only complaint is the writing is bland and stuffy. Not exactly the indices of total crackpotness. So maybe "some" of his views are contrary to the views of many in the physics community would be more accurate and less of a POV personal attack on the author. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 22:12, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - his crackpotness is to me a red herring. History is replete with notable loons and weirdos. The article gives solid claims for notability.

We currently don't have any reputable independent sources, and we certainly don't have any sources that allow us to make the article have a neutral point of view. I assert that given the currently extant sources, it is impossible for the article to abide by fundamental Wikipedia policy.

Even for the articles that are kept, they are usually focused on the ideas of the person rather than the actual person (BDORT was moved from Yoshiaki Omura, and so on). --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 10:05, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>Actual</i> nonverifiability and the impossibility of satisfying fundamental policy. This has been used before; for example, it was used as the justification for the Aetherometry deletion. It is a verifiability problem, which is the basis of non-notability deletions — even though the subject may have some presence on the internet and be known to some people, they are not notable enough to have independent sources about them. In this case, it is likely due to all of the sources being about the film, rather than the specific individual in the film. For that reason, I am somewhat inclined to redirect the article to WTBDWK, even though that redirect would be rather unintuitive. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 10:16, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

I'd be very surprised if it was impossible to verify his television and film appearances etc. That the article is of poor quality is unarguable, but I struggle to see a good reason for deletion; only for article improvement. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 10:28, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> per Dweller, unless I missed a [[WP:CRACKPOT]]-type guideline someplace. &#160;;-) Whatever one may think of his ideas, Wolf fulfills <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>; he has authored a number of popular books that haven't been published by vanity presses<a href="http://www.wie.org/bios/fred-alan-wolf.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wie.org/bios/fred-alan-wolf.asp" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> and his media appearances should be easy to verify.

In addition, he has published 10 or so books. The article, as it currently stands, is largely verified and/or relatively easily verifiable (see the link). If reliable, published sources consider him a "crackpot" (though I would advise the use of a more neutral term or phrase such as "disagree with him"), then by all means note them so that they can be incorporated into the article.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> While his theories <i>may</i> be "crackpot", the man is probably notable enough for an article. An article on his <b>theories</b> would need much better sourcing.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article now has several independent reliable sources to notability. He is a noted science writer, and has a PhD in physics from a noted university. He haswritten many books published by mainstream publishers such as Harper. His book "Taking the Quantum Leap: The New Physics for Nonscientists" won the National Book Award as science paperback for 1980 from the National Book Foundation. "Fred Alan Wolf" gets 120,000 Google hits. Disagreeing with the theoretical physics establishment is by no means a basis for deleting an article. The AFD process is not a forum for deciding the truth of scientific views but only of noting whether they have multiple independent sources. His many appearances on science programs and his book award are sufficient. His notability is further attested by his books. He may be a crank in the views of some, but clearly he is notable. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 21:17, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Keep</b>: My reasoning <s>does</s> did conform with policy, though admittedly in a non-obvious fashion, and I've listed several other AfDs as precedent above. In general, these sorts of articles are difficult to deal with policy-wise: it is possible to have a subject which is notable enough to have some sympathetic, partially reliable sources about it, or, in many cases, have many minor mentions in reliable sources , and yet be absurdly difficult or essentially impossible to write about while following verifiability, neutral point of view and no original research simultaneously. My personal threshold for this, which I believe stemmed from the arguments Aetherometry article a few years ago, is that for articles where the subject is clearly contentious and conflicts with mainstream science, the subject probably shouldn't have an article if no one has bothered to disagree with the subject in a reliable source. Nearly all notable crackpots and such satisfy this, as I mentioned above. As far as I could tell, after asking in the Pseudoscience Wikiproject and the talk page for the article, and searching around myself, Wolf didn't satisfy this criterion. It still appears that he doesn't, but the article has become more problematic — the article satisfies V reasonably well now, but making it satisfy NPOV will be difficult. In the end, this may end up like the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Michael_Langan_7c4b.html" title="Christopher Michael Langan">Christopher Michael Langan</a> article, and it may take us quite a while to find appropriate sources for NPOVing. There are also some other issues in this sort of case: for example, as the subject is portrayed in a scientific light, we really should have sources that satisfy the Appropriate Sources principle of the Pseudoscience ArbCom decision. But I can't currently call for the deletion of the article any longer given the new sources (nominating an abandoned article for AfD is a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">pointy</a> yet effective way of improving the article). --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 11:55, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Philosophus, I'm trying to understand your comment that subjects like Wolf are "essentially impossible to write about while following verifiability, neutral point of view and no original research simultaneously", and I'm just not grokking it. I'm sympathetic to your desire not to portray Wolf as representing some sort of majority or consensus view among physicists. But really, what is the big deal about people dicking around with metaphysics? It happens all the time. Surely wikilinking to <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphysics.html" title="Metaphysics">metaphysics</a> a/o <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> is enough to clarify matters for the curious but science-naive reader.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure I follow <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a>'s reasoning either. It sounds like you are giving two reasons: (1)The article is hard to police for NPOV and (2) No real scientist has gotten in a big enough huff over this crackpot to write an article explaining why his theories aren't science. Reason #1 is not deletion criteria. Policing a hard-to-police article is done every day at Wikipedia. Reason #2 is not going to be especially relevant in many cases. A lot of fringe science stuff is so kooky that no real scientist wants to treat it as important enough to even deserve a debunking article; for example, you'll never find a <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_abe5.html" title="National Geographic">National Geographic</a> article that debunks <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">Flat Earth</a> theories. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 03:45, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Consider a theory that the moon is made of cheese (a typical example of clear pseudoscience). Suppose the theory is mentioned in quite a few reliable sources, possibly in a somewhat humorous or passing manner, but enough that it is verifiable and thus suitable for inclusion per WP:V. How can an NPOV article be written about the topic? It clearly conflicts with obvious evidence, but pointing that out would be original research. My point is that it is possible for more obscure pseudoscientific topics to have every reliable source be biased. This was the case, for example, with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cognitive-Theoretic_Model_of_the_Universe_7557.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe">CTMU</a>. It was certainly verifiable, and mentioned in many reliable sources because of its connection with <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Michael_Langan_7c4b.html" title="Christopher Michael Langan">Christopher Michael Langan</a>. But there were no scientific sources, and the sources that existed were all sympathetic or mentioned the theory briefly while talking about Langan for other reasons. The article was deleted; otherwise, we would have been in a situation where to follow NOR and the letter of NPOV would have meant writing about the theory as if it were wonderful, without any criticisms. In this case, the situation is somewhat similar, though I misjudged the topic, due to my inability to find more independent sources. It is also likely that it will be possible to use WTBDWK sources as material for keeping a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Pseudoscience_f6ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience">serious</a> point of view in the article. I must say that I am quite surprised at the questioning of this reasoning, considering that it has been used many times before. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 05:38, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>In that case, you just write the article as "so-and-so says such-and-such." It's possible to write a pseudoscientific article in the same tone that is used when describing the contents of a novel: without writing as if everything that has been printed on a page is literally true.

<li>I never said that the magazine itself was unreliable. I was saying that, often times, magazine-conducted polls tend to be biased in front of the group with the most vocal proponents. Besides, are you honestly comparing "Indianapolis Woman" to <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stone_3229.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a>? And in any case, we have no idea what the sample size of the 'best morning radio show' is. Best out of the state? county? city?

<li>Given that the magazine in question is based in Indianapolis, the sample size seems obvious- Indianapolis. And with a value judgment such as "best," you have to rely on polls; how else do you judge value? Speaking of judging value, who's to say that one magazine is better or more reliable than another? Sure, with a larger magazine such as <i>Rolling Stone</i>, the circulation size is bigger; however, their target audience is bigger to match. Local newspapers are quite reliable to local citizens. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.atwell_c79b.html" title="User:David.atwell">David</a> 06:58, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per CounterFX. While I agree with the transwiki'ing of name lists from individual countries, this one is neither useless nor indiscriminate.

<ul>
<li>It was never claimed that the article was useless or indiscriminate, but that it is better suited for a dictionary. Note that <i>all</i> of the given name lists were lists of "most popular" names; they also had a limited scope. None of them included any possible given name, which could have been endless, only the documented popular ones. This is nothing more than the same principle applied on a limited scale for more countries. The reasons for this being unencyclopedic and more worthy of a dictionary still stand: it is a list of words <i>based on word usage</i> (geographical distribution) without any prose about the meaning, in an encyclopedia which prohibits name definition articles, so that links from the names would be unhelpful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> This isn't a static list of given names by national origin, or a list of names with etymological meanings, so it isn't appropriate for a dictionary. In my opinion, it's currently a very long stub, but more detailed encyclopaedic content about international naming trends could be added in the future in order to supplement the tables. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 16:51, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not just a list of names that exist in a country or among a particular group. It is a rather well-sourced (albeit incomplete) and dynamic list of names by country and/or region. I will not comment on the list's appropriateness for Wiktionary, but will assert that it is definitely appropriate for Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:09, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I fail to see the distinction. You're committing the fallacy of arguing that sources have anything to do with whether something belongs in an encyclopedia or a dictionary, it seems. Wiktionary would strongly disagree with that (<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/WT:RFV" class="extiw" title="wikt:WT:RFV">wikt:WT:RFV</a>). How is this any more encyclopedic than the rest? <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 23:16, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My main point was not sourcing (that's just a plus). My point was that it is not just a (static) listing of names. It is a (dynamic) list that supplements the article <a href="../../../g/i/v/Given_name.html" title="Given name">given name</a> by providing information about the commonality and geographic distribution of names--such information would never be found in a dictionary. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:46, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, there is no essential difference between this list and all the others. You say dictionaries don't cover the geographic distribution of words, but encyclopedias do? You have that exactly backwards: <i>dictionaries</i> specify word usage, like regional usages.

<li>There is a world of difference. The examples you have noted are all <i>limited to one country</i>. The <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Russian_surnames" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Russian_surnames">category for Russian names</a>, for instance, identifies only the origin of the names without saying <i>anything</i> about the geographic distribution and/or concentration of those names. Dictionaries <i>do not</i> cover this type of information: they cover the meanings of names, their origins, and not much else. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Scottish_surnames" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Scottish_surnames">wikt:Category:Scottish_surnames</a> identifies names of Scottish origin, but says nothing about the fact that there are plenty of individuals with this name <i>outside</i> of Scotland. And why should it? That is not within the scope of a dictionary. A dictionary should limit itself to identifying words, defining them, and specifying how they originated. The geographic distribution of names (which is tied in to migration patterns, the political histories of regions, etc.) is beyond the scope of a dictionary. That sort of information belongs in an encyclopedia. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:06, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think so. Regional political upheavals and migration pattersn are encyclopedic content. The general spread of words and names as a result of those migration patterns is also encyclopedic content. But information about <i>specific</i> words and names is dictionary content. The distinction that <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> draws doesn't have anything to do with the <i>scope</i> of an article or items in a list--it has to do with the <i>subject</i> of the article or of the items in a list. If the subject is a word or name, or if the items in the list are words or names, that's dictionary content. And the more that can be said about the words or names, the better--but it still goes in Wiktionary not Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:24, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The subject here is obviously not a "specific word or name". It is <i>the frequency of given names across the world</i>. The subject here is not names, but their frequency. This is not a static list. Any of the names on this list could be removed as soon as updated data arrives. Your point is inapplicable as it misjudges the subject of the list. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:52, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it doesn't. The subject of the list is not the general concept of name frequency. If it were, it would be titled Onomastic trends and would not be in list form. I imagine that such an article would be possible to write; it would include observations and extrapolations that outside sources have made by looking at data about specific names like the data that is in this list. But the list itself is a collection of information about the frequency of specific names, hence it is about specific names. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:34, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, your last statement is logically fallacious: <i>"the list itself is a collection of information about the frequency of specific names, hence it is about specific names."</i> No, as you justed admitted, it's about frequency. Second, I never claimed that the subject wsa the "general concept of name frequency". It's not about the general concept (though I suppose it could be altered to that purpose); it's about the actual frequency. Third, this is not a list of the frequency of any "specific names" (even if you count 200+ as specific) as it is a dynamic list that changes from year to year. How can it be about particular names when those names may be justifiably removed one year and re-added the next? -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:42, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let me address your first &amp; second points taken together. I raised the notion of "general concept of name frequency" to make a contrast between the kind of material suited for Wikipedia and the kind of material suited for Wiktionary. Information about frequencies of specific names <i>is</i> information about those specific names -- i.e. Wiktionary material -- as opposed to information about the "general concept of name frequency," which is Wikipedia material. On your third point, this really shouldn't be a dynamic list on either Wiktionary or Wikipedia; it should classify the information by year. But that's not relevant to the question of whether it should go on Wiktionary or Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 20:11, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is highly relevant. All the other "List of ... names" were just that: static lists of names that exist, and should have been deleted. This list is entirely different. This article does not convey information about a specific set of names; rather, it conveys information about a specific set of countries. The article presents descriptive information about a characteristic of individual countries. The individual names are of secondary (or even tertiary) importance and relevance as they are replacable. This article is actually mistitled (not a reason for deletion, by the way). It is not a list of names, but rather a list of countries. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 21:08, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The most popular given names are a highly notable topic, and I've seen entire websites devoted to the topic, as well as mentions of it in geneology books. Notable topics about which much could potentially be said belong in Wikipedia, not Wiktionary. Plus, I do not see any merit, or any basis in Wikipedia policy, in the argument about deleting this list of names just because many other lists of names have been deleted. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 02:10, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A dictionary is the proper place for the definition and usage of words. For lists of names by category, and for showing how the frequency of name usage evolves, I think an encyclopedia is much more suited. –<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoaler_5952.html" title="User:Shoaler">Shoaler</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/o/User_talk%7EShoaler_4dcd.html" title="User talk:Shoaler">talk</a>) 15:33, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> does not require that all "things about names go in Wiktionary", and the idea that everything about names go into a dictionary is dangerously schematic. There is a branch of linguistics about names (<a href="../../../o/n/o/Onomastics.html" title="Onomastics">onomastics</a>). This particular article may be about names, but as several above have implied the synthetic effect of <i>this</i> list places it outside of anything that I've met in any dictionary. While I'm happy enough to banish most lists of names, this one strikes me as compellingly encyclopedic and very un-dictionary-like. <a href="../../../s/e/m/User_talk%7ESemperf_0e01.html" title="User talk:Semperf"><font color="#008000"><b><i>semper fictilis</i></b></font></a> 04:00, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't express myself well and have amended my comment. Of course I don't think that material about names as a general category should go in Wiktionary. See my above response to Black Falcon.

<li><b>Comment</b> The recent discussions have given rise to one very valid point - what about converting the list from a single, dynamic, continually-updated list into a set of static lists by year, such as List of most popular given names in 2006, List of most popular given names in 2007, and so forth? This is already being done for the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_the_most_popular_names_in_the_2000s_in_the_United_States_e12c.html" title="List of the most popular names in the 2000s in the United States">lists of the United States</a>. This way, results from previous years would not need to be lost whenever a new publication is released.

Better serves Wikipedia? Exactly what does that mean. Is the purpose of Wikipedia simply to exist? Or is it to be a resource for people around the world to use? For if it's the latter, I fail to understand the rationale behind your comment. Not everyone finds categories easier to use than lists, and I'm sure you know that. So, in sum, I fail to see what reason there could be for desiring the elimination of the article. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:03, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> In response to the advertisement allegations: This article is not complete (see ToDo List), but is a work in progress on a dynamic subject that is difficult to define and categorize (help is welcome). This list of screen recording software should not be misinterpreted as an advertisement due to pricing, prices are included because cost is significant when evaluating software. They were removed once before from another page, and put back because some found them useful... see the <a href="../../../s/c/r/Talk%7EScreencast_e04d.html#External_Links" title="Talk:Screencast">Screencast Discussion</a> page. Furthermore; it took quite a bit of time &amp; energy to research &amp; compile the pricing data and software links. When looking at other Comparison pages, prices apparently can be included and are helpful when comparing features and making evaluation decisions... <b>Price</b> data is prevalent in many other 'Comparison' articles like <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_video_editing_software.html" title="Comparison of video editing software">Comparison of video editing software</a> &amp; <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_clients.html" title="Comparison of instant messaging clients">Comparison of instant messaging clients</a>.

<li>I agree that the List of Star Trek races is not comparable to these two Lists of Software. The Star Trek lists have content, are informative, and they lack any promotional external links. These two lists up for AfD are different; they have no content and their sole purpose is to be promotional. I've found that keeping external links out of software lists requires a lot of diligence. The big problem here is that one user in particular has taken an oath to be disruptive when they said <i>"Remove it if you can! I will not let you to remove external links."</i> Unfortunately a happy medium is not possible when dealing with such individuals.

<li><b>Comment</b> for another example, think of all the minor relatives of celebrities. Such people are rarely notable enough for their own articles, but they can be mentioned on the celebrity's article.

<li>These are the yellow pages and the contact information is the external links. You might not see the contact information (external links) in the current versions of both pages but that's because I've been fighting a losing battle to keep them clean.

In the discussion about the edit war a particularly defiant user has said <i>"Remove it if you can!

Many are not as well developed as this one. We simply need guidance &amp; templates as to how to create these <b>Lists and Comparison</b> pages properly (no one wants to see them become link-spam &amp; propaganda). It would be a shame to delete them all! Being an IT &amp; trying to keep track of software tools &amp; development is one of the main reasons I use WP... I find these Lists and Comparison pages most useful. As time allows, I would prefer to continue to work on this &amp; add stubs to wiki articles describing some of the significant software like <a href="../../../f/f/m/FFMPEG_6846.html" title="FFMPEG">FFMPEG</a> and Istanbul_software, which doesn't have a page yet. I don't think it is a black &amp; white issue (delete or keep), the Lists exist and are a necessary part of the process to create more in depth articles. There is a methodology to creating an article on a category of software like Screencasting. This is how it is evolving:</li>
<li>Define, List features and what the product is used for. <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_editing_software.html" title="Video editing software">Video editing software</a></li>
<li>Describe the process for creating a product, provide access to HOWTOs &amp; Examples. <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_editing_software.html" title="Video editing software">Video editing software</a></li>
<li>List tools for creating a product. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_video_editing_software.html" title="List of video editing software">List_of_video_editing_software</a></li>

<dd>It was never the intention of this article to create a 'link-farm', rather a source of reference for organizing &amp; defining what is Screen Recording software (similar to <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_editing_software.html" title="Video editing software">Video editing software</a>) &amp; how it can be used to create computer based Tutorials, Screencasts, Netcasts, Podcasts, CBTs... (rather hot topics), which are evolving rapidly. Unfortunately sites like tucows and freshmeat don't have collaborative wikis or the ability to categorize items the way some of the software lists have evolved on WP. So is there a recommended way to create a List of software with references and 'blue' links, short of creating a WP entry for each item?

<li>I agree that AThomas203 doesn't seem like a special purpose account but a lot of unusual stuff has been swirling around this AfD.

<p>I will re-nominate this NN Survivor contestant who hasnt done anything since leaving the show. Lack of notable secondary references outside game show, A quick google search (minus Wikipedia results) turns up around 1,000 results but most are forum posts from the Survivor game show, plus a few on her official website. I'm sure we dont create pages on losing game show contestants on shows such as <i>Jeopardy</i> or <i>Deal or No Deal</i> because they've been on a game show. (well except for the obvious notable celebrities on the special editions). --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnzy_60da.html" title="User:Arnzy">Arnzy</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/n/User_talk%7EArnzy_d126.html" title="User talk:Arnzy">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arnzy_0c85.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arnzy">contribs</a>) 13:33, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b> It is perfectly understandable for people to write articles about those who share their politics, and if the article is objective and NPOV, that's how we build; there is no POV in this article To me, that does not count as bad faith in the author.

<li><b>Delete as violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a></b>. The nomination provides no reason(s) for deletion. <s>Even if everything the nom says is true, being a spokesman for terrorists and engaging in anti-Russian propganda seems to hint that the subject of the article is notable.</s> However, the article (or at least the version I'm viewing) is quite strange. For instance, who does the "us" in the fourth and sixth sentences refer to? I would suggest notifying the author of the article, <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessir_bb9b.html" title="User:Messir">User:Messir</a>, of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> (writing "us" seems an indication of personal involvement in the issue). Also, the new additions (beyond the second sentence) are confusing. For instance, the article says "The main concept of his philosophy is quranic term "kufr", which interpreteded as ideology.", but "kufr" actually means "unbeliever", not "ideology". Another part describes the individual as an "elf-muslim" (claimed to be a self-description), with a reference to Tolkien, which I couldn't decipher. Unless this is sourced, I would say delete as a violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:00, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>It isn't hard to find angry Russophobic writers on the internet - that alone does not establish or even suggest notability. Currently, this article doesn't seem to fulfill <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (perhaps <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28journalists%29_7ddb.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (journalists)">Wikipedia:Notability (journalists)</a> is a better fit in this case).

Also, I'm not insisting that the individual is indeed notable, but am just expressing my opinion that the nominator's method of nominating the article for deletion is counterproductive overall and even to his goal (to get the article deleted). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 06:10, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Gentlemen, let me explain myself. I nominated the article for deletion because this Ivanenko character's "works" are only being published at the Kavkaz Center website, which is a terrorist media platform, run by the Chechen rebels themselves and the guys who support them. Even though I personally support the freedom of press, I don't think I can tolerate anti-Russian slander in Wikipedia (or links to such sites). But as always, majority here decides everything, even if people can't read Russian at all and have no idea what this Ivanenko is writing about. <a href="../../../k/n/e/User%7EKNewman_9692.html" title="User:KNewman">KNewman</a> 06:39, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think it much matters what he's <i>writing</i>. The question is whether <i>he himself</i> is notable and whether the article about <i>him</i> should be kept. I am of the opinion that the article should be deleted as violating <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. The statement that he works for/with Kavkaz Center is true and verified (see <a href="http://old.kavkazcenter.com/eng/content/2004/01/29/2331.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://old.kavkazcenter.com/eng/content/2004/01/29/2331.shtml" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>). However, other parts of the article, such as about his "philosophy", are not verified and thus violate <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Moreover, the subject of the articles <i>does not</i> seem to meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> (as far as I could tell from a review of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%2B%22Alexei+Ivanenko%22+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%2B%22Alexei+Ivanenko%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">available English-language sources</a>; there <i>may</i> be others in Turkish or Russian). However, your approach to the nomination was inappropriate and, I believe, the reason for most of the "keep" votes. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 06:51, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree with Black Falcon - there were many valid grounds you could've picked to delete the article, but you picked the one that would be least persuasive to editors unfamiliar with the subject. I've changed my vote to "Delete", because the article as it is now violates a whole bunch of guidelines and it doesn't seem likely to fulfill them anytime soon. If it does, my vote will change again; I'm basing my decision strictly on whether the article fulfills wikipedia guidelines or not. Please also realize that just because a person or ideology promote slander does NOT mean that they should not be in wikipedia. Wikipedia is meant to be a neutral mechanism, so that if this person's views are widely denounced people can read about that within the article and make their own judgements - we have articles on subjects such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_2073.html" title="The Protocols of the Elders of Zion">The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a> which do just that. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 07:11, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is identical to at least other 4 articles on the philosophical paradigm of <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simulated_reality.html" title="Simulated reality">simulated reality</a>. only this one not even trying to add anything new, written in a child like way and repeat even it self. it could link to the <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dream_argument.html" title="Dream argument">Dream_argument</a> or <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil_demon.html" title="Evil demon">evil demon</a>. yet I believe it is completely redundant.</p>

<li><b>weak keep</b> - Dennet has me convinced for now that this is a useful thought experiment separate from others.

<li><b>keep</b> Having read several philosophical books, I can say that most philosophers address this experiment separately from the problem of the <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dream_argument.html" title="Dream argument">dream argument</a> or the <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil_demon.html" title="Evil demon">evil demon</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Being a contest winner is <i>not</i> a requirement to be notable for Wikipedia purposes. The requirement for notability purposes would be that she has been the subject of multiple, independently written articles from reliable publishers. In this case, the article appears to cite three or four independent articles about the subject, and thus she would be notable (assuming the references check out).

<li>You are, of course--although technically AfD is not a vote&#160;;) . The nomination itself counts as a "delete" and many nominators add a bolded "delete" following their nominations (for visual clarity, to make additional comments, or to specify that they support deletion instead of redirecting or merging, for instace). I was just trying to clarify whether you were the actual nominator or just the first to comment. In retrospect, I could simply have checked the edit history to confirm that you created the AfD.

<li><b>Delete</b> or significantly ammend. For example, this POV page does not include the important article from a leading Armenian HETQ magazine - <a href="http://www.hetq.am/eng/society/0604-tapan.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hetq.am/eng/society/0604-tapan.html" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> about Armenians' destroying their own khachkars and cultural heritage -- and since the Hetq story compares this to khachkar (cross-stones or head-stones, common to Armenians and Caucasian Albanians of the region) destruction in Naxcivan, it was relevant.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is interesting, there are more admissions of khachkars being destroyed by Armenians themselves, especially around their capital of Yerevan -- for example, at this specialized khachkar website - <a href="http://www.khachkar.am/en/endangered.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.khachkar.am/en/endangered.php" rel="nofollow">[52]</a></p>
<p>"Endangered Khachkars in Armenia and Artsakh <b>It is particularly tragic that khachkars are also endangered in Armenia and Artsakh. They are disappearing, being damaged or moved.</b> Most endangered are the old khachkar fields located near today’s graveyards, where khachkars are being eradicated for the creation of new burial space. <b>The “crown of thorns” belongs to the khachkar field in Arinch near Yerevan. The situation is threatening in Noratus as well, where new burials are encroaching upon the khachkar field from at least three sides. The old graveyard of Areni is in almost the same situation.</b> The movement of khachkars voluntarily by different individuals is a widespread practice. In some cases this is done to allegedly create a new holy place, for example, the case of Karmir Dalakner of Gegharquniq region where the khachkar was brought from Karvachar. Another case of moved khachkars is due to the decoration of new offices and especially entertainment establishments, as for example in the Vank village in Karabakh. The third and the most condemning practice is when khachkars are merely disappearing to decorate individual yards and houses. <b>Khachkars are being damaged also by believers, worshipers and casual visitors, who light candles on them or write their names on them or engage in rituals that are damaging the carvings</b>." See gallery of photos here - <a href="http://www.khachkar.am/gallery/index_en.php?id=2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.khachkar.am/gallery/index_en.php?id=2" rel="nofollow">[53]</a></p>
<p>Moreover, the destruction of cultural heritage (or Cultural Genocide, as some Armenians dubbed it) in Armenia, like elsewhere, has reached dangerous proportions and led to many protests both in press and in streets -- <a href="http://noteshairenik.blogspot.com/2006/05/this-historic-landmark-is-being-torn.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://noteshairenik.blogspot.com/2006/05/this-historic-landmark-is-being-torn.html" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>, <a href="http://www.avantart.com/armenia/2005/kultur.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.avantart.com/armenia/2005/kultur.htm" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>, <a href="http://www.hetq.am/eng/society/0510-kamer.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hetq.am/eng/society/0510-kamer.html" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>, and <a href="http://www.armenianow.com/?action=viewArticle&amp;AID=1166&amp;lng=eng&amp;IID=1052" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.armenianow.com/?action=viewArticle&amp;AID=1166&amp;lng=eng&amp;IID=1052" rel="nofollow">[57]</a></p>
<p>Hence, if the Armenian and pro-Armenian view on destruction of khachkars by allegedly Azerbaijanis and allegedly in Naxcivan is to be included, then a contrarian view should be included too -- not just Azerbaijan's denial of wrongdoing by the government, but Armenians' own admission of breaking, destroying and otherwise mishandling their own khachkars on their own territory. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 13:02, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> because as I saw all references are to armenian sources and one iranian source, which uses the word Arran instead our official and OURS name Azerbaijan thus showing that it is completely biased and prejudiced. And coming to the video, It is not completely evident that those people are Azerbaijanis, it can be a constructed scene and imitation, how many times we have met such fake videos? I have watched that film from youtube, it must be viewed by a professional video master in order to be examined. I think this dispute should be solved by so simple procedure, Armenian MFa should ask any Internatioanl organisation and that organisation should conduct an official investigation with the Azeri and Armenian MFAs and if they can find any proof that that destruction was done , then please. <a href="../../../e/l/s/User%7EElsanaturk_57d3.html" title="User:Elsanaturk">Elsanaturk</a> 19:38, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article should not be deleted because it is very informative including the pictures and it is also fully sourced. The only reason that this article was listed for deletion by user Grandmaster is because currently there is a conflict between Armenian-Azerbaijani users and lot of edit waring in many Armenian-Azerbaijani related pages. This is a type of retaliation agains Armenian users and Armenian related articles, which I think is not the right thing to do by retaliating each other. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7EROOB323_48aa.html" title="User:ROOB323">ROOB323</a> 21:01, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Even though it seems that almost all those who have asked for it to be deleted are doing so for very questionable motives (to say the least), it does not get around the fact that the article duplicates what is already on the page for Julfa and adds nothing new to the subject.

<dd>I've recommended, that if we are to keep this article, then it should be expanded to include not only all the counter-claims (by the other side), but the significant evidence and pictures of Armenians themselves engaged in destruction of their historic heritage. Otherwise, it is obviously POV. Moreover, perhaps this article can become more comprehensive, and become "Destruction of cultural and historic heritage in South Caucasus", where we can include all the claims and counter-claims of Georgians -- such as 19th century Ilya Chavchavadze book about Armenians mishandling Georgian Churches and graves. I think there are some more evidence from Soviet academics about Urartu heritage being physically "rebranded" by some ultra-nationalists. All this would make a better quality article as would give a full picture to the readers. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 07:48, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The issue has received multiple international coverage and is the subject of a dispute between two countries. I think that easily qualifies its notability as a separate article. Armenia says it happened, Azerbaijan says it didn't, and a variety of international organisations/observers have confirmed and/or questioned its occurrence (for the most part, the incident has been confirmed). The article should reflect this controversy so that there are no POV issues. Based on their comments, a number of editors seem to be personally motivated either for or against this article. If there is POV in the article, clean it up. But the fact that this issue has received so much attention and controversy means that it qualifies as having its own article (aside from a notice in <a href="../../../n/a/k/Nakhichevan.html" title="Nakhichevan">Nakhichevan</a>). Content disputes should be addressed on the talk page, not at AfD. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:50, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

As for Nakhichevan, if this article is to be kept, then I think we should remove duplicate info from the article about <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julfa.html" title="Julfa">Julfa</a>, because what is the point in having the same information pasted in many articles? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 07:35, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You raise good points, which I admit I had not considered. However, I believe both issues can be addressed without deleting this article. The first issue can be easily solved through a page-move, such as moving the page to <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khachkar_destruction_in_Nakhichevan_b7e8.html" title="Khachkar destruction in Nakhichevan">Khachkar destruction in Nakhichevan</a>. As for your second point, a certain degree of duplication across articles is necessary. For instance, the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Germany_4fd2.html" title="History of Germany">History of Germany</a> article should obviously discuss <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, and even <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_Merkel_e07c.html" title="Angela Merkel">Angela Merkel</a>. The destruction of the khackhars (or to take a wholly neutral view, the dispute regarding the destruction of khackars) is an important part of the Julfa's history. I do agree, however, that the section in the article about Julfa should be reduced in length if the "Khachkar destruction" article exists/is kept. Articles should cross-reference each other, but they should not replicate large portions of one another.

<li>Thanks for your response. Right now I'm inclined to keep the article under its current name and split it into sections about various instances of real or alleged khachkar destruction. I think that might be the best way to deal with this issue. But I still have not made up my mind yet. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 08:06, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, the article was never created with the intention of mentioning the destruction of any cultural monuments in Armenia. However, you took a liberal interpretation of its title to your advantage and made this an issue. It's just become one big mess.</dd>
<dd>I personally think that the creation of this entire article was irresponsible in light of the RfA mediation currently being worked out between Armenian and Azeri editors. -- <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">Aivazovsky</a> 13:43, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This article was created as a POV fork, however it can be actually a good place to present information on various aspects of this issue, which were purged from articles on Nakhichevan and Julfa. I agree that this article should not have been creaed at this time, same as purging wikipedia of Azerbaijan related images and many other actions of a certain person.

<dd>"<i>Purging</i> wikipedia of Azerbaijan related images?" I think that as a first step towards working out our differences we shouldn't use such strong words. We need to replace suspicion with trust.</dd>
<dd>I still say that the best move for this article would be to rename it to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_of_Armenian_cultural_monuments_in_Nakhichevan_242e.html" title="Status of Armenian cultural monuments in Nakhichevan">Status of Armenian cultural monuments in Nakhichevan</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">Aivazovsky</a> 13:54, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>Strong Keep</b>The article describes intentional destruction with purposeful aim of destruction of a nations heritage - cultural genocide. The destruction of 19th century Yerevan is done with the AIM of development and through corruption, etc ... Example of neglect and corruption rather than attempt by Armenians to eradicate their own history. Destruction might be comprable to what happened in grand central station.

<p>This minor character in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_O.C._1fa0.html" title="The O.C.">The O.C.</a> only appeared briefly in one episode and I believe is not notable enough to warrant her own article.

<li><b>Delete</b> - How can <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> possibly be applied to a 5 month year old infant, who hasn’t had any life of her own? There is nothing substantial in the story about her as person, but only about the involved adults. Moreover, many of the quoted sources (TV transcripts, interviews) where people raise their claims are <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_sources.html" title="Primary sources">primary sources</a> in the sense of close to the situation.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I suspect the "spread of titillating claims about people's lives" has already been achieved by the substantial media coverage on this issue, which means Wikipedia is not the "primary vehicle"; therefore this article is not in violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> <i>per se</i>. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> doesn't specifically exclude infants, nor does it say that the sources must contain substantial coverage about "her as person"; it only says that the coverage must be "non-trivial", i.e. more than a passing mention. If the whole source - and there are six or seven separate sources cited - is about her paternity, then IMHO this counts as non-trivial coverage. As to "not mentioning the baby's name in other articles", that would count as censorship of established information, which would be in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89"><font color="purple"><b>Wal</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/a/l/User_talk%7EWalton_monarchist89_7ca3.html" title="User talk:Walton monarchist89"><font color="silver"><b>ton</b></font></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/WP%7EBRoy_e296.html" title="WP:BRoy"><font color="purple">Vivat Regina!</font></a></sup></small></font> 20:42, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

I referecned to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> not because I see it violated, but since I would want to stay on the side of caution with respect to an evolving story, instead of having a 'biography' that only consists of paternity claims. In this sense I would also want to clarify my comment about the <i>rather</i> not mentioning of the name which I don't want to censor as it should be e.g in the Smith article and is present anyway in the referenced sources.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikiwont_2b2d.html" title="User:Tikiwont">Tikiwont</a> (<a href="../../../t/i/k/User_talk%7ETikiwont_2ecc.html" title="User talk:Tikiwont">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tikiwont_e891.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tikiwont">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>KEEP</b> The custody battle of Dannielynn is unique in its circumstances.

Her notability, as weak as it is, does not derive from something she's done, something that has been done to her, or her current or future position in life. It derives from her parentage, and that can be discussed in her one verifiable parent's article. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 18:39, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article appears to be unnecessary listcruft (being as <i>real names</i> are on every single wrestler article). Also, the article itself says it may <i>may never be able to satisfy certain standards for completeness</i> as there are too many wrestlers to reasonably add to this article This creates certainty of endless cruft if article was maintained. Any cross-referencing impossible as gimmick names are listed seperately. The article, in addition, lists no references. <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuriel1981_fc18.html" title="User:Suriel1981">Suriel1981</a> 15:02, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> with the movie article. Jimmy was an interesting minor character with several lines, just enough that he might have a sentence or two in a synopsis or discussion of the movie. Without several reliable sources where he is a primary subject. the article fails to show notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> Too soon. As we still have no rule for this, we need to judge of general conceptions of fairness. this is a typical case, where there is nothing additional to say. I think the general feeling here is that a month is too short, and it would be good to establish that as a precedent. I think the consensus might be longer, but a month is certainly too short. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:07, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>I Disagree. The site has been quoted in a number of major metropolitan newspapers (check the talk page for references), and has been frequented by high-profile politicians, as well as a number of journalists. It is quoted and referenced in a number of print magazines and video media such as Newsrail. Furthermore, they serve as a portal and hosting service for a significant number of volunteer and tourist operations including a number that are supported by Federal Government. The site is also referenced a number of times for tourist information on various state government tourism websites. Also, a number of wikipedia articles take data from railpage, as well as link to it. Are these third-party sources?</li>

"There are many more than a few. With up to 20 new members a day, Railpage has 10,000 registered users and boasts more than 500,000 posted articles." among other mentions. It was considered first on the list of notable Rail websites in Australia.</li>

<dd>Bear in mind we're talking GUIDELINES for notability. But still, look at the opening lines of Notability(Web) "Internet guides. Wikipedia articles should not exist only to describe the nature, appearance or services a website offers, but should describe the site in an encyclopedic manner, offering detail on a website's achievements, impact or historical significance, which can be significantly more up-to-date than most reference sources since we can incorporate new developments and facts as they are made known. See current events for examples". The Railpage Australia article describes the nature, appearance, and services the website offers. It goes further to detail some of the site's achievements (which can be added to by the looks here), it looks at the site's impact on the Railfan community, and touches on its historical significance (which can also be added to looking at the talk page). This article clearly is in the spirit of Notability(Web). It has been shown that the site is of significance due to its historical significance of internet in Australia. It has also been proven to be used as sources for major news outlets as well as government and a variety of print and radio media. Contributors also remember a number of print articles (which are unfortunately no longer available online) where the site itself was the subject. So, we see that content from the site is being used in reliable, well-known third-party publications - which makes it fit Criteria 3 of Notability.</dd>

<li>Do you really think that you can make such a blatant mis-statement and get away with it? To be "quoted" or "mentioned" in a seniors site or a site of railway links does not constitute notability: note the criteria for notability - "being the <b>subject</b> (and not mentioned in passing) of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself.". Please point to non-trivial, reliable published sources in which Railpage is the <b>subject</b> of an article, and not simply mentioned in a single line or paragraph. Your fondness for contributing things that are patently false is well-known, please refrain from this passion of yours in this case.</li>

<li>Wikipedia is not the place to advertise, and this article doesn't read like an advertisement. Notability(Web) says: "Internet guides. Wikipedia articles should not exist only to describe the nature, appearance or services a website offers, but should describe the site in an encyclopedic manner, offering detail on a website's achievements, impact or historical significance", which this article clearly does. If there are ciation problems, these are soemthing that need to be edited to fix (citations provided), not have the article deleted. In future, please refrain from trying to suggest NPOV violation when YOU don't like the site in question. Your campaign of vandalism of the article does little to improve your character. Your suggestions on the James Morgan section were irrelevant and poorly considered - and despite two administrators and countless others telling you so, you continued to persist with this petty smear campaign. I suggest that it may be time for you to take a step back from the article, for it is you that refuses to come to consensus, and you who is intent on defacing the article.

<p><b>Keep</b>. With a website the size of this one, it is very difficult to find "third party" sources that are not directly involved (as I am). It appears that the push for deletion is coming from a (?)small group of former or disaffected members. The simple truth is that Railpage is the first stop for almost everyone seeking information about Australian railways, and this is reason enough for keeping the entry live.Latrodectus 14:58, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Delete.</b> Correction, I think one arbitrator disagreed with the subject, the other approached it from a neutral point of view and locked discussion with the subject material in place.</p>
<p>The incident was newsworthy being printed in an article in the Herald Sun. His actions were never properly explained, and there were calls for him to be removed at the time. <a href="http://http://www.railpage.com.au/f-t8839-0-asc-s30+crawford+busted.htm" class="external text" title="http://http://www.railpage.com.au/f-t8839-0-asc-s30+crawford+busted.htm" rel="nofollow">crawford+busted</a></p>
<p>I'll again use the comparision, if an leading individual of a company that featured an article here on Wikipedia was accused or convicted of a crime associated with his role at the company, the company of course would not condone the crime, but mention of that accused actions (even if found not guilty) if it was recorded in the mainstream printed media and the boards subsequent refusal to sack or reprimand the individual or publicly distance itself would surely rate a mention within that wikipedia article on that company.</p>
<p>Even if some people find mentioning his name objectional, It is my opinion that there should be some mention of this "small" "social controversy". Wikipedia has allowed mention the mention of "controversies" elsewhere - see Post-match "handbag incident". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Super_14_Final" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Super_14_Final" rel="nofollow">Super_14_Final</a>.</p>
<p>I fear there will never be any consensus to any proposed changes even if there is only just a passing mention in the article of the "incident".</p>
<p>I did propose Arbitration, however others have proposed for reasons already indicated (uncited material, etc) that the article is a candiate for deletion.</p>

<dd>That's one problem. There's been no evidence tendered here to show that his alleged crime had anything to do with his role with Railpage.</dd>
<dd><span style="background:#B0ffff;">His actions were never properly explained...</span></dd>
<dd>I presume that his actions were explained to the court, and I further presume that you are claiming that his actions were never properly explained on, say, Railpage. But you've never properly explained why they should be.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the site is one of the world's biggest rail enthusiast websites and the biggest in Australia, I should think; it has been up and running a long time as well. I did a Factiva search and it came up with only a couple of useful links, but RP has been involved in the production of a national rail map, etc; it hosts and helps run the websites of a number of notable rail heritage groups. It's even being quoted on rail incidents - an article in the West Australian newspaper about a prang between two railcars in <a href="../../../t/r/a/TransPerth_4367.html" title="TransPerth">TransPerth</a>'s depot quoted Railpage as a reliable source! The original versions of the page were quite bad and needed sourcing, but when I asked the contributors they did so and would probably be happy to source the page again if needed. The incident in question with the Railpage moderator was mentioned on Rove Live. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 00:53, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Its history as an early Australian website makes it notable, and the reliable sources that have beeb provide <b>do</b> count, and more are being brought to this Afd. For example, the abc article is talking about the St Kilda Tramway Museum, which is hosted online by Railpage at <a href="http://www.railpage.org.au/aetmsa/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.railpage.org.au/aetmsa/" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>. The article needs to move from a focus about the equipment to being about the "society", its history and relevance to the community; e.g. list its activities like previous meets. Also, from what I read on the aus.rail newsgroup, it seems like there have been server issues, so if <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> can be found, or it can be phrased carefully, I think it is worth mentioning. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 01:07, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>my intention in posting the proposed article "the wind up" is that it is NOT a neologism but a widely if infrequently used expression in British fiction (possibly also biography?) during the 20th century. I have seen it often, understood its meaning eventually from context, and often wondered where it came from and it more precise meaning. I have not found it in encyclopeadias or dictionaries uncluding the shorter oxford english dictionary. There are three rather obique references in wikipedia that do not help to understand the aspect I wanted to know. I hoped by posting what I know as an article to elicite a response from someone more knowledgeable than myself to calarify the useage. I think it would be a pity to delete it since I am sure others may wonder at its use, especially as there is now a resurgence in interest in books by sayers, shute, christie and many british mystery writers of the last century. I request indulgence to keep it and see whst is added when others, especilly british people more familiar with the phrase, edit the article. Alan Pooley, avid reader.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - In my opinion, this is an odd edge case. If you google InSORS, you'll get in excess of 40 thousand hits, all of which are talking about the company. If you check the links out, they usually contain just an off-hand reference or paragraph about the software. Examples: <a href="http://www.cse.unr.edu/agn_videoconferencing.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cse.unr.edu/agn_videoconferencing.html" rel="nofollow">University of Nevada</a>, <a href="http://www.accessgrid.surrey.ac.uk/HowtoGuides/HowtoBookandUseAccessGrid/tabid/56/Default.aspx" class="external text" title="http://www.accessgrid.surrey.ac.uk/HowtoGuides/HowtoBookandUseAccessGrid/tabid/56/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">University of Surrey</a>. But no-one's saying much about the company itself. They're just mentioning that, yes, they use the software for video teleconferencing and yes, they like it. I think rational argument can be made either way, but I'm siding with keep. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Croy_275f.html" title="User:Chris Croy">Chris Croy</a> 00:18, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - a quick search for "lipid hypothesis" on <a href="../../../p/u/b/PubMed_05d8.html" title="PubMed">PubMed</a> brings up 70+ scientific publications and reviews, including a mention that the lipid hypothesis was proposed over 100 years ago, so surely there's some content that could be contributed here, both from a historical standpoint as well as scientific discussion. - <a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETameeria_af89.html" title="User:Tameeria">tameeria</a> 05:02, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Except it has practically ceased being a hypothesis. The average cardiovascular paper treats it as established fact. Only the opponents still refer to it as a theory (compare "theory of evolution", which is really only called a "theory" by its opponents). The average animal study uses ApoE knockout mice, giving them very high cholesterol levels and accelerated atherosclerosis. The premise that underlies this is not questioned anymore. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 19:42, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Just because it has ceased being a hypothesis doesn't mean though that it never existed. A search on "lipid hypothesis" brings up 16,000 Google hits with the thincs page being the top hit. A couple of the pages I've clicked through are full of factual errors and misinformation. I think having a page explaining the "lipid hypothesis" and the surrounding controversy in a NPOV manner would be beneficial for those seeking unbiased information on the topic. It certainly has some interest in a historical sense and as a case study of testing a scientific hypothesis and the type of criticism medical research might have to overcome even in the modern world. - <a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETameeria_af89.html" title="User:Tameeria">tameeria</a> 21:00, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> as I've rewritten it to be about the term in neutral fashion. I agree with MastCell that we shouldn't present the dominant scientific view as an unproven conjecture. We can, however, report facts about opinions, including the fact that the dominant view is considered by some to be an unproven conjecture. This term has enough currency that some people might encounter it and want to know what it means. As with other such nonneutral terms, however (see <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chickenhawk_%28politics%29.html" title="Chickenhawk (politics)">Chickenhawk (politics)</a> for an example), our article needs to characterize the term as stemming from a particular POV. We should not implicitly accept that POV, as the previous version did. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 11:01, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

The expansion you made simply emphasises the point as made by the opponents, and actually just proves my point (that the three premises attacked by THINCS and their friends need to be examined together with the enormous mounds of evidence in favour of the "hypothesis"). <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 19:42, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: An article about one aspect of one viewpoint will, to some extent, emphasize that viewpoint. For example, we have a separate article on <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Earth_creationism_db9a.html" title="Young Earth creationism">Young Earth creationism</a>. It states that mainstream science rejects creationism but doesn't go into detail about the evidence favoring evolution. Noting the rejection by mainstream science conforms to the policy of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> that we state facts about opinions. In my rewrite of <a href="../../../l/i/p/Lipid_hypothesis.html" title="Lipid hypothesis">Lipid hypothesis</a>, I stated that the opinion underlying the use of the phrase is not the generally accepted one. Perhaps that point should be amplified? I don't think this article is the best place to put the whole discussion of the enormous mounds of evidence, but the article might be augmented by a citation to a source saying what you say (and what I believe to be true), namely that this phrase is the terminology of the opposition and that the scientific consensus is to the contrary. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 20:50, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>So call it "criticism of the lipid hypothesis".

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Now I'm confused about your position. If it became an article on "Criticism of the lipid hypothesis", then it would logically have to expand on the criticism, present the evidence cited by the skeptics, etc. Going that route would mean that it would indeed turn into a POV fork. It would become the THINCS version of the cholesterol article. I think it's better to keep the article but limit it to being about the term, not the concept. I included the quotation to illustrate the POV of those who use the term, not to start a full-blown discussion of the pros and cons. The latest rewrite by tameeria has a lot of useful information about the pros and cons, but I don't think this article is the right place for that. It's better for this article to stick to the two main points about the term "lipid hypothesis": which hypothesis is meant, and the use of the term by THINCS et al. to convey a POV. Most of the rewritten version should be moved somewhere else, possibly <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypercholesterolemia.html" title="Hypercholesterolemia">Hypercholesterolemia</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not against handling the minority position in one or both of those articles. Many readers, though, will already be familiar with the general subject matter; all they need to know is what hypothesis about lipids is being referred to with this specific phrase. An article that simply tells them that, with wikilinks to the other articles you mention, is more useful than a redirect. The previous version was something of a POV fork, but I believe the rewrite is NPOV. It doesn't address the same subject from a different viewpoint, but instead neutrally addresses one narrow aspect of the whole subject, namely this particular phrase. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 18:46, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - the two external references show that this individual has been the subject of multiple non-trivial coverage in independent sources, which establishes notability per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (although more sources are ideally needed). I'm also not comfortable with the description of any page which presents negative coverage of an individual as an "attack page" (see my comments at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Amir_Massoud_Tofangsazan_%282nd_nomination%29_1cb7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Amir Massoud Tofangsazan (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Amir Massoud Tofangsazan (2nd nomination)</a>). Although this article may need to be NPOV'd, any article which cites sources and consists of verifiable fact is, <i>ipso facto</i>, not an attack page. CSD G10 is designed to provide a quick way of removing libellous and patently untrue attacks (e.g. "John Q. Doe is an imbecile") and doesn't apply to cases like this. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89"><font color="purple"><b>Wal</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/a/l/User_talk%7EWalton_monarchist89_7ca3.html" title="User talk:Walton monarchist89"><font color="silver"><b>ton</b></font></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/WP%7EBRoy_e296.html" title="WP:BRoy"><font color="purple">Vivat Regina!</font></a></sup></small></font> 20:23, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Googled and found over 9000 hits for this individual, including several stories inthe New York Times of which I added 2. These multiple reliable and independent sources support notability and verifiability of this individuals notability springing from what was a much discussed international incident of friendly fire during a war. Any facts in the article must be well sourced, such as the results of military proceedings. A good article consistent with Wikipolicies on coverage of living persons is quite possible. As for the article being an attac on the officer, see <a href="../../../r/e/s/Res_ipsa_loquitur.html" title="Res ipsa loquitur">Res ipsa loquitur</a>. That said, I would not object to a merger of the several articles into one well written article on the incident, just as the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panay_incident.html" title="Panay incident">Panay incident</a> does not have articles for all the attackers and attacked in that peacetime attack. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 22:44, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> He along with Umbach are the principle parties to this event, and so the article is justified. It makes sense to merge articles on the victims into the main article, but the killers have a claim to notoriety. This is not BLP, as the case was adjudicated. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:25, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per the sources added and the already existing sources that establish notability. As for being an "attack page", the article is actually very fair in its presentation of the material (presenting both accusations against the individual and his defence of his action). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:54, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, though I'd support merging it as well, if only to make it easier for the casual reader hoping to learn about the incident. - <a href="../../../m/o/c/User%7EMocko13_549e.html" title="User:Mocko13">Mocko13</a> 01:38, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep/Cleanup/Merge?</b> Certainly is notable event but I share the nominator's reservations about the tone of the page.

<li><b>Delete</b> as NN. The overwhelming claim to notability is patently wrong. He was NOT a member of the Plastic Ono Band--at least, I can't find him on any discography. He may, however, have been a member of David Peel's band, which recorded "The Pope Smokes Dope". This album is documented as having been <i>produced</i> by Lennon and Ono, which is a far cry from the claimed connection. He seems to have been making this claim for a while, on mySpace, etc. To his credit, the WP article on <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plastic_Ono_Band_91d5.html" title="Plastic Ono Band">Plastic Ono Band</a> says: "Its credo of <i>YOU are The Plastic Ono Band</i> implied that everyone was part of the group. In actual fact, The Plastic Ono Band was an identity to describe works by Lennon and Ono and whoever happened to be performing with them." So maybe he's taking advantage of that vagueness. However, the standard notion of "band" and "member" should apply--i.e., someone who recorded and/or toured as a credited part of a performing ensemble. He doesn't make that cut. -- <font face="georgia, times, times roman" color="#990000" size="-3"><a href="../../../p/l/e/User%7EPleather_9646.html" title="User:Pleather">P L E A T H E R</a></font> <font face="arial, helvetica" size="1"><sub><a href="../../../p/l/e/User_talk%7EPleather_f2a9.html" title="User talk:Pleather">talk</a></sub></font> 00:06, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Black Falcon already said why. Otto4711's idea that AfD is how we "hash out" what's wrong with an article does not follow our policies/guidelines/essays.

<li>Er, I didn't say that AFD is for hashing out what's wrong with an article.

<li>I'm sorry if that assessment of your recent debating style hurt your feelings, but I'm afraid that I agree with it too. All too much of your "reasoning" when arguing to delete these many articles has seemed according to your personal feelings rather than Wikipedia policy, and your personal feelings do seem to be heavily against "list" and "popular culture" articles. Plus, you do bring up a lot of flaws in articles that are not deletion criteria. A film list with a few erroneously listed films does not need to be deleted for that reason alone, nor does an article need to be deleted simply because the introductory paragraph is an abomination of bad grammar and unsourced assumptions. Please try not to bring up everything that is wrong with an article during an AfD; try to stick to problems that actually meet (or come close to meeting) deletion criteria. AfD is not the right place to discuss fixing an article unless the flaws are inherently something close to deletable level. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 03:56, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It has nothing to do with "hurting my feelings." I did not say one word about my "feelings" and I have to wonder if your bringing "feelings" into this is an honest misreading of my comments or another in your long string of questionable comments in response to these recent AFDs. It has everything to do with not misrepresenting my words. Why you are bringing up the idea of deleting articles because of such things as bad grammar is a mystery, because I did not suggest that this article be deleted for bad grammar or for any other reasons of style. I nominated this article for exactly the reasons I stated, so it would probably be more helpful, not to mention refreshingly honest on your part, to respond to the things I actually wrote instead of responding to phantom allegations that were never made. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:01, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>In your recent mass AfD of many articles, aimed especially at "list" and "pop culture" list-like articles, you've mostly (but not entirely) argued according to small flaws and also used emotionally-charged language and personal opinions in many cases instead of using actual reasons from <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> that an article should be deleted. In saying that I hoped I wasn't hurting your feelings, I was trying to be polite, that was just a polite opening sentence because you already seemed quite worked up and I knew I'd go on to say some things that would sound less than flattering. It has nothing to do with my later statement that you keep bringing up criteria that are not deletion criteria, but rather wanting to delete articles according to your own personal feelings and interests. Trying to conflate those statements together makes it seem as if you aren't really paying attention when you read (something I'm beginning more and more to suspect is true of you) or that you're insistent on trying to <a href="../../../o/b/f/Obfuscation.html" title="Obfuscation">obfuscate</a> my points. As to the fact that you seem to be anti-list, your own statements on many of these AfDs support that, as does the fact that nearly everything you nominated was a list. I've asked you before, and I'll ask you here again, two questions. (1) Can you point out any instances in which you've voted in favor of keeping a list? (if you're afraid I'll miss your reply, you can drop a note on my talk page) and (2) If you want to continue calling me a liar instead of addressing the points I've brought up, will you please put your future accusations on my talk page? It really clutters up these AfDs. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 01:24, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, in the recent mass AFD of many articles, I pointed to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and in some cases noted <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. I'm not sure why exactly you continue to try to misrepresent these nominations. As for your false claim that I am not citing actual deletion policy, I refer you to the chart at the policy page you linked entitled <b>Problem articles where deletion may be needed</b>. If you look at the very first box it states quite clearly that for articles in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> the solution is to prod them or AFD them. I have acted entirely in line with Wikipedia policy, including the deletion policy, and for you to say otherwise is untrue. As for whether I'm paying attention, I'm not the one who voted on the athletes in film article without realizing what the article actually was. As for trying to obfuscate your points, I find that accusation laughable in the face of your repoeated distortions and untruths. As for whether I've voted in favor of keeping a list, the three-part answer is 1) whether I have or not is irrelevant, 2) <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_adaptations_of_The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray_165c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of adaptations of The Picture of Dorian Gray">yes I have</a> and 3) not only have I voted in favor of lists, I've even created some. As for calling you on your lies, no, I'll continue to do so where you lie. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:58, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not claiming that you never cite Wikipedia deletion criteria policy. You usually have some sort of nod to deletion criteria policy in the canned phrase that you typically used on most of these mass AfD nominations, but then (except on those articles where the policy concern cited really applied) you typically have a flood of editors who agree that the policy you've cited simply doesn't apply to that article, at which point you tend to bring up every little flaw the article has or could have in the future, flaws that are not deletion criteria themselves, and then you try to argue that the article should be deleted on the basis of those flaws. The most obvious point raised in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia deletion policy</a> is that normal editing concerns are not deletion criteria. That's why I keep telling you to stick to deletion criteria and use <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia deletion policy</a> instead of your personal dislikes. You should also note that I don't use emotionally-charged language such as "liar" to apply to you, despite that you keep seriously misunderstanding what I've said even when I've been quite plain. Instead, I point out the flaws in your tactics, and I sometimes call you "impatient" or "hasty" instead of saying that you are trying to cause trouble on purpose. Thus, I tend to describe you in <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_faith_4adf.html" title="Wikipedia:Good faith">good faith</a> terms, as if you have done various things through accident, or through a genuine misunderstanding. In asking you to resrict the name-calling to my talk page, I was trying to keep all these AfD debates from being flamed. You can attempt to illustrate flaws in my arguments without resorting to such strong language. Please, if you cannot stay civil, I may eventually start assuming <a href="../../../b/a/d/Wikipedia%7EBad_faith_5b43.html" title="Wikipedia:Bad faith">Wikipedia:Bad faith</a> on your part, as some others have already been leaning towards, but I'd rather not do that. If you think that it's so obvious that I've described you as doing something you're not, you can let others judge on their own (your statements above are plain for all to see) or you can use less emotionally-loaded language such as "Mermaid from the Baltic Sea is not describing my actions as I see them, in fact I think that what I did was ....". Please do stop it with the name-calling. The term "liar" is especially offensive. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 18:31, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm sorry if being called on your statements hurts your feelings. And I'm sorry if you choose to interpret nominating multiple articles with the same problems with the same or similar language as "canned responses." As for assuming bad faith, it's pretty clear from a number of your comments that you already do, which is fine by me because I know it's not true. And there is really no need for you to keep linking to the deletion policy. I have read it, and it says right on it in big ol' English words that the solution to articles which fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is to prod them or AFD them. I don't nominate articles by accident, I don't do it out of "misunderstanding," I do not make nominations based on what I do or don't "like" and I don't do it to solve editing problems. Your constant insistence that I do has gone past the point of being tiresome. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:02, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - for all the same reasons that Category:Fictional narcissists was <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_discussion_Log_2007_January_18_5405.html#Category:Fictional_narcissists" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2007 January 18">deleted</a>. The list is hopelessly subjective and requires editors to impose their POV in deciding who to list and who not to. The introduction to the article is a great indicator of why it should be deleted: "This article comprises a list of fictional characters who may be consider[ed] to be narcissists." Considered by whom, under what criteria? The list is indiscriminate and constitutes an improper loose association based on a character trait that the members may or may not share in common according to the interpretation of any particular editor. And for good measure, no sources, reliable or otherwise. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:28, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree that this version of the list is subjective, unverified, and so on. However, the concept of the list itself is not. It requires no POV or OR from editors if the requirement where that it list only characters who are described as narcissists by themselves, other fictional characters, their creators, reviewers, or in some other published, reliable source. I will withhold suggesting keeping or deletion until I can further consider the feasibility of creating such a list. I strongly disagree that psychological conditions among fictional characters (or among individuals) constitutes a loose association (any more than nationality, for instance). If the article is deleted, I strongly urge deletion to be <i>without prejudice to future recreation</i>. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:01, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I understand your sentiment here, but the problem I see with it is that we're not dealing with articles as they might be, or could be, or should be, but articles as they are. See for example the AFDs for Lothlórien Co-op. It was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lothl%C3%B3rien_Co-op_2a0c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lothlórien Co-op">kept</a> the first time largely on the strength of what the keepers said the article could become. Two months later, no one who argued to keep it had touched the article and the article was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lothl%C3%B3rien_Co-op_%282nd_nomination%29_8bfe.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lothlórien Co-op (2nd nomination)">deleted</a> and the people who wanted it kept the first time didn't even show up to defend it. More recently see the closing statement for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Swastikas_in_popular_culture_3716.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Swastikas in popular culture">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Swastikas in popular culture</a> which pretty clearly rejects the "can be cleaned up" argument as a reason for keeping. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:59, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry, but I must again strongly disagree. if we require immediate perfection of all articles, Wikipedia would quickly become a passing fad, as <i>every</i> new article (and almost all old ones) would be throttled like infants in a crib. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:32, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see the words "immediate perfection" anywhere in any statement that I've ever made regarding any article on Wikipedia ever. I would never demand immediate perfection from an article and your claiming that I did or would is a misrepresentation of my statements. What I am saying is that <i>if</i> an article is hopelessly flawed <i>as is</i> it should not be kept on the basis of "it can be worked on." (and please don't respond by saying that you don't agree <i>this</i> article is hopelessly flawed because I am speaking in general terms) <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:07, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The let us speak in general terms. If we are dealing <i>only</i> with articles "as they are", that is the equivalent of requiring immediate quality (alright, perfection was an overstatement). We should not only consider how an article looks <i>now</i>, but what potential it has for improvement. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:26, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> because I don't see why the reason given for deletion applies to this situation. Furthermore, if the article is flawed, that's what cleanup tags are for! Deletion is indeed for when the CONCEPT of the article is flawed, not for when the article itself has some bad entries. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 04:26, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> As with nom, I just see the application of the concept "narcissist" to be dependent on one's own POV rendering it largely unverifiable. I don't really consider this to be encyclopaedic. I don't feel this article corresponds closely to the article on Narcissits. In fact, using the dictionary definition of "narcissism" I would be inclined to remove several "fictional narcissists" from this list. <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuriel1981_fc18.html" title="User:Suriel1981">Suriel1981</a> 10:52, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Things that are notable within the "wrestling community" are not always notable for an encyclopedia. And I didn't say that the website wasn't notable (although it barely is), it's just that owning or being a webmaster of a site does not always promise notability. I find your comment to be lacking and we need to get the wrestlecruft out of here. He's just a nn indy manager who wrote a few low-selling books (in terms of book selling in general, not a few hundred wrestling fans) and has a barely notable website. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 03:45, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The I guess I should really make myself clear. I threw the website in as a bonus to emphasize that he is notable, but the book alone, in my opinion, makes him notable. The Death of WCW is brought up on numerous shows and publications that discuss pro wrestling as an example of how not to run a wrestling company. That fact makes it much more notable than anything Scott Keith has written, none of which have the same standing amongst those reporting on the workings of pro wrestling. Dave Meltzer is the most noteworthy of those who use it as an example. It is a significant enough piece of work, that it is VERY notable and as such the author is notable as well. I never said that he was very, or extremely notable, in fact I stated that he is barely notable under Wikipedia standards. However, someone who is barely notable is still notable. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Day_d3f3.html" title="User:Stephen Day">Stephen Day</a> 04:40, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> I googled this too and found no trouble locating many non-trivial sources that refer directly to this practice. I've added a few of these references. The subject is both notable and of considerable scientific merit. The article needs to be cleaned up and wikified, not deleted.

<li>Well, thanks for providing more sources, but 'Speedy keep' would imply an erroneous or bad faith nomination for the deletion this article submitted by Advance Sowers. As I tried to indicate above, I am open to revise my opinion, but would put a great emphasis on sources independent from the inventor and more than mentioning of a case study. And when the one independent review says, that "cs15 uses what he calls 'advance sowing'", we do not seem to have a common definition or a mulitple use of the same sowing method. --<a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikiwont_2b2d.html" title="User:Tikiwont">Tikiwont</a> 09:59, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're welcome...I've added three more and could easily keep going. I did not intend to imply a bad faith nomination, but I do believe this is an erroneous nomination. There is a single inventor for this process, but the references to him and the method are numerous and non-trivial, including the ABC and several government publications. In addition, reference to this method spans over a decade...not simply an 'interesting case study.' The google hits are clearly referring to the same technique and many also refer directly to the farmer who invented the technique.

<li>Well, time spans in agriculture are long and it would have been useful if the nominated article had already inlcuded a clearer common understanding of the term which I've now tried to add msyelf.

<li><b>delete</b> The principal claims to N is that he is a member of the board of governors of the Chicago Board of Realtors, and President of the Illinois chapter of the American Guild of Appraisers. This is very weak. Had he been president of the Chicago B of R, or held national office in a less well-known group, then he would be notable.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Please forgive me, but I'm brand new at writing articles for insertion. Yes, RC is a very accomplished appraiser, but his "importance" lies in his volunteer efforts in which he has served as a key player in the legislation of real estate appraisers on the state and national levels to protect the 'good of the general public' since the mid-1980s - which started with the federal bailout of S&amp;Ls in the late 1980s (cost taxpayers billions of dollars)and the current mortgage fraud activities (also costing billions of dollars). Unfortunately, there's very little info in Wikipedia (at this time) that I can cross-link to regarding the appraisal profession and the banking industry, such as "The Appraisal Foundation" and the "Appraisal Institute" (two articles that I have recently entered). Any advice would be greatly appraciated. <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrommeyer_cf66.html" title="User:Frommeyer">Frommeyer</a> 16:51, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This is precisely why <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> is a problem; someone close to the subject may have an inflated view of the subject's importance. If Gorman was important and a "key player", then <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">secondary sources</a> will have written about him, saying "Gorman was a key player" and so forth. Obviously the bailout and fraud were <b>themselves</b> important, but appraisal was one small part of those important stories, and legislation changes were a yet smaller part, and if Gorman was not a notable -- i.e. noted in secondary sources -- instigator, it really doesn't suggest that his importance in this small part of a larger story has been as critical as you imagine. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 00:30, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> RJ is another matter than his son. RJ is a major civil rights attorney with a long reputation and participation in many historic events. The article is specifically given as a beginning, and should not be deleted unless it is clear that there will not be enough to prove N and V-- and we have at least 2 good ones here. His key cases have not yet been added, but they will--an indication of them can be seen in the obits cited., which are from reputable newspapers. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:32, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The case he won was before the Illinois Supreme Court, not the US Supreme Court.

The case may have had repercussions in Illinois but this is a weak case for notability and no other major legal accomplishments are cited.

<li><b>Your Help Please</b> I fully understand the need for editors to check &amp; verify facts. I have a link to a PDF file of a six (6) page feature article about the Roy Eaton case (he spent 16 years in prison for a crime he did not commit) that was in the Saturday Evening Post in 1956. Can I put a link to this article on the RJ page for you check? Right now, I suspect that it would / could / might be more appropreate within it's own "People vs Roy Eaton" article? Likewise, I suspect that the NBC's 1957 television documentary "Error in Judgement" requires its own seperate Wikipedia article that can be linked to from RJ's page?

Eaton is notable, having been the subject of a TV documentary, and it might be appropriate to include some detail of Gorman's biography there as Eaton's attorney, but I don't think a standalone article on Gorman is appropriate based on the lack of notability in his own right. --<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 22:09, 28 February 2007 (UTC) and revised by <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 01:30, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>According to a Chicago Daily Tribune article from 1960, Eaton received $48,000.00 through legislative enactment in 1957, paid $16,000.00 of it to Gorman (so much for the <i>pro bono</i> stories) and had spent the balance by 1960, when he was arrested for drunkenness and jailed because he didn't have the $23.00 in fines and court costs. Sad. --<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 01:38, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed, but probably inevitable. To clarify from what I understand, Gorman was asked to be an <i>amicus curiae</i> by the state judge in the case, in an era before Miranda and widespread public defenders, somewhat unusual. He then pursued a civil suit on Eaton's behalf which is where the settlement came from. In any event, I wish this were a bit more notable, because it is interesting.--<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 09:05, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem is we have to be careful not to confound topics. Just because a person is involved in something notable does not make the person notable in his or her own right. The SEP article and TV special are about Roy Eaton's situation, with only passing mentions of Gorman because of his connection to Eaton. I think that Eaton is notable (and interesting, btw) and may merit a Wikipedia article. That does not mean that Eaton's <i>attorney</i> should have a self-standing article. --<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 18:03, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> That's true, but it seems that Gorman has has more than his 10 year involement (1946-1956) with Eaton before he was released from prison in 1956. Afterward, he won (as a seperate notable case) the 1st payment for a wrongful conviction case in Illinois in 1957. Then, during the 60s and 70s, I think his 95% success record in defending 19 of 20 conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War is notable. That's three seperate notable items that have been referenced so far. <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrommeyer_cf66.html" title="User:Frommeyer">Frommeyer</a> 15:03, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. None of you have any good reasons. US federal and local jurisdictiosns will designate ALL public roads with a number, therefore not all numbered roads are automatically notable. A lot of roads are being improved all over the country as we speak, so expansion or cleanup does not make roads more notable. There are hundreds of state highways, but not all are special. Probably no road would be as notorious as Rt. 66, but why is RI Rt. 11 notable? Why should we remember this road? Does it lead to somewhere special? Was it built for alterior motives like the Autobahn? Did the developers have to kill a few thousand people to build this road?

<li><b>Comment</b> Under the argument that was put forth above (and seconded many times) It seems that any road anywhere in the world should be notable -- or at least any road with a number. I am curious if the people who support this line of reasoning think it only applies to American roads, or if it should be true for foreign country's as well. Should there be pages for Moroccan: A1, N1, 2301, and 8202 through <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larache.html" title="Larache">Larache</a>; N2, N13, P39, and 410 through Derdara; French E70, A72, D10, D3, D8, D88, N88, N488, D201, D3, N498, D11, and N82 through Saint-Ettiene; and what about 302, 315, 494, 308, 58, 314, 197, 284, PA, IC, 41, and 320 through some city in Japan (google maps uses kanji for the city names for some reason)? My point is there are a <i>lot</i> of streets in the world. They are not all notable. At some level we need to decide whether wikipedia <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">is</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">is not</a> a road atlas. --<b><a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/l/User_talk%7ESelket_51a5.html" title="User talk:Selket">Talk</a></sup> 05:37, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, all those routes are potentially notable if someone takes the time to research them and write a full-length article, as those countries have decided to include them in their primary highway networks. The fact that the English Wikipedia is skewered towards United States highways is inevitable given there aren't as many Wikipedia editors in rural Morocco.

<li>As there have now been two independent suggestions that I nominated these articles in bad faith, I feel the need to address them. I came across these articles because I was trying to clear <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArticles_to_be_merged_since_April_2006_94f5.html" title="Category:Articles to be merged since April 2006">Category:Articles to be merged since April 2006</a> -- not because of some vendetta I have against roads. These articles contained little content and no assertion of notability beyond the implied assertion, which has been raised here, of a number being assigned to them. I did a google search (for example <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=lrS&amp;q=Rhode+Island+Route+11+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=lrS&amp;q=Rhode+Island+Route+11+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Rhode Island Route 11 -wikipedia</a>) and found no relevant pages that satisfied <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> in my opinion. <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> does not have a special section for roads and does not link to <a href="../../../u/s/r/WP%7EUSRD_P_fd18.html" title="WP:USRD/P">WP:USRD/P</a>, which, as I understand it, is not a policy. Please correct me if I'm wrong on that last point, but it appears to be maintained by a small group of the same users who are now accusing me of bad faith nominations and violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.

<p>I am re-creating this discussion for the deletion of the article latin metal for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This page is only a sentence and a list. The sentence could easily be debated and the list is very short.</li>
<li>There are no sources.</li>
<li>There are only three articles that link to latin metal. Eleven months after its creation, I think it shows that this article is not necessary for the encyclopedia.</li>
<li>There are only ten bands in the list of bands. I do not think that a musical genre with only 10 acts is notable enough to be on Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Those ten bands are very loosely connected. Some bands are <a href="../../../n/u/_/Nu_metal.html" title="Nu metal">nu metal</a>, others are <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_punk.html" title="Hardcore punk">hardcore punk</a>, others are <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_metal.html" title="Industrial metal">industrial metal</a>, others are <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_metal.html" title="Death metal">death metal</a>, others are <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grindcore.html" title="Grindcore">grindcore</a>, and others are <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrash_metal.html" title="Thrash metal">thrash metal</a>. If latin metal was such a big musical genre, the bands included in the genre would be somehow connected, in a similar way that <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_metal.html" title="Black metal">black metal</a> acts are.</li>
<li>I did my litte investigation on the subject:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If one was to type "<i>Latin</i>" on <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Metallum_0a26.html" title="Encyclopaedia Metallum">Encyclopaedia Metallum</a> in the "<i>Musical genre</i>" category, there are zero results to show. For those who are wondering, Encyclopaedia Metallum does not make users pick from a list of genres when they are adding a band, they have to type a genre description themselves.</li>
<li>There are no pages on <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockdetector.html" title="Rockdetector">Rockdetector</a> that talk about "latin metal".</li>
<li>If one was to type "<i>Latin metal</i>" on Google, there would be <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22latin+metal%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22latin+metal%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">36 400 results</a>.</li>
<li>However, many of these results have actually nothing to do with the subject. They consist of lists of styles who generally list the "<i>Latin</i>" musical style just before the "<i>Metal</i>" musical genre (alphabetical order). You can see it clearly <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=latin+metal&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=wikipedia+ill+nino+soulfly&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=latin+metal&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=wikipedia+ill+nino+soulfly&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">here</a> and on the previous Google link (6th, 7th, and 9th results on the first page). It generally is something like "<i>...Hip Hop/Rap, Jazz, <b>Latin, Metal,</b> Rock, ...</i>"</li>
<li>Many of the pages are pages that are copying <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>'s information (Answers.com for example). One of those results is the third result when typing "latin metal".</li>
<li>If we are to take off "<i>Jazz</i>" and "<i>Wikipedia</i>" from the research, in order to take off all search results that come from Wikipedia or style lists, we are left with: <b><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22latin+metal%22+-jazz+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22latin+metal%22+-jazz+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">967 results!!!</a></b>. I don't think that with less than a thousand GHits this subject is notable enough to be included on Wikipedia.</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. 967 Ghits isn't bad, considering, but this genre can't seen to make up its mind what it is. Apart from the article's definition, there also appears to be one that claims Latin Metal is "played by metal bands with Latino members". It's not much of a genre if it's vaguely defined. <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 00:42, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If we were to consider which results among those remaining 967 GHits actually talk about latin metal, there would be actually less than 967 since there are still some results that are style lists (third result on the last link I put up, for example). After taking off words from the search that often came up in style lists (jazz, indie, urban, rap, electronic), we are left with: <b><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22latin+metal%22+-jazz+-wikipedia+-indie+-urban+-rap+-electronic&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22latin+metal%22+-jazz+-wikipedia+-indie+-urban+-rap+-electronic&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">658 results</a></b> and there are still more style lists (8th and 9th results, for example).
