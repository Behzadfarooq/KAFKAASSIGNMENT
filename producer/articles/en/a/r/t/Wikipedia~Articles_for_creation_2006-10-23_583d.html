<p>Albert Tillman (January 16, 1928 - January 16, 2004) is regarded as the "Father of Scuba Diving Education."</p>
<p>Early Life: Albert Tillman was born in Los Angeles, California in 1928. He was the second son of Peter and Edith Tillman. Peter was the Captain of the MGM Studios police force and much of Albert's childhood was spent on the MGM lot where manyh in his family worked.</p>
<p>In 1938, at the age of ten, Tillman received a pair of goggles from a friend. He took these goggles down to the pier at Redondo Beach, California and jumped in while his parents enjoyed the beach. This first glance under the surface led to a 66 year love affair of the ocean world. He bacame an avid free diver in his teens and twenties and got to experience the waters of the world during the tail end of WWII as a Pharmacist's Mate in the US Coast Guard.</p>
<p>When Albert Returned from the Pacific after the war he entered the University of Southern California as a Political Science Major. He played football for the Trojans and earned money for tuition wrestling on KTLA television. During all this time he was an active free diver and was fortunate to hone is free diving skills by befriending a group of Japenese men that had learned traditional breath holding techniques from their families.</p>
<p>After College: After graduation with a degree in Political Science Tillman went to work for Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation. During this stint he was able to take his love of the ocean to the public. In the early 1950's the Aqua-Lung made it to Los Angeles and Tillman had borrowed one of these early imports from a diving friend. He tried it and immediately saw both a strong future for this invention and a real safety risk for users. While not the first SCUBA unit invented, Tillman had used several homemade units over the years, the Aqua-Lung is the first unit that started mass production. Tillman immediately typed up a memo to his superiors at Los Angeles County that he wanted to undertake a training program.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County Program: Tillman's memo got the ball rolling. The people in charge at the county supported the idea and Bev Morgan of the Los Angeles County Lifeguards came on board. The County sent Tillman and Morgan down to Scripps Institution where Connie Limbaugh had a training program for scientists on the use of the Aqua-Lung. Tillman and Morgan along with several other went through this program that included everything a scientist would need to know, not just the use of the Aqua-Lung. Tillman and Morgan completed this course and returned to Los Angeles to design a program that would be open to the general public. In 1953 Los Angeles County held the first public courses in SCUBA diving and a year later they held the first civilian instructor certification course.</p>
<p>California State College - Los Angeles: After the Los Angeles program got off its feet Tillman accepted a position as a professor at California State College in Los Angeles (now California State University at Los Angeles) in 1956. Tillman would remain on the faculty as a Professor of Recreation and Diving Officer at CSULA until 1994. He would take time off his teaching duties throughout his career to pursue his diving adventures.</p>
<p>National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI) In 1959 the only real training agency that trained nationwide was the newly formed YMCA program. Outside of that it was just local programs or mailo order certification. Neal Hess was a writer for Skin Diver Magazine and had such a mail order program. Tillman was also an editor of Skin Diver Magazine at the time and Hess came to him and they worked together to design a program that could be taught nationwide based on the Los Angeles County design. The publishers of Skin Diver Magazine, Jim Auxier and Chuck Blakeslee, gave their financial and editorial backing and the Underwater Society of America gave their official backing. In 1960 NAUI held its first Instructor Certification Course in Houston, Texas during the Underwater Society of America convention. Instructors and advisors of the newly formed NAUI included Tillman, Hess, Jacques Yves Cousteau, Garry Howland, Andy Rechnitzer, and other famous divers of the day. Soon after courses followed across the United States and in to Canada, making NAUI the first internation diver certification agency. Today NAUI courses at all levels are held throughout the world. Tillman was NAUI instructor #000001.</p>
<p>Underwater Photographic Society Tillman worked with actress, stuntwoman and experimental diver Zale Parry to create the Underwater Photographic Society and International Underwater Film Festivals. Tillmand and Parry both believed that in the long run it would be healthier for the sea to promote photography over spear fishing. They had both seen many of the species that were in their favorite dive spots wiped out over the years by over harvesting. Tillman also worked with Parry at this time to create the very first civilian dive traing film.</p>
<p>Underwater Explorers Society Tillman had always dreamed of a destination diving resort. In the mid-1960's this dream came true when a group a busniessmen gave Tillman a blank check to design a destination resort that would cater to divers. Tillman wrote up the proposal and construction soon began in Freeport on Grand Bahama Island. This facility would come to be known as the Underwater Explorers Society (UNEXSO). It was attached to a hotel and offered every amenity a diver and his family could think of at the time. A fleet of boats, a deep pool, saltwater tanks, a science lab, a museum, classrooms, pro shop, a professional photo lab, full staff of instructors and guides, and more were the best in the world at the time. The clientle included royalty, politicians, movie stars, and the best divers and photographers in the world. UNEXSO was hands down the primiere facility for diving in the world at the time. Tillman managed UNEXSO from Los Angeles as much as he could to fulfill his teaching duties but he was onsite as often as possible. In 1969 he sold his partnership in UNEXSO to travel the world looking for new locations for dive resorts. He went to Asia, Europe and Canada but the unlimited funding he had for UNEXSO was no longer available as his backers were tightening their belts so he settled for settling down in the Philippines for a while. The birth of his second child, Thomas Tillman, in 1971 brought him back to Los Angeles and full time teaching at CSULA.</p>
<p>1971-1984 Tillman settled down to full time teaching at the University during this period. His career had easily promoted him to a full professorship and he used this position to design a graduate program in recreation management. He wrote several textbooks to guide his program including the landmark Program Book for Recreation Professionals that became the cornerstone text for programs around the world. During this time he continued his professional association in diving by acting as a Master Instructor Trainer for NAUI, NASDS and the YMCA. He also took a short hiatis from teaching to become the first Executive Director of the Hugh O'Brien Youth Foundation. He also served as editor for several diving magazines as well as contributing editor to several professional trade journals in recreation.</p>
<p>In 1984 Tillman opted for early retirement from CSULA and scaled back to teaching three months a year. Because of his reduced teaching responsibilities he moved his family to Orcas Island in the Pacific Northwest. He built a home in a farm that he had bought years earlier while bidding on Rosario Resort during his hunt for a new location for a dive resort. While the purchase of the resort did not work out he found a 25 acre farm that he fell in love with. Every vacation had been spent there now his family lived there.</p>
<p>In 1994 Tillman's wife of five decades, Ruth Tillman, passed away. He no longer had an obligation to teach at CSULA so he concentrated on writing down the history of the sport of diving, a project that he has worked on part-time with Zale Parry since the early 1970's. Tillman published his memoirs, I Thought I Saw Atlantis, and a more comprehensive book about the hisotry of diving called Scuba America, which he co-authored with Zale Parry.</p>
<p>Tillman had many other accomplishments that are too numerous to go into detail: -He was a world class handball player who participated in tournaments throughout the world. -He was recognized by the YMCA for his contributions to thir recreationprogram world wide. -He had the second largest collection of pop-up books in the world and wrote a collecting book about them. -He was awarded diving's Reaching Out Award, The NOGI, NAUI's Lifetime Achievement Award, and induction into the International Diving Hall of Fame among hundreds of other awards.</p>
<p>In 2004 Tillman passed away from a stroke. He was working at home before the stoke on another book on the history of diving. He was with his second wife, Patricia Tillman, who he had known through the diving industry for years but had become reaquainted to during a recent dive with several of diving's "old timers." His son Thomas carries on his work regarding the hisotry of diving by maintaining Tillman's vast museum of equipment, photographs, books and ephemera of divings past as well as completion of the book on the history of diving with Zale Parry.</p>

<p>Sharindlar is a chaotic-good aligned dwarven diety of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. She is an intermediate deity who resides on the plane of Dwarfhome with the rest of the dwarven pantheon. She is goddess of romantic love, fertility, courtship, healing, mercy, dancing, and the moon. Her portfolio is very similar to the dwarven god Berronar Truesilver. She is possibly allied with Sune, the human goddess of beauty, love, and passion, for that goddess is allied with all deities having to do with beauty in some way. Her portfolio is slightly similar to the human goddess Selúne.</p>

<p><b>Popularity &amp; Stressin' Out</b>Popularity&amp;Stressin' Out <b>Popularity</b><a href="../../../p/o/p/Popularity.html" title="Popularity">Popularity</a>: Polk Middle School just got a popularity list going from 202 to all the to the top 10. The maker of the list is unknown. Moze is shocked to find out she was # 8 on the list and is officially part of the top ten group. Ned is also shocked to find out he ranked at #42. He fears that since Suzie is #7 she might not want to date someone not popular. Cookie is raged to hear that he ranked #129 on the list. He is determined to find out who made the list. Moze, meanwhile, is hanging out with her "new" friends. But they don't seem that fun. Cookie is still trying to figure out the maker of the list but was blind to see that it was Albert Wormenheimer. Ned is still upset about the list but Missy decides to help him be popular since he "helped" her once by giving her pencil to her when it dropped to the floor. So Missy gives Ned punk rock make-up and body jewelery by telling him that Suzie loves it. Truth is Suzie hates it and really does have feelings for Ned. Missy gets mad that Ned likes Suzie so much but not her. She leaves by telling Ned that one day she will be hers. Ned and Suzie end up being a couple.</p>

Our Lady of Graces has a reasonably short history of almost 55 years and was founded by the Dominican religious congregation whom originated in South France during the 13th Century. The old parish – originally known as Our Lady of Graces and Blessed Martin de Porres (a Dominican saint) was built in 1952 and established by the Dominican Fathers at the request of His Grace Archbishop Duhig. The land between McEwan Street, Mayfield Road and Broadway Street was once a bare paddock where a marquee was erected to serve as a church for the first three years. It was this large marquee that held the first official Parish Mass (Author Unknown, p12).</p>
<p>During this initial period a group of volunteers worked energetically to erect a timber structure near a creek, which then ran through the property. The structure today is know as the Dominic Centre and was the first permanent Church occupied by Our Lady of Graces Church at Carina. This structure was designed with canvas sides, which would be rolled up when required.</p>
<p>The Dominic Centre was subsequently used as a meeting point for parishioners and its walls have seen many birthday parties, parish social gatherings and similar functions. Up until 1999, the building was hired out to professional teachers for the purpose of conducting ballet, music and similar classes. The building also doubled as an additional classroom for St Martin’s Primary School and was taken over by them in full at the beginning of 1999 (Author Unknown, p12).</p>
<p>The current Parish was then built in 1973 and is under direction of Fr. Joseph Truong, O.P. whom welcomes a large congregation each week with parishioners coming from various ethnic backgrounds such as Italian, Vietnamese, Indian, Spanish, Burmese and Chinese (Fr. Wallace, 2005). Variety in ethnicity is important in a church as it brings people from various cultures together as a community and culturally devises an acute sense of place.</p>

<p>A new race has dawned upon earth. Although these creatures have been around for years, they have only begun to serface within socioty recently. Of course I am speaking of the creatures known as "Snufawompaluffaloops".</p>
<p>They aren't very hard to spot within our current society, many of them have decided to take on the deceiving look of an 'emo child'. As you can planley see in the image shown, they have odd looking moustaches and beards, uni brows. elongated thumbs and nostrols, and purple tongues. Other features include being able to cause stimulation with just it's glare at other people, and the status of being half goat, half man which for an unexplained reasons seems to be associated with these creatures.</p>
<p>They do seem almost human, especially within disguise of their tight jeans, large shoes, black hair that covers their face, gloves that hide their thumbs, and tight sweaters that seems to go along with the style. Do not be mistaken though, not all 'emo children' are Snuffies, a large percentage of emo' children' are just poeple that have chosen the style that was brought up by Snuffies, and most of them havn't even heard of these creatures who created the style. Few have decided to revealed to the public their true status, but some brave souls have come forth and admitted it to the public. Some of which include <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serj_Tankian_8fcb.html" title="Serj Tankian">Serj Tankian</a>, singer from the popular band <a href="../../../s/y/s/System_of_a_Down_7ea2.html" title="System of a Down">System of a Down</a>, and another singer from a well known band, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brendon_Urie_7fba.html" title="Brendon Urie">Brendon Urie</a> from <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panic%21_at_the_Disco_acf4.html" title="Panic! at the Disco">Panic! at the Disco</a>. They don't appear under this form because plastic surgery works wonders for thousands each year.</p>
<p>You may know a few of them and not even realize that they are Snuffies. Although they have shown signs of a kill like instinct, you should be respective of these creatures, and not condem them for their status that they were given upon birth. Many continue to be born each day, and should be accepted within society, until they make music which seems to be horrible, but their secual glare attracts many to their horrible bands. Little more information on them is known such as their origin, but I shall try to keep you lisetners posted on any little information more I can find.</p>

<p>Forevermore is an up and rising band from Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p>They are a band who fuses thrash, death, and heavy metal together, creating their own unique sound. Neo-classical sounds are also heard, which makes the musicianship technically challenging. Since today's music is normally a heavily watered down version of this, Forevermore is the next band who is going to "carry the torch".</p>
<p>Forevermore was formed by Sam and Colin, who after years of jamming together, found keyboardist, Claudia, and Drummer, Kerry. They are still in the underground of Canada, but will soon emerge, making an appearance which won't be forgotten once the new album is out.</p>

A fictional movie title created by comedian Patton Oswalt as a spin-off of writer/director George Barry's Death Bed: The Bed That Eats. The joke stems from Patton's failure in making screenplays, and the success of one man to successfully overcome the rigors of movie production to see his creation, Death Bed, to the end.</p>

<p>Too many men on the ice is an infraction cited in the sport of Ice Hockey. It exists in all international realms of competition, including, but not limitted to, the National Hockey League (NHL), the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), as well as the Olympic Games.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-23_583d.html" title="Edit section: Penalty Description">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Penalty Description</span></h2>
<p>Unlike most hockey penalties, too many men on the ice can be called by both a linesman and the referee. The penalty may be called when the game official counts seven active players on the same team with both feet on the ice surface. Typically, this act manifests itself when six skaters and one goalie appear on the ice concurrently. Because the penalty occurs most frequently on a line change, it is common for the number of skaters to exceed seven or eight.</p>
<p>The referee signals the penalty by directing his eyes towards his hands and holding up seven fingers while expressing confusion.</p>

<p>While not a common infraction, the penalty has a large following within hockey-centric communities due to several well known instances of its calling. The 1979 Stanley Cup Semi-Finals between the Montreal Canadians and Boston Bruins represents an often-discussed example. Trailing 4-3 late in the game, a too many men on the ice penalty injected new life into the Canadians, allowing them to come from behind and later win the series (the Canadians went on to win the Stanley Cup championship). For many people in Boston hockey circles, this episode is referenced when the team suffers an all too common late-season collapse.</p>

Kinser was later asked to join the band when word got around that he played guitar as well. Shortly after Kinser joined, his best friend Andrew Squires joined the ranks as well. Squires was a guitar player as well. Since Sully also played the bass guitar, he decided to trade in the six string for a four string.</p>

<p>4.225.211.40 07:55, 22 October 2006 (UTC) Erik Hoeffner was born on April 7th 1991 in Aroura Colorado. He was born to parents Mike and Wendy Hoeffner. As a child he could speak at 9 monthe's old, and was consider to be decently 'intelligent'. He started playing "drums" at the age of 5, staring of card board boxes and plastic boxes.He played what could be considered the drums on boxes until birthday 1997 (age 7) and his parents decided that the busted boxes were enough. So they bought him a mini electric drum set. From there he decided that drum's were part of his life. He constantly played the instrument and slowly improved. In December 2001 the cherished set suddenly shorted out. Luckly despite the fact his electric set was broken he had a single snare drum to practice on. Using the rim as hi-hats or the ride to keep the beat and playing the snare. The time came again in december 2002 (christmas) that his parents decided that one drum was enough. So on christmas day he recived a full drum set with basic options. Currently the same drumset he still use's made by pacifc drums and has eight Paiste cymbals and one wuhan china. He prefers the brands he uses because of relibility. He is currently involved in drums and vocals for local hard rock/punk band Destination: Darkness. and has played Guitar for ten monthes after inspiration from Destination: Darknesses Guitarist Val, and hand down of val's old guitar. Because of guitar he is also involved in a newer local band *69 and Is the only active member, recording guitar parts for songs, then recording and mixing drums with guitar, and finnally adding Vocals into the mix. He is also involved in improv band's known as: "Nick and Erik" and "Jesse, Joe and Erik". He has a myspace and a personal webpage(<a href="http://www.freewebs.com/erikhoeffner/" class="external free" title="http://www.freewebs.com/erikhoeffner/" rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebs.com/erikhoeffner/</a>).</p>

<p>David Solis, commonly known as "The King of the Swing", is a famed artist, musician, writer, and Chief Financial Officer of the company Shteven Productions. He's hated among the Jewish community for comments he made back in '89. Conversely, he's loved by Germans and Muslims.</p>
<p>Dave made himself known early in his life while drumming with his first band, straight out of Kansas, Riot Act Durish Genocide. They made a name for themselves in the local music scene in 2001 with their hit record "Legalize Rape", which was a hit within the feminist movement. However, a large tiff within the band would eventually lead to their downfall after lead singer Pistol Pete broke a pane of glass over Dave's head. To this day, they have not spoken face to face, but they sometimes talk on the Bobby Brown Fan Club Forums.</p>
<p>After Riot Act Durish Genocide disbanded, Trevor Antidote, singer of the death metal band Antidote, recruited Dave to keep time for them. Later on, Antidote got a new singer, James Stanley, to help Trevor out with guitar and heavy metal screeches. After seemingly much downtime, Antidote finally released their much-anticipated record "Fuck You...Welcome To Hell", and its single "Sex Change Jesus" quickly became a hit, despite harsh criticism from fundamental Christians.</p>
<p>After the release of "Fuck You...Welcome To Hell", Antidote quickly began working on a new record, tentatively titled "Skull Rape Neph", but has yet to be seen as of 2006, and the question of whether it will ever be seen still remains as Antidote is currently on hiatus. Dave and James are working on a side-project called "James and the Giant Peach Band", where their only released song to date, "Hello", has become a hit over the interweb. Dave is also drumming for the funk, blues and psychedelia band Shanghai Sally and working on his part of their next album "Blue Complex".</p>
<p>In between all this, Dave Solis somehow finds time to co-run his and James' company Shteven Productions, where he acts as CFO, and James as CEO. In 2005, Solis' first wife sued for his half of the company, but lost in a lengthy court battle.</p>
<p>Right now, Dave lives a peaceful life in his home in Mountain Home, Idaho.</p>

<p>'Awwghh' is a phrase/word that can be used, much like a common swear word, in several aspects of life. Its most common usage is as a sarcastic longing for an ugly or obese person (while walking past such a person, it can be screamed as loud as possible), however it has various connotations, often revolving around unusual sexual practices (<a href="../../../f/e/l/Feltch.html" title="Feltch">feltch</a>, for example), yet its meaning can extend to almost anything.</p>
<p>'Awwghh' is loosely derived from the term 'awww', which is used to describe something cute or adorable. The website <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Dictionary_cc65.html" title="Urban Dictionary">Urban Dictionary</a> describes 'awww' as a sentimental reaction to warm fuzzy experiences.</p>

<p>The Realist Writers is a long running group of Melbourne Writers. Although the group functioned primarily between 1940 and 1970, a tiny faction still exists today. The group stressed the importance of writing in a realist mode, in order to express political concerns. They were largely socialist. They rejected modernism as it disassociated man from the ordinary struggles of class and income.</p>
<p>Notable members included Frank Hardy and Dorothy Hewett.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Physarum polycephalum belongs to phylum Amoebozoa, infraphylum Mycetozoa, and class Myxogastrea. P. polycephalum, often referred to as the “many-headed slime,” is a slime mold that inhabits shady, cool, moist areas, such as decaying leaves and logs. This protist may be seen without a microscope, its single cell measuring up to 30 centimeters in diameter. P. polycephalum is typically yellow in color, and eats fungal spores, bacteria, and other microbes. P. polycephalum is one of the easiest eukaryotic microbes to grow in culture, and has been used as a model organism for many studies involving amoeboid movement and cell motility.</p>
<p><br />
Life Cycle</p>
<p>The main vegetative phase of P. polycephalum is the plasmodium (the active, streaming form of slime molds). The plasmodium is comprised of networks of protoplasmic veins, and many nuclei. It is during this stage that the organism searches for food. The plasmodium surrounds its food and secretes enzymes to digest it. If environmental conditions cause the plasmodium to desiccate (dry out) during feeding or migration, Physarum will form a sclerotium (hard, resistant form of slime molds). The sclerotium is basically hardened multinucleated tissue that serves as a dormant stage, protecting Physarum for long periods of time. Once favorable conditions resume, the plasmodium reappears to continue its quest for food. As the food supply runs out, the plasmodium stops feeding and begins its reproductive phase. Stalks of sporangia (reproductive structures that produce spores) form from the plasmodium; it is within these structures that meiosis occurs and spores are formed. Sporangia are usually formed in the open so that the spores they release will be spread by wind currents. Spores can remain dormant for years if need be. However, when environmental conditions are favorable for growth, the spores germinate and release either flagellated or amoeboid swarm cells (motile stage); the swarm cells then fuse together to form a new plasmodium.</p>
<p>Streaming Behavior</p>
<p>The movement of P. polycephalum is termed shuttle streaming. Shuttle streaming is characterized by the rhythmic back-and-forth flow of the protoplasm; the time interval is approximately two minutes. The forces of the streaming vary for each type of microplasmodium. The force in amoeboid microplasmodia is generated by contraction and relaxation of a membranous layer probably consisting of actin (type of filament associated with contraction). The filament layer creates a pressure gradient, over which the protoplasm flows within limits of the cell periphery. The force behind streaming in the dumbbell-shaped microplasmodia is generated by volume changes in both the periphery of the cell and in the invagination system of the cell membrane.</p>

<p>Daniel Ridyard, as written in the Welsh Premier League Handbook, was an out-standing referee. He has since gone on to work for the Scottish Referee's Association and has been responsible for sealing a major sponsorship deal involving a large glasses company. Daniel Ridyard, once quoted in the Manchester Evening News, was responsible for a mentoring scheme to allow teenagers access to become a referee or assistant in his only unique referee schools. His experience in the Iraq Gulf War has made him a stronger man, a natural leader and one that stands out above the rest. He has recently become married and has moved to Germany where he will enter the ranks of the German FA to highlight the need for new referee recruitment drives.</p>

According to the wikipedia, making a page about yourself is forbidden because a neutral perspective cannot be obtained. But when are we not bias, i looked up a name here earlier and found a page with a number of different achievements on it. It however did not name any negative points. It was created by someone who liked this person. Now had that page been written by the person it was about, then it would have been much the same. All i'm getting at is that there is no way to be neutral, bias is there and always will. I agree in the whole wikipedia idea, however i disagree with the want for 'neutral knowledge'. But hey what do i know, i'm biased</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-23_583d.html" title="Edit section: Roundabout dog">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Roundabout dog</span></h2>
<p><b>Definition</b> Non-professionally produced sculptural art in the form of a dog or other animal made from any material which, often concealed by the darkness of the night, is placed in a public place, preferably in a roundabout.</p>
<p><b>Background</b> It all started with somebody smashing a dog to pieces, that is, not a living dog but a man-made one. A dog that was part of an art installation, an artistic dog if you may. It was the artist Stina Opitz who had been given the task to decorate one of the many roundabouts that had been built in the Tornby area in the outskirts of Linköping, Sweden. This means that somebody demolished the concrete dog made by Stina Opitz, an act which was given appropriate attention in the local papers. Some time therafter the installation got renewed attention since someone had replaced the smashed (and removed) original dog with a home-made wooden dog. It had rather long legs and was rather flat and ugly but quite encouraging in its own way. Shortly thereafter this wooden dog got a concrete bone to chew on and as time has passed various pieces of art have appeared both in this roundabout and others. The involved amateur artists apparently seem to see no limits as regards choice of material, quality, size or even type of animal. Dogs are also moved from one roundabout to another, and some are stolen or demolished. It is a dog’s life after all, isn’t it? The dogs give rise to everything from cheers to cranky comments on traffic safety. They have also made local bureaucrats and politicians on the cultural scene to threaten with confiscation and institutionalisation of these pieces of art and place them in one – by them – selected roundabout or even in the local museum, suggestions which have upset some of the artists.</p>

<p>Chink/chenzo/vinnie/vincenzo (born Vince De Freitas on October 17, 1972) is a British musician. He was born and raised in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol.html" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, England.</p>
<p>Discovered by Entrepreneur Pete O'Reilly, Chink got his big break when signing to Bristolian Recordz and became a crossover sensation with his debut single "Withywood Crew Owns U" while simultaneously earning respect for his technical and lyrical ability. He is noted for his ability to change his vocal pace and style multiple times within one song without losing the beat, and has been praised for his skill in alliteration and assonance.</p>
<p>He is infamous for the controversy surrounding many of his lyrics and his unusual obsession with <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelsea_Football_Club_2843.html" title="Chelsea Football Club">Chelsea Football Club</a>. With the enormous ridicule of his highly criticised sophomore album Chenzo 4 Lyf, critics such as GLAAD denounced his lyrics as homophobic, misogynist and racist while others protested that it promoted violence.</p>
<p>Bristolian Recordz recently released a greatest hits album from Chink called Dreamin' of X Factor, a compilation covering many of his previous commercial hit songs, in addition to three new tracks. De Freitas has stated that he is taking a break from solo work but is in no way retiring, as he continues to produce and collaborate with his fellow Withywood Crew artists as well as Bristolian artists and rappers under his Luvvin' it label.</p>
<p>To date, Chink has sold Nearly 100 albums worldwide. He is also, at the time of writing this article, 4553rd on xfactorchallenge.</p>

<p>Chicago Fire Patrol or Chicago Fire Insurance Patrol</p>
<p>The Chicago Board of Underwriters, in the summer of 1871, decided to develop their own insurance supported Fire Patrol like many large cities of the time were doing because of the large number of fires and high losses that were occurring. The use of high volume steam engine pumps by the Chicago Fire Department, which in many cases caused more damage than the fire itself, may have been another factor for the organization of the Fire Patrol. A committee of three was formed from within its members and consisted of Chas W. Drew, of the firm of local agents Miller and Drew; Arthur C. Ducat, representing the Home Insurance Company of New York and general agent in Chicago; Thomas Buckley, secretary to the Home Mutual Insurance Company of Chicago. These men were instructed to organize and perfect the newly formed operation. The Board, looking for a man capable of managing the Fire Insurance Patrol, turned to Chief Fire Marshal Robert A. Williams, for his recommendation. On July 8th, Williams’ former driver and aide, Benjamin J. Bullwinkle, was appointed Captain of the Chicago Fire Insurance Patrol. Captain Bullwinkle immediately left for New York to study the operations and equipment of the New York Fire Patrol because they were the first Patrol established and were considered experts in the field. After three weeks experience, he returned home confident that he would be able to make the Chicago Fire Insurance Patrol a success. The Fire Insurance Patrol’s apparatus was not ready when he returned so the committee assigned him the task of inspecting buildings. He performed this task so efficiently that the committee had second thoughts about removing him from this important job. The Chicago Fire Insurance Patrol was organized on September 30, 1871 and officially went into service in their new red wagon on Monday, October 2, 1871. The Fire Insurance Patrol roster at the time of inception was: B. B. Bullwinkle, F.J. Gabriel, D. F. Donnelly, C. C. Donnelly, C. G. Emory, John Cochran, Thomas Soden, William Gough, Thomas Woodworth, and William Atkins.</p>

<p>Mikea is a social identity for Malagasy speaking horticulturalists/foragers of southwestern Madagascar. Mikea identity is flexible and complex, linked to living in the forest and using forest resources. Foraging and maize horticulture connect the Mikea with local, regional, and global economies. Being Mikea also entails managing connotations of primitivism with the social and economic consequences of government, researcher, missionary, and tourist interest in hunter-gatherers.</p>
