The result of the debate was delete.</p>
<p>My count was 13 clear delete, 5 keep (however one of those was discounted), 1 transwiki (discounted because I don't believe it meets their criteria for acceptance) and 1 merge. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:15, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Pretty interesting to a lot of people. The story has been featured on Fark, Good Morning America, and the AP. Not at all a copyright violation! The picture is from the article on which I own the copyright and am donating to wikipedia. The pictures from the article itself were used with permission. <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoodmarket_f110.html" title="User:Foodmarket">Foodmarket</a> 06:30, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Are you absolutely sure the permission given to you by some third party to use those images in your own article in your website extends to re-licensing them under <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> license (or similar free license) required to upload them to Wikipedia? I'm not a copyright expert, but my understanding is that mere use permission is not enough. <a href="../../../j/n/i/User%7EJni_807c.html" title="User:Jni">jni</a> 06:42, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Local news items are not encyclopedic. I haven't checked, but maybe <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinews.html" title="Wikinews">Wikinews</a> would be interested in this. <a href="../../../j/n/i/User%7EJni_807c.html" title="User:Jni">jni</a> 06:42, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki to wikinews</b>.

<li>"Woman eats cheeseburger." Well, at least it's a new variation on "dog bites man". The copyright violation problems alone would make me vote "<b>Delete</b> and rewrite from scratch". However, the utter <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">unimportance</a> of the subject strengthens that to a simple <b>Delete</b>. Come back when the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_Book_of_Records_2093.html" title="Guinness Book of Records">Guinness Book of Records</a> recognises it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:38, 2005 Jan 25 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> this notable cheeseburger eateress (well, as notable as they come) with <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eating_contest.html" title="Eating contest">Eating contest</a> or something. There was a similar challenge in a <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simpsons.html" title="Simpsons">Simpsons</a> episode, which makes me think it may be an aspect of American popular culture worth writing an article about. It would be a shame losing this image, provided <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoodmarket_f110.html" title="User:Foodmarket">Foodmarket</a> really has miss Stelnick's permission to use it on Wikipedia.&#160;;-) / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 15:20, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Weak <b>Delete</b>, cheeseburger eating or not, it doesnt seem notable enough for inclusion. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 01:19, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Local news? Where were you guys when this was racing around the Internet and on TV? Not only does Kate give permission for the photo to be on wikipedia, she actually edited an earlier version of the article... she changed her birthdate to the correct date. check under article Kate stelnick (lower case S) <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoodmarket_f110.html" title="User:Foodmarket">Foodmarket</a> 04:13, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I certainly hadn't seen this anywhere else before. In any case it is not the type of thing that is considered "<a href="../../../e/n/c/Wikipedia%7EEncyclopedic_889f.html" title="Wikipedia:Encyclopedic">encyclopedic</a>" in Wikipedia, but if you click on the red link in my vote above (or here) and write an article on the more general subject of <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eating_contest.html" title="Eating contest">eating contests</a> – and judging from your webpage you are probably qualified to do so – you can use the image and mention this particular challenge as an <i>example</i>. I look forward to reading the article. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 08:49, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Prior to the redirect, I see just you and two anonymous editors (neither of which can be proven to <i>be</i> Kate Stelnick) in the history for Kate stelnick. I also note the changes to <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger.html" title="Burger">Burger</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheeseburger.html" title="Cheeseburger">Cheeseburger</a>. How many duplicates of this are we going to have? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:22, 2005 Jan 26 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: contest winners not automatically notable. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E. Heresiarch">Wile E. Heresiarch</a> 06:20, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If indeed the above claim is proven correct - that she has edited the article - then it should also be deleted on the grounds of vanity. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 01:01, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We do not delete articles on such a basis. In that case any article on anybody would be subject to deletion if the person they're written about edited them. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 01:09, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah but we're not talking about just anyone. If indeed she edited the article about herself, for herself, that is still a form of vanity. Userpages exempt of course, but this isn't a userpage. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 01:46, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>This is <b>not</b> a world record. It's only the first person to have eaten the special 6-pound hamburger at this one particular restaurant. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 05:55, Jan 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Delete. If she's created an account, it could be moved to her user space but I don't believe this meets the recommended <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a> necessary to support an article in the main encyclopedia space. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 01:31, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, perhaps merge into an article on the eatery in question. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 05:35, Jan 27, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The eatery is no more desrving of an article than she is. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 05:55, Jan 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does it _hurt_ Wikipedia to have information on Kate and her record? It is a world record in that several professional eaters have failed to consume this hamburger whereas Kate has succeeded. This is the "4-minute-mile" of competitive eating. Although I agree that Wiki needs a larger article on competitive eating and its events, for now featuring this young woman adds to the knowledge-base available to our readers. Google returns 12,000 results for her name, which is hardly a common moniker. Isn't that a tad too many results for Wikipedia to be silent? <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoodmarket_f110.html" title="User:Foodmarket">Foodmarket</a> 15:23, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's the wrong question. The question to answer is "How does it <i>help</i> Wikipedia?". And the answer is that it doesn't. And, as both I and <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> have pointed out, this <b>is not a record</b>. As I said, come back when the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_Book_of_Records_2093.html" title="Guinness Book of Records">Guinness Book of Records</a> recognises it (which it does not right now). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:24, 2005 Jan 28 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regarding UncleG's questions, I am new to Wikipedia but have read that when creating a new article, one should take steps to avoid it becoming an un-linked orphan. Was it inappropriate to link back to the article in related articles? About Kate's editing of the page, trace the IP -- it goes right to her dormitory in the College of New Jersey. So I guess you can say it could be _any_ TCNJ student living on campus but you can take my word for it, it's her. <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoodmarket_f110.html" title="User:Foodmarket">Foodmarket</a> 15:29, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is an encyclopedia, not a compendium of all knowledge. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 20:47, Jan 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>Was it inappropriate to link back to the article in related articles?</i> — That's not what you did, so that question is not relevant. You repeated virtually the entire content of this article in both of the other two. At best, it should have been a "see also". <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:24, 2005 Jan 28 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>trace the IP</i> — The fact that you know the IP address of "her dormitory in the College of New Jersey" is arousing my suspicions. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:24, 2005 Jan 28 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Well, which criteria for deletion does it meet? I would vote to delete if she was entirely non-notable, but she has a sufficient claim to notability, in my opinion. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 20:57, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete. Non-notable. Maybe put an external reference link to the story from the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger.html" title="Burger">burger</a> article? <a href="../../../j/t/a/User%7EJtalledo_ca0a.html" title="User:Jtalledo">Jtalledo</a> 01:53, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Lord no, she's not significant enough to warrant mention in a general article. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 01:55, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: If the result of this is to delete, don't forget to remove the dangling hyperlinks in <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger.html" title="Burger">burger</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheeseburger.html" title="Cheeseburger">cheeseburger</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:24, 2005 Jan 28 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, along with links to it. Wikipedia is not the Guiness Book of World Records (and even they probably won't cover this). Hmmm, #2 google hit for the name is at www.<i>foodmarket</i>.com . Self-promotion? <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 18:25, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li>Self promotion? I happened to do the article on it, noticed wikipedia didnt have it, attempted to add my first article to your encyclopedia. I don't control my page-rank on Google. UncleG and RickK -- you should visit www.ifoce.com . Can wikipedia afford to ignore an entire sport? <a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoodmarket_f110.html" title="User:Foodmarket">Foodmarket</a> 18:37, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Um, yeah, you can influence your google page rank, by making other sites link to your site, as you seem to have done here. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 19:48, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>Can wikipedia afford to ignore an entire sport?</i> — Again, an irrelevant question. There's no evidence that this promotional gimmick by one restaurant was anything to do with sport. And it's Kate Stelnick that we are deciding whether to delete here. If you want to make that question relevant, write the <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eating_contest.html" title="Eating contest">eating contests</a> article that <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> suggested. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:25, 2005 Jan 28 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course, since this was not an eating competition, it would not be appropriate to include this person in an article on <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eating_contest.html" title="Eating contest">eating contests</a>. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 21:47, Jan 28, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Somebody has created a stub on eating contests now, including a couple of lines about this type of challenge as part of the, umm, culture of competitive eating.
