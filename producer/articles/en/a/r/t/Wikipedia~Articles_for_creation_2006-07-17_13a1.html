<p>KCC started in 1951 as a textile store in Koronadal City, South Cotabato. It then expanded in 1989 into a supermarket department store format called KCC Shopping Center.</p>
<p>In 1992, KCC opened its first store in General Santos City called KCC Warehouse Plaza. The warehouse club format helped it establish a small but promising foothold in General Santos City.</p>
<p>In 1996, KCC Warehouse Plaza converted into an airconditioned hypermarket cum mall concept and was renamed KCC Mall of Gensan. With renowned tenants such as Jollibee, Greenwich, Penshoppe, and others, KCC’s was able to better serve its customers.</p>
<p>After four more years and learning from its General Santos experience, KCC Shopping Center expanded into KCC Mall of Marbel, the first in Koronadal, bringing more options to shoppers there—four cinemas, mall tenants such as Jollibee, Greenwich, Chowking, Guess, etc. After a tragic fire in 2002, KCC Mall of Gensan rebuilt from scratch in mid 2004 and brought better shopping value for its shoppers.</p>

<p>The Institute for Private Enterprise is an Australian political group established for the purposes of promoting the cause of private enterprise and reducing the role of the government in economic affairs. <a href="../../../d/e/s/Des_Moore_5fa7.html" title="Des Moore">Des Moore</a> is the Institute's Director.<a href="http://www.ipe.net.au/ipeframeset.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ipe.net.au/ipeframeset.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>After resigning in 1987 from the position of Deputy Secretary in the Treasury due to fears that government policy would lead to recession, Des Moore in 1996 formed the Institute with the aim of assisting in the promotion of private enterprise and greater deregulation of the Australian economy<a href="http://www.ipe.net.au/ipeframeset.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ipe.net.au/ipeframeset.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>The Institute believes in a rolling-back of Government regulation in the Australian economy. The Institute however still believes in government assisting the disadvantaged, eliminating private monopolies and having a legal system which allows private enterprises to flourish by encouraging risk-taking and economic growth<a href="http://www.ipe.net.au/ipeframeset.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ipe.net.au/ipeframeset.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. The Institute has focussed on reform of Australia's labour market in recent years, and has ties with the controversial H.R. Nicholls Society.</p>

Tucker Estron, a minor celebrity in the Puget Sound region, is the pseudonym of a zinester, poet, and political commentator whose "tax name," as she puts it, is something entirely ordinary. She created the "Tucker Estron" identity as a character for her first zine and over time adopted the name as her nom de plume.</p>
<p>Originally from Olympia, WA, Tucker began publishing a small free zine <i>OtherWise</i>, a combination of science fiction and possible autobiography, in the mid-1990s. Though the zine only had a print run of 200 copies per issue, it generated a small amount of international interest when a French tabloid featured an article about the small publication and its creator.</p>
<p><i>OtherWise</i> was no longer published after 2002, but Tucker continues to write and publish material online and in print. <a name="Sources_11" id="Sources_11"></a></p>

The PGM (in German&#160;:Prüfgemeinschaft Mauerbohrer e.V.) certifies hammer and percussion drill bits for concrete and similar materials. The PGM is located in Remscheid (Germany) and has been found in 1978. The drill bits have to fulfil close tolerances in order to secure, that the manufactured holes are suitable for safe anchor fixings. In a hole which is too big or not exact, the anchor fixing can not be safe.</p>
<p>Drill bits certified by the PGM are marked with the registered PGM mark on the drill bit itself and on the packaging.</p>
<p>The tolerances are monitored by the PGM. New developed drill bits have to proof their suitability for anchor fixings by extensive comparision tests. Additionally, the drill bit manufacturers must have state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities and a quality system, which is also monitored by the PGM.</p>
<p>The certification criteria are developed in close co-operation with the approval bodies for anchors and with leading anchor manufacturers.</p>

<p>"Te Karanga", as is the name of the song by Rhian Sheehan on the Café del Mar 11 album, is a part of the Maorian (New Zealand natives) wedding cermonies. "Te Karanga" is the traditional Maorian welcome call to the wedding couple when they enter the maorian village or wedding location and is meant to welcome the bride and the groom on to the sacred land. Neither "Te" or "Karanga" have a literally completely correct english translation, since they are depending on their context. But "Te" is closest to being literally translated as the english "The" and "Karanga" as the english word "calling". The meaning of "Te karanga" is simply "The welcome call".</p>

He is a Film and commercial director, with his mother from the UK and his father from the UAE Ali grew up in Dubai. Film has always been a central part of his life and since childhood Ali has experimented making his own short films and mock T.V. ads. Upon completion of his higher education Ali established a division from an existing company focusing on set and interior design. He then pursued his goal in 2003 when he enrolled at the London Film School to obtain an M.A. of practical training in film technique. Over two years he has worked on short films and T.V. commercials in all areas of production, but his sights remains focused on directing.

<p>The sun delivers its energy to the earth in a relatively diluted form, from 600-1200W per m2. The solar panel industry (Photo Voltaic or PV) has so far developed panels that use this energy, with a 12-14% efficiency so far. However, the current (2006) global shortage of high-quality silisium has meant a renewed interest in concentrating the solar rays before applying a PV panel.</p>
<p>Several manufacturers such as Spectrolab has been developing CPV panels for satellites initially, and are today achieving much higher efficiencies (35%) than traditional flat panel. Even if the cost is higher per cm2, the overall cost of a system may be lower as the concentration ratio equals the reduction ratio for the CPV material. With a 1m2 concentrator working at 200x ("200 suns"), the need for PV material is only 1/200 or 0,5%. 100x is commonly viewed as having the same</p>
<p>To concentrate the sun, there are a number of optical systems being proposed. Most are either based on fresnel lenses or parabolic mirrors. All CPV systems must track the sun from morning to sunset with high precision, however this is yields 25-30% more energy throughout the day.</p>
<p>CPV is a subset of CSP (Concentrated Solar Power) which also includes thermal systems.</p>

<p>Dave Robicheaux is a fictional detective created by mystery author James Lee Burke. Robicheaux is characterized by an almost poetic use of language and by his alcoholism. Despite his often violent outbursts, he is also very generous, going out of his way to help those who may not even deserve it.</p>

<p>Mr. Cotton (and his parriot)are crew members of the famous black pearl. Cotton does not have a tounge, (because it was cut out) so his parriot was tought to speak for him ( but in usuallly in pirate or sailing slang). In the first Pirates Of The Carribean movie he is one of the crew members hired by Captain Jack Spearow to help hunt down the black pearl. In The second movie he is one of the few surviving crew members after the attack from the Kraken. It is guessed that he will be one of the crew members who will be traveling to the worlds end to find a way to bring Jack Spearo back from the dead</p>

<p>Transpired air collectors</p>
<p>Transpired air collectors use the sun's energy to heat cold outside air for use in buildings. In so doing, they reduce the amount of space heating needed to keep buildings comfortable on cold days. Since about 13% of the energy we use in the United States goes to heat homes and commercial buildings, this new technology could result in significant energy conservation, saving millions of dollars in heating costs in the process. And because transpired air collectors dramatically reduce utility bills, they can literally pay for themselves in just a few years.</p>
<p>This new technology provides an effective means for substituting renewable energy for fossil fuel consumption, particularly in cold climates.</p>
<p>How It Works</p>
<p>Transpired air collectors use a simple, elegant technology to capture the sun's heat to warm buildings. The collectors consist of dark, perforated metal plates installed over a building's south-facing wall. An air space is created between the old wall and the new facade. The dark outer facade absorbs solar energy and rapidly heats up on sunny days — even when the outside air is cold.</p>
<p>A fan or blower draws ventilation air into the building through hundreds of tiny holes in the collectors and up through the air space between the collectors and the south wall. The solar energy absorbed by the collectors warms the air flowing through them by as much as 40° F.</p>
<p>Unlike older space heating technologies, transpired air collectors require no expensive glazing, which caused energy loss due to reflection. The lack of glazing, together with design refinements, allow the new collectors to capture a record-breaking 80% of available solar energy.</p>

<p>In July 2006 the NHL has asked that members of the media refer to a goal scored in sudden death overtime be called a "Skate Off Goal." This refers to the fact that when the goal is the scored the players immediately vacate the ice. This is obviously akin to the term "walk-off homerun" used in baseball.</p>

<p>Platinum Dunes is a production company run by action director Michael Bay.</p>
<p>Platinum Dunes focus is that of remaking vintage horror films for today's generation of movie goer's.</p>
<p>Their first film produced was 2003's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, a remake of Tobe Hooper's 1974 film of the same name. The remake, starring Jessica Biel and Andrew Bryniarski as Leatherface, was considered successful grossing over 80 million dollars.</p>
<p>After TCM hit big, offers were literally handed to Bay and company at Platinum Dunes.</p>
<p>Their next production collaberation was the retelling of the Amityville Horror in 2005. Amityville Horror followed the basic story of its predecessor from 1979. It details how Ronald Defro, jr. had killed his parents and four siblings with a rifle after having been told to do so by "voices" in the house. One year later, The Lutz family move into their "dream home" only to find the house has an evil presence lurking everywhere and decided to leave after 28 horrific days. The remake had Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George playing the roles that James Brolin and Margot Kidder played in the '79 version. The 2005 version made over 60 million dollars.</p>
<p>Other Platinum Dunes projects is a prequel/sequel to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre</p>
<p>Called The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: the beginning. It stars Jordana Brewster (The Fast and the Furious) and Andrew Bryniarski returning as Leatherface. The story is rumored to be about the origin of the character known as Leatherface. It is due out in October of 2006.</p>
<p>They are also in the process of remaking The Hitcher and had been tapped to produce a remake of the original Friday the 13th.</p>
<p>The Hitcher would be a remake of the 1986 film of the same name. The story revolves around a young man driving across country who becomes prey for a cunning serial killer, who blames all his murders on the young man. The original starred C. Thomas Howell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Rutger Hauer as the title character. It is rumored to be released sometime in 2007.</p>
<p>Not much is known about the Friday the 13th film at this point in time other than it might involve Jason's backstory.</p>

<p>The 2002 Ohio Governors Election resulted in a landslide Re-Election for Govenror Bob Taft. Bob Taft who has never had a high apprvoal rating before or after the 2002 Election managed to be Re-Elected with over 58% of the vote due to the weak state of the Ohio Democratic Party. The Democratic Party nominated Former Cuyahoga County Commissioner Tim Hagan a proud Liberal who promoted redistirbuting the wealth, increasing taxes on business, ending the death penalty, and promoting Gay marriage. These radical stances alinated ohio voters who lean to the conservative side. Bob Taft however alienated his conservative base by picking Columbus City councilwoman Jeanette Bradley who supports Abortion, gay marriage, and affimative action as his choice for Lt.Governor. The Taft Bradley ticket campagined on improving Ohios Economy and Education. Taft ran a positive campaign unlike 1998 while Hagan attacked Taft brutally. Taft also outspent Hagan and ran advertising during the whole fall campaign. It became clear that Taft was going to be Re-Elected by early September. Conservatives who were angry at Taft supported him over the radical liberal Hagan. In the end Taft and Bradley were elected over Hagan and Tavares.</p>

<p>Born in 1956, Larry was one of the greatest long jumpers in history. He was extremely durable, as indicated by the fact that he made four U.S. Olympic teams, and strung together a span of 13 consecutive years in which he recorded a jump of at least 27 feet.</p>
<p>Although some may argue that his career was eclipsed by its intersection with those of Carl Lewis and Mike Powell, it also may be the case that a competitor of Larry's caliber was required to bring out the best in these two rivals. Larry's leaping capabilities carried him to three national championships, two World Cup titles, two World Championship bronze medals, and an Olympic bronze medal.</p>
<p>Mike certainly dominated the runway at Mt. SAC; his six Relays' long jump titles are the most won by any competitor in this event.</p>
<p>Sometimes overlooked is the fact that Larry was also a world-class competitor over 200m. In 1983, Larry captured the Mt. SAC 200m title in a time of 20.36. Later that year, he recorded his PR of 20.03, a mark which continues to place Larry among the 20 fastest 200m runners in U.S. history.</p>

<p><b>HFSLIP</b> is an advanced <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_source.html" title="Open source">open source</a> <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotfix.html" title="Hotfix">Hotfix</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Service_Pack_9c7f.html" title="Service Pack">Service Pack</a> slipstreaming utility designed to update <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_2000.html" title="Windows 2000">Windows 2000</a> (SP4), <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_XP_1c6b.html" title="Windows XP">XP</a> (SP1, SP2), and <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_2003.html" title="Windows 2003">2003</a> (Gold, SP1) installation sources.</p>
<p>The binaries (individual files) of fully supported hotfixes are slipstreamed directly. This means that original files are being replaced with the newer versions present in the hotfix executables you can obtain from the Microsoft Download Center. In the rare occasion that a hotfix isn't supported (usually because of it being a non-standard package or requiring a special installation procedure), it is integrated instead. HFSLIP leaves these uncommon hotfixes or updates as they are and places them in the SVCPACK folder, to be installed automatically near the end of Windows setup.</p>
