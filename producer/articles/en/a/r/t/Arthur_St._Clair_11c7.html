<p>By the mid-1770s, St. Clair considered himself more of an American patriot than a British subject. In January 1776, he took a commission in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Army_3e70.html" title="Continental Army">Continental Army</a>, as a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">colonel</a> of Pennsylvania militia (<a href="../../../3/r/d/3rd_Pennsylvania_Regiment_5a8e.html" title="3rd Pennsylvania Regiment">3rd Pennsylvania Regiment</a>). He was appointed a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigadier_general.html" title="Brigadier general">brigadier general</a> in August 1776, and was sent by Gen. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> to help organize the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> militia. He took part in Washington's crossing of the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delaware_River_6e02.html" title="Delaware River">Delaware River</a> on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> night 1776, before the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Trenton_47a7.html" title="Battle of Trenton">Battle of Trenton</a>. Many biographers credit St. Clair with the strategy which led to Washington's capture of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton%2C_New_Jersey_b719.html" title="Princeton, New Jersey">Princeton, New Jersey</a> in the following days.</p>
<p>In April 1777, St. Clair was sent to defend <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Ticonderoga_2308.html" title="Fort Ticonderoga">Fort Ticonderoga</a>. Unfortunately, his small garrison could not resist British Gen. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Burgoyne_e506.html" title="John Burgoyne">John Burgoyne</a>'s larger force in the <a href="../../../s/a/r/Saratoga_Campaign_7708.html" title="Saratoga Campaign">Saratoga Campaign</a>. St. Clair was forced to retreat at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Ticonderoga_%281777%29_5f42.html" title="Battle of Ticonderoga (1777)">Battle of Ticonderoga</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_5.html" title="July 5">July 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/7/1777.html" title="1777">1777</a>. He was able to withdraw his forces and continue resisting the advance at the battles of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hubbardton_0979.html" title="Battle of Hubbardton">Hubbardton</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Fort_Ann_05c3.html" title="Battle of Fort Ann">Fort Ann</a>. In 1778 he was <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court-martial.html" title="Court-martial">court-martialed</a> for the loss of Ticonderoga. The court exonerated him, and he returned to duty. St. Clair was at <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorktown%2C_Virginia_4d15.html" title="Yorktown, Virginia">Yorktown, Virginia</a> when <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Cornwallis_33db.html" title="Charles Cornwallis">Lord Cornwallis</a> surrendered his army.</p>

<p>St. Clair was a member of the Pennsylvania Council of Censors in 1783, and was elected a delegate to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Congress_9db6.html" title="Continental Congress">Continental Congress</a> from <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2.html" title="November 2">November 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/8/1785.html" title="1785">1785</a> until <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_28.html" title="November 28">November 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/8/1787.html" title="1787">1787</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_St._Clair_11c7.html" title="Edit section: Northwest Territory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Northwest Territory</span></h2>
<p>Under the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwest_Ordinance_2859.html" title="Northwest Ordinance">Northwest Ordinance</a> of 1787, which created the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Northwest_Territory_5f9d.html" title="United States Northwest Territory">Northwest Territory</a>, General St. Clair was appointed governor of what is now <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana.html" title="Indiana">Indiana</a>, <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>, along with parts of <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin.html" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota.html" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>. He named <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati%2C_Ohio_33af.html" title="Cincinnati, Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a> after the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_the_Cincinnati_17a7.html" title="Society of the Cincinnati">Society of the Cincinnati</a>, and it was there that he established his home. When the territory was divided in 1800, he served as governor of the <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Territory_bbcd.html" title="Ohio Territory">Ohio Territory</a>.</p>
<p>As Governor, he formulated <i>Maxwell's Code,</i> the first written laws of the territory. He also sought to end Native American claims to Ohio land and clear the way for white settlement. In 1789, he succeeded in getting certain Indians to sign the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Fort_Harmar_feea.html" title="Treaty of Fort Harmar">Treaty of Fort Harmar</a>, but many native leaders had not been invited to participate in the negotiations, or had refused to do so. Rather than settling the Indian's claims, the treaty provoked them to further resistance in what is sometimes known as the "<a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwest_Indian_War_0466.html" title="Northwest Indian War">Northwest Indian War</a>" (or "Little Turtle's War"). Mutual hostilities led to a campaign by General <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josiah_Harmar_3fdd.html" title="Josiah Harmar">Josiah Harmar</a>, whose 1,500 militiamen were defeated by the Indians in October 1790.</p>
<p>In 1791, St. Clair succeeded Harmar as the senior general of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a>. He personally led a punitive expedition comprising militia and two Regular Army regiments. This force advanced to the location of Indian settlements on the <a href="../../../w/a/b/Wabash_River_bb2b.html" title="Wabash River">Wabash River</a>, but on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_4.html" title="November 4">November 4</a> they were routed in battle by a tribal confederation led by <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami_tribe.html" title="Miami tribe">Miami</a> Chief <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michikinikwa.html" title="Michikinikwa">Little Turtle</a> and Shawnee chief <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Jacket_4343.html" title="Blue Jacket">Blue Jacket</a>. More than 600 soldiers and scores of women and children were killed in the battle, called St. Clair's Defeat, the "Columbia Massacre," or the "<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Wabash_f983.html" title="Battle of the Wabash">Battle of the Wabash</a>." It was the greatest defeat of the American army by Native Americans in history. After this debacle, he resigned from the Army at the request of <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President</a> Washington, but continued to serve as Governor of the Northwest Territory.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Federalist_Party_06ea.html" title="United States Federalist Party">Federalist</a>, St. Clair hoped to see two states made of the Ohio Territory in order to increase Federalist power in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congress_8653.html" title="United States Congress">Congress</a>. However, he was resented by Ohio Democratic-Republicans for what were perceived as his partisanship, high-handededness and arrogance in office. In 1802, his opposition to plans for Ohio statehood led President Thomas Jefferson to remove him from office as territorial governor. He thus played no part in the organizing of the State of <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> in 1803. The first <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Constitution_7bc1.html" title="Ohio Constitution">Ohio Constitution</a> provided for a weak governor and a strong <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislature.html" title="Legislature">legislature</a>, in part due to a reaction to St. Clair's method of governance.</p>
<p>St. Clair died in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greensburg%2C_Pennsylvania_710e.html" title="Greensburg, Pennsylvania">Greensburg, Pennsylvania</a> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_31.html" title="August 31">August 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/1/1818.html" title="1818">1818</a> in his eighties and in poverty; his vast wealth dissipated by generous gifts and loans, and by business reverses.</p>
