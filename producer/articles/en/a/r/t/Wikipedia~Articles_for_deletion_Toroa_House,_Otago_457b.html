<li>If they are registered historic places, then please provide evidence of same. Six out of the nine listed were opened after 1940. I rather doubt the claim these are all considered historic places. Having a distinct identity does not make them notable. As C.fred noted below, "dorms" is a common term to describe residence halls in American English. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 16:53, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A number of them are <i>probably</i> similar to the AmE "dorm". My thought on this is that those that are notable (and should be kept) will, given the rivalry between them, lead to their recreation at a future date. Some of them may be a little generic, but they don't seem to be doing much harm. I found out a number of interesting things about Arana (relating to the Colombo Plan), that I had previously been unaware of.</dd>

<li>Hoo-eee! So, er, it appears that the only 3 that I've actually read until now (Knox, Selwyn, Arana) have any real merit. Arana could still do with some cleaning up, and I'm not sure whether it's because it contains more history, or because Arana *is* more notable, but the rest of them seem pretty bad. I'd perhaps revise to keeping those 3 and merging the rest into a non-descript article. --<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 23:30, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Having been involved with several Commonwealth universities in four Commonwealth countries and having visited several US universities, I do think there is at least a difference of emphasis between US dorms and Commonwealth Colleges and Halls. So let us use Commonwealth nomenclature and Commonwealth precedents rather than US ones. The way these Commonwealth Colleges and Halls are dealt with on WP varies. Some universities have separate articles and some have collective articles. One example of the latter is <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Exeter_Halls_of_Residence_b68a.html" title="University of Exeter Halls of Residence">University of Exeter Halls of Residence</a> that arose after a very similar broad Afd discussion earlier this year. Another is <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monash_Residential_Services_bef8.html" title="Monash Residential Services">Monash Residential Services</a>, again after a broad Afd discussion. The different title is because that page existed for the organisation that manages the Halls. I agree with the nom that many Hall articles are vanity and are often the first article written on Wikipedia by a member of the Hall. They can suffer from vandalism. Nevertheless they can be made into usefull articles. I think readers of WP have an expectation to be able to find NPOV information on University Colleges and Halls. They are very significant parts of many Commonwealth Universities, particularly the older more established Universities such as the University of Otago. So my view is to <b>keep</b> them all. If that is not the consensus I would support keeping the two Colleges which are really quite notable and which have links to the Church and the training of ministers, and perhaps some others, and <b>merge</b> the rest into a new article University of Otago Halls of Residence. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 00:50, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. In line with that thinking, I would say that <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massey_University_db38.html" title="Massey University">Massey University</a> has something in the line of 'dorms', effectively just different blocks of the same, with shared dining facilities. Some of the newer Colleges here (NB: the university is in the process of changing all of their institutions to 'colleges') are more dorm-ish, but the older ones are moving toward a more Oxford/Cambridge sense of College (albeit perhaps only midway on that continuum).--<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 01:19, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> pre Bduke and Limegreen. At the very least, Selwyn and Knox's articles should be kept with the others merged (if this is done, Salmond's should be merged with Knox's). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 00:57, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I thought of that option this morning, but I don't anticipate that ex-Salmond residents would take to kindly to that. I'm also inclined to believe that any merge/delete is likely to increase vandalism. --<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 01:19, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Comment: "Wikipedia caters for a multitude of viewers and ex-residents find articles about their former halls very useful about who to contact re: reunions etc. I believe that calling the Halls of Residences (now all offically colleges) dormitaries violates the very tradition in Otago. Some of these halls, eg Selwyn and Knox are officially registered as historic buildings. Infact, Selwyn College is the most popular Hall in New Zealand. We need to keep these articles on Wikipedia so they can be enjoyed by the many people that look them up" Lloyd Burr</p>
<ul>
<li><b>merge</b> into a single article, none are individually notable (though as others mentioned, some are borderline). Halls of Residence at other NZ varsitys should probably also be looked at. --<a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako_0eb9.html" title="User:Mako">Mako</a> 07:48, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Knox and Selwyn are not 'dorms'!</b> Both deserve keeping even outside of their university context, if only for the buildings, history, and alumni. And of course Salmond's shouldn't be merged with Knox's, the one and only similarity is the joint-ownership and governership at a board (not management) level. Understand rationale behind not including 'dorms' but both are prestigious colleges with returning students, illustrious histories and significant buildings. They certainly have an identity outside the university, in a way that other halls at the university simply don't.</p>
