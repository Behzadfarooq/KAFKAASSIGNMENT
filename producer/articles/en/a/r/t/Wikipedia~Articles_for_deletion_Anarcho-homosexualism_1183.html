<li><b>Not Delete</b> The Anarcho-homosexualism is not only legitimate but is also a quickly growing movement. Much like the Log Cabin Republicans who advocate homosexuality in the conservative party, these anarcho-homosexuals advocate homosexuality as an important aspect in libertarian-style anarchy. Although sources are important, this is a relatively new grassroots movement and information on the issue is very scarce. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.127.241.240 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.127.241.240_4be2.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.127.241.240">contribs</a>) 23:49, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</small>

<p>The amount of sources containing this factual information does not take away from its validity. The reason for the scarcity of information is because people such as those wanting to remove this article always claim that sources must be based on information found in other sources in order to be true. Someone has to initially start the literature on the topic or else that argument will be used for every new topic. Let this article stay as is until new information either invalidates specific information or add additional information. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.127.241.240 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.127.241.240_4be2.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.127.241.240">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I've never seen anyone identify as an "anarcho-homosexualist". I'm getting no google hits when "anarcho-homosexualism" is put in quotes. I'd say it's OR and a neologism as there does not seem to be any established movement with this name. The term "queer anarchism" does get some hits, which I expected since there is a queer-oriented trend within anarchism (similar in nature to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcha-feminism.html" title="Anarcha-feminism">anarcha-feminism</a>). There is even a queer anarchist flag (like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Anarchist_flag.svg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Anarchist_flag.svg" rel="nofollow">anarcho-syndicalist</a> one but with pink instead of red). I wouldn't be opposed to an article on queer anarchism, but even that would probably be mostly OR since most anarchists would inherently support queer liberation anyway and few anarchists have focused on queer issues specifically. Anyways, most anarchists who <i>do</i> focus on queer issues would use the term queer, not homosexual since homosexual isn't inclusive, which casts further doubt on this article's veracity. <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 04:53, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- Seriously I think there could be a good article here, about lesbian and gay anarchists/anarchism. However, this article just seems too trolled to have any hope of turning into that.... And, people are right about the "google test" -- there are feminist anarchists, and there are gay/lesbian anarchists, but people commonly call feminist anarchism anarcha-feminism, whereas no one really seems to call homosexual anarchism, anarcho-homosexualism... it seems to be too much a rare/made up term to refer to a real phenomenon. In part, I think (as The Ungovernable Force has well put), lesbian/gay anarchism is (correct me if I'm wrong) most often not sufficiently distinctive in its thought or praxis to need to be described under a specific term, whereas for feminist anarchism there is more distinction of thought/praxis. Anyway, delete this, but hope that someone will one day write a better article, under a better title as well. --<a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a> 12:04, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I've heard some people call it anarcho-homosexualism, but it's more of a new pc term used to describe the movement, Queer Anarchy is also used in addition to less common term "gaynarchy". Many don't refer to it as anarchy at all for PR reasons, but the movement does exist. There's a movement in San Francisco called <a href="http://www.gayshamesf.org/about.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gayshamesf.org/about.html" rel="nofollow">"Gay Shame"</a> which promotes what could be described as anarcho-homosexualism.

That being said I feel sorry for them because I think this article acutually deserves some attention. I think the problem here is that the page needs more work put into it.
