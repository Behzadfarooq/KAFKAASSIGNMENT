<li><b>Keep</b> 1. This article has already been voted for to be kept, 2. The vast amount of internet sites that describe a circumcision fetish make it certain it is not simply made up or Original Research. That there are no reliable sources (medical peer reviewed journals providing articles about circumcision fetish) is not reason to delete it, as few fetishes as described on Wikipedia would actually qualify under that standard. It would open a slippery slope that would legitimize removal of most if not all fetish articles and ultimately most if not all wikipedia articles. Dabljuh 15:10, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If there are a <i>vast</i> number of sites that describe circumcision fetishes, why isn't there even <i>one</i> circumcision fetish site cited in the article (as distinguished from some isolated quotes on political advocacy sites)? The slippery slope argument is odd. No one is proposing removing <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foot_fetish.html" title="Foot fetish">foot fetish</a>, because foot fetishes aren't <i>completely fabricated</i>. In fact, it turns out that <i>no reliable sources</i> is, in fact, <i>one of the best reasons to delete an article.</i> That's because Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a collection of things that <b>people just made up</b>. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 15:45, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>The first is not an encyclopaedic source. The second is mildly interesting - and probably the closest to a suitable source yet suggested - but only mentions it in passing, failing to define it, and unfortunately does not specify <i>who</i> these 'many' are. The third makes no mention of fetishism, only a preference.

<dd>Jake, I think most reasonable people would agree that the following is a good example of a circumcision fetish:
<dl>
<dd>The Ultimate Circumcision Video. Filmed in Phoenix, Az after a heated contest between the Champion, Max, and his opponent, Jon. The raging battle for the conquest of manhood where only one will walk away a MAN ends in the loser being CIRCUMCISED. His glans bare and a scar to show his defeat.</dd>
<dd>Max, the Circumcision Master, preps the still warm, pink loose foreskin for it's exicution. First the Betadine, then the EMLA cream to numb the sensative nerves. The audience of 20 naked men (mostly CIRCUMCISED...ready to welcome a new member to their people) gasp as the Tara KLamp is placed over the doomed foreskin...then clasped...then......CIRCUMCISED!</dd>

<dd>That may be so, Dan, but it doesn't answer my question. The standard for Wikipedia is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, not truth. Perhaps we have a skeptical reader who looks at this and thinks, "pretty strange stuff, but I wonder if it's really a fetish in the technical sense". What scholarly sources exist to allow him to verify that this is indeed a circumcision fetish? <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 23:15, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Although I (very weakly) supported keeping Foreskin fetish, this article strikes me as much less believable and less likely to be an actual fetish. Again, many of the fetish articles are problematic in similar ways, but this "fetish," if it really exists, seems so minor and marginal as to be unremarkable and unencyclopaedic. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 18:11, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In my opinion the <a href="http://www.icon.co.za/~hugot/circum/circum.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.icon.co.za/~hugot/circum/circum.htm" rel="nofollow">Short Circumcision Stories</a> on the CIRCLIST South Africa web site is evidence of circumcision fetishism. The <a href="http://www.cuttingclub.de/" class="external text" title="http://www.cuttingclub.de/" rel="nofollow">Cutting Club</a> web site is also evidence of circumcision fetishism. The following from the main CIRCLIST web site is also evidence.

<dd>"Like me, this guy also had a <b>circumcision fetish</b>. He loved thinking about it and planning it. So, our first sex play began with you show me your skanky skin, and I'll show you how one looks after it's had an adult circumcision. He worshiped my scar with his tongue. He sucked my flared, bare head. He begged me to fuck (dock) inside his boy-skin. I eventually bent him over and fucked his uncircumcised boy-ass. Our first time together was all about foreskin and circumcision. It was very hot. During future activities, we always included talk about my circumcision and his pending circumcision in our play. We even began simulating his own circumcision....tying him down and placing film canisters under his skin, etc. Eventually we bought a Gomco and a Tara clamp for our play. After about one year, we actually had him circumcised, which was very hot."</dd>

<dd>"Now, we look for other "boys" who still have their little baby-skins. We enjoy playing with them and helping them to get circumcised too (if that's what they ultimately want.) It's amazing how many uncut guys have a <b>circumcision fetish</b> (or can at least be turned on by fantasy play about circumcising them, usually ritually) Even if they would never want to ultimately get the cut, like my friend and partner did, many enjoy fantasizing about it.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a sexual fetish where the subject of the sexual desire is a non-sexual item: The circumcision itself.

<li><b>Delete</b> with reluctance. The article presents no information beyond what can be inferred from the title, Circumcision fetish, itself. If the article could be expanded to include additional, non-trivial information about the topic, then, clearly I think, it would warrant keeping. Unfortunately, it appears that there is a lack of reliable sources that could provide such information meaning any expansion of the article would require original research. Perhaps in the future research about this subject will be published upon which an aritcle could be based.

<li><b>Keep</b> "If there are a vast number of sites that describe circumcision fetishes, why isn't there even one circumcision fetish site cited in the article (as distinguished from some isolated quotes on political advocacy sites)?" Circumcision fetish sites don't necessarily describe themselves as such. Circlist and The Acorn Club are clear examples. The "isolated quotes" are many and consistent. Features of the stories they tell are an obsessive focus on the details of circumcision and aspects of humiliation, submission and "punishment" (Humiliation fetishism is listed as one of the common types). <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHugh7_d3fe.html" title="User:Hugh7">Hugh7</a> 08:08, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
