<p>No context on this, so I'm not really sure what this is, but a google search for X3i Rifes returns five hits. This does not give me confidence of notability. <a href="http://forum.fanfilmsforum.com/index.php?showtopic=5796" class="external text" title="http://forum.fanfilmsforum.com/index.php?showtopic=5796" rel="nofollow">This</a> reveals it to be a student film that has yet to be shown anywhere notable. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 20:44, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This has already being played on The Ohio State University campus. If you search on X3i Divinity more sites would come up on google. Its a popular internet series as well. Four episodes are finished, have been on television (and still are) and the Four episodes are online.</p>
<p>This is my first time posting on Wikipedia but I am trying to follow the guidelines as best I can (and as quickly as I can). Please give me some time.</p>
<p>The show plays on the "Buckeye TV" channel, which is already on Wikipedia. I'm just branching off on this specific series.</p>
<p>Are you all going to allow me to create the X3i page?</p>

<p>What needs to be done?? This is an Ohio State television series that is played on Buckeye TV, whhich is already on wikipedia. This is Ohio States first sci/fi drama television series. And to our knowledge thus far, the first sci/fi drama series created at Any college. Just because it didnt come up in a main search in google, shouldnt mean much. There is some dell out there with the name X3i, which makes it hard to find under google. Like I said, if u search "X3i Divinity" or "X3i Cobra Productions" more options would come up. Please do not delete this after all the work we have been putting into it all day long. Especially after this late of notice..</p>

<p>Im still lost on the whole situation.</p>
<p>I do not understand your stance that Buck-i TV as a station is of significance for your site, yet the programming on the station is not (even if the given program is on the current roster of available shows as it has been for approximately two years.) I'm sure you are aware of the vast number of persons who attend The Ohio State University, and though they may not all watch the show, it is available to them via the network. I think the popularity of this actual show is only as relevant as the popularity of the network it appears on. Again, Buck-i TV made the cut. Also, about your request for a valid or notable review, I point to Buck-i TV as our source. Any notable review of the station would naturally have an overview of the programming. If that event has occured anytime within the last two years, X3i would have been a part of that review. Although I do not have any specific article to point out to you or that information readily at hand, it seems only natural that these two things would be connected. Our popular success is not soley connected to Buck-i TV, though. Our series and upcoming movie have had various viewings and reviews from multiple websites (and forums). I understand that you have rules and regulations, but it seems illogical that these criteria would invalidate the experiences and opinions of a rather large online, interactive community. I really do not wish to be confrontational about this. Any personal investment I may have in this project witholding, I still believe that the crux of this argument is that X3i is real, it is visible and consumable, and it is part of a network/community that is, or at least should be, recognized. I thank you for your time and hope to hear from you regarding this matter once again.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - individual series that only appear on one college tv station are not quite notable enough.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Revelations" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Revelations" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Revelations</a></p>
<p>This is a link to a wikipedia page for an internet fan film which did not have a national theater release. Though, I do not doubt it's notability, it does cast a shadow over the arguement made regarding X3i's non-theater release and significance. At the bottom of the linked page is a list of other such internet fan films, mostly regarding Star Wars (unofficially) that also fail to meet the release criteria.</p>
<p>Because I feel this debate is becoming circular, and I feel as though no matter what evidence or arguements I present I will be countered with continued, perhaps repetitive rebuttal, I am beginning to question the overall objectivity of this evaluation. I would like to state that X3i as a series or movie, nor its creators, are seeking this inclusion into the Wikipedia database as a means for promotion or even validation. Our own accomplishments with the network, internet viewings, and forums are satisfying enough for both of those departments.</p>
<p>I am being told now, as before, that X3i is failing to meet this or that certain criteria, but I feel I have provided sufficient evidence or argument to the contrary on all accounts. Aside from that, many of these supposed requirements being presented are not requirements even being met by other wikipedia entries.</p>
<p>-AXanderSR</p>
<p>ps - this is proof of X3i playing on many college campus's across the states. We play on OSTN</p>

   "Keep this article because you have other ones just as bad" is not a valid argument. Address the concerns raised about this one. User:Zoe|(talk) 17:29, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

   I think you will find five other people at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/X3i who will tell you the exact same thing. User:Zoe|(talk) 17:47, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>See, that is the sort of argument I was talking about--circular. You failed to present a case against the majority of my statements. One film being THE exception is not a valid or objective point. Who or what exactly determines what is or is not an exception? It is also untrue. I directed you to the bottom of the page where there are links to other such fan films. I guess I will have to lay them out for you.</p>

<p>ALSO, please note that X3i DOES have a notable network showing on Buck-i TV and is the ONLY student series from OSU, shown on OSTN.</p>

<p>SO, the series is more than a mere burb on some insignificant local college station, it aires on televisions across multiple college universities. As a courtesy of debate, I would appreciate if you would take the time and consideration to provide clear and concise reasoning for your arguements, as well as meet each point or topic within my rebuttals. I do not think that is too much to ask.</p>
<p>I never made any judgements about the quality of the other productions. The greatest concern you have brought up is a clear lack of professionalism, tact, and objectivity. I doubt Wikipedia or any other professional institution would accept your words as being representative of their own. You have failed to address several concerns and FACTS being brought up about the topic, and I do not wish to continue this "debate" with you. I would like to speak to another moderator, who, hopefully, will display the positive qualities you seem to lack.</p>
<p>I think those five people would have the sense to look at the same evidence and arguments that have been presented to you with objective clarity and worthwhile commentary.</p>
