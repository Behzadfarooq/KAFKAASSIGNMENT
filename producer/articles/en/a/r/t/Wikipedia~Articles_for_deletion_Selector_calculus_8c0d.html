<p>Completely uncritical article on alleged mathematical background for a cranky topic called <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heim_theory.html" title="Heim theory">Heim theory</a>. See <a href="../../../s/e/l/Talk%7ESelector_calculus_7d5b.html" title="Talk:Selector calculus">talk page</a> for various comments to the effect that there is no such topic known in mathematics, and the unmotivated claims made without proof in the article run counter to well-known mathematical knowledge. The existing article on <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heim_theory.html" title="Heim theory">Heim theory</a> seems adequate without littering the WP with a half dozen articles on subtopics which are not part of mainstream knowledge. This is an encyclopedia and it should focus on mainstream knowledge, not attempt to give exhaustive descriptions of every crank theory which has ever been proposed! <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 22:20, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>How dare you call this a cranky theory. Heim was known to Heisenberg and worked with Jourdan and Von Weizacker. Just becuase he was somewhat eccentric in eschewing the normal academic processes in favour of a hermetic existence does not give you the right to label him with repulsive epithets such as 'crank' - he was removed from that category in Wikipedia long ago.

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't know what's going on with the Heim business, but there is no mathematical subject of selector calculus AFAIK nor do the standard mathematical resources such as MathSciNet mention it. The article doesn't even make clear what "selector calculus" <i>is</i>. Given its lack of references and general lack of clarity, I fear this article might be falling into the original research category. I think we should focus on these issues, rather than confuse the matter by in effect merging this discussion with the Heim theory discussion. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 11:07, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Among other problems, one is that this article doesn't define what selector calculus is. Thus, there is no way to validate it, or to discuss its technical merits, or to apply it in any real-life calculation. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 14:57, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, per Chan-Ho. Unverifiable. Since the article mentions language difficulties, I also looked through <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zentralblatt_MATH_3e98.html" title="Zentralblatt MATH">Zentralblatt MATH</a> to cover the German literature, but with no success. The New Scientist article does not mention selector calculus. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 12:49, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems to be part of Heim's production. As the article says, it is supposed to be something like <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tensor_calculus.html" title="Tensor calculus">tensor calculus</a> but without infinitesimals or limits tending to 0. Apparently it is covered in Part III (pages 99-172) of <i>"Elementarstrukturen der Materie 1: Einheitliche strukturelle Quantenfeldtheorie der Materie und Gravitation"</i> by Heim, published in 1978/1980 and a second edition in 1989.--<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 01:22, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: it's good that a reference has been provided, but the problems with the article remains. Additionally, the reference is good if someone were able to understand it and write an article based on it, but that doesn't appear to be the case here. It still doesn't explain what selector calculus is, although it says it's "something like" something else and makes an unsubstantiated claim that it is something very near tensor calculus. The only other info in the article is rather muddled and nonsensical:
<blockquote>
<p>"The approach differs from conventional differential calculus which does not place a finite lower bound on infinitesimals. In selector calculus, the limit of Riemann sums taken to infinity has no physical interpretation, as the smallest unit of measure is a metron, rather than infinitesimal."</p>
</blockquote>
Since I know "conventional differential calculus", I can say this comparison is wrong as it shows a misunderstanding of calculus. The article also says, "See Heim theory for details." Well, if the article on selector calculus refers to another article for an explanation of what selector calculus <i>is</i>, what's the point of having such an article? Since all the details are apparently in the Heim theory article anyway, a merge would appear pointless; I'm sticking with my 'delete' vote. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 18:39, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: As someone has added the above reference to the article, I think we should know how you got that reference and why you think the selector calculus is "apparently" covered in it. There's an issue of verifiability here, besides the other issues that have been mentioned. (Note: I have removed the reference from the article as I don't believe at this point that the editor had actually used the reference to verify the information) --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 10:27, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: This might be from <a href="http://www.datadiwan.de/netzwerk/index_e.htm?/heim/he_002e_.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.datadiwan.de/netzwerk/index_e.htm?/heim/he_002e_.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> (the German version is better if you can read it), which says: "Accordingly, a whole chapter in [1] is devoted to the development of a difference calculus considering the finite area [the metron]. This enables any differential expression to be metronized." However, the basic problem remains: the article is not encyclopaedic because it does not attempt to define selector calculus, and it also seems to be not notable: it is not clear whether the calculus has been used by anybody but Buckhard Heim himself, and even if it has, nobody except for the handful of people working on Heim theory have used it. So, I remain of the opinion that the article should be deleted. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 14:08, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Merge</b> Based on Jitse Niesen's comment above, would it be a satisfactory alternative to merge the article with the existing articles related to Heim? Perhaps not notable in and of itself, but since it shows up in Heim theory, perhaps this would be a better alternative. I would not want to lose this content - it is not written very well compared to other articles, but surely if someone had the time to look at it, they could exapand the material. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 14:20, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
