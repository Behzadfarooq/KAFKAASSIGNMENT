<p>Original research, not a reputable source, not an important subject. Could be a hoax. I'm also adding many other pages in the category "Maltese nobility". Either they are unsourced, or they come from a small family of web sites. None of these web sites cite their sources. This subject would be of minor encyclopedic interest if a <b>reputable</b> source could be found. Historically, they may be interesting (but not without a good source). As for now, they look like vanity pages. Even if they do exist and have some bona fide claim to their titles, they would still be vanity pages if they're not mentioned anywhere in a reputable source. I'm not an expert, but apparently something like Burke's Peerage is a good source. There is no use in listing all of these baronies/noblethings as separate entries. It is promotion or vanity. Apparently it is all based on a single web site anyways. The user who made most of these has been notified on his talk page <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">User:Tancarville</a></p>
<p>At best, they could make a single page referring to Malta nobility, their committee, with good sources, and then put in a link to their web page. Many of these pages were already listed as unsourced or original research.</p>

<p>Perhaps we should consider letting the article writer put in better sources. In these types of articles, the reference should be to an individual page in these books or at least a chapter, so that someone can borrow the book in their local library and check them. But since nearly all of these pages are written by a single author, and these types of pages may embroil Wikipedia in the less-reputable sale and promotion of old useless or practically extinct nobility titles, I think it is better to delete them. Also, note the possibility that most of the text here has been copied wholesale from one of the older book sources, hence breaking copyright/GFDL.</p>
<p>Also, could someone look for these pages in other language Wikipedias? - <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanbrogger_b0ef.html" title="User:Janbrogger">Janbrogger</a> 10:35, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm tempted to say that anybody who'd pay money in order to call himself "count", "baron" or whatever deserves whatever fleecing he gets, but I suppose I should be charitable toward the vain and silly. Yes, the whole thing looks like a vanity scheme, which may or may not be based on facts -- which would anyway be rather silly and trivial facts. There's an emphasis on the present day, but no claim that I can see that these titles have any significance whatever in the present day. I hesitate to say "<b>delete</b> the lot" because I haven't even glanced at the whole lot, but they do look feeble. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 11:02, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Still delete the lot</b>. The <b>big question</b> here is sources. Wikipedia articles <b>must, must, must</b> be based on reliable, reputable and verifiable sources. If the sources were there, I agree we should keep a subset of these articles. However, the reason that I nominated the lot is that the sources are extremely dubious. Apart from that, and adding weight to the deletion question is that these are NN, potentially ladden with copyright, and embroils Wikipedia in the dubious claims of "lost" nobility titles (as I suspected, and has been verified. Wikipedia will not even inch forward towards encyclopedic fame and reliability unless sources, sources, sources are emphasized. I'm an MD, PhD with a strong academic interest. It really is vital.

<li>I'd suggest that we re-open the prior deision that pertains to the lot of them. The consensus reached about these articles back in early 2005 was that none of them were technically "original research," they were generally notable and verifiable (if with some difficulty), and as such they should remain. Several things have changed since then: verifiability and reference requirements have been substantially tightened, and the number of Maltese nobility articles has substantially increased, and arguably reaches to dubious claims or minor figure. Finally, there's the new claim that some or all of them represent hoaxes. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 17:14, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I find all of this quite...bizarre. <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta.html" title="Malta">Malta</a> today has a population of about 400,000; with the long list of noble families listed at <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maltese_nobility.html" title="Maltese nobility">Maltese nobility</a> (which seems to be the central hub article of all this strange stuff) and a rough estimate of Malta's population in the 1700s, it looks like about one in ten Maltese citizens woud have been a baron. Additionaly, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maltese_nobility.html" title="Maltese nobility">Maltese nobility</a> claims that most of these titles were created either directly by or under the influence of <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_I_of_Russia_ddc6.html" title="Paul I of Russia">Paul I of Russia</a> - I'm by no means an expert on 18th century history, but our own article on Paul I merely states that he gave refuge to the Knights Hospitallers <i>after</i> they were ejected from Malta, not that he ever did anything special on the island, let alone ever visited it. I'm inclined to say <b>delete the lot</b> as unverified and very probable, if elaborate, hoax - additionally, I think some serious fact-checking by someone with access to detailed and reliable books on Maltese history is in order. Depending on the findings of the research, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maltese_nobility.html" title="Maltese nobility">Maltese nobility</a> needs to be substantially rewtitten/expanded to explain either why there is such a ridiculously high density of noble titles, or to explain the fact that all of this is a hoax (which in itself seems widespread and notable enough to merit a mention in the article). This last point is technically not a part of the Afd discussion, but now that the issue has been brought up, we should not forget it once the Afd is closed -- <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerkelparade_da80.html" title="User:Ferkelparade">Ferkelparade</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFerkelparade_2c87.html" title="User talk:Ferkelparade">π</a> 19:16, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Answer</b> The Maltese were closely aligned with the Knights of St John and the Papacy. Of course there was never more then 5% of the population that were titled, though up to 10% of the population would have been nobility. 45% that claim to be of noble ancestry. The rest of the population were made up of working class people and slavery. -- <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a> 08:34, 25 July 2006 (EST)</li>

There are no notability concerns here; if the claims in these articles are true, then they are valid entries for an encyclopedia. However, I have to agree with the above posters that the lack of reliable sources is fatal. For example, the "references" section of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counts_of_G%C4%A7ajn_Tuffie%C4%A7a_7fa5.html" title="Counts of Għajn Tuffieħa">Counts of Għajn Tuffieħa</a> contains two websites (neither of which appears to cite any sources other than the other) and some "Unpublished research papers", which are obviously completely useless for our purposes.<br />
I am not convinced that there is any hoaxing going on. It's a commonplace that small European nations have disproportionately large aristocracies, and I can't see anything obviously implausible in the claims of the sample of articles I checked. However, the simple fact remains that Wikipedia requires that it be possible to verify articles in their entirety from the sources cited -- all the more so when the article has been accused of being a hoax! -- and at present I'm not capable of that, which means something is badly wrong. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 20:05, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Tancarville also posted this on JanBrogger's userpage [User talk:Jan Brogger]: Do you really know what your doing by deleting all of the Maltese nobility? There are already previous requests for deletion and some were deleted and some were not. If its all based on references then check and ask. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a> 08:39, 21 July 2006 (EST)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tancarville has now added the exact same set of references listed above to all the pages. This is an improvement, but still falls short of adequate references. First of all, the references themselves must be improved so that it would in fact be possible to get the books. Citing "various editions" is imprecise - please provide at least 1 or 2 actual editions and their info (ISBNs/publisher, year etc). For any recent books, ISBNs should be listed. The "Adami Collection" is clearly inadequate - is it a book? When, where, by whom was it published? According to a Google search the Adami may be "The Adami Collection Database birth records for Malta ". The second problem is the preciseness of references. You cannot simply cite a whole database, and similarly it is not good practice to cite a lump set of 10 books. For each and every noble title, actual page numbers or at least chapters should be produced. In Library of Congress and Amazon, the only book I found of the ones listed "Nicholas de Piro: Casa Rocca Piccola: Home of a Maltese Noble Family, 74 Republic Street, Valetta, Malta: An Historic House, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1871684757</a>".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I did find the Publishers Enterprise Group. Apparently all the books he has listed are available from their web site. E.g. "The Genealogy and Heraldry of the Noble Families of Malta (Vol1)" is listed at <a href="http://peg.hanut.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=317&amp;Identifier=c24a405c8efa07e7e1e8e2908682e07d" class="external autonumber" title="http://peg.hanut.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=317&amp;Identifier=c24a405c8efa07e7e1e8e2908682e07d" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and has ISBN <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 99909-0-329-8</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Let me reiterate again that it is sources and original research that is the problem - I have nothing against Maltese nobility. In fact, I would be quite happy to have the articles there if in fact they have good sources and only a minimum of original research. As an example of what I think is acceptable research and sourcing is:
<ul>
<li>referencing the Adami collection with an actual record number, or enough information that I can find it myself (potentially).</li>
<li>Enough detail on the books to easily be able to retrieve them, with precise enough references (chapters at least).
<ul>
<li>Well these references cover all of the Maltese nobility, but I will need to go through each one to cite page, chapter, isbn etc. Thats no problem, but I shall need time hopefully completed in several days. I do realise that I was asked before and never got around to completing this task. This certainly has gotten myself to do something that should have been done originally.<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Tancarville</a> 22:41, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And still, Tancarville has not answered the "original research" charge. His pages clearly state that this is his own research, which is not allowed. What is his own research, and what is taken from the books?</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Question</b>: "The Present Count", you say. I took a look at <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maltese_nobility.html" title="Maltese nobility">Maltese nobility</a> and there read: <i>The Maltese nobility consist of those titles of nobility recognised by the British and those titles never presented to, or failed recognition by, the Royal Commission, even though the titles were of historical relevance. .&#160;.&#160;. and Foreign titles which were either confirmed or inherited by a person of Maltese descent.</i> That's slightly unclear at the start, but toward the end it seems to me to indicate that the nobility is a matter of the <i>past.</i> My reading of articles about Malta informs me that Malta is a republic, a parliamentary democracy with a directly elected unicameral assembly. I see no particular space within this for nobility and no mention of nobles. Oddly, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Category%7EMaltese_society_95fa.html" title="Category:Maltese society">Category:Maltese society</a> lacks an article on Maltese society, but again as I look around I see no indication of the significance of this "nobility". I therefore tentatively infer that, whatever significance Maltese nobility may have had in the past, it is now merely a matter of personal amusement, snobbery (membership of "old money") or whatever. (And the "now" seems not to date from independence; rather, <a href="http://www.maltadata.com/maltavot.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.maltadata.com/maltavot.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> seems to imply that political significance of the nobility disappeared in 1921 if not earlier.) What significance does membership of the nobility have now? If it has no real significance, then what's the justification for describing those "title holders" (such as the present "Count Sant Fournier") who postdate its loss of significance? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:33, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I couldn't listen, as the file is in proprietary Windows format. I did skimread two or three of the interviews, and the gist seems to be that, whatever significance the titles had in the past, they have no significance now. (A contino writes: <i><a href="http://www.maltagenealogy.com/SME/Vellabonavita.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.maltagenealogy.com/SME/Vellabonavita.htm" rel="nofollow">I doubt the general population occupies any of its waking hours thinking about the nobility.</a></i>) This reinforces my view that coverage of the "nobility" should stop when the nobility ceased to have political or social significance. Again, I don't claim to know when that was, but my impression is that it was no later than 1921. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 08:08, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't understand who it is that you are asking here. As for me, no, I don't believe that "Maltese nobility" is, in its entirety, a hoax. But the long list doesn't impress me at all. Let's take "Sir Temistole Zammit, Kt.Bach." as an (interestingly named) example: I'd say that if he is noteworthy for what he <i>did</i>, he deserves an article; and that if he's slightly noteworthy for what he did, he deserves a part of a larger article -- but that his mere existence in some genealogical record is not something of any concern to Wikipedia. I'm also wondering why nobody has explained just what the significance (to Maltese politics, economics, society, etc.) was of its nobility, when and how its significance (apparently) fizzled to nothing, or why it is worth mentioning who have been the Counts, Continos, etc., of what, <i>after</i> this fizzling to nothing. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 01:49, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
