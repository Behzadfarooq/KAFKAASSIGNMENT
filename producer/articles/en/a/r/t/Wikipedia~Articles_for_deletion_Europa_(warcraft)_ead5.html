<li>Looks like you spent a lot of time and effort into it. Looks like it hasn’t been explained to you what non-notable and fancruft is, which isn’t fair to you. To he best of my knowledge, it means... that this was created by a fan and goes into too much detail for something that is relatively insignificant to the workings or parts of the game... um well I mean is that if “article may only be understandable by people who play Warcraft 3 or people who solely play the map itself and possibly StarCraft” that is very few people would be interested in unless you directly played the map, and if you did so, you probably know all of that anyway. <a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFledgeling_731d.html" title="User:Fledgeling">Fledgeling</a> 03:09, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I know of no known published source that could verify the article, plus people do NOT have to believe it. People of warcraft though could possibly use this article for tips on how to play the map. On warcraft though it generally seems though if a person is a noob at the game, and this map being complicated, they may get frustrated and not want to play it and could come to this and learn how to play. I'll put the believing statement in my disclaimer even more so people do not have to accept it as the outright truth. If they wish to truly know that it is correct they will do independent research.

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> <b>Speedy delete</b> CSD A7. NN fancruft. Look up what "cruft" means on a regular dictionary, then attach that to "fan" and "game". Basically, a really really bad article that only fans could appreciate or that pertains to a game. There is no way for you to fix this, because this does not belong to Wikipedia since it violates our policies (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>). You also say it yourself: "this is the only well-known source I know of that could be a home to this material". Wikipedia is not your personal webspace; get a free one such as <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geocities.html" title="Geocities">Geocities</a> or find a friend who will host it for you, or shell out with your own money for it. Sorry that your first article turns out like this, but we are an encyclopedia that serves the greatest good to the greatest number of people.

<li><b>Reply</b> There are a decent amount of articles which are a specific custom map for Warcraft 3. Look under the popular map section in <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warcraft_3.html" title="Warcraft 3">Warcraft 3</a>And I do not see the ones I have looked at been suggested for deletion. I view this as hypocritical and also you guys are not telling me what <i>exactly</i> is wrong with my article. I have been a wiki-member for less then 2 days and yet you critisize my article without telling me exactly how to change it to make it fit the standards, also if you dislike it enough you will make the edits yourself. I've been trying to change it to fit what standards I know of but still receive delete comments.<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowZach_d613.html" title="User:ShadowZach">Zach</a> 04:11, 1 June 2006 (UTC) I actually have gone through all the <i>other maps</i> section of warcraft 3 and find none of them but my own being recommended for deletion. They are all custom maps for a single game. The worse I found in a article was a cleanup request and a request to verify references. This is actually relevant to my article but it was actually recommended for deletion while the other was not.<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowZach_d613.html" title="User:ShadowZach">Zach</a> 04:15, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> But you see, that's the POINT. We CAN'T edit it because we DON'T KNOW ANYTHING about it since it is so non-notable. We <i>are</i> telling you what is exactly wrong with the article. We are deleting it because it's the SUBJECT MATTER that is the problem here, not merely the article itself. Thus, you cannot change anything about it. We understand that you are a new user and we are not criticizing you for this. We want to help you understand this process; however, despite the fact that you are a new member, the article must go. If you want, I can make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and nominate all of the other articles for deletion. Actually, that would not be a bad idea, considering they all probably violate the same principles.

<li><b>Give it Time</b> I understand your arguments but you must understand this was requested for deletion for less then a day it was created and less then a day I made an account for Wikipedia. During the time I have left over from school, sleep, and other activites/responsibilities I do not have much time to work on the ariticle and make it acceptable to what little amount of standards I have learned in a very short amount of time. I will try to work on it to make it acceptable but I simply think it was requested for deletion to quickly and I will accept and consider requests that may be done to the article; if you think I will put your requested part in the article in a wrong way you can simply add it yourself; I will not change it.If you guys give me time I think I can make this article acceptable <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowZach_d613.html" title="User:ShadowZach">Zach</a> 04:44, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Subject of the article is unacceptable fancruft, no matter how much time and effort you spend on it.

<li><b>ANGRY</b> Ok, seriously I am getting pissed off now. I have been given very little time to make this article acceptable and there is other articles like this. I am starting to find these comments hypocritical. If you wish to see other maps for Warcraft 3 go to <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warcraft_3.html" title="Warcraft 3">Warcraft 3</a> and then on the table of contents thing and go to other maps. There will be a list of maps including the Europa one which I did not put there but added the link to my article. None of these articles since last I checked have been suggested for deletion which makes me think some of the comments said here are hypocritical while the other articles have been there for many weeks/months but this is unknown to me but I know they've been there for awhile. Compared to mine me a noob to Wikipedia have been given very little time to make this article acceptable. I know I am repeating but it seems like people aren't getting my point. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowZach_d613.html" title="User:ShadowZach">Zach</a> 04:56, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Calming</b> I'm sorry you're getting "pissed off." The Wikipedia society is not attacking you. The term <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">fancruft</a> has nothing to do with the quality of the article. In fact, you wrote a great article and I hope you continue to contribute to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">Fancruft</a> suggests that the article is only understandable by a small group people who know about the subject. NN stands for non-notable; this just means that the article's subject is not large/popular enough of a topic to merit a Wikipedia article. About those other maps, I plan on nominating them for deletion soon. There are other sites that are designed for this purpose. --<a href="../../../d/a/k/User%7EDakart_88fd.html" title="User:Dakart">Dakart</a> 06:43, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> no serious reason for deliberation, but certainly reason not to piss him off. The article is getting better fast, which is certainly admirable. But the article's subject matter is not - just like we cannot have an article about the chair I am sitting in because it would be based entirely on me and not sources and because not enough encyclopedia-goers would be interested.

Hope that the creator reads up on the policies that have been linked and continues to work on Wikipedia: also that he recreates this article elsewhere. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 10:34, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. <i>Cruft</i> is a neologism, <i>fancruft</i> even more so, neither are widely used, it'd be nice if people explained these terms rather than assumed everyone is conversant in subculture jargon. --Coroebus 11:12, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>'<i>Comment</i>. You're right (although I do think the word is wicked cool), especially newcomers should not be subjected to unnecesarry slang. We should have been better at explaining this term early on and/or providing a link - something to take note of for the welcome commitee. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 11:20, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I can understand the confusion when other articles about specific maps are not deleted. Is there something different about those other maps, or is this just inconsistency. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 11:40, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as it is fairly consistant practice that mods and maps don't get articles unless they become enormously popular (ala Counterstrike). I also want to second what Coroebus and <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> stated above. Nominating someone's article for deletion is likely going to irritate them from the start. When they come here and see arcane references like "nn" and "cruft" it doesn't do much to encourage them to continue involvement here, or even explain to them what the problem is. In my opinion, <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a>'s deletion opinion is the right way to do things.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:47, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> To the creator: just copy this article to specialized Warcraft wiki. You might also "userfy" it, moving to your own namespace, like <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowZach_Europa_f0c0.html" title="User:ShadowZach/Europa">User:ShadowZach/Europa</a>. Overall, the article doesn't deserve deletion, but it's simply out of Wikipedia's scope and needs <b>transwikiing</b>. <a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> 17:15, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Other articles on video game maps have been kept, and recently (see <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_dust.html" title="De dust">de_dust</a>, etc.) so there is precedent for well-written game map articles here. That being said, THIS article is an unholy mess, but it should have been tagged for cleanup and wikify before being brought here, especially when it was just created yesterday. Most articles are a work in progress and don't get spit out all sparkly on the first iteration. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 20:57, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>-Maybe I should make a popular wc maps section so its more able to relate to more people but it could also have a section about this.<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowZach_d613.html" title="User:ShadowZach">Zach</a> 22:34, 1 June 2006 (UTC) -Wow I just checked, someone nomianted all those sections to be deleted after I talked about them earlier, atleast this deletion is less hypocritical or at all now.</p>

<li><b>DELETION</b> Eh, screw it, it's overwhelmingly favor in deletion, I have article saved on Microsoft Word if I decide to bring it back when I'm more experienced with Wikipedia or if I hear several people wanting it back...

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Just don't take it personally. It's not that article is bad, it's just that the general opinion here is against keeping it in the <i>namespace</i>. I'm sure wowwiki or some gaming site will appreciate it, WP is simply too generic for it. <a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> 04:27, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yeah... On Wikipedia, you don't just delete the article. You have to nominate the article for deletion, people have to vote on it, then an admin will come and delete (if the majority of the votes say to delete) the article about 5 days after the nomination. --<a href="../../../d/a/k/User%7EDakart_88fd.html" title="User:Dakart">Dakart</a> 01:23, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
