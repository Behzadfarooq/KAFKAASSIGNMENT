<p>See the webcomic <a href="http://www.thejaded.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.thejaded.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and their one man band forum <a href="http://www.talkaboutcomics.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=213" class="external text" title="http://www.talkaboutcomics.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=213" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Webcomics reach their end user purely through the means of the internet, so Alexa ranking is a good way of finding out how popular one is. When you have a ranking of <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.thejaded.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.thejaded.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">over 2 million</a>, this is clearly not good. This is a none notable webcomic with a tiny readership, and with 2 million more popular sites out there, it's time to remove this from wikipedia. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 00:07, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b>. The rank only hints at the lowness of the readership. How big is the readership, actually? Moreover, does size of participation or readership necessarily determine notability? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickyrab_21c2.html" title="User:Rickyrab"></a> — <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickyrab_21c2.html" title="User:Rickyrab">Rickyrab</a> | <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickyrab_2fd1.html" title="User talk:Rickyrab">Talk</a> 00:21, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, maybe <b>delete</b>, on notability grounds. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickyrab_21c2.html" title="User:Rickyrab"></a> — <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickyrab_21c2.html" title="User:Rickyrab">Rickyrab</a> | <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickyrab_2fd1.html" title="User talk:Rickyrab">Talk</a> 00:32, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> - That could be a point. But try looking on Google for the jaded and webcomic. It has not received any outside press, it hasn't even won any community awards I think, which almost every webcomic wins some. It's true, there are notable films, books etc, which may have been notable but not well read/seen. I do not think however, that this case holds true for this webcomic. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 00:33, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Alexa is in general a horrible way of determining popularity or notability, since it is not based on visitors, but on visitors who chose to install a specific piece of spyware. Also note that "The Jaded" is mostly read through Graphic Smash, so Alexa would treat such visits as results for graphicsmash.com, not for thejaded.co.uk, further biasing the Alexa results. Even aside from all that, this article is verifiable, encyclopedic, and useful. There are absolutely no disadvantages to keeping it in Wikipedia, so it should not be deleted. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 01:07, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I understand that Alexa rankings can sometimes be a red herring. However, doing a Google search found nothing to distinguish this from any other website. Apart from the Google search mentioned above, I was also drawn to nominate this due to the sparcity of the forums. I know not everyone joins the forums, but surely a proportion of the readership will join up. I did not know about GraphicSmash, that is true, and whereas you have mentioned the nature of Alexa, I do have to point out that Alexa ranks GraphicSmash at over 700k. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 01:22, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Alexa's ranking of Graphic Smash is also unreliable, of course. But even if we had good reasons for thinking the comic had a low readership, I still don't see any claims being made as to disadvantages of keeping this article. Are there any disadvantages? <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 01:49, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The disadvantage is, that instead of wikipedia being used as an encyclopedia, it is used as a web directory, free advertising, personal space and yellow pages. Would an article on myself be a disadvantage to wikipedia? It's verifiable, and useful for potential employers or friends, I'm sure a lot more people know of me in real life then read this comic. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 01:53, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am not an avid webcomic reader. I nominated this purely because I thought it was none notable. May I ask why a comic on GraphicSmash is inherently notable?

<li><b>Attention</b> - Some users have said that comics on <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphic_Smash_d091.html" title="Graphic Smash">Graphic Smash</a>, like this one seem to be notable. Even though Graphic Smash itself only has an Alexa rank of over 700,000. I see a parallel here with the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Metroblogging_f286.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Metroblogging">afd for Metroblogging</a>. Metroblogging is a blog portal, and from there you can find blogs. Metroblogging is a lot more popular than graphic smash, with an alexa rank of sub 30,000, it was rightly kept. However, the links pointing to specific blogs were not. Following a similar idea, I feel that this article ought to be deleted, with some summary information at the main <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphic_Smash_d091.html" title="Graphic Smash">Graphic Smash</a> article. The separate Graphic Smash comics however, should not have their own article. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 00:08, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As I said at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Jordan_Capri_cbaa.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Jordan Capri">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Jordan Capri</a>, the Google Test is skewed and meaningless for porn actresses. There's a whole subsection of the Internet pornography industry that is devoted to so skewing it (and that indeed regularly adds lists of links to WikiMedia projects as part of skewing it). Relying upon the Google Test as a gauge of notability for porn acresses is exceedingly unwise. Moreover, the number of films is <i>not</i> a strict indicator when it comes to actresses. (One can produce any number of unknown films.) As <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:criteria for inclusion of biographies</a> states, the films and thus the actresses have to be known by people, as demonstrated by the existence of newspaper or magazine coverage, commercial endorsements, fan clubs, and independent biographies.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I respect your opinions, Uncle G. I found you balance on voting in the AfD/VfD. I don't like *-crufts as much as the next guy but we already have gazillion porn star bio articles in Wikipedia. I'm not into pornography but there is an adult video trade publication that has covered her. It is the <a href="../../../a/v/n/AVN_af79.html" title="AVN">AVN</a> which has a semi-article in Wikipedia. They had an interview about her that shows some biographical data but not that much. <a href="http://www.avninsider.com/stories/audreyotto.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.avninsider.com/stories/audreyotto.shtml" rel="nofollow">Not Safe For Work reference</a> (see copyright "©2001 AVN Publications") Although, this doesn't fit your criteria but a popular weblog, Fleshbot has covered her as well. <a href="http://www.fleshbot.com/sex/straight/video/catching-up-with-audrey-hollander-104750.php" class="external text" title="http://www.fleshbot.com/sex/straight/video/catching-up-with-audrey-hollander-104750.php" rel="nofollow">Again Not Safe For Work</a> --<a href="../../../j/2E/_/User%7EJ._Nguyen_e461.html" title="User:J.

<li>I, um, haven't seen this name that I've noticed. I agree with Uncle G on the general principles for articles in this category, and on the verifiable data in this case not showing notability. The article says she's a frontrunner for a 2006 award from a leading publication, Adult Video News, but WP is not a crystal ball. If it happens, we could discuss whether that award confers notability, but I think the consensus would be "no", not without some of the other criteria that Uncle G mentioned. <b>Delete</b>, but with lubricant. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 06:25, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> - Well, let me address the issues that you've brought up in regards to deleting the entry about my comic. Please understand that I'm often flip in the blog on my site. A lot of what I say there is tongue-in-cheek or exxagerated. I put Detective Fork on Wikipedia because I feel I do a good comic that has depth and will continue for some time. I thought an article on it might be of interest to people who like Web comics. I won't lie and say I mind people following the link to see the comic itself. Another thing you bring up is that there are only five forum members. The forum was put up about a week ago. I do get readers on my site but Detective Fork has a regular group of readers on DrunkDrunk.com and on JellyCreations.com. I don't know what qualifies as "notable" but just have a look at my fan art section to see that a number of people follow the comic and are inspired to do their own artwork based on it. Finally, is it against Wikipedia policy to write an article on something you created? I'm not promoting the hell out of the comic, just providing info on the characters and stories. I sense your decision to delete the article is based more on a dislike of me from what I wrote in my blog and on a perception that Detective Fork is not important enough, not from hard criteria. Would you consider keeping the entry if perhaps I change something about the article you don't like? Please work with me here.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I put Detective Fork up for deletion because it hardly has any readers, gaining no Alexa rank at all. What makes your website more notable than every other website out there? It may have a core few fans, but so does every other website in the world. My decision to nominate articles on deletion have nothing to do with feelings towards the author at all, although I must say, placing a link from <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cutlery.html" title="Cutlery">Cutlery</a> was a bit cheeky. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 21:42, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - That's the point I was making earlier. Detective Fork has a good number of readers from being posted and seen on other sites. You can't judge the readership just by the hits on detectivefork.com. My site is the best resource for the comic, however, and that's why I posted that link. And the Wikipedia entry is for the comic itself, not just the Web page. The reviews I'm given by readers compliment the comic's originality. It was also a nominee for "Best Anthropomorphic Comic" in this year's Web Cartoonists Choice awards. Does Detective Fork get Penny Arcade numbers? No way. But neither do other Web comics you have listed. Looking back, yes, the cutlery thing was a combination of cheek and bad judgement. - DetectiveFork 22:10, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. In regards to the alternate proposal for posting Web comics, I have met the 33 week minimum. I am about a month shy of having 100 comics up. The entry was posted by me but I do not in it wax on about how great my comic is. It is factual. Let me refer you to the part of the guidelines that says, "Remember, however, that these are merely guidelines. Sites that are close to, but still under, these thresholds may also be included on the basis that webcomics customarily grow in size and have a higher likelihood of increasing in readership and, thus, becoming encyclopedic." It all depends on how strict you feel like being, seeing as they are guidelines and not strict rules, after all.</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> - I have nothing against your webcomic, I know you want to see it succeed, but Wikipedia should not be used as a promotional tool. You seen to have a pretty good sense of humour about you, and you've not spammed this nomination with constant numerous keep votes. But the problem with the guidelines at <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> is that they are way too lax, there are some webcomic articles on wikipedia which are even more unnotable than your one, that's true. But we will get round to reviewing them, it is because of the overly lax guidelines that so many have been let in unchallenged. But the reason for my nomination still stands, I don't see anything which lifts your website apart from any other out there. Also, did you know that there is a Wiki for comics? Yours is <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Detective_Fork" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Detective_Fork" rel="nofollow">already there</a>, and it's a great place for it. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 02:27, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> I had seen the listing on Comixpedia, which seemed to show up there automatically after placing the article here. Are you saying that the listing on Comixpedia would remain even if this one is deleted? Also, I acknowledge that the job you've undertaken is to keep Wikipedia credible and that, although the guidelines aren't concrete, most of you have a belief about what the qualifications of a webcomic should be. I don't seem to have won anybody over with my arguments so far and, while I hope they do, the outlook on the Magic 8 Ball is grim. If the entry is deleted, I can only hope my comic gets the kind of hits someday that earns itself back an entry and inspires someone else to pen it. I understand even Penny Arcade started small...DetectiveFork 07:46, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>Why marked for deletion? I wrote the article from scratch.</p>
<p>This is not advertising. I recently underwent Levulan Therapy and there is almost no information about it available on the web. The treatment is brand new and very effective at treating both acne and scars. As a longstanding acne sufferer, I can promise you that people will be happy to learn about this procedure. I wrote a long article about my experience at [<a href="http://www.wasauna.com/levulan.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wasauna.com/levulan.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>] and posted the beginning of the article on wikipedia. I am willing to post entire article and remove link, if that is causing the deletion.</p>

<li>Ban the asshole. Is this <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astroturfing.html" title="Astroturfing">Astroturfing</a> or enthusiasm that the anon is rid of his acne? <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 01:27, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sorry. Ban him <i>if necessary</i>. The article is now hopefully a decent stub. If this gets reverted again a ban is in order. As far as the "illegal marketing" goes, I presume the anonymous author refers to <a href="../../../o/f/f/Off-label_use.html" title="Off-label use">off-label use</a>, which must not be advertised. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 01:41, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I wrote the article, and it is not an advertisment. I'm not even selling the service! As for reverting the article, all I did is add more information. You have a 3 sentence stub that provides no useful information. I underwent Levulan Therapy, it made a huge difference for me, and I wrote a long article about it. All of the information may not be as cleanly written and edited as you like, but it is accurate and useful information. I suffered from Acne for 10 years and this helped with the problem, so I wanted to share the information. Here is the original article I wrote&#160;:www.wasauna.com/levulan.html - does this look like an advertisment to you? Maybe the link to the doctor who treated me seems like an advertisment, but it was on my personal story website, not on the wikipedia page. -Dave</li>

<p>I have nominated this page for deletion for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. Jimbo Wales gave his word to me that this page would be protected from vandalism and that he would take actions to prevent wikipedia from being used as a platform for libel and posting of sealed court documents.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>WALES POST 1:</b> I did agree with Mr. Merkey to take down some vandalism which has been posted here about him, and temporarily protect the articles while we sort out what's going on.Some really vile stuff was posted about him in some of these articles by anonymous ip numbers -- he seemed to think that it was one of our admins, but I explained otherwise. What I can safely say is that Wikipedia should not libel anyone, and that our normal standards of good conduct are expected of everyone.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 22:07, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I just reviewed the changes since the page was unprotected and I don't see anything that looks to me like "vandalism" by the "SCOX lynch mob" or anything else. All I see is some wikification by <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">User:Jonathunder</a>, who is not a vandal, and the addition and then the removal of a {{vprotect}} tag by an anon, 67.177.35.211, followed by the insertion of an {{afd}} tag. Gadugi, what exactly is your complaint?</dd>
<dd>I can easily believe that Jimbo promised in a general that way the page would be protected from vandalism, but I find it unlikely that he promised that the <i>content</i> of any page would remain <i>indefinitely</i> under the <i>control</i> of any single individual. It is appropriate to ask the Wikipedian community to exercise special vigilance on a page, but not to ask that nobody ever be allowed to change it, or that all changes be preapproved by a single person. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:38, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> whilst vandalism is unfortunate it can usually be controlled, and is not a reason to delete stuff <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowells_4fc9.html" title="User:Chowells">chowells</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Jeff Merkey has made himself a very notable individual in the <a href="../../../s/c/o/SCO-Linux_controversies_ece0.html" title="SCO-Linux controversies">SCO-Linux controversies</a> by making an offer to buy a snapshot of the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> kernel to be licensed under the <a href="../../../b/s/d/BSD_license_12f7.html" title="BSD license">BSD license</a>. Such people often <i>want</i> to either have exclusive control over their article, so that it excludes anything they would rather people didn't know about them, or to delete it because they <i>won't</i> possess exclusive control over it. However, this is not a privilege we have ever extended to anyone; as for Mr. Merkey's claims that he received a personal promise from Jimbo Wales that he would be given such control, I quote from the Findings of Fact in <i>Novell v. Timpanogos Research Group, Inc.</i>: "... this statement is another example of Merkey's penchant for self-serving, separate reality, dishonesty ... While it is human nature for each of us to put our own spin on events which we observe ... Merkey nonetheless regularly exaggerates or lies in his comments to others about events happening around him. It is as though he is creating his own separate reality." Clearly the article should be kept, and yes, a careful eye <i>should</i> be kept on it to protect it from vandalism. However, the history shows that the vandalism it is most likely to experience is Mr. Merkey himself removing documented facts he finds unfavorable, either under his username Gadugi or under a number of anon IPs. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 16:40, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> If vandalism can be controlled, I have no objection to this page. As for quoting from a 9 year old ruling, anyone who believes that mouldy piece of fiction written by Novell's stooge judge speaks for itself. It reads like an astrology report. If you are going to quote from it, please also quote from the orders removing the judge from the case by the Utah State Legislature and the Judicial Conduct Commission. You are free to quote facts, just remember there are two sides to every story, and you should present NPOV which is to present both sides. Also be advised that some portions of these court documents are sealed. Gadugi 17:03, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Protect yourself from falsehood</b> This is a pearl indeed from the talk page of <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a>. It certainly applies here: I used to believe (and tell others that I believed) that "When your goal is to act in an ethical and moral manner, your first and foremost enemy is always yourself." I now know I was wrong. If you have the basic desire to act ethically in the first place, then you have to take second place in line to a whole lot of other people out there who can do a lot better of a job twisting your good intentions into bad deeds than you can. To be hoist by one's own petard is not necessarily the easiest or most common way to go, only the one with the most irony. Beware of approaching a problem by trying to find its identifying characteristics. What is truly needed, and what should be the goal of your search, is <i>distinguishing</i> characteristics. gadugi 17:27, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Anaeus and Gadugi/Jeff, let's keep this <i>constructive and OT</i>. What happens outside of WikiPedia should be kept out until it has bearing on an article itself.

<dd>If someone has been described by a federal judge in a Findings of Fact as having a tendency to create his own separate reality, I think it is perfectly on-topic to bring this up in the context of certain promises supposedly made to that person by Jimbo Wales -- for which we have <i>only</i> that person's word that said promises were ever made, and what their content was. Of course, I think Mr. Merkey's attempt to impersonate Jimbo Wales rather supersedes any documentation I could provide to indicate that his word is not exactly to be taken on faith. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:29, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you are being a uncharitable in your assertion that this was an attempted impersonation, the comment is part of a comment by Jimbo Wales from the articles talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jeffrey_Vernon_Merkey" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jeffrey_Vernon_Merkey" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, he did also leave the date of 13 September in place from the original comment. What he failed to make clear was that he was partially quoting and who was doing the quoting. (The item is missing is the text is the opening sentence "Obviously that isn't what I said." in response to Gadugi's original characterisation of his discussion with Jimbo.) I do agree that it would be helpful if Gadugi logged in consistently rather than having multiple "accounts", and if he'd simply provided a link to the original discussion. As it stands though I'm not sure what help the comment is, it doesn't seem to promise any special treatment, just business as usual.</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> It is clear that Jimbo Wales did not promise that the page would be protected indefinitely.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. Merkey is certainly notable. In fact, his frequent attempts to block WP from mentioning him in a way he fanatasizes as libelous is probably notable in itself, since it makes him a public figure (albeit of mockery).

<li><b>keep</b> But we need to add an article on the fact that Jeffrey Vernon Merkey was single handedly responsible for the abomination known as Disco in the 70's.

<li><b>Comment</b>: This article is mainly a description of why he is the most powerful character. This isn't even proven, and personally i think it's incorrect.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: IT IS PROVEN AND IS CORRECT, I think we Japanese know our animations. If in any doubts, consult the Japanese production or Mr. Toriyama (he did take part in the writing/advisor). Please also check Japanese web pages, etc. If he is not the most powerful, who is?? Broly?? Super Saiyan 2 Gojita?? In the Japanese version, SSJ4 Gogita has been mentioned to be the most powerful as well as One star Shenron being the most powerful villain. SSJ4 Gojita deserves a separate page. The author only wrote it for the benefit of the western world which is bombarded with their own interpretation of what or what not Japanese animation should be and with their own dubbing of the Japanese originals. There are way too many kids out there who think watching a few of our productions would make them the expert of our products!</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned, the article was written for the benefit of the western world, if they do not desire authentic information, then let Wikipedia clouded with false (westernised) information and let's called it CRAPedia!</p>
<p>Also, much of the information on article <a href="../../../g/o/g/Gogeta.html" title="Gogeta">Gogeta</a> were inserted by me to the original article, that's why one would think there is duplicated information. I am interested in providing authentic information. Readers who have no desire for such information may choose to ignore this article "Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta".</p>
<p>"Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta" is now a stand-alone article. Articles "Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta" and "Gogeta" are no longer cross-linked, they are separate entities.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> (original: <b>Do not delete</b>): What's everyone's obsession with perfection? Yes, I agree with Secretlondon, to an extent, that to be in here, a piece of information needs to be presented contextually, but why not label it as being in severe need of revision, as opposed to removing information which is a) rare and b) very interesting and releveant to exploration of "warez" culture? Again, just because some information is "not encyclopedic" doesn't mean that it shouldn't belong in an encyclopedia, especially one with as many limitless capabilities as Wikipedia. We don't remove a picture of a green apple because it's notr epresentative of apples in general, do we? Finally, let's take Sapient's cue and describe "what it is," instead of killing off valuable information. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoThe1_026f.html" title="User:NeoThe1">NeoThe1</a> 01:58, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

Instead of including this load of text into the articles, it's made as separate page, for sake of clarity. Reason for text to image is, that standards are ratified as they are, the text itself cannot be changed, even if it sounds silly or contains errors.

<dd>I see where you are going with this, but <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> states: <i>Wikipedia articles are not.... 3. Mere collections of public domain or other source material such as entire books or source code, original historical documents, letters, laws, proclamations, and other source material that are only useful when presented with their original, un-modified wording.</i> Does this not fall foul here, in its current state? Are these standards accessible on an external web-site and as such be referenced as an external link? If this article were an explanation of the standards, how they are arrived at, how they have developed and their significance, then I would consider that encyclopedic and worthy of inclusion. As it stands, I'm afraid I'll have to stick with my original opinion. <a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESapient_6a20.html" title="User:Sapient">Sapient</a> 22:16, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Stay</b>. ObjAsm32 is much more than an OOP model. It combines the newest COM/DCOM, OCX servers, OleDB, etc. technology with the well known OOP model at assembler level.

It's not even that bad a page when you consider other self-promotion pages - its main neutrality problems are the apparently inflated viewing figures and that photo, both of which I've now removed. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 11:01, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe I should translate the website and put it on the talk page. The private thing is that this channel has the photo of one man on the front page, team and "Live" pages are "under construction", instead the list of DVDs for sale works. And on the front page you will notice the "Virtual University, coming soon." In fact I will be happy enough if someone confirm that he/she can actually watch this 24-hour program on satellite. The information for that is also available at the front page. I don't have the facilities.

<li>As far as I understand it, the general policy on Wikipedia is that articles which can never expand beyond a stub should not be articles but be included somewhere else.

<li><b>Keep</b>, as the terms peaknik and doomer are in common use and are just beginning to break through into the mainstream media, and they define different issues to the terms "peak oil optimists and peak oil pessimists" which raises matters of WHEN oil peaks, not what it MEANS. Don't <b>merge</b> as the complicated doomer scenarios and worldviews attached to the Doomer paradigm could grow in this article, and would terribly inflate the Hubbert's peak scientific theory of oil depletion, with no end of debate. Having a seperate entry for Doomer allows the Doomer crowd to focus their attention on the definition of their paradigm in that entry, rather than endlessly swelling and debating the various collapse scenarios under Hubbert's peak, which actually deals in the scientific facts of oil depletion. The Doomer article has only just started. I can see it swelling to 4 or 5 times the current size, as various collapse scenarios are expanded on, and expert Doomer authors such as Heinberg, Kunstler, Duncan, and others are quoted or write for themselves in the Wiki Doomer entry. The peak oil question is one of the most important questions society faces this decade, and it may be even more immediate than global warming. The potential for severe economic pain, or even chaotic doomer collapse, is real. Surely the importance of the subject demands that this entry remains, even if the term does not strictly meet the Wikipedia guidelines this month? Because it WILL be in the mainstream press sometime in the next 12 months, I guarantee it. Adopting this term early will help countless new peakniks decide where they fall on the peaknik / doomer spectrum, and actually facilitate this discussion in the media, allowing Wikipedia to be an influential "mover and shaker" in the cultural debate, as well as maintaining intellectual credibility of describing something that is already established. Adopting this term is not "making stuff up" but just being slightly ahead of the curve. (Interesting pun in the context of Hubbert's peak.) Surely this is in Wikipedia's best interests?

<li>Eclipsenow, since most of our concern stems from the use of what are very new words, I'm wondering if you could write about the material you want to discuss without using them? The <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubbert_peak.html" title="Hubbert peak">Hubbert peak</a> article is already a substantial 48k and I would think there is plenty of room for it to semi-organically grow into other articles like post peak oil scenarios or social responses to peak oil, or whatever. As long as you can write <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a> content in accordance with our <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a> policy, I think the encyclopedia as a whole would welcome more content on this issue. I do think however think that most of us would prefer you not consistently use the terms "doomer" and "peaknik". It might be more cumbersome for you to write "those expecting social collapse", or similar phrases all the time, but it is better from an encyclopedic point of view. Also, if you wanted to mention in passing that they are "sometimes called 'doomers'", or something similar, at the start of a discussion on apocalyptic views of peak oil, I wouldn't particularly mind. It is just that Wikipedia doesn't want to be leading the charge to adopt new terminology that isn't already well established. If you do feel up to writing on apocalyptic views of peak oil or something similar, I suggest you talk to the people at <a href="../../../h/u/b/Talk%7EHubbert_peak_theory_6f66.html" title="Talk:Hubbert peak theory">Talk:Hubbert peak theory</a>. Most topics, when they expand into multiple articles, do so by removing chunks of an existing large article and growing from that, so it is good to talk to the people that have already been working on this topic in order to coordinate. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 23:48, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The author removed content from the <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emotion.html" title="Emotion">emotion</a> page and put it on a new war on emotion page, most likely because he disagreed with its POV. The funny thing is that I agree with the author that this content does indeed represent a limited POV, nonetheless, we can arrive at the final result better through intelligent discussion than through rash provocative deletions and postings. I'd appreciate if in the future, the author would take a deep breath himself and cool down his own <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emotion.html" title="Emotion">emotions</a> before making changes to articles. <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a>'s action was inappropriate, and I concur with the others that this article should be deleted. I look forward to working with <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> and the other <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emotion.html" title="Emotion">emotion</a> authors to come to a compromise that works for everyone.

<p>I deleted the material from the emotion page once, and sombody regressed the page, so I moved it to a new article, where I thought it seemed fit, and addressed why it fit the topic. I am confused at the categorization of my action as rash and provocative, though and would appreciate it if Sallison were to elaborate further.</p>

<ul>
<li>To elaborate at Hackwrench's request, the so called "War on Emotion" is not an actual war, but rather your personal conflict with another author. That is, unless you have some references to back up the assertion that this particular conflict stems from a conflict within the larger academic community that has been termed "The War on Emotion." If you came up with that term on your own because you were mad at the other author, and not from research, then you were acting provocatively. In short, it's what the other reviewers here are calling an unsourced OR/POV essay. I haven't seen you discuss this issue on the emotion talk page. From what I can infer from your actions, I think your point is very valid. I agree that the <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emotion.html" title="Emotion">emotion</a> page needs to have a much more neutral point of view, but perhaps an attempt at diplomacy is in order before resorting to a one-man-war. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESallison_24f1.html" title="User:Sallison">sallison</a> 08:11, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hackwrench now appears to be making a concerted effort to turn this page from what originally appeared to be a personal attack on another author into an article on a theme that may (or may not) be considered valid by others. I would be more convinced if the author could cite some sources in hard print in addition to his web sources. In general, the move away from inflamatory discourse is commendable. I don't know if this revised article will meet the standards of the other reviewers taking part in this discussion, but at least my biggest concern regarding this particular article has been directly addressed. I would like to express my thanks to the author for his efforts in this regard. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESallison_24f1.html" title="User:Sallison">sallison</a> 09:07, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Fix</b>. The phrase (and related idea) the article is based on has substancial usage. The article doesn't explore it very well though. Even if the majority view is that the concept is silly, the article should remain - and contain POV details of why the idea's not very useful. 203.208.80.13 00:21, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
As the creator, artist and writer of said webcomic, I object to the comments made above. Firstly, with regards to the forums. The forums have never been very active but then this has never been a sign of the popularity (or supposed lack of it) of the comic. I recieve e-mails and talk to fans of the comic over MSN regularly and I have recieved nothing but positive feedback from them, apart from one or two comments relating to artwork that I have since rectified. The writer of the above comments shows their obvious lack of attention to detail when they state that the comic has "probably" over 100 strips. If they had read the comic at all, or the newsposts, they would find that the comic has indeed had over 100 strips (as illustrated in a anniversary comic) and that it is in fact, almost upto the sum of 150. I myself doubted the popularity of my comic at one point, but I have recently installed a statcounter on my site and am happy to report that Rooms now recieves more visitors (and more returning visitors) than it has done in the history of the comic and this is currently on the rise. I also would like to call into question the amount of traffic cited as being reasonable for a web-comic. A friend of mine, who has been a long time supporter of the site, described it as "ludicrous", and I myself have to concur. There are many webcomics on the internet, with articles on this very site, which have lower levels of traffic than the proposed number. I therefore propose that the subject in question is not whether Rooms should be deleted but whether any of the many small webcomic entries of wikipedia should be allowed to remain. I personally believe that they should not be removed as there are always people who will be interested in procuring information about less well known comics and to deny them this opportunity would be a grave shame. The description of my comic as "totally unnotable...in every way" in the above comment is also very subjective. It seems to me as if the comment was written by someone who just decided that they didn't like the comic (or possibly myself) and therefore it was worthy to be removed from wikipedia. I know for a fact that my readers wouldn't describe my comic as "unnotable" and I believe this subjective viewpoint to weaken the rest of the writer's arguments. Obviously, the final verdict is upto you but please consider the matter carefully before you reach your verdict. For it is not just the fate of this entry that you will be deciding but of all small-time comic entries. Thank you. - Euan Mumford 17:05, 1st October 2005</p>

<li><b>Reply</b> - Do you know that your webcomic is already at <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Rooms" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Rooms" rel="nofollow">comixPedia</a>. Comixpedia is the place for small time webcomics, as you yourself have said. And regarding the mention of webcomics at wikipedia which are even more non notable. We will be deleting them too, AFD takes time. My concern has been that guidelines at <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> have been overly lax, compare say with <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Had your the article in question not been in the webcomic category, and listed as a website instead, it would have definitely be deleted. My opinion of your webcomic did not come into play during this nomination, or any nomination that I may make. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 23:57, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

It seems that no statistics decide which articles get deleted except the whims of Hahnchen himself, who has admitted on his talk page to having no real knowledge of webcomics. --<a href="../../../h/i/j/User%7EHijamiefans_b84c.html" title="User:Hijamiefans">Hijamiefans</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> - I object, my nominations are usually very well worded and arguments explained. Webcomics are not inherently more notable than websites, no matter what you may claim on my talk page. There are many more popular blogs/pornsites/forums than the webcomic in question, we should not judge webcomics with a totally different criteria. As for real people going to wikipedia to look up small time comic entries, they should be going to comixpedia. If that isn't good enough for those budding webartists, then obviously it's a problem with their ego. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 12:47, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, Yeah well I added this article myself to try to expand on the topic which had been red-linked on several Nazi-related articles on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Query</b> I basically decided to opt for what <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> suggested to me earlier and add the necessary text relating to the Moon base and the SS technology in the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_mysticism.html" title="Nazi mysticism">Nazi mysticism</a> article, however this has now been deleted by <a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> because it has been regarded as not being verifiable or relevant? Someone please help me out here because now I'm confused. I think the Nazi Moon base should have a mention for encyclopedic purposes seeing as it is a recognised and explored subject by many people who study Nazi mysticism and Nazi conspiracies.

<p>I've thought quite a bit about listing this article since it has some interesting points. However it is, IMO, largely lengthy non-NPOV critiscism of a book, which probably violates copyright/fair use by containing an extremely long quote. As such, I don't think it's worth of an encyclopedia article and the useful bits could very well be merged elsewhere. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowells_4fc9.html" title="User:Chowells">chowells</a> 19:50, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't know, Chowells. It is true that the article is badly in need of cleaning up and cutting it down to size in order to make it conform to the book. I have asked another user to have a look and you might reconsider after he has done some editing. But your criticism towards the current state is valid. This page (and other's like Pope's Hitler) was orignally created by someone to use it as a soapbox for his views on Pius XII and related (and not so related) issues. Hence many things are included that are not in the book, hence it largely is parallel to the original Pius XII page. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 20:24, 26 September 2005 (UTC) But in the end, I vote for <b>keep</b>ing a cleaned up and de-POV'ed version. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> 08:22, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>(Invective deleted) The book Hitler's Pope is more than notable enough to warrant an article, and while I strongly disagree with that book's sentiments, this AFD vote should end quickly with a <b>Speedy keep</b>. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHanson_59b8.html" title="User:PaulHanson">Paul</a> 22:28, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I hereby apologize for the above comment as it was unduly harsh and not in conformance with WP protocol.

<li><b>Delete</b> I think Dhammakaya itself is notable but this seems to be advertising for a specific subset of the movement. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 20:28, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> For one thing, the article has copyright problems; it seems to be a copy of <a href="http://www.dhammakaya.or.th/about/history.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.dhammakaya.or.th/about/history.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a>. I do think that this organization might ultimately be worthy of an article, but the information provided on the current article is way too far from NPOV to be salvagable- we'd be left with nothing but a few names. I createed a new stub from information on the Foundation's website at <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhammakaya_Foundation_be2c.html" title="Dhammakaya Foundation">Dhammakaya Foundation</a> that should serve until more specific, non-POV info can be located. 'Dhammakaya' is the Pali equivalent of the Sanskrit 'dharmakaya'- something quite specific in Buddhist philosophy, and not really related to this particular organization. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpasemunki_be3a.html" title="User:Spasemunki">Clay Collier</a> 20:41, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Actually, it was listed as an A1 because of a lack of context, and if I had been thinking, it would have been A3, as well. (I was the one who listed it for speedy deletion.) Since I tagged it, though, context has been added, so it's no longer speediable.<br />
In any case, this article isn't a useful start for an article about the organization, as it's hopelessly POV and possibly copyvio. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 00:39, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Although I originally created this entry myself, it was merged to <a href="../../../g/w/r/GWR_6000_Class_b059.html" title="GWR 6000 Class">GWR 6000 Class</a> by <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Duncharris</a>, with the reason given being "write a decent stub or none at all please". I feel that instead of being removed unilaterally, the process should be via AfD - I have therefore reverted the merge and brought it here. My own personal vote would be <b>Keep</b>, as I believe that this stub could be added to by locomotive enthusiasts (not a speciality of mine) but, as mentioned, my vote should be viewed in consideration of the fact that it was me who created the initial stub ("decent" or otherwise). <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a> 21:02, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Close the Afd</b>, and talk about the merge on the talk page. I don't see how Afd is a good way to discuss this issue. As for the merits of the article, I'd say redirect it for now, with the possibility of it being a seperate article when and if there's enough information to warrant it. Context is good. But I see no reason for the Afd when apparently <i>nobody</i> wants this article to go away. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 21:07, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Duncharris</a> also turned into redirects a number of similar articles on preserved locomotives (some of which were created by me). I disagree with this unilateral approach when there was no attempt whatsoever to discuss or reach consensus and IMO AfD is the correct way to resolve it.

<li><b>Merge, but</b> as I explained to Chowells, it's not that it isn't potentially notable that I merged it, it is that it was a <b>substub</b> and <b><a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">cruft</a></b>. It has no content that would be useful to a reader who would be better directed to the article on the class as a whole. If we manage to get the page on the <a href="../../../g/w/r/GWR_King_Class_eb7d.html" title="GWR King Class">GWR King Class</a> up to a decent standard, then we should be thinking about splitting some off. However <a href="../../../g/w/r/GWR_King_Class_eb7d.html" title="GWR King Class">GWR King Class</a> is a stub which doesn't even list all of their names. It also happens that 6024 isn't even the most notable King, the first 6000 <i>King George V</i> is. The worst thing is that <a href="http://www.greatwestern.org.uk/m_in_kin_king6.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.greatwestern.org.uk/m_in_kin_king6.htm" rel="nofollow">the information required to write a basic stub is online</a>, as are <a href="http://fotopic.net/search.php?searchtext=6024&amp;tab=3" class="external text" title="http://fotopic.net/search.php?searchtext=6024&amp;tab=3" rel="nofollow">several photographs</a> that he could request permission to use if he could be bothered to send out a boilerplate request for permission.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This should not have been nominated for deletion (I've been noticing a few nominations with very weak reasoning lately. A brush up on <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> wouldn't hurt.) Anyway, the transition from large to small size paper money in the U.S. is notable on its own merits, and far more notable than much of the junk that is seen as acceptable. A request for expansion would have been the proper course of action here (which I did add). <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHanson_59b8.html" title="User:PaulHanson">Paul</a> 22:34, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Move</b> The Series of 1928 is notable only because it is the first of the small sized notes. Move to Small size note (U.S. Currency) and redirect other small size series to that article as well which could be expanded to a reasonable history of the small size notes. The current name encourages adding articles for each of the non-notable series of U.S. paper monety that would be better described by this article and a companion <a href="../../../l/a/r/Large_size_note_%28U.S._Currency%29_6636.html" title="Large size note (U.S. Currency)">Large size note (U.S. Currency)</a> article for the pre-1928 paper money. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 18:16, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. That a lost child's toy can become a medium-scale Internet meme is notable. I don't understand how this is advertising. The original Hopkin Green Frog ad was a real paper ad stapled to a pole, written by an autistic teen, and it took off from there. See <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/11/21/internet_hopkin_meme.html" class="external text" title="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/11/21/internet_hopkin_meme.html" rel="nofollow">Boing Boing report</a>, for instance. Since this has an origin and conclusion <a href="http://mike.whybark.com/archives/001951.html" class="external text" title="http://mike.whybark.com/archives/001951.html" rel="nofollow">researched by third parties</a> it's got great article potential, although what's there needs a lot of work. This is the sort of <a href="../../../u/a/_/WP%7EUA_5bfb.html" title="WP:UA">thing</a> that Wikipedia does particularly well.

<li>I read the so-called "researched by third parties" link, found the reference non-authoritative, and found the article topic utterly non-notable. No indication that this has any significance other than a few people wasting electrons for a few months.

<li>Hrm, you're not the first person to comment about that: it's not notable because he was autistic, it's notable because it's an Internet meme with an unusual backstory. It seems I've hit a nerve and that wasn't my intent (see the edit history, too); apologies if that was the case. — <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel">mendel</a> <a href="../../../m/e/n/User_talk%7EMendel_d73b.html" title="User talk:Mendel">☎</a> 20:11, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Didn't offend me at all. I just hadn't seen evidence that it was notable as an Internet meme, and looked for evidence that it was notable in any other way. "Internet meme" to me very nearly means "childish fad of the week", and even thousands of hits (if just blog entries and Usenet chat and so forth) don't prove WP-worthy notability unless some of the hits are feature articles from major media. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:48, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Charles Matthews is definitely right about not using AfD for cleanup. We already <i>have</i> {cleanup} available as a tag, and that's much more appropriate (per nom who states in the AfD itself that the "topic is notable"). Voting "keep", BTW, doesn't obligate a voter to do the cleanup her/himself—doing so is great, but not everyone has expertise in everything. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 16:31, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

With respect, I find the cleanup commendations confounding. The <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenics.html" title="Eugenics">Eugenics</a> article illustrates a number of highly dubious assertions in this. Most notably, the author has conflated a science (genetics) with a social philosophy (eugenics), unless I have somehow missed the Japanese eugenics degree available as a pre-war discipline. Also, the last line, <i>Eugenic thinking probably had wider effects. Japanese soldiers received instruction on how 'inferior' Asian and European races were to be treated. Military personnel who violated these instructions were severely punished</i> is nonsense. Since when did Japanese society, especially the military, need eugenics to promote a world-view based on racial superiority? Instead, the theory of eugenics and social Darwinism worked well within a social system that already fostered such a view. Bottom line: moving this to Eugenics will get this content the cleanup it desperately needs.

As I did indeed say, the topic is notable and article-worthy, but it would be better to have a one sentence stub than a badly titled, vague, sloppy article. Sure, I could have added the cleanup tag and forgotten about it, but in my opinion it's better to start from scratch. Hey, look, there is potential for an excellent article about the topic, but let's do it right, eh? (Note: I was going to follow Neutrality's suggestion and create the article Eugenics in imperial Japan, but I was unsure as to what the article itself should consist of.) <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHanson_59b8.html" title="User:PaulHanson">Paul</a> 19:16, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Will you vote to delete an article, not nominated here for lack of references, before requesting that references be supplied?

<li>Hi Charles. I did not want to vote, because I have no detailed knowledge about japanese war crimes.

<p>This page contains non factual and insulting text regarding the diet of a specific state. The tone is in itself derogatory. The article states that Kentucky consumption of White Castles is the highest in the nation. There are only White Castles in 3 cities in the state and the states population is over 4 million. Burgoo ( which I had never heard of) is served in Owensburg and I had to get that off the internet. It may contain some truth but it still has a derogatory tone to it. Also is this article suitable to Wikipedia? If there is an article concerning this states presumed diet then wouldn't there have to an aricle concerning every states cuisine?<a href="../../../d/a/k/User%7EDakotaKahn_841e.html" title="User:DakotaKahn">Dakota</a> 22:30, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, assuming that the material is verifiable. The innacurately-named "Sources" section is just a link to an annoying recipe site.

<p>The article as I first found has changed greatly. The original was different in title and tone. I am not a "purported native" of Kentucky. I am not from Kentucky but have lived here 5 years.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think this topic is essentially different from "Messiah", and should remain as such. The difference between Messiah and Messianism is huge, and they should not be in the same page. I agree though that this page should be reedited, as the information presented is incomplete. I suggest also to distinguish between religous messianism, and other forms of messianism (political).
