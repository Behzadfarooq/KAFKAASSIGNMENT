<li><b>Delete</b> both. Anarchism IS anti-statism - thats it. The state claims a monopoly on force. If the state enforces capitalism, then ALL (AC and AS) anarchists would be against that. A government, on the other hand, could mean your home owners association or even a democratic vote. It doesn't necessarily imply state-like powers since the option of secession (sell your home and move or find another union) is always available, though possibly not preferable. So I don't think ANY anarchist could be against government as long as it's voluntary (non-state sponsored). The free market implies all transactions are handled voluntarily absent any coercion. State sponsored capitalism would not be a truly free market. It seems to me that a simple definition of Anarchism would simply be anti-statism. It goes without saying that an anarchist would be against state sponsored capitalism, socialism, feminism, or communism. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.238.102.176 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.238.102.176_90fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.238.102.176">contribs</a>) 18:11, 9 Jun 2005.</small></li>

IMO he is wrong, and there are anti-statist versions of both socialism and capitalism. He's simply the other side of the 'ancaps aren't really anarchists' coin. I.e. Some intolerant ansocs can't conceive of stateless capitalism, and some intolerant ancaps can't conceive of stateless socialism.

<li>Plenty of people believe in anarcho-capitalism, and plenty of libertarian minarchists respect anarcho-capitalism as a more extreme version of what they believe in.

<p>What is at issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The definition of anarchism.</b> Should it be defined according to its Greek roots, meaning "without political rule"? Or should it be defined according to some 19th century proponents who happened to be anti-capitalist?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The Greek roots of anarchism means "without rulers", not "without political rule". Its an assumption that the -archy must refer to state politics. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillerc_2ebe.html" title="User:Millerc">millerc</a> 12:50, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is <i>not</i> at issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The size or importance of anarcho-capitalism</b> within the general movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>What does this have to do with deleting Wiki articles? This is a little more complicated. Ideally, everyone could 'just get along' and create an unbiased article, with both definitions considered in a neutral manner. Practically, this approach hasn't worked well since too many people insist on their preferred definition by deleting any edits which are not in conformance. Most Wiki editors, regardless of which side of the definitional issue they support, agree to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be a permanent edit war if there is only one Anarchism article.</li>
</ul>
<p>So here on this page, we are trying to decide whether to continue with the permanent edit war or 'split the question.' A vote to KEEP BOTH is saying that you think we should split the question, i.e. have a separate page for each definition. A vote for DELETE BOTH or MERGE is saying that you want to continue with a single hotly contested page, and continue the edit war. --<a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 20:08, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aha. Here is where we are not on the same page.

<p>In my opinion there only needs to be one main anarchism page (with a disambiguation page as well). This would be a basically socialist one ('cause that is what anarchism is). However, there should be a link to the capitalist page in the first paragraph so that people can see it if that is what they are looking for.</p>
<p>It seems that many people are trying to claim that there is simply two types of anarchism, capitalist and socialists. This is quite wrong. That are a number of different sorts of anarchism, all of them socialist (unless you happen to think that anarchism does not mean no social hierarchy or rulers, but rather simply no state). However, many anarchist violently disagree whether other forms would even work or be anarchistic. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrismw_46b5.html" title="User:Harrismw">harrismw</a> 01:44, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Lets say the state as we know it disappears tomorrow. If you have a centralized plan for how everyone SHOULD live and want that plan enforced, I'd question whether you're an anarchist. In my opinion, the AC crowd has no plan and would leave it up to individuals as to how they'd live. Their version would allow the AS crowd to live out their socialist dreams as they please. On the other hand, the AS crowd seems to have plans for everyone and wouldn't be tolerant of the AC. My hunch is they'd immediately talk about outlawing the AC lifestyle - and that would require state-like powers. Honestly, I question whether or not an AS is really an anarchist (anti-state). This could be why the ACs are so adamant - they don't see the AS as serious or credible in their anarchism, and not worthy of the title anarchist. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 4.154.113.253 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.154.113.253_04db.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.154.113.253">contribs</a>) 03:41, 11 Jun 2005.</small></dd>

<dd>Perhaps you are an individualist anarchist, a la Benjamin Tucker. Suppose a bunch of Wiki editors got it in their heads to define anarchism as anti-individualist, wrote at the top of the page that all anarchists are anti-individualist, and deleted all individualist thought from the general article except a link labeled 'not-really-anarchist' pointing to the Individualist Anarchist article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I guess the teeming hordes weren't enough aware of the line crossed. The stub would have been expanded to an article of reasonable length that meant something to hundreds of people. But if you guys still feel that violates the deletion policy's "Wikipedia is not a general knowledge base" clause, it's ultimately your call. The one favor I ask is that you let the redlinks stand, so that if the subject becomes article-worthy, the name will still be available.

<li>Sorry if I came across harshly there, but there are over 6 billion people on the planet, and if we add all those who have come and gone, we probably top 9 billion. If Wikipedia had an article on every person, it would be an unmanageable, unsearchable mess - so we draw notability lines that limit us to perhaps a few dozen thousands of persons. Sounds like a lot, but it's really a tiny proportion of the whole. Also, <i>what</i> redlinks? Nothing links here except the redirect that you made from "Mr. D" - which is hardly an appropriate redirect, because there's very little chance the average user typing in Mr. D will expect this result. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 03:50, 2005 Jun 8 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> – I agree that 9 billion biographical stubs would be a mess, but perhaps you'll allow me to point out that Wikipedia's a still just a six-thousandth of that size. And certainly not every article has meaning to dozens of thousands of people. For example, lots of the data-generated articles for small municipalities wouldn't qualify. Take <a href="../../../m/a/z/Maza%2C_North_Dakota_ab63.html" title="Maza, North Dakota">Maza, North Dakota</a>. Home to five people. Or an article about <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astley_Cooper_Key_4143.html" title="Astley Cooper Key">Astley Cooper Key</a>, lifted from the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica and edited twice, once minor. Dozens of thousands? Doesn't seem like it. Now, I'm not saying that my article fits your notability criteria, I know it doesn't. But I had always felt that one of the coolest things about Wikipedia was that it really seemed like what ever subject I wanted to learn about, no matter how obscure, there might be an entry for it. Maybe that's not feasible, but even impossible ideals can be worth pursuing. About the redlinks, I guess I didn't use the term correctly. All I meant was to ask for the article name to be left available, even if the current article is deleted. That way, if the subject ever does reach his notability quota, he can still have an article. As for the redirect, its appropriateness I won't contest, but remember there wouldn't be many users typing in "Mr. D" at all. It's a common nickname of the subject, and not used anywhere else on the site, so I created the redirect without realizing the rigid standards under which one may create new pages. That's just stating my reasoning; I'm not saying it was valid. Last but not least, don't worry about seeming harsh. According to the Guide to VFD, the people frequenting it "may seem terse, gruff, and abrupt, but that is not actually the case." <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikinick_8aa8.html" title="User:Wikinick">wikinick</a> 10:08, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>A catchy name given by the press does not make a difference here. Just because something is all over television for 15 minutes does not make it notable forever.

<dd>From <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a>, I think "Wikipedia is not a general knowledge base" #4 'Memorials' and #5 'News reports' apply.

An article on infant abandonment (or maybe expand <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_abandonment.html" title="Child abandonment">child abandonment</a> to cover it) would be fine, maybe even link the names of those convicted of it to that article, but otherwise the individual criminal articles are much the same, except for the details: "__firstname__ __lastname__ was convicted of __exactcharge__ for leaving their infant in __exactlocation__, wrapped in __blanket/coat/nothing/whatever__. __criminal's name__ had been __at the gym/at the prom/doing laundry/at school/at work/whereever__ when the incident happened."

That's not to say Bovlb does not make a good point: there seems to be no article in wikipedia on the phenomena of young parents abandoning and murdering their own children. But rather than focusing on a few subjects of dubious noteriety, an article should be written that talks talks about and explores this phenomena (from a psychological and cultural stand point; why they do it; the effect on society; etc.) - I'm sure there are plenty of resources out there to competently draft an article. --Jeffrey O.

<li>It seems you’re making yet another ad hominem attack. (And here I thought that “conspiracy theorists” were the ones who made logical fallacies.)

<li>Stating that a group of people argue vehemently is an ad hominem attack? I think you don't understand the meaning. Regardless, your response doesn't address the point. As with my comment below, to do this article appropriately to include all viewpoints would result in an immense article. The list, as it stands now, is all people who do not agree with official conclusions. Thus, the content is more appropriate for the 9/11 conspiracy theories page. Please observe that I haven't voted to delete the content; merely merge it. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 21:11, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Calling people "conspirowackos" is ad hominem. So is calling them "conspiracy believers." Everyone believes that 9/11 was due to a conspiracy - the only debate is who was doing the conspiring. Responding to an argument by saying that people "argue vehemently" is a non sequitur. I apologize for not making it more clear which of your fallacies I was referring to. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 04:22, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your levity is appreciated, Durin, even if not refreshing, given the gravity of the tragedy at issue. Of course, adding researchers who have tried in vain to keep alive the Bush administration's deceptive and disproven conspiracy theories, linking Iraq to 9/11 and to stockpiles of WMDs, would be very much welcome (short of spamming); bring 'em on, to coin a phrase. Merging into an article including the term conspiracy is patently absurd, however. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 23:27, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Generally the term "September 11th researchers" has been used to mean researchers who believe there was complicity by the Bush Administration in 9/11, but if you would like to change your vote and include some of the more notable researchers hired by the government to uphold the official conspiracy theory (that a cabal of Muslim zealots living in caves in Afghanistan hatched a successful plot to defeat the world's most powerful air -defense system using box-cutters) then I would not object. The article could easily include a section for those researchers who believe there was U.S. government complicity and one for those who don't. That's what Wikipedia is all about - <i>presenting</i> both sides of an issue and letting the readers decide for themselves. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 20:18, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If I were to include the people as I suggested, per the current way in which the page is laid out, the page would greatly exceed recommended article length. My suggestion was intentionally tongue in cheek, and should have been read as such. The list of people researching 9/11 is immense, too much so for Wikipedia to have an article titled as this one. The article thus is inherently going to be biased towards conspiracy theories. As such, it deserves to be merged. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 21:11, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was well aware that that you were being rhetorical. I simply decided to call your bluff. I am quite serious about what I said though, so long as like Ombudsman said, you don't spam the article with hundreds of insignificant individuals. It should only include the most notable researchers from each side - with two categories - those researchers who believe there was U.S. government complicity in 9/11 and those who don't.</li>

<li>Then we should also be analyzing the significance of the people who are currently in the article if we go that direction. Before doing that, some metric needs to be established for how to count as significant. Anyone can publish a book; there are lots of companies that will enable you to publish, so that is not enough of a metric. Referring to WP:MUSIC #3 as a possible guideline, then we'd need two or more books from a major publisher by the author. The list of government investigators is <i>very</i> long, but their qualifications and notability are no less than most of the people currently on this list. Regardless of what you or I think, it's very clear from the current vote that this article will be merged; currently 9 merge 4 keep. If the article passes VfD as 'keep', then we can discuss metrics. Failing that, I'll refrain from commenting further. My vote for <i>merge</i> stands.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Someone with the title Professor in the UK is automatically of more note than an 'average professor' as usually defined in Wikipedia, as there are three levels below (Reader, Senior Lecturer and Lecturer) that get titled professor in the US. A quick Google Scholar search finds that her book E-moderating: the key to teaching and learning online has been cited a few hundred times, indicating importance in her field. The Independent Newspaper in the UK said ‘If you are serious about e-moderating, you should have a copy.’ She has been the key speaker at conferences <a href="http://www.atimod.com/profile/keynotes2002.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.atimod.com/profile/keynotes2002.shtml" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>, That was in an article about a car, not this article. <i>I agree that Kawasaki is a major manufacturer of bikes, I just didn't think that a single model deserved a page.</i> There was so little content that I found it unecessary to merge.

<li>What is the drawback of having many catalog-like articles? --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused">focused</a> 15:24, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That they tend to be rather short, must all include redundant information about the parent company, and are more easily accessed and compared if put in a list. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 10:17, Jun 10, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>These will develop far more than a simple list. Have a look at <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honda_Prelude_669c.html" title="Honda Prelude">Honda Prelude</a>. Further, each of these motorcycles should (eventually) have a photo, to help with identification. Significant products require both a list, and a separate article for each, ideally. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused">focused</a> 14:22, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The drawback is that, in my opinion, Wikipedia is not a catalogue. But do not think that I'm for deleting them (I voted to keep this one). Quite the opposite, i think it is unfortunate that some articles don't say anything about the product importance: which novelties does it include? (Even if simply a minor detail or a new combination of features); did it have any cultural impact?; was it a major selling product? Or a flop? Why?; etc.. On the other hand if nothing of relevance can be said about it... what's the article for? It should probably be in a list, which would give a better perspective to a then relevant set of products.--<a href="../../../n/a/b/User%7ENabla_d282.html" title="User:Nabla">Nabla</a> 02:55, 2005 Jun 12 (UTC)</li>

In addition, you have formatted the page as a blog or fan website would (heading-font, bold notices that "This Page is Under Construction" do not help), thereby lessening the encyclopedic value of the entry. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 07:08, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The comment to idont haveaname is not a personal assault, i was pointing out that he claimed it was an obvious hoax and patent nonsense dispite the fact that if you click one link you will see it is a real band. that is a CRITICISM of his voting technique, not an attack. ALSO it is my opinion that Weyes and his followers ARE abusing their power, that is not an attack, the only attack was there continued Speedy Deleting of the page. AND my comment to you to read the page had nothing to do with MUSIC, it had to do with the fact that you asked me to proof to you that this band EXISTS, please read what you wrote, you asked to prove it exists, and i told you to click the link to see it did. NOW you change the subject and ignore your original comments, how conveniant. -<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrowardBulldawg_2d70.html" title="User:BrowardBulldawg">BrowardBulldawg</a> 06:11, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Example: You asked: "Again, stop the personal attacks and come up with proof that this band exists from a verfiable source. " I replied: "AND LOOK AT THE LINK IN THE ARTICLE ITSELF. " then you completely change the subject and IGNORE your first comments in order to discredit me by saying: "... second, i read the page, still doesn't prove anything under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>."

<li>If you read the rest of my post, it also talks about notability... and the first post i made was about <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>... so i don't see how that really applies, plus, you really brought up the issue of notability by editting the original page to that the band member's name actually match up... <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch<span class="Unicode">′</span></a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">Talk</a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">Contributions</a> 06:29, Jun 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>First, under the original page and the band members listed, it turned up 0 hits, therefore, that was a valid hoax. After you edited the page, you then changed the band members to the correct name. After you did that, this brings up the issue of notability brought upon the page by yourself by correcting your <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_nonsense.html" title="Patent nonsense">nonsensical</a> origial page which indeed contained false information about the band members. So really, you yourself are responsible for the change of topic because you EDITED the page. So therefore, even after the edits, it still is a valid <b>Delete</b> because it fails the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> test. As for your excuse the it is your opinion the Weyes are abusing their power, it is still as personal attack. The second you express your opinion, it can be interpreted as so (i.e. "I think &lt;&lt;insert any name here&gt;&gt; is an idiot because of his edits" would just be an opinion of an person, but also a peronal attack). Again, I reitterate, the original page, seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fallen_Desire&amp;oldid=14862664" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fallen_Desire&amp;oldid=14862664" rel="nofollow">here</a> was to be speedied as it was a hoax and did not contain the link at the time. Hope that answers your questions, either way, the page is not Wikipedia material.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I have added information to the article, including: Humbug is <i>one of the earliest <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux_user_group.html" title="Linux user group">Linux user groups</a> in Australia</i>; and <i>HUMBUG hosted the third national <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.conf.au.html" title="Linux.conf.au">Linux and Open Source conference</a></i> in 2002. Googling on their full title gives 839 hits.

<li><b>Comment</b>. For people not acquainted with the UK education system, please take note that this is not a preschool. It is subject to inspections by the same agency that inspects all schools and it teaches the national curriculum. The last OFSTED inspection examined and praised teaching quality with respect to "mathematics and the reading, speaking and listening aspects of English." This particular school didn't do so well, apparently, teaching kids to write--this was based on the national SAT tests at age 7. It may teach children aged 4-7, but that is the age at which British children start attending school and learning to read, write and do mathematics. It's a serious teaching institution, not a nursery school. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:59, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Tony, on this VfD entry (and several others), you have voted to keep. Might I ask why? I understand one of your reasons is that you feel as though it is acceptable to include minor entries because <i>Wikipedia is not paper</i>. I'm claiming that, even though Wikipedia does have virtually unlimited room to grow, its goal is still to be an encyclopaedic reference work. As such, non-notable entries, such as this one, must not be allowed to flourish. This school (and the other that you and I have voted on) is non-notable, has no listed well-known alumni, and seems to be just another minor educational facility. This is one step away from allowing every principal, teacher, or tutor to have their own wikipedia entry, which, I gather, is generally frowned upon. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">Jasonglchu</a> 15:13, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay. I see somewhat where you're coming from, after reading <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a>.

<li><a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> in general recommends merging because these schools rarely seem to get deleted. Schools are public entities so it's very, very easy to acquire public neutral about them and present it in a neutral manner. For instance I added a link to the OFSTED report for one school and may do the same for this one. Schools appear in the local press, in political campaigns, and as premises for polling stations and the like.</li>

<li>Searching the deletion archives for 2003, I find no records of any deletion discussions relating to elementary schools. None. The earliest elementary/junior school deletion debate I can find is in May, 2004, barely a year ago. The result was deletion, A grand total of eight editors, including the nominator, were involved in the discussion.</li>
<li>The next elementary up for deletion was Meriwether Lewis Elementary School in July last year, just eleven months ago. A grand total of twelve editors were involved in that discussion and the result was delete but this was complicated by a copyright issue.</li>
<li>Dodd middle school, listed the very next day, barely scraped a result that the closer interpreted as "rough consensus [to delete] (10 delete, 5 keep, 2 anon votes)". Clearly there is no truth to any claim that there has been near unanimity on the question of elementary schools for years. Wikipedia simply hasn't been considering the issue for long enough for that to be true, and the figures, such as they exist, are far from suggestive of unanimity. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:53, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What does "fourteen displayed hits" mean? Surely you're not relying on google to tell you all there is to know about a school! If an article contains unverifiable information, the solution to this problem is to remove the information. Deleting the article is not necessary in such cases. Could you explain why you think infant schools (this is not a preschool) are not encyclopedic? In what significant operational way do they differ from high schools, which also have teachers, pupils, sports teams, premises, curricula and community links? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:53, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don;t think high schools are encyclopedic, either, but at least most of those years are remembered by students--for most people earlier grades are mostly a blur.

<li>It's there for finding something interesting that you otherwise won't find. If there would be a one-line substub for each preschool in the world like that one all useful content in Wikipedia would be outnumbered. People are wasting time on wikifying these articles, but no one reads them, because there's nothing to read. Everyone who has any relation to that school knows everything in that article already. Everyone other just doesn't care.

<li>Once you get beyond these evidence-free statements I don't think there's a lot to the anti-school argument.</li>
<li>Schools are of intense interest to many people, particularly parents. The sheer amount of online information about each school in my country is quite formidable. Nearly every school is inspected once every five years and the inspection reports are online. This is an inherently encyclopedic piece of information. With schools on Wikipedia we can (and are in the process of) map every single US public school to the related school district and municipality. This enhances the articles on the municipalities themselves. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:20, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>FWIW, the lyrics given are seven brief lines. If it can be confirmed that this is indeed the state anthem, these are the lyrics, and someone includes some sort of brief writeup about the song, I'm not sure that the Malay lyrics couldn't be kept here, or that it's extended source material that should go to Wikisource.

<li>Until there is enough to say about an individual school for it to merit its own article (which is NOT the case here) <b>MERGE</b> into an article on its parent school district. Dogmatically voting to keep as an independent article based on the generic subject without regard to the state of the actual content is really revolting.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Did you check to see whether those voting keep had done any school editing? I don't think you did. I have just looked at every keep voter on this discussion, and failed to find a single one who does not engage in school article cleanup. You're putting the cart before the horse in any case; <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> recommends merge as an alternative to listing deletion, and this is likely to be far, far more effective because no discussion is involved, you just do it and move on. If all those listing for deletion would just carry out that minimal act of maintenance we wouldn't need to have *any* schools listed on VfD. And that would be a good thing. It seems that May VfD closings are heading for 100% keep, and I really don't expect June VfD closings to be any different. Wikipedia doesn't like to delete school articles. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 09:19, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree with your last comment—I wish people would just merge these useless stubs rather than listing them for deletion. As to your first comment, my apologies to those who have actually cleaned up school articles, but I so very rarely see it happen <i>during</i> a VfD discussion (if ever). The typical story is that the "article," containing little more than an address, is listed for deletion and a parade of generic "keep" votes appear that bear no specific relationship to the content of the "article," which remains just as pathetic at the close of the discussion. More people would vote "keep" if there was actually something worth keeping when they're considering their votes. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 16:11, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To a large extent, the specific content of the article is not relevant to the deletion. The article is being put up for deletion due to a "lack of notability." This is inherant in the topic, not the content of the article. Either the topic is notable or it is not, regardless of the article's content, or so it seems to me. If nominators are here to contest the notability of schools, they can expect repetative keep votes as well as repetative delete votes, because most every nomination is the same debate. If nominators want articles improved, merge them or send them to cleanup. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 21:41, 2005 Jun 9 (UTC)

<ol>
<li>Biting the deletionists: You <i>know</i> (or should know) that articles about schools will <i>always</i> be kept. So there is not much point in nominating them just so you can make your delete votes. Being bold and merging this immediatetely requires only <i>two</i> edits, as opposed to the <i>three</i> required for nominating this for deletion.</li>

<li>Okay, fine. See my reply. I do resent the implication that someone who doesn't agree with deletion of an article should do cleanup on it (VfD is not, or should not be, cleanup) but as it happens those whom you castigate here do not deserve it because <i>they have all cleaned up school articles.</i> --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 09:24, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm not trying to bite very <i>hard</i>. Sorry if you were offended, and I have think your efforts with school articles are admirable.&#160;:-) But I think that very short two-liners might as well be merged, and then unmerged later if someone wants to expand it, and my agreement with Postdlf was that it was not neccesary to vote an outright "keep" on twoliners. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 11:58, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Ah, I see now. Wikipedia has a large amount of space, so we can just ignore all standards. As long as a select few of the articles are good (say, one hundred thousand), several hundred thousand more are medicore, and several million more are just plain bad, an impartial observer would think the one hundred thousand good ones illustrate the level of quality on wikipedia despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. And here I thought that falling in to the trap of doing something just becasue one can was going to hurt wikipedia in the long run. My aplogies. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 04:02, Jun 13, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I just don't see where the urgency is to delete articles because you think they're "bad". Make them good! <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 04:49, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I dont see how this article "ignores all standards" at all. As <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> just noted, Wikipedia is a work in progress. If the majority of the articles are "bad" it is solely because they have yet to be worked on. Just because an article is not in a highly-polished finished form does not mean it merits deletion. Also, I was <b>not</b> arguing that we should keep this article "just because we can". I was merely stating that any argument that we should not keep this article because of space constraints is invalid. Therefore I was arguing that we should keep the article because we (as this VfD vote has more or less proven) as a community beleive it should stay AND because we can logistically have it stay. -<a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunningLinguist_5ed1.html" title="User:CunningLinguist">CunningLinguist</a> 07:21, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>A rational and impartial observer would measure wikipedia by the total amount and accessibility of information. Deleting useful but below average article just to make a better impression on random page users is not an honest way to represent wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 21:03, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree. I think that a rational and impartial observer would measure wikipedia by the total amount of <b>encyclopedic</b> information. If the majority of wikipedia articles are not encyclopedic, then it will not be well thought of as an encyclopedia. There is a faction here that believes an encyclopedia should include every scrap of information in that ever has existed. This is not the point of wikipedia, otherwise, we would not have a list of <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">what wikipedia is not</a>. As wikipedia is not paper, it can include much that a paper encyclopedia cannot, but the information still needs to be encyclopedic. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 03:30, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>We can differ on whether school articles are generally encyclopedic, and on whether a given school article is encyclopedic. I think it's readily apparent that Wikipedia very rarely regards school articles as irretrievably unencyclopedic. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 03:35, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not convinced that rational and impartial observers on the whole spend their days in "measuring" Wikipedia. Some might even be quite impressed to find a short, informative article on even the most banal of things. Personally, I am deeply impressed at the quality of our breadth of coverage. Yes, there are rubbish short articles, but so very many good ones too. And I take a delicious pleasure in making the former into the latter where I can. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 04:24, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Very well said Grace Note, I completely agree. I personally find an amazing part of Wikipedia to be when I find articles that a traditional encyclopedia would not cover, such as say on pop culture info. No we should not just cover any scrap of information imaginable but at the same time, this is not just any other old encyclopedia, I think we are trying to go above and beyond that. -<a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunningLinguist_5ed1.html" title="User:CunningLinguist">CunningLinguist</a> 07:19, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>My god, there's an article on <i><a href="../../../i/n/t/Interceptor_%28TV_series%29_42d4.html" title="Interceptor (TV series)">Interceptor</a></i>? I remember that. I disagree with the phrase "<i>It was received well critically and by viewers</i>", which seems very much unlike my own recollection; it was awful, everybody hated it, it was a joke, it flopped terribly.

<li>I liked it. Yes, Annabel Croft was rubbish but Sean O'Kane was good, and the series didn't flop: it got reasonable ratings but became a casualty of internal ITV politics.

<li>Comment: I've got to disagree with you on that. Why is G-BOAC any more significant than other aircraft of its class? It might deserve a mention under <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concorde.html" title="Concorde">Concorde</a>. --<a href="../../../x/c/a/User%7EXcali_e28f.html" title="User:Xcali">Xcali</a> 15:47, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: I can think of a couple of reasons -- First off, as the second Concorde built and one of the test aircraft, holding several records, it is more notable than the remaining fleet. Wikipedia has entries on other notable aircraft of a series, such as <a href="../../../c/h/i/China_Clipper_a5e5.html" title="China Clipper">China Clipper</a>. If BOAC had been prescient enough to name their fleet, we'd probably make an entry here using the aircraft's name instead of registration and I doubt the entry would be questioned. Second, BOAC has nmemonic value, and it's one of the few registration numbers I can associate with a notable plane. <a href="../../../b/o/l/User%7EBollar_3977.html" title="User:Bollar">Bollar</a> 16:04, Jun 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b>. I have to agree, the individual generic 737-200s and 737-300s are all so identical to each other that it is meaningless to make separate articles on each indivisual airplane. This is in contrast to cruise ships which are usually built individually (or in small series, and not by the hundred). I suggest that if an airlines fleetlist can be found, that an external link to it be placed on each airliners article, in that way readers can easily access information about individual planes if that's what they want. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:00, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>One person's untested speculation does not constitute a scientific theory and does not warrant an article in an encyclopedia.

<li>Again, all that article has to say about this topic is once sentence that says, <i>And more controversially still, he has suggested that homosexuality is caused by an infection.</i> At most, that belongs in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Cochran_683c.html" title="Gregory Cochran">Gregory Cochran</a> article. <i>Out</i> magazine recently reported that Elizabeth Taylor's dog Sugar recently passed on -- appearing in <i>Out</i> magazine does not inherently make something worth documenting on Wikipedia. Even the primary source you cite (article from <i>Out</i> says): <i>It is worth repeating that there is no evidence for a gay germ yet.</i> and <i>At this point, there is only speculation pitted against speculation.</i> Wikipedia is not the place for putting forward rampant speculation as legitimate scientific theory (which requires that a conjecture be tested and shown to hold true to the empirical evidence, among other things). --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 17:30, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Then say in the article it is 'rampant speculation', if indeed you can find such a quote. So far there are a number (3?) of mainstream sources I've quoted that talk about this issue, be it a theory or conjecture or however you wish to classify this concept. How many sources do you want from your statement "citation of reliable sources are necessary for an alleged 'scientific theory'", there are a variety of theories that are wrong, and controversial yet if they are in magazines and come from known scientists then it seems to me it has a place on Wikipedia.

<li>Firstly, I think that what this Gregory Cochran has been promulgating is utter rubbish. But that is irrelevant. If this theory is, as Tabor has said, the unverifiable ramblings of a small group of men, it has no place on Wikipedia, so then my vote would be <b>delete</b>.

<li>The fact that this has been put up on VfD doesn't mean that no research or no edits are possible, Shaun. It's what happened to <a href="../../../u/p/t/Upton%2C_Warwickshire_bde9.html" title="Upton, Warwickshire">Upton, Warwickshire</a>, and those edits turned the article from a certain delete into a certain keep.

<li>Ewald is evidently quite careful about what he says on the topic; I don't know that "support" would be quite the word. From your own source: <i>In a carefully worded e-mail, Ewald, for his part, asserts only that "the argument about infectious causation of homosexuality is a feasible hypothesis and should be treated as such—no more and no less."</i> Untested hypotheses are not Wikipedia material unless they are newsworthy in their own right, such as <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_fusion.html" title="Cold fusion">cold fusion</a>. If other editors believe that a single sentence in the Economist reporting what someone has "suggested" and an article in <i>Out</i> magazine constitute sufficient newsworthiness to overcome the lack of any peer-reviewed scientific publications, so be it.

<li>One problem is that if an eccentric notion is not widely publicised and not widely believed, as well as being far outside what is established in mainstream science, no scientist is going to bother criticizing or rejecting it; no one is going to give it a second thought, because no credible scientific source is going to publish it. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 22:44, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps a broader article about Cochran's idea that conditions that the layperson would expect to be "bred out" might all be caused by microbes would be a better idea. The hypothesis he's putting forward is not unscientific -- and nothing like as offensive as some are trying to make out -- but it's not a widely pursued line of thought. Does that make it not worth coverage? Well, he's got a bit of press -- on the gay germ angle -- so it's been noted. We shouldn't be judging the notability of scientific, or quasiscientific, ideas on our own account but merely considering whether they are part of the general discourse on science and things scientific. This seems to be to me, but I don't much like this particular article. So no vote from me but I'd like to see this merged into a less contentiously titled article (avoiding the word "theory").<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 07:46, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>Non-notable: I live in Delaware, a scant 60 minute drive from Philadelphia, and am an amateur graf artist and emcee very into hip-hop culture.

<li>I've been on wikipedia for a while, though not much of an editor - i'm a lurker by admission. Though I would imagine that shouldn't have any weight on the matter - my logic and reasoning should count over why I am here. And this is something that I have knowledge and a vested interest in. Isn't a passion for a subject matter the way many articles get written on wikipedia? If we had a ban on people writing or commenting on articles they have a vested interest in, nothing would get written!&#160;:D I want to see entries on online gaming organizations in this Wiki - its not a fad, its not some small thing, and I believe its notable enough to deserve an entry on this Wiki. I orignally voted a weak delete on this article due to it being a blatant advert, saying that I would change my vote if it was edited not to be.

<li><b>Retain</b> Apparently, they have over 200 members, which is above the example low threshold of interest. A similar page exists for Sturmgrenadier. Oddly enough, Sunder is made up of former members of Sturmgrenadier. Together they <i>claim</i> a thousand members. Perhaps significant, perhaps not.

<li><b>Delete</b> Even if the 200 members claim is true, 200 members isn't nearly enough for an encylopedia entry by that criterion alone.

<li>Maybe we should give them a chance to change it to an encyclopedic article instead of outright deletion - there's already a notice about NNPOV there.

<li><b>Merge</b> with a larger article about online organizations. It's unreasonable to expect something that's been around for less than 6 months to appear on Alexa. There are also a number of equally prominent gaming organizations that don't have entries in Wikipedia, such as Conquest www.conquest-guild.org, Afterlife www.afterlifeguild.org, and Fires of Heaven www.fohguild.org. All of the aforementioned organizations have been around longer than either Sunder or Sturmgrenadier, and have had a much larger impact on gaming in general, regardless of their memberbases. Frankly, this dispute seems to have erupted out of a vendetta against Sunder on the part of Sturmgrenadier, as both users Habap and ChronoSphere are current members of Sturmgrenadier. It's notable that both have voted to delete the Sunder entry, but to retain the Sturmgrenadier entry, in spite of the inherent similarities of each organization and each entry. --Vyrus 18:20, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The similarities between the Sturmgrenadier article and the Sunder article are superficial - Sturmgrenadier is larger, older by almost 5 years, is ranked on Alexa <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=sturmgrenadier.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=sturmgrenadier.com" rel="nofollow">Sturmgrenadier.com</a>and has been mentioned in mainstream press by USA Today on June 24th, 2003. And as you may note by reading the text next to my vote above, my rationale behind voting was because the article was a blatant advert - not because I am a member of SG. Please take care to read the discussion in its entirety before making declarations on editors intentions.

<li><b>Keep</b> I use this page all the time. There are many such "lists" on Wikipedia (even a new "best of lists" featured article category). The notion that every article must be like a traditional book-bound encyclopedia is not accurate.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's not just that the article is useful and provides helpful context; the assemblage of all these terms in one place makes it encyclopedic.

<li>That makes no sense. For GFDL requirements, the old article's contribution history gets included in the parent article's history when information is merged. We do <i>not</i> have to keep the merged article or even a redirect. Also, no non-VFD pages link to this article except two which can easily be changed. <b>No vote</b>; I would think this could be merged to a section in another article, but failing that, the consensus pushes me more toward Keep than I would have leaned. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 18:33, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have no problem deleting this but you may be wrong on the copyvio. The first half of the "hater" definition was created over two years ago and the second paragraph was added by another user (or user name at least) over a year later, and still more than a year ago. The web site you cited in your copyvio notice, on the other hand, has no entries in the Internet Archive, while the Wikepedia page appears twice. Though not dispositive, it strikes me that it is more than likely that the other site lifted the definition from Wikipedia, not vice versa. Why should we have to start rewriting articles just because other sites take Wikipedia works without attribution? <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 23:15, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, and here is why. I want everyone to open the history log on this article and click on the first few edits. His range was Bb9? One and half to two octaves higher than Minnie and Mariah (the queens of the whistle register). I mean, <b>IF</b> I wanted to do an autobiography, I sure as well am going to add date of birth, and other life crap to make the article at least appear encyclopedic on the outside (vane maybe&#160;:-) ). But I sure has hell do <b>NOT</b> need to guess my vocal range, or whatever. The record was a C#8, but he hit E8 (which is higher) on the show? Why wasn't the record for E8 (its just as easy to prove E8 as C#8 if its happening in the same context, no?). I think this is <b>NOT</b> Adam Lopez Costa the singer, but a poser who needs reversion and possible blocking.

<li><b>Comment</b>, looking back at whistle register, I remember how the articles talk of the extreme altitude in a C8. Soon after, 152.163.100.7, writes about Artimius Rollins hitting a brief C#8. I removed that, and other info was added about <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melisma.html" title="Melisma">melisma</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staccato.html" title="Staccato">staccato</a> (both rather separate concepts). Suddenly the info was back with he uses melisma and staccato and a brief C#8. Its as if the person is using the extreme note and pasting a "X does it better". I really believe 152.163.100.7 and User:Adam Lopez may be related and if the article talked about C9, he would have hit E9.

<li>I guess I'm missing something. We do NOT know that this user is <b>THE</b> Adam Lopez, and secondly, why isn't this encyclopedic. As a true fan of the human abilities in the whistle register, I think it is good to know that their is documented evidence of <b>men</b> being able to pitch in those altitudes. That it isn't just a "female club". I won't disagree with verifiability being immportant and vanity being bad, but I worry that Wikipedia is becoming a "if Google doesn't have it, it has no business existing", type of forum. There is a website (I think its on free hosts) that has a RealAudio clip of him pitching the Bb7. I only agree the discrepancy between the text and the Guiness link is <b>BLATANT</b>; however, while he may not be important to the world en mass, he is important to fans of the whistle register (for which there are a few) and is QUITE encyclopedic, if for no other reason that for historical posterity. Females in club do exist from time to time, but he is about the <b>ONLY</b> example of a male in this extreme altitude <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares33712_1845.html" title="User:Antares33712">Antares33712</a> 21:33, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b>, some bars &amp; social clubs are notable, this one isn't - I live 20 minutes away from Yatton, have driven through the village to its railway station countless times, and have a friend who lives there, but I'd never heard of it before reading this article. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 07:29, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>; most social clubs have nothing verifiable beyond a name, maybe a meeting location, maybe a pale semblance of a purpose, and officers which change every year or more in fashions not conducive to maintainability. Their events and activities aren't even close to encyclopedic significance, except maybe a very few such as the Friars Club Roast. Grace Note is incorrect, in that "notability" for WP purposes isn't subjective; it's about objective facts like widespread coverage by mainstream media, or ongoing published controversy in the major journals covering a field. None of this is shown in the article or vote comments. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 18:49, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's a bar that serves alcoholic drinks. And - Get this! - it has a pool table, snooker table, dart board, table skittles, and a jukebox. How unusual is that! <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> is wrong.
