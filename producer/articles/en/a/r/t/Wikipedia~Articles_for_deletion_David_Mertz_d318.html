<p>This page was up for deletion once before but I decided to list it again. The article seem to be a total vanity article. When discussing whether or not to delete the article before, the subject of the article, who is <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> was asked to refrain from editing the article. He has been unable to do so and has made almost weekly edits to it changing wordings, listing himself as in categories (such as philosopher) which he may or may not actually be qualified as. He did seem to appear in a few Google searches, but that's not very hard to do. I myself have published books, have taught classes, and have many of the same qualifications as this man seems to have, but I don't feel the need to glorify myself or make a completely vanity-like article. The fact that this user himself is the one who's done most of the workl on the article, and has made the majority of the edits, especially after being asked not to do so, is troubling to me and puts the reputation of wikipedia at stake. {See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_David_Mertz_Archive_262f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/David Mertz/Archive">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/David Mertz/Archive</a> for the previous deletion vote) --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottyBoy900Q_4200.html" title="User:ScottyBoy900Q">ScottyBoy900Q</a> 15:35, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would urge editors to read <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>, which reads in part: <i>Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more</i>.

<dd>My book on <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addison-Wesley_c410.html" title="Addison-Wesley">Addison-Wesley</a> has sold about 3500 printed copies to-date (but has just gone to second printing in the last week), but has been downloaded approximately <b>70,000</b> times in its electronic version. The website gnosis.cx is essentially exclusively for archival publications of my articles first published in other places. It has received visits from approximately <b>750k</b> distinct IP addresses (which only loosely correlates with eyeballs, of course). However, the original publishers, chiefly IBM <a href="../../../d/e/v/DeveloperWorks_76db.html" title="DeveloperWorks">developerWorks</a>, O'Reilly ONLamp<a href="http://www.onlamp.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.onlamp.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and Intel's (now terribly unorganized) developer site, certainly receive more readers on first publication (of my articles specifically) than does my archival site. So in other words, <i>my readership is approximately</i> <b>two orders of magnitude</b> <i>beyond the (admittedly minimal) recomendation WP provides for notability.</i></dd>

<dd>I took a look at Google Scholar for my name. It's a cool tool; I haven't really used it before. There seems to be a "DB Mertz" who is an ethologist, and is not me. But looking through the 67 basic hits, I see that 38 of them are really about me. Fewer than half of those concern any work for IBM. It appears that I have a number of citations and acknowledgement related to my philosophy work that I had not been aware of. Cool! See: <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22david+mertz%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22david+mertz%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>

<dd>Also of interest—at least to me—is Google Print. See: <a href="http://print.google.com/print?q=%22david+mertz%22&amp;btnG=Search+Print" class="external autonumber" title="http://print.google.com/print?q=%22david+mertz%22&amp;btnG=Search+Print" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Interestingly, all of the 11 books that contain my name in their text are genuinely references to me. It's delightful to me (for vanity reasons) that books as diverse as <i>Women's Health Solutions</i>, <i>Understandings of Russian Foreign Policy</i>, <i>Philosophy of Science and Its Discontents</i>, <i>Python Cookbook: 2nd Edition</i>, <i>Fear, Truth, Writing: From Paper Village to Electronic Community</i>, and <i>Sexual Investigations</i> all mention me. Mostly just by way of brief acknowledgments or citations of a single paper; I'm certainly not claiming that any of those are significantly about me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The basic "Google test" shows about 85k hits on my name, about 95% are to me rather than someone else sharing my name. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 05:14, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Google Scholar turns up some half-dozen hits (admittedly in IBM publications) so I don't feel it's <i>total</i> vanity although it is somewhat self-promotional. I too am disturbed by the edit pattern, but it did fairly clearly survive the previous Afd and the request there by <i>Smoddy (Rabbit and pork)</i>that <i>Lulu</i> not edit the page further can hardly be taken as binding. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 16:26, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Don't think so - all the votes were cast before that last-minute request went in.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This is just absurd (again). Yeah I'm the guy the article is about, and I've done a number of <i>small</i> edits on it, but the substantial content was written by our fine admin SlimVirgin (and contributions by other top-notch editors). But either way, "David Mertz" is both meaningfully discussed in a bunch of Wikipedia articles (on computer programming-ish topics), and read by hundreds of thousands of readers (a magnitude more than watch the minor porn actors with articles, or ever attended some high school with an article). I mean, 85,700 google results on "David Mertz" isn't an accident (about 95% are the right david mertz). Nor is the high Alexa rating on the site gnosis.cx where my articles get archived. Contrary to my "sworn enemy" Jguk, my contributions to Wikipedia are completely non-notable in this article, and that's why they are not mentioned. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 17:08, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just the fact that you're so dedicated to making sure the article stays seems to justify my claim that its for vanity. I have a degree in history...does that mean I should list myself amongst the most notable 20th century historians and create an article about myself...no! You just don't seem significant enough to warrant having your own article. The very idea that you edit it and keep editing it to me indicates its just for self promotion. If we made a page for every minor person who works in every occupation, we'd have so many rubbish articles.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Although this may sound fan-boyish and David has pointed the AfD request out to me, but I do find David Mertz to be notable, especially in programmer circles (3 hits on Slashdot on his name is notable in my book). He is a widely read, widely cited, widely published author. Then there is the Open Voting Consortium; David is the CTO and was recently <a href="http://www.openvotingconsortium.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=35" class="external text" title="http://www.openvotingconsortium.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=35" rel="nofollow">nominated for the Open Source for Elections panel of the State of California</a>, together with <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Perens_e2e2.html" title="Bruce Perens">Bruce Perens</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't think that articles on people should have to jump hrdles set higher than video-game characters, American villages, or pop singles; this article would in fact jump hurdles much higher than any of those, and (as <a href="../../../f/a/w/User%7EFawcett5_8093.html" title="User:Fawcett5">Fawcett5</a> and others have commented) clearly meets the normal criteria for notability and verifiability. <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> says: "If Mertz was not a wikipedia contributor this would be a slam-dunk delete"; I don't actually understand the refernce (I think that it's to basketball, but that's the best I can do), though I understand its general meaning — and it's surely the other way round: if the subject <i>weren't</i> a Wikipedia contributor no-one would have thought to delete the article. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:26, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree that if he <i>weren't</i> a Wikipedia editor, this article would unquestionably be kept.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have no reason to doubt that this AfD was brought in good faith. However, while I had personally never heard of David Mertz, there is sufficient evidence of notability, through google searches, and online bookshop searches, etc. His book "usually ships within 24 hours" at Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk. (The more obscure titles have "usually ships within two months, but may not be available at all".) The book seems to be popular and to sell well. Obviously, it was against Wikipedia policy for Lulu to have started the article, but he explained in the first AfD that he was unaware of that policy at the time.

<dd>As is noted in the article talk page (and the prior failed VfD), I <i>did not</i> write the article. I copies it from a bio at another wiki that discusses various computer people. Yeah, I performed the cut-and-paste, but not the composition. In any case, take a look at the edits: I made pretty many, but they're stuff like typos and wikification, overwhelmingly... nothing that even comes close to NPOV issues. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 02:14, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> based on the qualifying publishing information and minor notability. The difference between Wikipedia and other encyclopedias is that we are not constrained by space and thus can include minor notables if they meet some basic criteria.
