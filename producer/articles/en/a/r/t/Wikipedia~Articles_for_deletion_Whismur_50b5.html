<p>Non-notable Pokemon. It has never actually been written about outside the anime, card game, and video games, and even in those places, it's not very notable at all. Lack of secondary sources other than Pokedex entries (and Bulbapedia, which hardly counts as more) doesn't help. People who close this as a speedy keep with no discussion will be eaten by <a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Grue" class="extiw" title="uncyclopedia:Grue">Grues</a>. <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 16:03, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Pokémon <i>only</i> exist within the anime, card game, and video games, and this one is just a specific one of the near 500 that currently exist. Just because this one has not appeared in many of either of the media does not mean that it should be deleted. There are Pokémon that have only appeared in two of the three media, but that does not mean that their article should be deleted either. It has been a goal of the <a href="../../../p/c/p/WP%7EPCP_c57f.html" title="WP:PCP">WikiProject for Pokémon</a> to get presentable articles on all of the species, and this is one of them. To compare, some relatively non-notable Pokémon articles are <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">good</a>, and at least two articles are <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured</a> (these Pokémon are somewhat more prevalent in the metaseries, though).—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Ryūlóng</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="gold">竜龍</font></a>) 21:31, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

</li>
<li>One might count my opinion as biased, considering I'm mostly here to deal with any issues which involve Bulbapedia on the Wikipedia; however, given that this was brought to my attention, I must note that I fail to see a major, significant difference between Whismur's article, which is being considered for deletion, and Weedle's article, which has good article status - particularly when one notes that Weedle is a first-generation Pokémon and Whismur is a third-generation Pokémon, which inevitably leads to three times the amount of reference material on Weedle as on Whismur. Beyond that, the differences can be whittled down to the <i>In other media</i> section - all Pokémon media, of course - fluff, and polish. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaydeis_edf7.html" title="User:Jaydeis">Jaydeis</a> 00:35, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I can't possibly see any good reason in deleting one single Pokemon article out of hundreds.

<li>Further comments - I'm sure we've had dozens, if not hundreds, of similar discussions before. All this seems to be aimed at is changing precedent. I don't quite understand the nominator's motives, but in my opinion nominating individual Pokemon only puts a strain on the deletion system. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 01:29, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Because the <b>one</b> article has a reason I can see to delete.

<ul>
<li>What makes it non-notable? It's been featured in an episode of the anime, it's listed among all of the other ones known at both official and fansites, it's probably been published in one of the various handbooks, just like every other one.—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Ryūlóng</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="gold">竜龍</font></a>) 02:39, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Well, actually, yes, putting Whismur up for deletion does assume exactly that. What you're arguing is whether or not Whismur is notable enough in and of itself to have an article of its own. If there are grounds enough to justify thus far every Pokémon having a separate article, there should be more than enough grounds to justify group articles. So, if Whismur is not notable enough for a single article, then it should be in a group article; but what's the point of a group article if only Whismur and Whismur alone is in it? Why not, in such a case, just have the article for Whismur? Or do you expect everyone to simply pretend Whismur doesn't exist? Or include it as a footnote on the articles for Loudred and Exploud? Deleting one out of 493 serves no purpose except to make an incomplete set. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaydeis_edf7.html" title="User:Jaydeis">Jaydeis</a> 02:41, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comments</b>: while I don't have a strong feeling about this article per se, I feel that the nominator and nomination have been treated unfairly by many&#160;!voters. I have recently seen many AfD's where there were complaints because the nominator had created a mass nomination (nominating multiple related articles at the same time). Now, people are complaining because the nominator has <i>not</i> created a mass nomination. This is unfair, and does not reflect the nomination. This nomination is not a call to delete Whismur and keep all other Pokémons, but a call to delete Whismur, full stop. After this AfD, and depending on the comments and the result, every editor can choose to nominate other articles and/or merge them. Another comment is that it is not right to nominate an article for deletion because it only has in-universe references (only references in the show, card game, ...). However, this is a perfect argument for deletion. If no one had ever written anything out-of-universe about <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhett_Butler_0705.html" title="Rhett Butler">Rhett Butler</a> (a terribly unsourced article for the moment) or <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tintin_and_Snowy_30cc.html" title="Tintin and Snowy">Tintin and Snowy</a> (a much better example), it would be perfectly allright to delete these articles, since the only sources then would be primary sources, making Wikipedia a secondary source, when it has to be a tertiary source. Every article that fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, no matter if it is about something obscure of about a detail of a well-known subject, is a fair candidate for deletion. Now, a good argument to keep this article anyway is to point to the available secondary sources (books, articles <i>about</i> Pokémon: not game manuals and so on though, those are still primary sources), of which there are a few listed. Since I am unable to judge if these books fit the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> criteria (independent? reliable?), I am in no position to decide if this AfD should get a <i>delete</i> or a <i>weak keep</i>, but I still wanted to comment on the many people unjustly targeting the nomination instead of targeting the subkect and its merits and faults, as an AfD discussion should do. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:54, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article itself is not bad. It is sourced just like any other article on a particular Pokémon species. In fact, it even passes a notability requirement for a singular Pokémon that the nominator believes it has failed, which i had also brought up. It's not feasible to merge any of these articles into lists due to their length, nor does it make sense that a single species' article be deleted when it could be improved upon, or other matters be dealt with. This character will probably not be mentioned in the New York Times, or other notable news media like some others have, but Whismur is alongside probably 300 similar cases. The man who knows nothing about Pokémon is only going to know Pikachu, but that does not certainly mean only that one species gets an article, while all of the other ones are relegated to lists. All Pokémon species are only going to be mentioned in</li>

<li>All of which are listed within each article on each species. There are probably another few sources that I have forgotten to mention, but something like <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotom.html" title="Rotom">Rotom</a> is not going to be spoken about any time soon.—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Ryūlóng</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="gold">竜龍</font></a>) 18:18, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Agreed, but of the six kind of sources you mention, only the fourth and fifth can be considered <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources, with the fourth having the problem that they aren't independent of the subject, and the fifth that they <i>may</i> not be by reliable, fact-checking publishers and authors (but the latter is a possibility I can't judge). So my only question is if the mentions in these sources (especially source number 5) meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. If not, the articles have to go, no matter how many fans Pokémon has (but then a merge may be a solution, if more can be said about larger groups of Pokémon). If, on the other hand, these books are good <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources and e.g. Whismur is discussed in them in more detail than just a passing mention, then these articles have every right to stay. The other sources are only of supplementary value: 1, 2 and 3 are primary sources, and 6 is of no value for Wikipedia (no matter how good such sites may be). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:57, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Like everyone's been saying, If we delete this one, then why not delete other Pokemon articles as well? <a href="../../../j/o/i/User%7EJoizashmo_803f.html" title="User:Joizashmo">Joiz</a> <a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A"><sup>A.</sup></a> <a href="../../../j/o/i/User_talk%7EJoizashmo_eb05.html" title="User talk:Joizashmo">Shmo</a> 20:42, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Pokemon aren't non-notable. What about if something links to a Whismur article? As odd as it might sound to some, all pokemon articles are noticable. Yes, even down to Nidoran F. <a href="../../../t/o/a/User%7EToastypk_a70f.html" title="User:Toastypk">Toastypk</a> 05:05, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>: I don't really think that we have completely proven that it is impossible to write an article on Whismur or any other Pokemon like <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitsuhoney.html" title="Mitsuhoney">Mitsuhoney</a>. There was a lot of discussion on the <a href="../../../p/c/p/WP%7EPCP_c57f.html" title="WP:PCP">WP:PCP</a> talk page about possible mass merging of these near-500 Pokemon creature articles, but that conclusion was never reached, and such an action would create Wikipedia's version of the Los Angeles Riots, I'm sure. Keep in mind that this page never had an editing focus like other articles, but there's certainly room for it. I think <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silcoon.html" title="Silcoon">Silcoon</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cascoon.html" title="Cascoon">Cascoon</a> are even less notable than Whismur, but several months back I had completely rewritten them, and now it's a matter of sourcing those pages to create what I think will be somewhat good articles, at least in comparison to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ship_commissionings_in_1964.html" title="List of ship commissionings in 1964">List of ship commissionings in 1964</a>. Whismur hasn't been revamped and rewritten yet, but I may plan to some time in the future. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_fc38.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator">Erik Jensen</a> <b><sup>(<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErik_the_Appreciator_50c0.html" title="User talk:Erik the Appreciator">Appreciate</a>|<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_the_Appreciator_Keepers_dd6d.html" title="User:Erik the Appreciator/Keepers">Donate</a>)</sup></b> 21:44, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This is rediculous. It's not non-notable at all. Why not delete all 493 Pokemon articles while you're at it? <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinach_Dip_4b8e.html" title="User:Spinach Dip">Spinach Dip</a> 01:43, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

The positive view of the Pokémon argument, which holds that the articles on truly trivial Pokémon turned out to be reasonable articles that fulfill all of Wikipedia's official content policies, and therefore are keepers, like poor Whismur here.
