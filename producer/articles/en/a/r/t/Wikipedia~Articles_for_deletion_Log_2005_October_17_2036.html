<p>This issue should be part of the main air america article. The separate article is being used to maintain a POV fork. This account is a sockpuppet of the same individual of the 'Nagin Buses' POV fork. If the POV spin is eliminated from the article it would be short enough to fit in the main Air America article.</p>

<p>I still think that the same points could be made more forcefully and effectively in far fewer words. In wikipedia the point is not space, its the reader's attention.

<li>Could you elaborate? I notice that the previous thingie was set off by your accusation "Non-notable boring professor". Does boringness disqualify article subjects? (If so, then boringness <i>to me</i> would knock out everything about <i>Star Wars</i>, just for starters, though I accept that this is limitlessly fascinating for many.) Or is boringness only damning when coupled with non-notability as a professor? What would make a professor notable, anyway?

<li>I gave that argument a read, and I think its very interesting. I was almost convinced. But I thought about what it takes to get an article written about oneself. Media outlets are likely to write articles about authors who are interesting to the general public, not academics. So, people who are quacks, but loud about it are more likely to have articles writen about them than people who are importantly contributing to true scientifc advancement. On the other hand, regular living contributors to science don't often have articles written about them, just about their work. I like the ease of application of Encephalon's critera, but I'm afraid I wouldn't be happy with the outcome.

<li><b>Delete</b>, though it's close. The article is informative and well written. The problem is that it doesn't establish notability. Though some would disagree, I believe that a typical college professor is not notable enough to justify inclusion here. Are Mr. Wolter's publications of ongoing scholarly relevance? That is, have they been used as references in other works? Are they of general interest (Nearly all college professors publish books, but many are only purchased by their students and colleagues)? If Mr. Wolter is indeed a notable individual, the reason for his notability should be called out in the opening sentence. The present opening sentence states that he is a college professor. Tony Sidaway opines above that Wolter is an expert on the Copper Scroll. If so, the article should say that; it does not at present. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 06:15, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> First, by definition, almost all academics are specialists about something; it's in the job description. This fellow's publication record and teaching history do not make him stand out above the vast number of other professors who are toiling away at their specialties. If community consensus decides that we need to have bios of <i>every</i> professor who has published books in their chosen field of specialty, sobeit, but I am unaware of such a consensus. Second, looking at his publication record, I am at a loss to understand the appeal to his supposed authority. Wedge, Eerdmans, Paternoster Press? These are not academic publishers of any repute; they are specialty (one might venture fringe) theological publishers with significant ideo-theological bias. His <i>one</i> academic publisher, Sheffield Academic Press, barely makes it above the bar. A google search for a review of his works returns no peer review of any significance that I can find. But more importantly, <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>'s decision to ignore unanimous - unaninmous - consensus last time and cite WP:IAR as a justification looks a lot to me like a blatant and outrageous arrogation of authority. It is frankly arrogant summarily to undelete this and then do nothing more, by way of explanation, than declaim "hey this guy was on TV! he has to be notable! You got it wrong." What's the point of the entire AfD process if one admin can arbitrarily decide to reverse consensus - unanimous consensus no less - and then hide behind a ruleset based on a clear misinterpretation of the subject's authority. Not only should this be removed (again), I think that the admin has provided grounds for censure and should be stripped of any power to meddle in the AfD process. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 07:11, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">Ignore all rules</a> is certainly something that requires extreme arrogance, and can sometimes lead to censure. I've no problem with that. I think I did the right thing because this way we end up with a worthwhile article that would certainly have remained deleted (<i>see arrogance</i>). I also don't like the idea of using the word "consensus" to describe the five or six editors who typed "delete" without adequate explanation in the previous AfD. They obviously just voted "delete because I hadn't heard of the guy and I find professors boring". --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 09:42, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's important to note, that ignoring the rules wasn't needed to make a *new* substantially different article for the same professor; better explaining his signficance. If he's as important as you say, and there's ample sources to verify this, than it should be straightforward to write an original article on him (based on verifiable external sources, and not on old content). So, the question isn't whether the professor was worth ignoring the rules, but whether the time saved by re-using previously rejected content was worth it. Essentially, I am saying, on this matter, you should have stayed within the same limits, that a non-admin would have to stay within. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 10:12, 17 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not saying you're wrong here, but the argument that the article could be rewritten strikes me as somewhat <i>ad hoc</i>. As we can see, the article is believed by a substantial majority of those who have looked at it in this new vote to be a perfectly acceptable one. It follows that it doesn't even come close to being a candidate for deletion. Dottore So's suggestion below that thos e who voted delete in the previous debate may have done so because J√≥zef Tadeusz Milik doesn't have an article also strikes me as blatantly <i>ad hoc</i>. The problem here is not so much that AfD occasionally deletes articles that are obvious keeps, but that VFU flatly refuses to do anything about the matter. Hence my intervention. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 10:59, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>One reason we see things differently, is I'm not admin.

<li><b>Comment</b> - on the whole "average professor" - no, most professors do not have book(s) published; most focus on teaching and are employed by community colleges or small liberal arts schools. The "average" professor at a research university is by no means "average" - s/he has had to publish entensively to get tenured. As for appearing on NOVA - not a lot of university professors ever appear on national television, let alone something like NOVA. So, as long as the criterion for notability is someone who is more notable than the "average professor" (using the US definition of the term professor), this guy appears to clear that hurdle with ease. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 14:00, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Weak <b>Keep</b>; independent information on Mr. Wolters does seem difficult to come by, so the argument that he might fail a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> test is tempting. The article does contain its share of nonverifiable vanity-style fluff at this point as well. But, my opinion, it's still a keeper. I'll add my two cents on Tony's move: it fell well within proper behavior. These AFDs with no real discussion are always suspect: it's supposed to be a consensus-gathering discussion, not an up-or-down vote. When there's no discussion, it's a good thing to have an admin go look at the page in question and see if the article should be re-Afd'd. Although if I were he, I would have abstained from voting after doing so. No big deal though. ‚Äî<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 18:54, 17 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem is that it's more than just fluff/vanity taken from the prof. The critical text in the article <i>"...also done work on the Dead Sea Scrolls, in particular the Copper Scroll, which is a list of buried treasure (probably taken from the temple in Jerusalem in New Testament times)."</i> was lifted from the prof's <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/alwolters/" class="external text" title="http://www.freewebs.com/alwolters/" rel="nofollow">freewebs</a> page, wasn't put in quotation marks, and wasn't attributed to the professor. The tone of this AFD seems to be that the first-round AFD'ers didn't bother doing their research. In fact, the article's author didn't do their research, and the undeleter didn't do it. If this prof is worthy, then go and do the research, find the independent reliable sources, and make a genuine substantially different article. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 19:21, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not sure why this article is being considered for deletion. I stumbled across it recently and added the last point about the gamespot review. Searching google for the term shows a number of references to the phrase in the exact context as defined in the article.

<p>I originally added an {{expert}} tag to this article, in the hope that it could be improved. It is becoming more and more clear to me, however, that it's unlikely to ever be more than a collection of hard-to-verify entries, and the article's very nature makes it a fertile breeding ground for spam and POV. Further problems include the impossibility of keeping the page up-to-date, and the inherent difficulty of an informed, NPOV treatment of the subject. I believe Wikipedia would be better off without this blatant vehicle for advertisements. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshenai_68df.html" title="User talk:Ashenai">talk</a>) 11:44, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>3rk3tect, there are three different subsystems of units called "foot-pound-second" systems: the <i>absolute</i> foot-pound-second system, the <i>gravitational</i> foot-pound-second system, and the <i>engineering</i> foot-pound-second system. These are used in calculations, because they form "coherent" (or nearly so) systems of units. None of these systems include any "fingers" or "palms" or "cubits" or "roods" or "kennings" among their units. As a matter of fact, they don't even include any gallons of any type (Imperial, U.S. liquid, whatever), no yards or acres or ounces either--any of those units must first be converted into the particular fps system being used before using it, and often need to be converted out of that system at the end once the calculations are completed, to express the result in some units not contained within that system. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 14:01, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Furthermore, the term "foot-pound-second system of units" is indeed used, as some other commentator mentioned above. However, this terminology is normally applied only to specific coherent or nearly coherent subsystems of units, the first of which only came into use in 1879, systems which do not include any inches or ounces or miles (there exist other "inch-pound-second" systems of units too). These specific systems are often further identified as more specific subsystems, as they are in the <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound.html#Systems_of_units" title="Pound">table in the pound article</a>, as the "absolute foot-pound-second system" (uses poundals for force and pounds for mass), the "gravitational foot-pound-second system" (uses slugs for mass and pounds (pounds-force) for force, never used before the 20th century), and the "engineering foot-pound-second system" (uses neither poundals nor slugs; uses pounds for mass and pounds-force for force). <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 13:44, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If an encyclopic article on the foot-pound-second system should be limited to what someone finds in a quick google search, why does Wikipedia exist? Before you begin to talk about foot-pound-second systems in Newtonian terms it makes sense to look at what they were before they were combined into a system. Why not just add the content you feel is missing to articles called the "inch-pound-second" system, the "absolute foot-pound-second system", the "gravitational foot-pound-second system" and the "engineering foot-pound-second system" which as you describe them all appear to be different from the foot pound second system&#160;? <a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFederal_Street_5da6.html" title="User:Federal Street">Federal Street</a> 10:17, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Indeed, no author or publisher is given in the article, which like that of <i>The Interim</i> is long on plot details but contains no information on authorship or publication.</p>

<li>'<b>KEEP'</b> The article contains useful information about the movement. Some of the comments for deletion seem to be because of disagreement with the views of emergents. The jibe about "secret knowledge" may be perceived by some of us as a not-so-veiled reference to the ole gnostics. And "we" all know they were heretics, right? This is guilt by association. But the purpose of this discussion about deletion is not about whether they are heretics or not. (Yep, the emergents do have difficulty conveying what they are up to, but they are making the effort and do not claim, as far as I know, that they have any secret knowledge.) There was a critique about emergents being long on philosophy and wordiness. Whether they are or not is beside the point. Whether they are right or wrong is beside the point. What is to the point is that they are a small but growing movement within the CofC. They are around and that cannot be changed or deleted away.</li>

<p>First of all, anonymous votes do not count in a VfD. Second - there is a difference between "misunderstood" and "not understandable." Grace is explainable in human words, after all, Paul did it quite effectively. This movement, evidently, is not. I have no objection to a description of whatever this is being on the Wikipedia. There are lots of things on the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Christ_acd4.html" title="Church of Christ">Church of Christ</a> article with which I disagree. But I am not convinced that anyone can write the article. Look at this prose!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Church of Christ emergent sees present and future theology as creative pursuit and passionate inquiry, like the best art and the best science. Psychology, sociology, the new physics, history, comparative religion, and spirituality‚Äînot to mention postmodernism in general‚Äîall are calling for creative Christians to unfold new paradigms to use in new world explorations. The old systems are tired, used up, and worn out, but the thirst for God is as strong as ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WHA?!! It's the same as the <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emerging_Church_b930.html" title="Emerging Church">Emerging Church</a> page. Mountains and mountains of vague, crappy writing filled with buzzwords. Can anyone explain this movement in clear, human language? Or is it not understandable from the outside at all? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanlovejoy_4999.html" title="User:Danlovejoy">Danlovejoy</a> 22:49, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>There's plenty in this article that's not like the <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emerging_Church_b930.html" title="Emerging Church">Emerging Church</a> page also. Instrumental music/ a cappella, how the emergent churches of Christ are organized, how we see evangelism, and more--and all understandable. And all unique to the emergent Church of Christ.</li>
<li>Tell me what you can't understand in the paragraph you cited above? I understand it...it's clear! Do you need me to explain?</li>
<li>I really wonder what is going on here. When this page first went up I inquired as to why it was up for deletion. The nominator sent me a message and said "no sources." So I began the process of adding and said more would be added over time; now the reason has changed. Now I'm hearing, it's <i>crappy</i> and <i>can't be understood</i>.</li>

<dd>First of all, why is the page titled "Gathering Conversation/Movement" when it should be titled "Church of Christ Emergent" or "Emerging Churches of Christ?: I think the title here points to the essential ambiguity of the er... movement. Y'all can't even agree to call it a movement. It's a "conversation." Well, a conversation is informal, ephemeral, and almost always oral. We don't call bodies of like-minded people "conversations" in modern English, so you need to come up with a word that is instantly recognizable to everyone who is trying to understand what you're trying to say. The word, while imperfect, is "movement." But everyone seems so enamored with the word "conversation" that they insist on everyone else understanding that bizarre usage of the word rather than the word all the rest of us understand. Why? Perhaps because argot lends a feeling of exclusivity and belonging. I don't know.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To those of us on the outside, the paragraph I cited is simply gobbledygook. It is anything but clear. I find it hard to believe that anyone, in this day and age, could use the word "paradigm" and expect to be taken seriously. I'm surprised the author didn't manage to work in "outside the box," "dialoguing," or "vision casting."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The issue at hand here is whether the "Emerging Church of Christ" merits an article in the Wikipedia. Now, I'll bet if you called up the churches in the list and asked the person who answered the phone, "Are you an Emerging Church of Christ?" he/she would say "What?" Only one website of the churches listed in the article (Garnett in Tulsa) has any reference at all to the Emerging church. There's one blog entry by Wade Hodges and two references to the book "The Emerging Church."</dd>

<dd>If someone wants to write an article about the "Church of Christ Emergent" not "Gathering Conversation/Movement" that is clear and to-the-point, NPOV, and certainly not sickeningly laudatory like this article, far be it from me to stand in your way.</dd>

<dd>I didn‚Äôt want to misrepresent the point in time along the continuum of a movements evolution so I tried to be honest when I refered to this as a gathering conversation gaining momentum. That‚Äôs what it is--at this time. At some point it will become a movement; but not yet. This is the reality. Conversation always precedes a movement.</dd>

<dd>As for the churches I listed. If you telephoned each one and asked I know for certain two churches would say they were emergent. Of course, if the church sec or building and grounds people answered the phone they might be puzzled by your question. But if you asked them about <i>belong/before believe</i> or <i>evangelism</i> or the other sections I'm confident a light would switch on; and each one listed would resonate. Remember, the restoration was the product of churches discovering each other and their similar beliefs and practices; a movement.</dd>

<dd>You're correct--we have our own language. A re-lexiconing project is not out of question. Why not be open to reviewing how our <i>Christianese</i> may or may not be communicating? If we are willing to to translate so native tribes can understand, why be reluctant to do good missionolgy here (in America) so we can really take the message to the streets?</dd>

<dd>This has really become more than I have the energy and time for. I‚Äôm busy and can‚Äôt dedicate the time to what I think you're asking (although I have to honestly say I was never clear, and I read the messages on this page closely.). I just wish we had bantered before I posted the article and had understood <i>exactly</i> what you expected. I believe the ECofC should have, if nothing else, a small parcel of Wiki space.

<li><b>Delete</b> if it can't be rewritten. I had originally suggested the separate page to avoid an unwarranted lengthy section in the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Churches_of_Christ_04ac.html" title="Churches of Christ">Churches of Christ</a> main page, since it would seem the movement is very small in size right now. A rewrite focussing on the basics would be my preferred way of handling this: who are these churches, what do they believe that makes them distinct from the other subgroups, what's the history of the movement, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you leave the link to <i>emergent church of Christ</i> on the main page and I'll rewrite it, to your liking, in the next week or two? <a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENucmanchh_f8be.html" title="User:Nucmanchh">fred</a> 01:30, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wasn't planning on removing anything, at least not until the RfD is dealt with (obviously, if it's deleted, the link would have to go).

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think the definition needs to be narrowed. Gimmick porn should be porn that uses clich√©d scenes like pizza delivery as an easy way to segue into a sex scene while still having some story. A similar one is the type with sex in certain situations that many viewers fantasize about, like school and the office. Just showing faces would be more like a filming style. Also, reality porn and rape porn should be in a separate category. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:55, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It still reads like a long dissertation and not an encyclopedia article. The references are not so much references as just more reading on something that I just read too much about. An encyclopedia article on a topic should introduce it in a concise fashion. Here is an example of what it should not be: <i>An indefinabilist about truth subscribes to the correspondence view- that truth is agreement with reality- but resists drawing the conclusion that this succeeds in proffering a definition or explanatory reduction of the concept.</i> If it is a valid and touted theory of knowledge, perhaps it could be placed into <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistemology.html" title="Epistemology">epistemology</a>? As it stands it is entirely too cumbersome for this encyclopedia.‚Äî<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff"><font color="Indigo">Gaff</font></a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff"><font color="firebrick">œÑŒ±ŒªŒ∫</font></a></b></small> 02:58, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</sup></li>

<p>Alright! Delete the page. Will have to wait until this view becomes received wisdom before it is acceptable to articulate this very serious contender for what a theory of truth looks like. Accepted that the article does not fit into "encyclopedic" style at the moment; instead of revision I shall first advertise it globally, letting it (deservedly) receive a wider audience than it so far has. Best wishes, Arhat Virdi</p>

<li>Indefinabilitists look like a sub-variety of Correspondence Theory to me, especially if you're taking Davidson as a primary example. They fit the definition on the Correspondence theory page that "The correspondence theory of truth states that something is rendered true by the existence of a fact with corresponding elements and a similar structure. A rejection of any sort of relativism about truth, this theory maintains that the truth or falsity of a statement is determined only by how it relates to the world, and whether it accurately describes (i.e., corresponds with) that world." which says nothing about whether or not such a correspondence constitutes a definition of truth. Why not add a short mention of indefinabilists as a sub-variety of correspondence theory on the correspondence theory page? You could add Alston's Minimalist theory of truth too if you wanted. 139.102.45.119 17:16, 20 October 2005 (UTC)Brian M. 12:10, 20 oct, 2005</li>
<li>Indefinabilists are certainly not a subset of correspondencists about truth. Someone holding that to say of a statement that it is true means that the objects and relations expressed by that statement correspond or fit-in with the world is painting a distinctly non-indefinabilist picture. Correspondence theorists argue that their theory points to truth's being a "seriously dyadic" relation, with truth-bearers (sentences, or the proposition expressed by them) and truth-makers (facts lying in the extra-lingual realm) being distinct entities. An indefinabilist says something quite different; that there is a conceptual equivalence between saying "p is true" and saying "p corresponds to the world" and that this being so is not an insubstantial claim i.e., truth is an informative notion, not redundant or dispensable one as the minimalists or disquotationalists or any other variety of deflationism would have truth be. This answers also why minimalism's only bedfellows ought to be other deflationists (by the way, Paul Horwich is the provenience, and only current defender, of minimalism- not Alston, who is a dyed-in-the-wool realist about truth. See Alston's "A Realist Conception of Truth" 1996, Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY). Arhat Virdi</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Seems to be non-notable and original research.

<li>Right, like articles about particle physics are unlikely to offer value to the encyclopdia unless some physicist somewhere wants to research particle physics. Wikipedia's written for a general audience, and there's lots you can do with an encyclopedia other than academic research.

<li>The article itself claims that essentially anyone can create any newsgroup. Given that, having newsgroups named after you isn't a high bar to clear. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowersofnight_dd24.html" title="User:Flowersofnight">flowersofnight</a> 13:25, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, having an alt.name newsgroup is really not a big deal, unless it gets a lot of traffic and actually perpetuates. alt.religion.kibology is a functioning 'religion', alt.fan.andrea.chen is not (even though andrea chen is one of the most inventive constructs in usenet history). But there are literally hundreds of vanity newsgroups that are created and have no traffic. There isn't a significant number of posters perpetuating any of the joel.furr newsgroups, so I don't think they should count. Please look at the list of usenetters in wp and tell me why joel furr should be included. Jorn Barger coined the term 'blog'. Kibo is a verb in the OED. Serdar Argric is known to almost anyone who read usenet at all, ever. There were true architects of usenet, people who ran servers and made decisions for the good of usenet as a whole, not just as a joke here and there, who are not listed. Those guys should totally have wp entries before joel furr does. He never made any lasting admin-level decisions about alt.group propigation, his vanity newsgroups are empty and he was never written up in the print media. Do you guys happen to know him personally or something? <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 4.252.249.219 (<a href="../../../4/2E/2/User_talk%7E4.252.249.219.html" title="User talk:4.252.249.219">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.252.249.219_092c.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.252.249.219">contribs</a>) 14:18, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</small>

<li>"These other people should have articles" is a peculiar reason to delete an existing article. The order in which articles are created is not a statement of notability!

<li>There are print sources that cite Furr (now referenced in the article). The other standards for notability are much too high: how many founders of enduring religions are there in total? how many of them hung out on Usenet? how many people have words named after them that made it into the OED? Also, the whole argument (I'm paraphrasing) along the lines "X cannot have a Wikipedia article unless Y and Z do first" does not make sense: the lack of articles about anyone you may consider more important than Mr. Furr does not necessarily reflect an editorial decision. If there is a shortage of articles, it's most likely due to the fact that nobody has written them yet. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a><big><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">‚úç</a></big> 17:58, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>You're right, the argument that 'X cannot have a WP article unless Y and Z do first' is totally no good. What I meant to get across is that those other guys played a much, much bigger role then Furr did and this article is misleading about how big of a role Furr played in those decisions/policy/propagation protocols.</li>
<li>The standards for notability are not too high, I don't think. If you've been written about in the print media, you might be worth an entry. If you haven't, then you almost certainly are not notable enough to warrant an entry. Is that incorrect?</li>
<li>Ok, I think with the inclusion of the citations we'er finally starting to get somewhere and have some real concrete way to evaluate this guy's notability. Kudos to whoever provided them. But these cites aren't enough in my mind to demonstrate notability. Furr is not widely credited with coining the phrase 'spam'; one of his buddies (who happens to be in charge of the EFF) "thinks he remembers" that Furr was "one of the first ones". This is hearsay. Furr was a source for one article in the Nation -- not by any means the subject of that article (like Kibo and Argic were). And then there are two FAQs, one written by Furr himself and the other written by a fellow usenetter. These cites and the friendly tone of the "keep" votes here add up to a subjective, sort of buddy-buddy cartel among old usenetters to keep Furr listed.</li>

Gaia almost certainly has as many or more members than Usenet did during Mr. Furr's long-past heyday, and I'm sure the case could be made that the most prominent Gaia personalities are "a very notable part of 2000s Internet history". My point is: just being there at a certain time and making the occasional funny joke does not qualify you to be the subject of an encyclopedia article. Despite the additions to this article, no claims have been made for Mr. Furr's notability besides that he was a funny guy and Usenet moderator. Good for him; I'm sure he's a fine man.

While Usenet is sadly not what it once was (I fondly recall the days before the Web.) it was at one time the second most important thing on the internet after e-mail, and it still is quite useful.

<li>I'm most emphatically <i>not</i> an expert on the field photography, but if she's won numerous awards and been named among the ten most influential female photographers in the history of photography by American Photo Magazine, that sounds like she's notable enough.

<li>Mr. Beyer is quite a celebrity here in Montclair; his masterful film works are considered sacred by many townsfolk. I happen to have met the man in the flesh, and have had the pleasure of taking part in a few of his earlier films, such as "Henry Clay- Caught On Tape!" and "The Beast". As a routine contributor to Wikipedia (I've "edited" the George W. Bush page many a time) I feel that my statement here should nt be taken lightly. -Mattie I <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.197.3.77 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.197.3.77.html" title="User talk:68.197.3.77">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.197.3.77_1ea9.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.197.3.77">contribs</a>) 22:02, 5 October 2005 (UTC).</small></li>
<li>The Kurt Beyer Films website used to be much larger, and receive many hits, but has recently been changed due to a hiatus from filming.

<li>Besides being one of the great minds in Montclair, NJ...Mr. Beyer, ironically, has a great fashion sense. he taught me to pop my collar, and since then, the girls can't take their hands off me.

<p><s><b>Delete</b></s> this as it is an unmaintainable list. All the three-letter code links are invalid links. This list is so big, that it can't be fixed, and it gives no useful information. Surely, people should check out the appropriate official site to get the meaning of a code. This sadly has a lot of back-links, but from checking, they are another reason to get rid of this.

<li><b>Keep</b>: all information is verifiable, and useful. There should be no reason why this list cannot eventually be completed. Also, please provide some reason as to why <i>Three-letter abbreviation disambig pages shouldn't list station codes along with common meanings of the abbreviation</i>: if I wanted to find out what the three-letter code was on a luggage label, I would want to search on the code, not have to deduce which list to look it up in. ‚Äî<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Boswell_c574.html" title="User:Phil Boswell">Phil</a> | <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhil_Boswell_f2d3.html" title="User talk:Phil Boswell">Talk</a> 10:19, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>This list is too large to ever be updated/verified properly. Nobody is going to spend hours reviewing every entry, so that one or two stations can be added or removed as needed. It's filled with masses of errors, nobody has bothered to fix, for instance, it links to the "train code" of <a href="../../../o/a/c/OAC_ebac.html" title="OAC">OAC</a> which re-directs to <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Academic_Credit_362e.html" title="Ontario Academic Credit">Ontario Academic Credit</a>. Of course what it doesn't link to is actual train station articles. I object to these codes being on disambig pages, since it makes it harder to find other information. If we put Amtrack codes on disambig pages, we have to list other train station codes, part codes, and all sorts of codes. The disambig pages are to help people find wikipedia articles, and nothing else. We have to be wary of piece-by-piece additions to disambig pages, which can add up over time. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 11:10, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>But don't most of those lists actually point to relevant articles, or give red-links for articles that should be made? Notice, I AFD'd this list, but not <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Amtrak_stations_3f62.html" title="List of Amtrak stations">List of Amtrak stations</a>, which lets people look up a code, and also gives them a related articles. Alpha-sort is needed for full names, but not for 3-letter codes, as a) people don't know the codes usually, b) if they know the codes they can search for it with the browsers "find in page" feature. This list has a substantial number of erroneous blue links (roughly 50% of all links), pointless red-links (e.g. combinations of two city names), and has no useful links (e.g. no stations), and fixing this would probably require remaking it from scratch. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 00:46, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think this list makes sense when we have lists of airports by IATA code, such as <a href="../../../n/_/_/List_of_airports%7E_N_450e.html" title="List of airports: N">List of airports: N</a>. Of course, the airport list is more useful since people more often refer to the TLA when talking about airports than for stations, but still, various ways of ordering stations is OK with me.

<li>My guidelines are these: There should be entries for urban infrastructure, such as airports, train stations and bus interchanges. The <i>List of airports</i> is fine, as is the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Amtrak_stations_3f62.html" title="List of Amtrak stations">List of Amtrak stations</a>, even though maintenance is a problem. The <i>List of Amtrak station codes</i> that we are discussing here is a duplicate of the <i>List of Amtrak stations</i> and also a copy of original data from the Amtrak website. That is why I think it ought to go. Others may argue different, of course. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 13:03, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. Numerically, I have 19d-10k, which is fractionally below the two-thirds level, and I don't think any of the editors need discounting. Nevertheless, I'm inclined to give more weight to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> than to "oh but we have other articles [that are just as bad/good]". Driving everything down to the lowest level of quality is not the way to conduct an AfD debate. We should seek to haul standards up, not search for the weakest article and drive standards down towards to it. Anyway, that's too personal a reason to bend the threshold here, so I'll call a very close no consensus. If this is renominated in future, I do not think this AfD serves as a "keep because was kept before" argument. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:19, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with those above me. If we have lists for films, books, etc., there's no reason why we shouldn't have a list of websites. Keep in mind that this is not a list of every web site out there. It is a list of those that have Wikipedia articles already, which is much smaller and more maintainable. --<a href="../../../c/s/w/User%7ECswrye_d0de.html" title="User:Cswrye">Cswrye</a> 17:33, 18 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm going to make one more attempt to justify why this page should be kept. While I do think that categories are great, they are not always a substitute for a listing page. For an example, I will point out the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_dances.html" title="List of dances">list of dances</a>. This page simply lists each dance under certain headings with a short description of each one. If I want to see a list of dances, I can simply go to this page. This cannot be done in the category system. Because of the many subcategories that exist and branch off mulitiple times, I would have to go through many different pages to really see a list of all of the dances. Seeing them all at once is much more convenient. Furthermore, it is nice to be able to see a short description of a topic before going to the page. Wikipedia can be slow sometimes, and traveling from topic to topic can be annoying. A list would prevent that. Finally, I don't think that spam would be a major problem. This list is already quite extensive, and I haven't seen any spam on it yet. Even if there were, many pages get spammed routinely, and they have all been handled pretty well. I don't think that spam is a satisfactory argument against this until it makes the page virtually unusable. I know that I have found this list to be quite helpful, and I would be disappointed to see it go. --<a href="../../../c/s/w/User%7ECswrye_d0de.html" title="User:Cswrye">Cswrye</a> 17:57, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>By the way, although I do think that this page should be kept, I agree that a category should be created either way. --<a href="../../../c/s/w/User%7ECswrye_d0de.html" title="User:Cswrye">Cswrye</a> 23:50, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete and create category</b>. Although the abovementioned lists are good for wikipedia, I just have a bad feeling that this list is going to become <i>very</i> unmaintainable, <i>very</i> quickly. As soon as the more unscrupulous members of the Wikipedia community find this list, every man and his dog will be putting up personal websites, spamming links, etc, and it is going to be the mother of all headaches to keep under control. Also, every website on this list will also have a category on it, and when the non-notable websites are deleted, the redlink will remain, making it easier for someone else to come along and do the same. At least with a category, once an article is deleted, the link int the category will likewise vanish. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 00:32, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: lists and categories are complementary. Categories are self-maintaining, updating when articles are added to or removed from them; they are incapable of displaying more than a list of article titles. Lists must be maintained manually; however as described above, they are capable of displaying explanatory text next to each entry, and are amenable to more flexible styles of display. Lists are not confined to simply sorting entries alphanumerically: entries can be grouped according to appropriate subject areas.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with those above me. I think many people have got confused about the purpose of the page. Its not about listing down all the websites, but listing only those for which there is dedicated Wiki page entry. Also, if we have lists for films, books, etc., there's no reason why we shouldn't have a list of websites. Again, keep in mind that this is not a list of every web site out there. It is a list of those that have Wikipedia articles already, which is much smaller and more maintainable. -- <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolninad_a244.html" title="User:Coolninad">Ninad</a> 15:13, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

It is way to big to maintain, and really doesn't deserve this much stuff--very few of those things have actually reached true fad level. I liked it better when there was a small list on the main YTMND article page, rather than this sprawling bohemouth of disorganized fads. It <i>is</i> true that these sites have reached a certain level of notablity (see ytmndtakesovergoogle.ytmnd.com/), but few of those mentioned are actual fads. I like the text at the top of this page, and feel it should be incorperated into the main article, as with a few of the actual big fads, and a small mention about things such as the Tiger merging fads.

<li>WikiBestofYTMND sounds great to me. I just don't see how this stuff is encyclopedic. But then again, I am not super savvy on internet culture. I read somewhere about wikipedia wanting to focus on what will be important 100 yrs from now. This stuff seems like the filler that the internet is <i>already</i> overflowing with. I'm not saying that some of it isn't funny, but it seems to me that wikipedia has an opportunity to be a powerful voice in the internet community and to raise things to a higher standard. <i>Maybe</i> this could be in BJAODN. However, the sheer size of the thing and that fact many of these are funny jokes of the moment that some kid in Peoria who knows something about Flash programming put together to impress his friends suggests that they are flashes in the pan.

<li>To reellaborate, the internet is a vast collection of assorted tomfoolery that will not die because a bunch of soccor moms disapprove of what YTMNDs; fads offer. Schivacos' death HAS been a source of moraleless humour on sites beyond YTMND, so they are no special case. YTMNDs' "fads" are self contained within thier own community, however, their community has been gradually expanding into mainstream noteriaty, one may even suggest that YTMND ITSELF is an Internet fad, not quite outperforming other contraversial sites such as say, a Newgrounds, but it may very soon eclipse it. And indeed, some of the sicker humour involved (be it about Schiavo) is just further proof that not everyone on the internet looks at the community as one that needs moral direction. If people are trying to delete something that dares to find humour in tragedy, you wither need to live a little, take a joke, or start hunting down and delete every parody site in the past, the present, the future. Take a damn joke. I'll be saving this information to put straight back up if it IS deleted, YTMNDs' fads have a place here, and its' survived deletion before, if a merge is what is required to sustain its' lifespan, so be it, but its' not a question of "should we keep it", its' a matter of "when we keep it" RKZ <b>KEEP</b></li>

<dd>Yeah, there's no denying it's great stuff, but the question is whether or not it's encyclopedic. At the very least it needs to be cleaned up, but the inborn nature of the article means that it's prone to every shmoe who's created a site to add theirs in. Stuff like Schiavo and "What is Love", the various stapler parodies, Bannana Phone, Yakkety Sax, and the numerous others are worth noting to YTMND lovers, but the question is; are these really notable to people who don't know about the site? Are you honestly saying that people who have no idea about YTMND would want to read such a huge page? If nothing else, it needs to be condensed, and I love the idea of transwiking it to another project (Mediawiki or otherwise). -[[<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysekurity_5643.html" title="User:Mysekurity">User:Mys</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysekurity_5643.html" title="User:Mysekurity">kurity</a>|<a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysekurity_22b6.html" title="User talk:Mysekurity">Mysekurity</a>]] <sup>[[<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mysekurity_f119.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mysekurity">additions</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mysekurity_b472.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mysekurity">e-mail</a>]]</sup> <sub>03:44, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</sub></dd>

<p><b>KEEP</b> this page, it serves as a handy, up to date reference for the many fads that we come across on the web. In my opinion Wikipedia is excellent for this sort of thing; regularly updated lists of things that may confuse people, yet are ultimately harmless. If you don't like this page, don't visit it.

<li><b>Transwiki</b>. There has been a lot of effort for this that does not justify for it to be just deleted.

<li><b>speedy keep</b>. Thank you for doing merging; this is a thankless task that we are way behind on. After merging, we almost always keep the redirect, since we need to keep around the history, and because the existence of duplicate articles strongly suggests the usefulness of such a redirect. So, this should certainly be kept.

<li><b>Keep and merge</b> ‚Äî I think this request is bit odd. I believe that we should have an article called <i><a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhafazah.html" title="Muhafazah">Muhafazah</a></i>, but, if its content is the lacklustre list it is now, the content should be moved to <i><a href="../../../g/o/v/Governorate.html" title="Governorate">Governorate</a></i> and the first page redirect to it. The proper procedure for this. I believe, is cut and paste, rather than page deletion. One problem, different countries have different official translations of <i>muhafazah</i>: they might not be officially called <i>govenorates</i> in all places. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 17:17, 18 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the word has several meanings, then it can well be a disambiguation page. I tried the copy &amp; paste bit, and I got shouted at for it, hence my nomination here. ‚Äì <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimwi_eb8f.html" title="User:Timwi">Timwi</a> 00:13, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>who shouted where? If you refer to your admin-rights misuse in deleting <a href="../../../a/r/a/Template%7EArab_subdivision_9b46.html" title="Template:Arab subdivision">Template:Arab subdivision</a> without prior notice to anyone nor without tagging it, than I think you mix something. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Conradi_1f4c.html" title="User talk:Tobias Conradi">(Talk)</a> 21:21, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as <a href="../../../g/u/b/Guberniya.html" title="Guberniya">guberniya</a> was kept. Of course extend. Problem with subdivision translations into english is that they are different from country to country. the four articles wilayah, mintaqah, imarah and muhafah give a short overview about these arab words. This would be lost if merged with provinces, regions, states etc. And because the translations are different from country to country this would bring some wilayah to one article some others to another. Interwiki links will not work. At the end: the terms are official, for some we may never find an official translation. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Conradi_1f4c.html" title="User talk:Tobias Conradi">(Talk)</a> 19:46, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> Delete would mean no redirect? If not, than why is it not a simple "merge" process? Timwi himself said he is pro merge. Why does he put it on VfD? <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobias_Conradi_1bd2.html" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Conradi_1f4c.html" title="User talk:Tobias Conradi">(Talk)</a> 21:15, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>This, and the other pages it links to, appear to be advertising. Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">is not</a> an advertising vehicle or a web directory. If this company is notable enough for an article, I suggest <b>deleting</b> the linked per-site pages, and consolidating all mention of them into a single non-advert article. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 19:56, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> significant non-profit resource. But could do with history etc, and Mormon connection, e.g. Mormons do family research a lot partly because of their belief in sealing dead relatives, and baptising them. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 21:10, 17 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There <i>is</i> no Mormon connection. The company isn't even owned by Mormons (or, at least all of the owners aren't Mormons), and the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_ff27.html" title="Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> has 0% stake in the company. Even if there are Mormons who are shareholders in the company, that doesn't make the company have a "Mormon connection." Given the number of subscribers they have (over 850,000 on Ancestry.com alone, according to one article I read) chances are there are many more non-Mormon subscribers than Mormon subscribers, especially since you can use Ancestry.com for free at any of the Mormon family history centers around the world. If people want to learn about Mormons, they can go to the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon.html" title="Mormon">Mormon</a> page and read up, but there doesn't need to be a link on this page. I'm not sure what you mean by "non-profit resource," though. There's nothing in the article that says anything about being non-profit. --<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">nihon</a> 02:31, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, I don't know any history of the company since they have nothing on their site. Perhaps you could add that. --<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">nihon</a> 03:30, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The page has been significantly expanded now. All of the per-site pages have been combined into one and the old pages are now redirect pages pointing to the main page. Since your whole objection to the page is moot now, The Anome, I suggest removing the afd from the page. Since there is no "Mormon connection," as MacRusgail implies, I don't see that as any reason to keep the page marked as afd, for the reasons stated above. --<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">nihon</a> 06:47, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Not so fast. I say <b>Delete</b> This is advertising dressed up as a pseudo-encyclopedic entry. Note the Controversy discussion: <i>As with many large commercial websites, there are some individuals who dislike the policies and business practices of MyFamily.com and its subsidiaries. There are some sites that catalog these stories, though it should be noted that MyFamily.com rarely posts anything in defense of its policies on the following websites. As such, the information found on these sites may be skewed to only one point of view, and may not contain all of the facts in any give case.</i> Also, including technical support numbers is also highly suspect. This is: POV, advertising, and using WP to give these sites objective credibility. If the content changes to reflect a more critical evaluation of the services and site (e.g. the Mormon connexion, or lack thereof), I will change my vote since it is a notable site. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 09:58, 18 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is a collaborative site, so I shouldn't be the only one working on the article. It would be useful if some of you would actually change the article rather than taking the easy route of bashing it and doing nothing about any of the "problems" you mention. I find it absurd that one person is doing all the work on this article, and that it can be so arbitrarily marked for deletion rather than one or more of you actually putting forth a little effort to make it fit your views of neutrality. The Ancestry.com article was around long before I had anything to do with it, and I modified it because it was very negative. So now that it's basically neutral, you're blasting it because of that? Also, please name me even one large company that doesn't have it's own cadre of disgruntled customers. If you think it should be rewritten some other way, please do so. I just wanted to make sure people were aware of the "anti-Ancestry" sites. Feel free to add some critical evalutation yourself as I don't use many of their services. --<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">nihon</a> 15:29, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Any other comments regarding this article? It has been modified quite a bit since <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> originally marked it afd. I've tried to make it an objective article to better fit in with the rest of Wikipedia. If no one else has any objections, I suggest the article be <b>Kept</b>. As <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> indicated, it <i>is</i> a notable site (or collection of sites, anyway). --<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">nihon</a> 21:58, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

There have been no comments made regarding these changes for the last four days (other than me asking if there's still any reason why the page should be deleted). Therefore, I'm proposing that we <b>KEEP</b> the page. I will wait until Monday morning UTC -7. If there are no further objections at that point, I'll go ahead and remove the afd on the main page and consider this matter closed due to lack of any further comments to the contrary. ---<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">nihon</a> 01:22, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Comment/Question: Can (or has) an admin deal/dealt with the causer(s) of this. It seems User:24.11.71.38 and User:HipHopHead88 are one and the same. What's worrying, is the original edits by User:HipHopHead88 were well done (fully wikified article, back links, images uploaded), showing somebody who's been around wikipedia for a bit. It's getting difficult to undo changes to related articles, since they look "plausable" to other users, who make subsequent valid changes, after the fake ones. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 05:19, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please tell me why this needs to be deleted. NauFal WaFFle is an established young producer with ties to huge producers such as Dr. Dre &amp; Scott Storch. In one year, he may be one of the top three producers out. Wikipedia has articles on fifteen year old chess masters, what is wrong with a fifteen year old producer who has much more critical acclaim and celebrity potential?

<li>Comment: I removed the images from the articles and put them on IFD. Two of them appear to be an unauthorized copy of real album covers which were altered to put this person's name on them.

<p>I created this article as a relative newbie.

<ul>
<li>Nonsense. It's a CSD criteria in black and white (A7), and, in practice, it's the reason Wikipedia doesn't have articles about every failed political candidate, every road intersection, every day, every toy, every model of computer, every issue of long-running magazines, etc. There are lots of verifiable, factual things that just aren't encyclopedic material. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 04:56, 18 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Nonsense, indeed</i>. CSD (A7) states "An article about a <i><b>real person</b></i> that does not..." This is not a real person; CSD (A7) does not apply. I participated in the debate to expand CSD, and A7 was <i>deliberately limited</i> to real persons only. If you're going to cite deletion policy, please take care to cite it properly, especially considering that you are an admin and are expected to apply it properly as well. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 06:48, 18 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I omitted "in" accidentally; my point was not that CSD A7 applies to this example, but that the logic behind CSD A7 reflects general consensus for (non-speedy) deletion, and that that logic applies in a (again, non-speedy) way to the vast majority of topics. (I suppose I deserve the chiding, for the original wording, but I'm mostly a tag-and-bag kind of RC patroller unless it's obvious gibberish.) Non-notable websites are deleted for the same reason (if not by the same method) that non-notable people are; there are many, many websites, most of which have no impact beyond the creator and a handful of people mostly known to the creator. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 08:12, 18 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you want to state that "non-notable" has consensus in general practice for things other than real people, and that you agree, please do so. It's a valid and common opinion. Connecting it to an official policy that doesn't apply, especially where such consensus for such connection was <i>deliberately rejected</i>, is something that I hope you will not continue to do. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 16:08, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per above. Per <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollderella_9ec1.html" title="User:Trollderella">Trollderella</a>'s assertion that notability is not grounds for deletion, it is just not worth taking up the argument. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollderella_9ec1.html" title="User:Trollderella">Trollderella</a>, for whatever reason, seems sincerely to believe that as long as something is factual and verifiable, it should not be deleted.

<ul>
<li>Official policy, as opposed to guidelines and common practice, supports Trollderella's assertion in all cases except regarding real persons. Whether right or wrong, "non-notable" simply is not a deletion criteria supported by official policy. Surely we shouldn't criticize someone for supporting the official policy of Wikipedia, even if we don't agree. Further, we shouldn't discount the opinion of someone who is in line with the letter of official policy just because they don't want to discuss the validity of that policy in every AfD. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 16:08, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Variation is the basis for evolution; wikipedia is about open-source information free to all - even if it is not in accordance with the letter of wikipedia law it is in tune with the spirit of wikipedia; do not delete this article <small>(preceding comment by user:194.82.51.28)&lt;/small)</small></p>
<dl>
<dd><small>you miss the point. Kozakti-ball doesn't belong in here, because it was just a made-up game played by a couple a dozen friends over the course of a few years. Steph-ball is a similar made up game that has no place in wikipedia. it's probable that thousands of different similar games with variations have existed briefly then stopped. If Steph-ball was the common name of all these variations worldwide, it would be encyclopaedic. It isn't. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 23:42, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></small></dd>

<li><b>Weakest Keep</b> in that F1 (and Indy 500) are definitely the "major leagues" of motor sports.

<li>Actually that is not true, he had quite a history on the dirt-track circuits back in the 1950's. At the time they were almost as popular if not much more so than the big races.

<li><b>Keep</b> Having grown up in Indy, I have to say just getting a ride at Indy is a feat in itself. The competition is fierce. He had to have some kind of history in racing to get in. This particular bio is probably weak because it's just a stub. Incidentally during the 50's The 500 counted in the world cup standings, but was dropped in the early 60's.
