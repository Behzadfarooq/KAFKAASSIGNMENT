<dd><b>Response:</b> You are right that this article does need better referencing, however as the person who pretty much put this whole thing together, I can tell you that I used not only clear markers in the texts themselves, but many secondary sources such as Keith Topping's unofficial guides which place books in the timeline, and the Buffy/Angel episodes in relation to each other, a Dark Horse Comic timeline that was at the Dark Horse site, 'Historian notes' at the begining of many stories, as well as comments in interviews by authors and script-writers about how stories relate to each other. Putting together this article was a <i>lot</i> of work, and I'd really appreciate if people allowed it time to reference itself rather than deleting because they assume its based on original research because of the current lack of clear referencing. -- <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 16:59, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Allow me to address the reasons for deletion presented so far.
<ol>
<li><i>Completely fan-written.</i> One of the worst reasons I could imagine, even worse than <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a>. Why does it matter who wrote it? The article should be judged on its merits. In fact, why would something about a fictional work/universe be written by people who don't like/care about the work/story?</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a></i> is an essay and not a reason for deletion. To me, issues related to quantum physics are quite crufty (as I've got little understanding of what it's about). What's cruft for one person is completely normal for another.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">Unsourced original research</a>.</i> Please note that this is a chronology and <i>all</i> of the entries are blue-links, so the sources are likely <i>located in</i> those articles.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>.</i> This does not qualify for any of the 8 things listed at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>. It's not so much a "plot summary" rather than an aid to navigation for articles related to the <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse.html" title="Buffyverse">Buffyverse</a>.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#WEBSPACE" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#WEBSPACE</a>.</i> This guideline includes "Personal web pages", "File storage areas", and "Dating services". This is obviously none of the three.</li>
<li>Finally, these articles meet <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> as aiding navigation (given how <i>extremely</i> well-organized they are) and being highly informative (i.e., it's not just a list of internal links).

<li>Could you please clarify? "Original research" means that the information is inherently <i>unverifiable</i> (not just unverified).

<li>Just to comment a second, the practical difference between this index article and an article indexing just the Buffy-related books is that this article is attempting to organize information related to the Buffy franchise across all media types (books, television, comics, films, etc). It seems to me to be a fairly useful sounding means of organizing the large amount of information available on the franchise, and places all these varied articles in some sort of chronological perspective for the reader. Personally I think this sort of indexing also sounds like a possibly useful idea for similar cross-media franchises, such as Star Wars or Star Trek, etc. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:00, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree, Pax. The argument that "policy might not actually say this violates anything, but in my opinion it should" doesn't hold water. Either it breaks the policy <i>as written</i> or it doesn't. There's a good reason the words "cruft" and "trivia" don't appear in WP:NOT, and that's because there is not strong consensus on how or when to delete articles based on those criteria or even how to properly define those terms. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:54, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Black Falcon's reasoning. Can always been cleaned up, etc. but AFD is not a place to judge content. The claim that it's not sourced doesn't make sense because every entry includes the title of the book or other work from which the information is taken, and most of these works have their own Wikipedia articles from which (in theory) info such as ISBN and publisher can be obtained rather than doubling the size of the chronology articles with bibliographies. I do have a concern regarding the images which, under Wiki's increasingly draconian free use rules probably aren't kosher anymore.

However there is actually <b>no original research in this article.

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> The nominated articles serve as source material for a navigational tool for Buffy-related articles; I think the <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> policy would successfully argue against its removal, as right now Wikipedia is served by hundreds of articles on Whedon's universe that are currently quite easy to navigate. <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> is a <i>very</i> dicey rule, but it can support this as well: ignore rules <i>when doing so improves Wikipedia.</i> Does <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> grant utter immunity to the chronology? Of course not. But it does support the suggestion that facile navigation between tightly related articles does indeed improve Wikipedia, and leaving a article navigation system in place long enough to grant editors enough time to properly reference the article serves Wikipedia much better than ripping it out (presumably userfying it in the process), which would require the rebuilding of linkage and structure once a referenced version of the article was posted. Witness how Esperanza, instead of being deleted, took instruction from its MfD and came out of it a better organization. This can be done here. Lack of references is a problem that can be resolved by editors with an interest in Joss Whedon's writings providing references, and does not need to be resolved by removal of the material. To remove the material and disrupt the very nicely prepared navigation system already in place is disruption simply to serve a point, a practice strongly discouraged by <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.

The disruption to Wikipedia would be the resultant damage to the various navigational templates used in each and every Buffy/Angel/etc. article and the sheer manpower required to either eliminate the navigational templates altogether and/or re-repair them once a referenced version of the chronology is available; the point you would be trying to make is Wikipedia's policy of articles being referenced (I do not suggest malicious intent); the preferred method of discussion-based resolution would be withdrawal of the AfD (or failure of same) in order to allow Whedonverse editors enough time to properly reference the chronology. Moreover, allowing editors time to address problems in an article, instead of deleting it outright, (a) is a common practice in AfD, and (b) in no way contravenes core policies such as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. — <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhedonette_62db.html" title="User:Whedonette">Whedonette</a> <small>(<a href="../../../w/h/e/User_talk%7EWhedonette_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Whedonette">ping</a>)</small> 15:26, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep (might need some cleanup)</b> First of all, references to "cruft" can pretty much be ignored - there's no cruft in policies or guidelines. Second, this appears to be the equivalent of a list article for an episode index for a television series. The main difference I can see between this and an episode index is that this article covers multiple related products in the same franchise. Since episode lists for television series are permitted, I don't see a problem allowing for this sort of cross-product list as well since it probably would help interested readers more efficiently navigate the related articles. The main short-coming, which appears to be correctable, is that currently the references for the "in world" dates and other information are buried in the corresponding articles. However, since those references almost certainly exist, and can be appended to this article, I'm for keeping the article in place and allowing for its contributors to clean it up a little by providing some in-article sourcing and removing any statements that might not be verifiable. Note that the article does <i>not</i> appear to be an extended "plot summary", and does serve as a useful index for a larger multi-article topic, thus not violating the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> section on Plot Summaries or violating <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:50, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>99% of the sources on the BttF timeline article are the BttF films themselves.

<li><b>Delete</b>, a load of mostly original research about pop culture. Go put it on BuffyWiki. Wikipedia should confine itself to discussing the real-world importance of fiction, and not spend a great deal of effort on documenting the fictional universes found within pop culture; such content is far better suited for special purpose projects. With respect to Buffy, that means that perhaps a discussion on how the name "Xander" has pervaded popular culture is in order, but there is no encyclopedic purpose to a detailed chronology of the fictitious Buffyverse. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 05:08, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>A lack of sources is not proof of original research. Original research is something that we as editors have made up ourselves and requires that information is <i>inherently unverifiable</i>.

Despite that, a number of references are provided <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_episodes_594e.html#References" title="List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes">here</a>. Moreover, the information could be sourced using primary sources (e.g., "The WB Buffy promo, "History of the Slayer", states specific dates").
