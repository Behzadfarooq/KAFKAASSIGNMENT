<li><b>Delete</b>. Not sure if this AfD is necissary. The article has been redeleted, again as No Merge was done by anyone, Moink saw that the AfD was a delete consensus, and the VfU has no consensus thus far, so it has no reason to be undeleted. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">dwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) 02:26, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>The article has been undeleted. The solution to an unperformed merge is to perform the merge, not to delete. Moink uses a different definition of consensus than the one some other use--as he remarks himself: "I guess there is no consensus on consensus". --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:35, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually I reversed the second out-of-process deletion <i>prior</i> to the merge--it's hard to paste wiki from a deleted article. The merge was, I freely admit, performed largely to dissuade further delete warring while we (or rather you--I'm not going to vote) decide what to do about this article. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 03:55, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Article is on a an utterly non-notable, non-encyclopedic phenomenon. It should be deleted, but within process. Deleting this article the first time was out of process since that AFD debate had been closed with a reasonable "no consensus" judgment call. It was a fair call by Tony Sidaway to undelete, and bring this back to AFD. VFU is not yet the place to dispute "keep" results (it might be in the near future), and just deleting it so that it can go to VFU (where about 50% to not delete is required) instead of AFD (where about 33% to not delete is required) is not really right either. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:44, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would prefer to see this <b>merged</b> into the article on <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_83fd.html" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a> which it pertains to. While trolling is non-notable in itself, this sparked merchandise, and caused considerable controversy within the fandom (fancruft isn't a reason for deletion). I agree this doesn't warrant a seperate entry, though and wouldn't particularly be upset to see it go either. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:07, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. That applies to history merges. We are definitely NOT doing that though. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">R</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24"><font color="darkblue">dwolf24</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedwolf24_1e7b.html" title="User talk:Redwolf24">talk</a>) 02:19, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I think the argument is intended to make clear that the vote "<i>Merge and delete</i>" is indeed a valid one to make, Redwolf24. It is sometimes held that it is not valid because keeping author attribution is required by GFDL, whereas a page delete would seem to remove trace of it. However, this is not so. One can merge an article into another and still preserve author attribution in one of two ways: by performing a history merge, or by listing the authorship(s) in the Talk page. The history merge method is somewhat disliked by admins, because of it's laboriousness (and, I'm given to understand, its irreversibility). However, the operational difficulty of one method is no argument that the "<i>Merge &amp; delete</i>" vote is <i>invalid</i>. If Ryan wants to vote that, he is perfectly eligible to do so. Kind regards—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">encephalon</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#606060">ὲγκέφαλον</font></a>&#160; 12:41, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: Yes, technically he can vote "merge &amp; delete" but those alternative means of preserving attribution history are all laborious and error-prone. Unless someone makes a very strong case for <i>why</i> I should go to all that trouble, many closing admins (myself included) are going to ignore the "delete" side of that vote. A "vote" unadorned by comment or explanation gets low weight. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:59, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh yes, I'm quite aware of that Rossami—I did read <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_deletion_January-February_2005_c0f2.html#Merge_and_Delete" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion/January-February 2005">this</a> comment that you'd linked from that discussion I linked for Redwolf. I was here concerned mainly to dispel the notion that it is invalid or disallowed; it is not. Incidentally, and I'd understand if you'd like to take this to a talk page, it seems to me that the decision to disregard the delete part of the vote is one that is usually possible only because the vote is rare; I imagine that if I were closing a hypothetical AfD and was faced with 10 clear M&amp;D votes and nothing else, and all specifically asking for a history merge, I'd be bound to honor those wishes, however unadorned the votes (as I would be if, say, they were all unadorned keep votes). Not that this has practical relevance here, of course.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">encephalon</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#606060">ὲγκέφαλον</font></a>&#160; 00:50, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hmm, we now have two merge targets, I think the HP6 article is better suited because the bridge incident was not online. -- <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJoolz_b423.html" title="User:Joolz">Joolz</a> 00:00, 17 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Trolling is basically online by definition, and that's why I think the redirect to Internet troll is better, given the title we're redirecting from. The bridge incident is not really trolling, it's a stunt. It might warrant mentioning in some appropriate article if someone cares to salvage it, as it's actually much closer to real significance than anything else in this article. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 01:16, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I didn't miss the AfD notice, but because I came to the article from VfU, I was under the impression that the notice was leftover from the previous discussion. And I did merge, after of course quite significantly condensing the content. Check the history of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">Internet troll</a>. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 07:06, 17 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm aware of your edit to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">Internet troll</a> (quoted above). It's an appropriate addition to the article, but it doesn't remotely constitute a merger. I wouldn't even refer to that sentence as a summary of Harry Potter trolling (the content of which is referenced only in passing). —<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a> 07:40, 17 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Considering the strong sentiment for deleting the page, it's a merger of the concept this page is really about, minus all the stuff people don't consider to be worth keeping. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 20:13, 17 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, I'm not disputing the appropriateness of your addition to the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">Internet troll</a> article. It was a reasonable edit, but it doesn't come close to being a "merger." "Strong sentiment for deleting the page" is an argument against merging — not an excuse to change the definition. —<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a> 20:43, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't really understand what the people voting delete here have against a merge being performed. Very few people are arguing to keep the article in it's entirety, a merge normally does not keep the article intact in it's entirety, the worthwhile bits (e.g. the bridge incident) gets kept whilst the other parts get cut down, I don't see why people are objecting to this. -- <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJoolz_b423.html" title="User:Joolz">Joolz</a> 23:31, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> some of this into <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_83fd.html" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a> on a permanent basis. A condensed version of the first section (concerning online trolling) would be sufficient, and the banner incident seems notable enough. The radio incident and links needn't make the cut. Of course, all of this is merely my personal opinion. To be clear, I'm voting to turn the page into a redirect to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_83fd.html" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a> (with the full history retained, of course), thereby allowing editors to perform (and modify) the merger as they see fit. —<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a> 05:15, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: On multiple talk pages and project pages (including this one), <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24">Redwolf24</a> attempted to justify this page's re-deletion by noting that no merger had transpired. Lacking sysop status, how was a "Harry Potter" fan supposed to perform this task, given that the article was deleted less than a day after the AfD debate was closed by Moink? (I directed this question to <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24">Redwolf24</a> in the VfU discussion, but have not yet received a reply. "Something terrible has happened in [this user's] life," so I certainly don't expect one at the present time.) —<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a> 05:15, 17 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry to hear the bad news about Redwolf24. Of course there is no speedy criterion "has not been merged yet as required by AfD". The deleting sysop had the option of either performing the merge himself or allowing someone else to do so, or at most relisting on AfD as a disputed AfD close. I decry this recent habit among some sysops of simply speedying articles, without even making any attempt at discussion, because they disagree with another sysop's close. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:35, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
