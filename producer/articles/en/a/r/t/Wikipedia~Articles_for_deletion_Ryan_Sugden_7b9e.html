<li><s><b>Delete</b> Despite a handful of league appearances for Oldham, that still does not meet the "competing at highest level requirement".</s> Change to <b>Keep</b> per ChrisTheDude.

<li><b>Neutral</b> I think the minor league baseball rationale is unsuitable, beacause I think there are quite a few minor league players that deserve their own article, especially in areas without pro teams. However, the article doesn't assert any claims of notability, and would need to be expanded before I made a call on it.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonkBirdDuke_b901.html" title="User:MonkBirdDuke">MonkBirdDuke</a> 08:50, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The Soccerbase link on his page states for Oldham 20+ times, so that establishes his claim to notability. I'd still like to delete him mind, I really don't think many people are going to look up a player who played for a Division 2 side 20 odd times then disappeared into the lower leagues. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornetMike_bb8b.html" title="User:HornetMike">HornetMike</a> 13:29, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. The Conference may be the 5th flight of the English league, but it is regularly reported in all national newspapers and on television.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> he's played professional football therefor he qualifies. As for not strictly following <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> on atheletes what is the point of having rule regs and guidelines if we're not going to follow them strictly??

<dd>Normally I would agree with you about following guidelines, but I think WP:BIO is way off on this point and I'm not the only one who thinks so. That is why new (and stricter) notability guidelines for athletes are going through the proposal process as we speak. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 13:11, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think players from the Conference probably meet notability criteria.

<li><b>Keep</b>. He had 5 starts for Oldham Athletic in the Football League in 3.5 years there so he scrapes in based on that.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> 118 starts is an amount you can count on your fingers? Well, not everyone here is an octopuss, so we can't all quite count those on our fingers.
