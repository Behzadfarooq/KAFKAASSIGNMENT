<li>I argue that the jrocknyc entry be left up, as the site has been a long standing center of information for the jrock community.

<li><b>Comment</b> - While it's still being created, and not necessarily notable until release, as many mods of otherwise notable scope go unfinished and unreleased, I'd say this mod's scope would definitely qualify it as notable if it was actually completed. Furthermore, some of the nomination's comments seem strange to me - some quick research shows that <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Revolution_6333.html" title="Project Revolution">Project Revolution</a> (apparently founded in 2003) predates the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_Revolution_dcb8.html" title="Nintendo Revolution">Nintendo Revolution</a> (unveiled in 2005). Furthermore, this material doesn't really belong on <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_b5e0.html" title="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a>, not being a commercial game nor a guide to a game, and I was not aware that similarities in name were a reason for an AfD. -- <a href="../../../i/m/b/User%7EImban_8637.html" title="User:Imban">Imban</a> 01:43, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am Cooler one of the coders for the Project. We have been in gaming magazines two times as Siloh said. I would have to disagree with the fact that this project is not well known. We have over 1700 fan base registered users on the site alone. As well as our parent site Warcraft 3 Campaigns the leader of the wc3 mod community who has over 10,000 active members we are considered the largest and most famous of wc3 mods to date. We are also have an exclusive deal which <a href="http://www.sclegacy.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.sclegacy.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sclegacy.com/</a> one of the largest SC fan sites who also owns the famous blizzforums who has over 28,000 users and our mod is constantly mistaken by them and the web for starcraft 2. This is one of the main reasons for this article to stop confusion that a starcraft 2 is in production by blizzard. If I am not mistaken this one reasons why wikipedia exists to stop information confusion on the subject if this articles is removed at least put line in the SC one that says and any screen shots of sc2 are more then likely that of this wc3 total conversion.Also how could the article have rumors in it when it comes from the staff who is creating it. So all information is as accurate as possible. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECooler2_0107.html" title="User:Cooler2">Cooler2</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECooler2_5a71.html" title="User talk:Cooler2">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cooler2_0102.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cooler2">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> If anyone actually bothered to do an in-depth research about PR, they would find that it won second place on Mod DB awards, a huge mod site, <a href="http://features.moddb.com/111/?fpage=15" class="external free" title="http://features.moddb.com/111/?fpage=15" rel="nofollow">http://features.moddb.com/111/?fpage=15</a> PR won against fierce competition and only lost the first place to a mod who benefited from Half-Life's enormous popularity. And if that is not enough to guarantee that PR will be a huge success when released, then consider that PR is a TOTAL conversion, one that is intended to make StraCraft 3D that is much like the much-anticipated StarCraft 2. PR also benefits from StarCraft's popularity. PR is seeking multiple large sites to mirror it when released, proving that the staff has reason to expect mass downloading. I believe that a person qualified to vote here should at least know just how anticipated StarCraft 2 is and what PR represents to the SC fanbase.

I'm unwilling to declare an outright keep on a non-article that noone saying "keep" or "keep/cleanup" has actually put a trace of content-production effort into.

The labels are conspicuously absent from the discography, and the notion that merely <i>having</i> an entry on allmusic equates to a keep is a new one indeed. I note that it's called "semi-famous" and "[f]airly notable" but no evidence of this has been presented.

<dd>I apologise for not being more specific, however I assumed it was clear: The phrase "two albums" appears three times in the above discussion, so I highlighted that it has not been shown to meet that criterion. I also explicitly state that it has not been shown to meet <i>other</i> criteria. The comparisons you've made are facile, as both of them drew large amounts of coverage in independant media. If it's shown in the article that this ban has drawn coverage or that the albums have been released on a label per above, I'll happily change my recomendation. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000"><sup>{T}</sup></font></a><span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="#000000" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 04:39, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Reply:</b> I meant to says the band was "semi-famous" <i>within the Christian community</i>. I could've been more clear on that.

As for the label information, the band released albums on independent Christian label BulletProof Music. They were on BulletProof at the same time as, and toured with, Squad Five-O, a band that is notable enough to be listed on <a href="http://www.mtv.com/music/#/music/artist/squad_five_o/artist.jhtml" class="external text" title="http://www.mtv.com/music/#/music/artist/squad_five_o/artist.jhtml" rel="nofollow">MTV.com</a>. What that means for the purposes of this discussion, I'm not sure, but I think all of this evidence supports the notion that this band was "semi-famous," at least within the Christian community. Whether or not that is notable enough for Wikipedia, I'll leave for others to decide. My personal opinion (as voted above), is yes, it is. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeDockery_1c25.html" title="User:MikeDockery">MikeDockery</a> 05:23, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a good faith nomination. Rummel's contribution to DPT after his initial study is dubious.

<dd>Advanced mathematics and physics often do not receive much attention outside the field since it is very hard to understand.

<dd>Actually, their *theories* are fairly adequately covered under appropriate articles.

<li><b>Keep and Clean Up</b> - Falcone meets three of the criteria for a musician to be included in wikipedia. (1) Falcone has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable). Falcone released two albums on Cleopatra's Hypnotic Records (which has been in existence since the early 90s). Cleopatra's roster has included releases by Gary Numan, Yes, Motorhead, Hawkwind, Future Sound of London, and more recently Elvis Presley and The Ohio Players. (2) Falcone leads a number of music projects that contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable. Falcone leads Spirits Burning, a musical collective that has included members of many well-known progressive and space rock bands (such as Gong's Daevid Allen, Porcupine Tree's Steve Wilson, Hawkwind's Bob Calvert, Can's Mal Mooney). Falcone is also part of Weird Biscuit Teatime (CD on Voiceprint), with Gong's Daevid Allen. (3) Falcone has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show. Falcone's Spaceship Eyes wrote the theme for the rave film "Better Living Through Circuitry." Article would be better served to have the above info in its intro. The material about Falcone's hometown, college, and early bands (pre 1990) should be removed.</li>

<p>Greetings, while I do agree that this article reads like and ad for the complex. I would like to point out that it is valuable as a supporting article for this page, <a href="../../../w/d/w/WDWCP_76cd.html" title="WDWCP">WDWCP</a>. While an article on a random apartment complex in Orlando FL is not exactly what people on Wikipedia want to read, its status as one for 4 housing complexes in an international internship program for a fortune 500 company.... is.</p>
<p>Please consider using your talents to edit the article so that it doth not offend. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShifter55_2b04.html" title="User:Shifter55">Shifter55</a> 19:43, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with Shifter. As this is not a general interest for the general community, it is meant for a particular group of readers. The Disney College Program is a very big program and this page supports the topic for that page. Thousands of students research and look up information about the program every semester and a major question that they would like answered is what their living arrangements would be like. Please help in edit the page to help it fit the Wikipedia mold and reconsider the deletion if page is reposed. --<a href="../../../c/w/5/User%7ECw532_a58b.html" title="User:Cw532">Cw532</a> 04:02, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm pretty sure an article on "a technique in rhetoric" could be expanded with more examples of historical usage, important authors, texts or political speeches which have used it and so on. I see no big reason not to transwiki this at the moment, as long as nobody objects to a future re-introduction of an expanded and referenced version to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 10:22, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, I would prefer somebody either to rewrite it as a better article, using a more complete description, more examples and proper references, or use it as a section in a larger article on rhetorical devices and make the title a redirect. A problem in <i>this</i> case is that it also appears to be a copyvio, see <a href="http://www.virtualsalt.com/rhetoric.htm#Dirimens" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.virtualsalt.com/rhetoric.htm#Dirimens" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 18:14, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Business and finance are some of the weakest areas of coverage here. The success or failure of corporate recoveries, the ensuing layoffs and restructuring, impact millions of workers, their families and communities every year.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unverified original research in which many of the entries apparently don't meet the stated criteria for inclusion (death depicted via "special effects.") And this article includes a woefully incomplete section on "death by gunfire," which will overwhelm the article if taken seriously; a section on "death by blendering", a purely subjective category; and no section on "death by bow and arrow," which I suppose means that Native Americans can die gorily, but not cowboys. But NOR/verifiability is the central problem. Who's to say that a particular death was depicted by special effect or implied by skillful editing. And how can you verify, say, that the character in Ghoulies 2 died from having his buttocks eaten? Has anyone ever died from that?

<p>I prodded which was shortly removed. The rationale I gave for the prod follows: <i>This is 100% original research and POV, to wit, no encyclopedic content. While it is possible that a proper article could be created on the sex scandals plaguing the protestant church, this isn't it.</i> Note that the author removed most of the text after removing the prod tag (see history for the full text). I do think an article can be created on this topic, but just because an article <i>can</i> be created is not a proper rationale for rehabilitation of unencyclopedic content. <a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 05:51, 4 March 2006 (UTC) .</p>

<p>Keep it. There are 30,000 Protestant churches. You can't write an article about abuse cases in every one of them, so it has to be general. There is one just for Catholics. Why not have one for Protestants? Sections for Jimmy Swaggart etc. can be added. It is POV to delete it just because it's creepy. The one on Catholic priest sexual abuse is pretty creepy to, so shouldn't it be deleted? This gives a starting point to balance the whole issue of sexual abuse instead of making it appear to be solely the perogative of Catholic priests. I think there should also be entries for abuse among Rabbi's, Buddhists, Muslims, and others. It is POV just to have one for Catholics. Let's be fair here. Also I would like to add there is a dearth of information on Protestant church scandals. They are not studied or covered as much. This makes it difficult to write an entry. Let it stand as a stub and be improved over time.

<p>Actually there are 22 ritual churches within Catholicism. Should I demand that we have a seperate article for each rite? One for the Roman Rite, one for the Coptic Rite etc.? There is simply no way to cover the issue without using the word "Protestant" to cover the spectrum. Otherwise this is simply a pretext to avoid writing about the issue at all (except for when it's about Catholics). If you check the link you will see it covers many denominations. This is the only way to do it. I am aware that there is sentiment to not focus on Protestant scandals. But they do exist and deserve the same treatment as the Catholic ones. It is admittedly harder to do, but we should start somewhere.

<p>What if the Catholic Church sued Wikipedia for libel? You cover only abuse scandals in the Catholic Church as if they don't happen elsewhere. Do Protestant children count less? Is their abuse somehow different or okay then if the perpetrator was Catholic? Are you prepared for 30,000 articles each covering a different denomination? And you claim there is no central Protestant body, so who exactly is going to sue wikipedia then? If you check the link you will find almost 1000 scandals with their respective denominations listed. That's pretty meaningful and verified. What I see here is an intense desire to avoid covering an important issue due to POV. If this article doesn't make it then the one on the Catholic scandals should go. Unless you simply want to admit bias. Frankly I don't see the problem with an article on this unless there is bias at work. Again part of the problem is that there are no comprehensive records or studies. No one has bothered, other then that one site, to start adding up the Protestant scandals. The denominations aren't trotting out their records for public perusal. If anyone knows where we can find more detailed info please speak up. But if you look at the site you know it is happening. You say be more specific. I would be delighted to, but the Baptists et al are not being real cooperative. They don't have to be since they are not under the microscope. The Orthodox are mired in sex scandals right now in Greece. Have you heard about that? Probably not, since it isn't a Catholic scandal. Why in the world do you want to keep facts out of wikipedia or should I say THESE facts?

<p>I put a link to the best source I could find. No studies have been done as far as I can tell. By providing at least a brief stub with the link we put as much out there as exists currently. It's the best that can be done at this point and is better then nothing. At least if someone has a question they get pointed in the right direction. We can certainly link to the TV evangelist scandals. I argue that this be permitted despite it's stub form since it seem to be the only information available. The alternative is to simply ignore what is there. Perhaps others have access to more information and can add to it. So why not leave it as a work in progress? Cestusdei</p>

<dd>That woud be fine if this was a different type of reference work. But Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. Encyclopedia's are not the venue for news, or original research or academic papers, etc.. An encyclopedia is a compendium of already know information. It is not or should not be a first source but a second-hand source, and good articles are a <i>synthesis</i> of original source material, if you will. I (we?) have no problem with the nature of what you are writing per se, what I object to is its inclusion in this <i>encyclopedia.</i> There is no rancorous intent or hidden agenda. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 21:39, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well that's the problem. What is known is minimal right now. If I had detailed studies I would certainly put those in. I wish I did. All I can do is put in what is available. I can't do the research myself. I grant it is just a small stub with only one link, but if that's all that's out there then that's all that can be put in. But something is better then nothing. Maybe someone out there will see the stub and have access to more information then I do. It won't hurt to let it stay. It may be that someone will find the reference useful. I think I have said as much as I can say about the article in it's defense. I hope that wikipedia will keep it at least until something better comes along. If something does then it can be replaced. I think that is fair and will also shield wikipedia from the claim that they focus only on catholic scandals out of bias. Keep it, everybody wins and no one really loses.</p>

Other articles contain blatent bias or falsehoods or unverifiable statements and they too are permitted to continue. POV seems to be ignored in many cases. Yet here suddenly all the rules apply.

<li><b>Keep</b> I suppose. I authored this list to add Kansas to the List of United States shopping malls by state. IF you want to delete this article, you should also delete all of other lists of malls. I am not against that, since I think Wikipedia has too many damn lists, but you can't rightfully delete this article and <b>keep</b> List of shopping malls in Rhode Island, List of shopping malls in Vermont, List of shopping malls in Maine, etc. So, if someone wants to take on the project of deleting ALL of the shopping mall lists, be my guest.

<p>Article is an unverified neologism. Google produces <i>zero</i> hits for entire term; acronym alone has no hits for legal connotation (chiefly for "Association of Childrens Prosthetic-Orthotic Clinics").

<p>Old, but non-notable website. Original version had about <b>6</b> external links to the site. Main claim of notability seems to be that it is in the Library of Congress's Sept 11th Internet archive; this is not significant, as that archive contains a large proportion of all sites on the net as of that time; it's no claim of notability, afaik. Also the site has a prominent banner saying that it is being sold; this looks like an attempt to use Wikipedia as a promotional tool. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 09:24, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP.</b><a href="http://www.usnewslink.com" class="external text" title="http://www.usnewslink.com" rel="nofollow">USNewsLink's</a> main claim to fame? There is no main claim to fame. This website is constantly updated and provides information about a variety of subjects and issues. Jesse's criticism is unwarranted and his summary of the site's importance is petty at worst and inaccurate at best. Jesse does not have a clue about the history of USNewsLink or its "external links.” USNewsLink's <a href="http://www.usnewslink.com/uscasualties.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.usnewslink.com/uscasualties.htm" rel="nofollow">US Casualties</a> pages are constantly read. The <a href="http://www.usnewslink.com/archive.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.usnewslink.com/archive.htm" rel="nofollow">Archive</a> is constantly read, and re-read. And I doubt that anyone at the Library of Congress would agree with Jesse as to the importance of the Sept. 11 Archive. While there may be many entries in the Archive, they were hand selected by an editorial committee. Every article was read by one or more people before it was nominated for inclusion. The efforts of Jesse to minimize the importance of the selection of USNewsLink's articles and commentary for the Sept. 11 Archive is certainly no reason to delete USNewsLink from Wikipedia. The fact that USNewsLink is for sale in no way implies that it will not continue in its present format because it is funded by my foundation. I will remain a Director and my stock ownership will revert to the foundation for USNewsLink's future overhead. And for the record, Jesse made no effort to notify me of his deletion nomination. I have revised the content to bare bones information and hope that Jesse will remove his objection and allow the content to stay in the directory. Usnewslink 09:44, 4 March 2006 (UTC).</li>

<p>Thanks for your comment on this. I didn't leave you a message before nominating the page because I noted that you were currently active on the article, and I assumed(correctly) that you would see the message, and would comment if you wished to. Regarding your description of Wikipedia as a "directory", please review the page <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>. Also <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia:Notability (websites)</a> would be useful, as it lays out some good guidelines regarding the inclusion of articles on websites in Wikipedia. Reviewing the LoC site, I see that you are right - although the total collection is over 30,000 sites ("selected", but mere mebership in such a large list would not be grounds for inclusion in Wikipedia), there is a smaller collection of approx. 2,300 sites which were further indexed, and USNewsLink <a href="http://lcweb4.loc.gov/911/catalog/2394.html" class="external text" title="http://lcweb4.loc.gov/911/catalog/2394.html" rel="nofollow">is one of them</a>, which I agree is some claim to notability. I still wish to leave this up for nomination for some more time, as I'm not yet convinced, but I do appreciate the comment. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 10:22, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The inclusion of USNewsLink's articles and commentary in the Sept. 11 Archive ensures that historians throughout the ages will have access to what Americans - in particular this American - thought and felt during the aftermath of Sept. 11. But from your view, people who read Wikipedia would have no interest in such. You think USNewsLink is not relevant or important enough to be included in Wikipedia and want it deleted. But thankfully, the Libary of Congress doesn't share your view. Usnewslink 11:19, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The whole article is original research -- and one of the most vile variations of such original research, namely the kind that doesn't limit itself to one article, but tries to insert itself into a variety of other articles as well (e.g. see creation of articles <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_Europe_7640.html" title="Celtic Europe">Celtic Europe</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_Europe_085c.html" title="Germanic Europe">Germanic Europe</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_Europe_b571.html" title="Latin Europe">Latin Europe</a> etc). There's certainly lots of things that can be spoken about cultural divisions in Europe -- and for linguistic and religions divisions as well. But this overall "hypothesis" that conflates culture and history, objectivity and subjectivity, fact and research into one single thing, and tries to lift artificial concrete border where the reality is much more fluid and abstract -- ugh, this is a horrid and ugly thing; less a description of reality and more of a original-research modelization thereof. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 10:50, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b>. The term "Spazcore" or "Spazzcore" is irrelevant and contrived. No one uses the term except for occaisonally those who are far-removed from the DIY hardcore scene, who are unfamiliar with the actual terminology and therefore invent their own. For instance, mainstream rock journalists who have likely never attended a DIY show in their lives may make up their own terms ("spazcore") to describe music that already has a more legitimate name ("second wave powerviolence"). The article is pointless; it's obviously one person's attempt to use Wikipedia to legitimize a silly and non-existant term. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexanderj_1067.html" title="User:Alexanderj">Alexanderj</a> 11:23, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Croat historians argue that the De Administrando Imperio gives direct contradictions. Many other historians also agree that the settlements described in chapter 32 of the Serbs seem like a copy of an earlier written chapter 31 of the Croats. Croat historians also accuse the De Administrando Imperio of having a Byzantine and pro-Serb bias in the later chapters 33 and 34 where it designates Hum and Travunia as Serb lands. They also argue that there are no historical documents prior to the 11th century that designate Duklja (large part of Montenegro) as a Serb territory. Croatian historians believe that Montenegro was forcefully conquered by the Serbs in the 12th century and Orthodox religion was forced on the populace. Croat nationalists believe most of the Orthodox Montenegrins and Herzegovians to be descendants of Red Croats and therefore "Orthodox Croats".</i></p>
<p>Ehm - what does this have to do with <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Croatia_7047.html" title="Red Croatia">Red Croatia</a> - it deals with <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Administrando_Imperio_1509.html" title="De Administrando Imperio">De Administrando Imperio</a> - and should not be present here (not the subject). --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 13:22, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Serb nationalists declare Montenegrin separatism as a direct product of Greater Croatian ideology. In the later half of the 20th century, a prominant Serb historian Dr. Slavenko Terzic had extreme criticism against his enemies whom he considered "Red Croats" particularly against the work of a Montenegrin Croat named Savic Markovic Stedimlija. Stedimlija between 1941 and 1944 in the pro fascist Independent State of Croatia published several books and articles promoting pro-Croat Montenegrin nationalism as well as several articles on the promotion of the "Croatian Orthodox Church." Stedimlija is accused of the systematic sabotage of Serbian history in Montenegro by Terzic due to Stedimlija's publishing of Red Croatian history which Terzic alleged was made only for the purpose of negating the Serb roots of Montenegrins.</i></p>
<p>Today, Montenegrin separatism is less based on Croatian nationalism and more due to economic problems facing the union between Serbia and Montenegro. There are still many Montenegrins today who declare themselves Serbs and very few that declare themselves Croats.</p>
<p><i>Today, Montenegrin...</i> - what does this have to do with Red Croatia? Anyway - the third paragraph to the up mentions that <a href="../../../z/a/h/Zahumlje.html" title="Zahumlje">Hum</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Travunia.html" title="Travunia">Travunia</a> were Serb lands (again) - when DAI (De Administrando Imperio) actually says that Pagania and Zahumlje were Serbian lands (like I explained before). Travunia is the area of Serbian rule. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 13:25, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is verifiable, notable and not indiscriminate. As the intro states, the Nation parties "are not merely commercial events held for LGBT recreation but also socio-political statements of significance in Singapore gay history and milestones in Singapore's human rights record.". The article is about the history of the development of the LGBT community in Singapore, through bars and parties. It is also about the repression of the Nation and Snowball circuit parties. Parties and bars (and now perhaps the internet) have generally been the mechanism for the development of LGBT communities throughout the world. The Nation parties are notable, having been mentioned in several national and international news oulets. The article is a useful and interesting information.

<li><b>Comment</b>. May I ask for clarification. The nominator wrote that the verifiability of the literature is not questioned, but he later said that "loosely associating them in this fashion is original research". May I point out that: First: most of these literature are of certain genre, so they are closely associated (except probably the section on "short stories" ). Second: compilation of verifiable content is NOT original research. Please refer to <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and the discussion in the talk page. In fact, such compilations, in general, are very useful, and especially valuable in this topic. It badly needs a cleanup instead. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 16:10, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'd like to see some sources that classify these writings as "Singapore gay literature". Something that shows that someone else has written on the subject of "Singapre gay literature". Otherwise this just looks like original research. I've followed all of the links, but they're about a specific writing, not the subject as a whole. This leads me to believe that the writings should have their own articles and that this article lumps them all together for some unexplained reason. The "internet" section at the end serves as a repository of links of examples but nothing that I would consider a <s>primary</s> reliable source. --&#160;<a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrash_3aff.html" title="User:Krash">Krash</a>&#160;<small>(<a href="../../../k/r/a/User_talk%7EKrash_5bb4.html" title="User talk:Krash">Talk</a>)</small> 16:57, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I first prodded this page and it was speedied, possibly by {{db-author}} After recreate, I prodded again which was shortly removed. My prod rationale was <i>Dictionary/neologism definition; <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a></i>. In the recreation history message author proposed that page be merged with article on <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a>, but as I stated on the discussion page, that makes no sense. If the term is to be incorporated into atheism, make the change (be bold); dicdef not candidate for merge with article.

<p><b>Closer's notes</b></p>
<p>There was a majority of keep comments in this debate, however the variety of options led to the comments being split, with no consensus for a particular action. The strongest trends were:</p>

<li><b>Remove</b> Keeping this article will open the door to more spamming articles by NASCAR news related websites being added to the encyclpedia. I am not an authority at Wikipedia, but surely it is not the intention of the founder to have spam advertising running rampant throughout this site. There are a lot of notable NASCAR news sites that have reporters actually at the events covering the sport. Jayski's is not one of them. Thunderroad 22:04, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The site is a notable resource of all types of Nascar information. The site is notable in that it provides news on almost everything happening in the Nascar world, not to mention resources such as pictures of nearly every paint scheme being run, media news, team news, and more. Many Nascar fans rely on this site for their Nascar information, and it's not like a site like this is commonplace, and no other site seems to have the vast resources that Jayski's site does, nor are any such sites as popular by a long shot.

<p>The article is on a local councillor (and failed parliamentary candidate in the 2005 general election). It demonstrates no further notability or significance. There is no evidence that she is a major local figure who has had significant press coverage. I proposed the article for deletion but this was removed. The article has not been improved since, hence the AfD. <b>Delete</b> as not meeting <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 17:02, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Retain</b>: There are currently *many* articles on people who have been candidates in various elections aronud the world, and this person is but one. Whilst I see no especially reason to retain this one more than the other similar people I likewise see no reason to delete this one whilst retaining all the others. For that matter, I do not see any urgent need to delete such type of articles generally as these people had a moment of 'fame' that will remain of interest to people interested in politics in the future, no matter that they did not succeed in the election in which they stood. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a> is relevant here as it does us no harm to retain such reference material and, imho, does us great good. We cannot presume that other data sources (such as the Guardian one listed) will remain free to users. On the one thing <i>There is no evidence that she is a major local figure who has had significant press coverage</i> btw, she had very significant press coverage as she took the seat she took from Labour (the party in power) in a bye-election victory which overturned a safe seat for that other party, indeed the seat of the Leader of the council. Whilst we would not write an article on these people this far after the event there is no clear reason to delete it after the event/</li>

<p>Page has become completely scurrilous, has POV too embedded to fix. Subject probably doesn't warrant Wiki entry at all, or maybe a 10-line entry. Now there are TWO entries on Marsden/Donnelly controversy, a 10-year-old harassment case. Artticle is now loaded with unsubstantiated/unproven allegations of criminal behavior. Article appears to be a hatchet job by Canadians against a local pundit. Article is also libelous by innuendo under Canadian law. Attempts to make this article NPOV have been rejected by administrator and two or three writer/editors. See (long) discussion page. Delete -- Ceraurus 18:26, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Mmm, I see a number of references to an American Chess Association founded in 1874, then changed to National Chess Association. That merged with the American Chess Federation to form the United States Chess Federation.<a href="http://aotw.org/officers.php?officer_id=237" class="external autonumber" title="http://aotw.org/officers.php?officer_id=237" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> So I'm not sure what to believe here.

<p>If you want to redirect "Amertican Chess Association" to "United States Chess Federation" I have no objection.</p>
<p>Mention of the "National Chess Association" first appeared in the "American Chess Bulletin" in 1927. I believe that it had been newly formed at that time. It merged with the larger Western Chess Accociation to become the United States Chess Federation on December 27, 1939 (note the date).</p>
<p>There were probably other chess asociations prior to that time, but very little is known about them.</p>
<p>I am 100% sure that no "American Chess Association" exists today. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Sloan_b1e5.html" title="User:Sam Sloan">Sam Sloan</a> 14:00, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> It's just slander. If you want to level something against the religious order (which was incorrectly named as a school) I suggest you back it up. I could dig up some old documents in my room about the order. But the founder was never accused of anything demonic or pervertive. He was only ever accused of misspending money and that allegation turned out to be false after an independant third party was told to investigate. His accuser was being spiteful.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>; it presents formatting and sorting not possible in a category. It may be incomplete but it can be expanded; as for links, I don't feel competent to judge which fictional battles do or don't merit articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> Why are lists always getting AfD'd for being incomplete? It's not a valid reason to delete a list, just as being a stub is not, in and of itself, reason enough to delete an article. As Melchoir said, this list does things with formatting that a category can't. --<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">djrobgordon</a> 21:01, 4 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A misunderstanding. An incomplete list than can reasonably be completed is not a problem (it'll get finished at some point). An incomplete list that cannot possibly be completed may be suffering from a hopelessly broad scope (e.g. List of villains - which is a blue link for reasons I cannot fathom - or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_places.html" title="List of places">List of places</a>), a problem which can sometimes only reasonably be dealt with by deletion. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 04:58, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In this case, the category and its children have roughly 200 articles, half of which are from Star Wars and might require a list of their own. Either way, I think it's a manageable quantity. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 05:33, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, if the list is <i>not</i> limited to battles that already have articles, it will become unmaintainable rather quickly; the number of battles invented for various fictional works outnumbers the number of real historical ones (which already compose some five very long lists). —<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lok</a><font color="green">s</font><a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">hin</a> 05:46, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you for giving reasons for proposed deletion of Compressionism. A couple of points: (1)The poem 'The Compressionist' (3 sonnets in iambic tetrameters) was submitted to all British copyright libraries in 1988. It can be found, for example, in the catalogue of the British Library. (2) The terms 'Compressionist' and 'Compressionism' have recently become more common. Since my poem, the terms have most often been used with reference to complicated techniques in the film industry. In the last few weeks Amazon has been offering a novel with the word 'Compressionism' in the title. I would not be at all offended by a deletion but I think that there is a genuine need for a term in aesthetics or literary criticism to describe a standpoint between the extremes of impressionism and expressionism. I also think the numerous and varied uses of the terms demonstrate a need for definitions on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EANDREW_LAMBERT_620e.html" title="User:ANDREW LAMBERT">User:ANDREW LAMBERT</a> 5 March, 2006

<dd>Important articles by Michael Billington in The Guardian on Compressionism in modern drama can be found by searching for 'COMPRESSIONISM MICHAEL BILLINGTON'. "The new compressionism can also leave too much unsaid" (16.4.05). "In an age of dramatic compressionism one wishes that Shepard would get on with it" (6.7.01). "Compressionism is a perfectly valid dramatic form as the work of Beckett and Pinter proves"(9.4.05). "Laurence Kitchin in his fascinating book 'Drama in the Sixties' pins down a moment when compressionism suddenly became all the rage. He defines a compressionist play as 'one in which the characters are insulated from society in such a way as to encourage a maximum conflict of attitudes'. Kitchin also traces the development of compressionism through the plays of Sartre, Beckett and Ionesco and shows how it influenced other forms such as painting through Francis Bacon's portraits..." (9.4.05).</dd>
<dd>The key book in this respect is Laurence Kitchin: Drama in the Sixties. 11:24 5 March, 2006</dd>
<dd>User:Andrew Lambert 'Drama in the Sixties' was published by Faber and Faber, London, in 1966.I do not have the book to hand but it may well be that Kitchin (not I, as I thought!) first defined Compressionism. In that case should the article be seen by an expert on C20 drama before deletion? By the way, I would be happy to post a copy of my poem for purposes of verification. 11:39 5 March, 2006
<dl>
<dd>Um... Billington seems to be talking about a meaning of "compressionism" separate from yours. In order to incorporate his and Kitchin's ideas, we'd have to scrap the article anyway. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 21:13, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>REDIRECT</b> to <i>Afro</i>. Mass-sockpuppetry aside, there is still no outright consensus to delete here, with many preferring a redirect instead (though relying rather heavily on a previous AfD, when really this AfD is about...this AfD). Still, there is literally minimal support for the article to standalone, so I figure a redirect is likely to displease people the least. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:45, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Where, so not only do u seem to have a problem with Jewish concepts, but now you have a problem with democratic procedures? I think we should change this site to "where-pedia" and then people would only print things that Where deems to be okay. Furthermore, if this information is in afro, then depending on the outcome of this vote we will either have to keep it in there or remove it:) .Perhaps they are "sockpuppets", but i don't think there is a way to prove that, so we will just have to rely on good faith.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I voted keep last time and still believe that the article works fine on its own. Of course, <b>I wrote most of it</b> so maybe I'm biased. Nevertheless, sticking it in the middle of Afro essentially does a disservice to both articles. On a side note, I'm somewhat bemused by the ardent calls to respect the previous AfD outcome. Considering how freqently articles are nominated and renominated, sometimes three or four times, sometimes in the same week, until they are eventually deleted, at which point they become speedily deletable as recreations of previously deleted material, the editors who have waited some months to recreate Jewfro have shown significant restraint. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 22:34, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>The bottom line is that AfDs are really only closed as keep or delete. A close as merge or redirect is in fact equal to keep. I can point you to many Afds that were closed as merge where editors at the target refused the merge and so it was not carried out. I could also point you to many Afds closed as Keep where editors who had voted delete immediately redirected the article. That is actually extremely frequent. Your point about page deletion is not correct. Recreation of previously deleted material can be speedied. Hence, it requires DRV. However, there is nothing to review regarding the close of the previous Jewfro Afd since the material was not deleted. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:40, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's a somewhat idiosyncratic interpretation of the previous AfD, because the result was merge, which is exactly what was done- the article was merged and it is substantially longer than a dicdef.

And yes, I can read, but I would suggest that you read the criteria for speedy deletion and this does not qualify. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 10:17, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have to agree with you about the CSD, JJay. The previous AFD closed with a deletion in a figurative sense, but not in a literal sense, and only the latter matters with G4. Regarding the warnings, however, I think we do need two, as each warning serves a different purpose. The first warning (in blue) is addressed to the closing admin, and the second warning is addresseed to Whoermaster (and possible his/her friends). <b><a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where"><font color="blue">Wh</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="#0AB20D">e</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where"><font color="blue">re</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../w/h/e/User_talk%7EWhere_05e5.html" title="User talk:Where"><font color="#0099FF">(talk)</font></a></sup></b> 12:56, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article was never created in the interest of accuracy, but of of vengance. This article has numerous glaring inaccuracies. When involved parties have attempted to correct this information, it has been "reversed", thereby proving the lack of interest in accuracy.</p>
<p>This person has no relevance, and is certainly not interesting enough to warrant a Wikipedia page.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the continuance of this article holds this person up to public ridicule, and therefore could result in civil implications. Other articles do the same thing, completely disrespecting people's privacy. I cite the article on Natalie Portman. She chooses not to use her family name out of safety for her family..her homeland is a lot different than America. Yet, in a total disregard for her wishes and family's safety, her name is listed. It has no relevance.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, he got a lot of coverage for some of his antics.

<p>My view is that a guy that works for a year straight to get on Fox news, to get on the radio, to get into the newspapers, and when you Google his name is all over the place, deserves a spot on Wiki. I am not sure what the contention is here... Crook himself is the one that tries to make the most changes,as is evident from his IP#'s based either out of Syracuse, or a nearby suburb. I think it could use some cleaning up by someone that is really experienced at writing wiki, but the guy is a public figure, He gets to live with the fame.. I am not sure what is in here that is so terrible. He is concerned about his families safety???(the question begs to be asked why he started all his stuffin the first place) but he regularly posts the contact information for police, his detractors, and other public figures if he can find it... why does it not apply to him? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.16.96.116 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.16.96.116.html" title="User talk:24.16.96.116">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.16.96.116_7444.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.16.96.116">contribs</a>).</small></p>

Well, did you ever stop to think, with your lack of courage to even sign your entry, that maybe there would be no need for him to post his detractors' info if this entry didn't exist? Misery loves company..at least that's my view. Despite what you think, I am not him, nor does he live in New York. If you bothered to do even five minutes of kindergarten-level research, you'd know that. But again, you're after blood and vengence. If that's the way you want to live life, that's fine, but I see this as a vicious circle. There's no need for this article, and it can certainly be considered a threat, a civil implication for Wikipedia, and just plain stupid. And again, if it were to go away, the detractor's information likely would as well. Who knows? It's a crazy mixed up world, but there are lots of people who have lots of Google hits, who don't have an entry. Actress Blaze Berdahal has many hits, but no Wikipedia entry. Why? Oh yes, whoever created this entry did it out of spite and moral outrage. Oneforthetruth 12:56, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I don't have an account, but as you can see my IP is plainly logged. Explain how it is a threat, and how there are civil implications for Wikipedia? And if in fact the article was created out of spite and Moral outrage, why has Michael Crook edited and added to his own Wiki... I think you are outvoted at this point... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.16.96.116 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.16.96.116.html" title="User talk:24.16.96.116">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.16.96.116_7444.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.16.96.116">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Well, as "apposed" to doing your research, you slander the subject. He does not HAVE anti-trop, anti-police websites. He HAD them. No blog, either.

You've proven that you have no interest in facts, but revenge, and moral outrage.</p>
