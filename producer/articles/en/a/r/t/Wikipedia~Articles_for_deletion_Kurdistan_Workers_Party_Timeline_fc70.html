<dd>If <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> thinks this is "impartial scholarly research" There is a long tradition of BALANCING the articles, but not deleting them. It should not be difficult for <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> to add the events from <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a>'s view point. <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> is welcomed to bring is POV to make it NPOV.
<dl>
<dd>"Balancing the articles" usually means putting an opposing viewpoint within the article itself, either as a separate section or mixed within the same section, not by writing a separate, stand-alone "article"... and this is hardly an encyclopedia article as it is presented here today. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 00:25, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the people interested Kurdistan Workers Party/Timeline; It was created as a graphical time to the the articles <a href="../../../p/k/k/PKK_1685.html" title="PKK">PKK</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Kurdistan_Workers_Party_8c3f.html" title="History of the Kurdistan Workers Party">History of the Kurdistan Workers Party</a> in helping the users understand (visually see the periods) the violent behaviors of the organization (organizational development) that spans more than 30 years. PKK is an organization that uses force and the threat of force against both civilian and military targets , and it's activity profile is comparable to <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Qaeda_fab2.html" title="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a>. The arguments regarding Kurdistan Workers Party/Timeline (<b>graphical time</b>) is <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:EasyTimeline_activation" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:EasyTimeline_activation" rel="nofollow">part of</a> wiki (an encyclopedia article)or not, is something that does not have any credit. To understand this tool; or to use the tool; one has to read <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Kurdistan_Workers_Party_8c3f.html" title="History of the Kurdistan Workers Party">History of the Kurdistan Workers Party</a>, or look previous versions PKK which (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kurdistan_Workers_Party&amp;oldid=43853119" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kurdistan_Workers_Party&amp;oldid=43853119" rel="nofollow">timeline integrated into the article</a>) before the history become a separate article. In order to understand what this time line is telling about. If <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> wants to improve the article, I was just trying to be agreeable to <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a>. I can not see the validity of adding "opposing viewpoint" of an organization that has committed multiple acts of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>. On the other hand, <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> seems removing content more than adding to it. This time line stayed in the wiki sphere for nearly two years. I guess if you do not like something (a dedicated militant of an ideology or group) what you need to do is "wait"; there will be a time that one can even "delete" a content using claims like ugly, unuseful<b>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> or create a new article if its listing as a subpage violates guidelines. There are shorter articles about fictional Star Wars and Pokemon characters and planets, there is no reason that there shouldn't be an article about the timeline of PKK et al. NPOV issues can be dealt with, just put the appropriate tag. The whole article is sourced, it can be expanded, structured and English sources found.. What is the problem here? Hurriyet is the most prominent newspaper in Turkey. In 2004, Turkey ranked higher than Italy for the freedom of the press, so I think that its words carry enough weight. The article could be moved to a a new article, but there is no basis for deletion. Many timeline articles exist for every topic imaginable. NPOV issues <i>in</i> the article are not the basis for its deletion. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 18:07, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am bothered to see so many people who have less than an impartial view on issues concerning turkey on one vote. That is why I wont be voting.<br />
As for the article in question, I did not create it, I created a sub page because of the amount of code. I merely copied the timeline from tr.wiki since it felt sensible at the time. I was going o translate it but later felt that was rather pointless. A number of png/svg timelines would be better IMHO.<br />
