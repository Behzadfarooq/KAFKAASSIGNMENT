<h2><span class="mw-headline">Etiquette for moving articles to other collaborations?</span></h2>
<p>What is sorely missing in AID practice, to my mind, is a community-enforced mechanism for moving articles over to more appropriate collaborations (e.g. the sorely missing biodiversity (for species articles) and technology (for engineering and computation topics) collaborations). That would help to lighten the load. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 00:49, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Threshold effect - raising it further?</span></h2>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I note the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost a week after the introduction of the increased threshold of 4 votes per week, the active nominations have decreased from 74 to 67.</li>
<li>Eleven (11) more articles will expire by or on the 13th, properly a week after the introduction of the raised threshold, assuming no additional votes for those articles.</li>
<li>More articles are nominated on weekends than weekdays.</li>
<li>I am writing this on a Saturday morning.</li>
<li>As there are fewer nominees, each nominee may get more votes (this cricically depends on voter psychology, of course!)</li>
</ul>
<p>While I can't be certain that the threshold was rigorously applied (someone should probably check this, some deadline dates look at bit odd as well, presumably due to the "what, you mean February has 28 days?" effect), it may be worth keeping the idea of raising the weekly threshold to five (5) at the back of our minds - presumably a number of candidates in the region of 20-30 would be ideal? - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 10:12, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think that's a good idea. I say we wait for few more weeks and see what happens because this raise of limit works. It works slowly, but works. As for checking, I'll add a feature to my bot today which will check the nominated section for fraud ((date2-date1)/7*4 == number of votes), but only for nominations which were added after March 6... --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 11:52, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey Dijxtra, you can use one more <b>if</b> and calculate the correct date for nominees added before March 6 (if you want:)) Btw, this new 4 votes/week needs at least 1 months to stable.

Presumably, Seigenthaler only got those 36 votes over an extended amount of time, while the former article got votes much faster, and so at the rate it was going, it would have been over 36 by the time it reached that age, had it stayed as just a nom that long. --<font color="orange"><strike><i><a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERory096_e5c4.html" title="User:Rory096">Rory</a></i><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">0</font></a><b><a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">96</a></b></strike></font> 22:08, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Quantity is nothing. An article can be deleted through AfD with just a handful of votes, while another could attract hundreds but not reach a consensus. The vote count means that Seigenthaler attracted a mild but not critical amount of interest, and it took a long time for this to die down. While on the surface you're right that it seems weird, I think the system is pretty fair for its purposes. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 09:35, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If I remembered correctly, I removed John Seigenthaler. For a very long time, it seemed like it would win, but there was just not enough votes. Once it nearly made it, but because of invalid votes, it didn't.

<p>We have a problem.

<li>We convince guys at <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">Wikipedia:bots</a> that we need this stuff to be done by a bot</li>
<li>We decide not to post notices on talk pages at all</li>
<li>We return to only one AID per week, so rollover by current rules becames managable by hand</li>

<dd>I agree, the statement at the end of the vote said the majority consensus was for two, but when the vote is 6-4, it's not a consensus, just a majority.

<dd>I agree. Either that, or we don't post the notices in the talk page. It takes too much time and effort, I spend 10 min doing that when there was only 1 AID, it will take even longer. As well, it divides people's attention when you have 2 AID. Those articles then won't get the desired attention of AID. Lastly, maybe, just maybe, we should get a bot to do the notice, if we're going to keep doing it. But personally, I don't see the use of the notices. If a person is on Wiki a great deal of time, they will check the Community portal sooner or later in a week. If they aren't on, they don't see the message. Therefore, it isn't much of a use. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 21:36, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

We may have more voters on AID, but that doesn't mean we're going to have the contributors to the winners. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 18:07, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would move back to one a week. Two is overwhelming and just hurts the AID as it causes there not to be much work done on either article (something like 6 edits for Great Leap Forward?). One is just easier to concentrate on. I, too, did not even know about the poll until it was all over, and the results were hardly overwhelming. <a href="../../../p/d/x/User%7EPDXblazers_2cc8.html" title="User:PDXblazers">PDXblazers</a> 05:49, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s>The only really hard thing about two articles per week is pasting the 'help, please' template onto seventy user pages. I am, in fact, the only person who ever did that, and I am not doing it again. However, if it was automated by a bot - or stopped altogether - then the workload is only marginally more difficult than doing one article per week. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 18:14, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</s>

<li>I'm striking my vote. I just did the rollover for this week, and I can see that nobody edited these articles.

<li>I used to do the rollover, but I now refuse to do it for same reasons - to much job to do. But I think that even if we fix that problem (by means of a bot or deciding not to post noitces), I'd like to return to only one AID as having two aids is splitting of attention and is not good. --<a href="../../../d/i/j/User%7EDijxtra_582d.html" title="User:Dijxtra">Dijxtra</a> 19:24, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Same here, the pasting alone takes up too much time and effort, plus, as I mentioned before, it isn't much use. After all, if the person that voted for the AID is active, they will check the AID sooner or later. Otherwise, its wasted effort. It wastes a valueable 10-20 min that can be spent on another part of wikipedia. As well, there is something that just isn't attracting people to participate anymore. There is no longer that push that had driven the AID for so long. Reducing the AID back to 1 article a day would be a good first step back to gaining attention. As well, I noticed that the AID section is further down on the community portal page.... could that be a cause too? It takes a while to find. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 00:39, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>2 articles/week was an innocent opinion but unfortunately it didn't work at least for last AID. Maybe we can try for one more week, but my vote is "return to one" for now.

<li>Okay, that's taken care of. All things considered, you may be right. Nobody is editing these things.

<p>Last weeks collaborations don't work nearly no edits (less then 50).

<dd>Except that often the articles a person most wants to see improved are those that they currently know nothing about. The purpose of Wikipedia is to educate, after all. Frequently I want to know more about a topic but am disappointed to find the page in poor shape. Am I then not allowed to request the help of someone more qualified to expand and enhance it? That doesn't seem sensible at all.

<p>Here is something that I mentioned earlier. If you take a look at the community portal, the AID section is placed all the way at the bottom of the page, and unlike before, there is no longer a picture there.

<p>Perhaps a rule that articles may only be reelected after three months from their last nomination. This way, articles can get a second chance of being worked on (by possibly a different set of people), and there won't be the same articles every week (and therefore room for more articles in the AID). <a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><i><b>(^'-')^</b></i></a> <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovington_6d97.html" title="User:Covington">Covington</a> 04:38, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I like the 'incumbent' idea better. My suggestion: if an article gets five additional votes in its week as AID, it can be the article for another week. If it gets ten additional votes during that week, it can go on to the week after that. Then 20, 40, 80, etc. That way an article could get renewed once or twice if people really liked it, but there would be no chance of it becoming a permanent autocrat. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 12:15, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I would say, instead of 5 additional votes, candidate should have 8 additional vote at the time of current AID. We should limit the number of votes for a particular user at a time.

<p>Good ideas; I volunteer to split the difference. How about, after six months, an article can be renominated with eight (or whatever number you like) votes, to automatically overtake the leader. If there are more than one renoms, the one with the highest amount of support wins. As for the limit-three-votes idea, I think that should be a totally different vote. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 23:29, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I see. You mean it would say something like "This previous winner had X votes," and any additional votes for its re-nom would count toward its overall scoring.

<dd>Is there really THAT much of a problem with it? I agree that the number of votes is no longer in the header, but it does look a bit more organised then the big bolded date.

You shouldn't vote based on how many votes the canditate has, but rather, whether or not you're interested in the topic and willing to improve it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cleaning up AID</span></h2>
<p>I know this is an enormous idea, and might end up killing the AID instead of doing any good, but hear me out first. Currently (with the exception of Belgrade), some of the articles nominated become chosen 2-3 months after the nomination. By then, people that have signed their names might have already done what they can to improve the article, meaning there are less things to do on the articles. Its not likely someone would wait for 3 months before editing the article. In this sense, there are less people actually editing an article when its actually chosen for AID. My thought would be to stop accepting new nominations for a period of time, let the current nomination number drop back to a reasonable number, then restart AID again. And this time, maybe restrict the voting process, so that a nomination does not take 3 months to become chosen.--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 00:52, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

That should eliminate candidates much more quickly. <b><a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacoplane_198a.html" title="User:Jacoplane"><font color="#AE1C28">jaco</font></a><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacoplane_6d73.html" title="User talk:Jacoplane"><font color="#21468B">plane</font></a></b> 00:56, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, that would help clean up the nomination list.

<li><i>Strong oppose</i> to temporarily raising the limit to 5 votes just because there are a lot of articles on the page at the moment (which will change quickly as a large number of them don't get 4 votes every week and fall off the list). This sounds like something that would be specifically done only by users who aren't interested in any of the current nominees, to hurry them off the page so a "blank slate" can be started. If you want a blank slate, start a new project, don't toss into the garbage the hard work and interest so many users have invested into the current nominees for weeks and weeks and weeks. However, I agree that the lengthy delay between nomination and becoming the AID article is a problem. We should probably find a way to encourage users to edit these articles when they're still nominees if they're interested in them, rather than waiting forever to see if they're successful or not. Too many good topics receive little or no attention in the entire time they appear on the page; if we made it clear that interested users are strongly encouraged to edit <i>any</i> article on the page that's received a lot of votes, not just ones that are currently the AID of the week, it could potentially make the whole process a lot more useful, without all the waste and inconsistency that would be caused by arbitrarily raising the voting requirement. If <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egypt_c49a.html" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recycling.html" title="Recycling">Recycling</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">Mathematics</a> don't each get their long-deserved week in the AID at some point, it'll be tragic. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 03:36, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I meant to say, we can have fresh policy for newly nominated articles which should have 5 votes per week to retain on the page. In addition to that, all the articles are already nominated we can make a fresh policy which may be effective from e.g. <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_19.html" title="May 19">19 May</a> to have 5 votes per week to retain on the project page. <a href="../../../u/r/s/User%7EUrshyam_d8c5.html" title="User:Urshyam"><font color="black"><b>Shyam</b></font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/s/User_talk%7EUrshyam_3871.html" title="User talk:Urshyam"><font color="orange"><b>T</b></font></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Urshyam_5801.html" title="Special:Contributions/Urshyam"><font color="red"><b>C</b></font></a>)</sup> 21:19, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Like I said, such a change would be both unnecessary and destructive. The only articles that could possibly survive in such an environment are ultra-mainstream ones like <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> and the rare nationalistic fervor-inspired one like <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgrade.html" title="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>; the vast majority of other highly worthy articles, which would have gotten a chance to be AIDed otherwise, will randomly happen to get 4 votes instead of 5 some weeks and be immediately eliminated. Terrible idea. Moreover, new nominations tend to take a week or two at least to build up some support, and midway-supported articles tend to go through a small "dry spell" because they're surrounded on both sides by the rest of the nominees; those are survivable at 4 votes, but often won't be at 5, for articles that deserve, and would otherwise have gotten, AID support. If there are <i>4 separate users</i>, 4 separate talented, involved, dedicated Wikipedia editors supporting the article in question, for every week the article's been on the list, that's vastly <i>more</i> than enough than should be necessary to give the article another few days on the list! -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 06:30, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This argument could be, and was used when we voted on whether or not to raise the threshold to 4 votes a week. The only problem it would cause if we raise it to five at the current moment would be that a massive number of nominations would be taken down. However, may I remind you that that is the purpose of raising the bar. Otherwise we have way too many nominations. However, once the number has settled down again, things will go back to normal. We might end up having only 5-6 nominations going past the first week, yes, but that also means one of those 5 or six will almost definitly be choosen for AID in the coming week. That means the nomination to AID is only 1-2 weeks of wait, better then a 2 month wait we are currently experiencing. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 14:03, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree to this. However, I strongly oppose the idea of 2 articles per week, we tried that idea, and it failed miserably. As for Silence's comment, this project is a Improvement drive, not a page for people to put up their articles for 2 monthes and we'll fix it up kind of thing. They have projects like that already. The point is, most articles are on the nomination list for WAY TOO LONG. If we don't raise the bar, the list will just keep on getting longer unless we imply a limitation. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 16:00, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There is a template that people put on the talk pages of articles while they're being considered for AID.

<li>We do not allow IP users to vote due to the fact that we have no way of making sure one user doesn't vote on one nomination multiple times. However, currently, we have nothing down in writing about newbie users. This allow people to create multiple accounts for the purpose of voting on one nomination multiple times, giving that nomination an unfair advantage. In my opinion, we should require users to have at least 1 contribution on another part of Wikipedia before they are allowed to vote in the AID. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 21:25, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>One of the first places I found on Wikipedia was the AID, and I was attracted to it because I didn't have to edit an article itself; I had everyone else who voted on it to help me.

<li>Good point. I'm sure that we can have a template to show a link to the vote count like the user2 template, but this one would have a datestamp. And maybe we can have a bot scan the users?

<ul>
<li>I was actually thinking about this myself the other day. Signing up on Wikipedia is quick and easy, way too quick and easy for those that want to simply manipulate votes. If a user that has previously not paid any attention to an article votes, then their contributions should be checked to make sure they are not simply boosting numbers. <b><a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkblue">Noble</font><font color="darkorange">eagle</font></a></b> <a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobleeagle_accc.html" title="User talk:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred"><font size="0.5">(Talk)</font></font></a> 03:17, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I support in principle, but I also think we can handle this on a case by case basis. <b>IF</b> an article gets a lot of votes by users with few contributions we can take action, if necessary. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarSch_3340.html" title="User:MarSch">MarSch</a> 08:55, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see the rationale for the proposal -- but I'm uncertain whether I support its current parameters. Perhaps we should treat a registered user who has submitted several votes, especially over time, but who has not made other contributions, differently from a registered user who has only submitted a single vote. (I feel that the one-vote user is more likely a fake account than the multiple-vote user -- though I wouldn't be surprised if someone provides evidence to refute this view.) Also, should we count a comment as a contribution other than voting, so that a single-vote user that submits a comment would not be subject to deletion of the vote? --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottwiki_b826.html" title="User:Scottwiki">Scottwiki</a> 14:17, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure about the idea that they have a contribution in a comment, I have no strong opinions about that. However, here is the thing. What if the a person was too lazy to create a new account for every single vote he or she wants to double? Wouldn't they just make one account and use that? Besides, because they had no other contributions to the Wiki in the first place, they should not have been allowed to vote that first vote either ways, right? --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 14:29, 17 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We can fix a ratio (e.g. 15-20) between contribution to main space/wiki space (not associated with any kind of nomination vote) and voting for article improvement drive. But it would create an extra work for maintenance contributor. I am unable to seek any other feasible maintenace work, if you have some other sugestions for fixing a criteria, please suggest. <a href="../../../u/r/s/User%7EUrshyam_d8c5.html" title="User:Urshyam"><font color="black"><b>Shyam</b></font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/s/User_talk%7EUrshyam_3871.html" title="User talk:Urshyam"><font color="orange"><b>T</b></font></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Urshyam_5801.html" title="Special:Contributions/Urshyam"><font color="red"><b>C</b></font></a>)</sup> 19:17, 17 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Does it have to be this complicated though? I mean, couldn't we just say, anyone that has less then __ contributions, may not vote? (Setting it at 3 contributions seems to be a reasonable amount, since we have to keep in mind of the newbies.) --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 20:32, 17 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, it is little bit complicate. But according to your suggestions, after only 3 or such contributions an user is free to vote for AID as many times (s)he wants. We want to fix a criteria for avoiding such condition. An user can create one or more additional accounts in advance and when (s)he can vote accordingly when the user feels to vote. If we fix this type of criteria, what I mentioned earlier (s)he has to contribute before polling here. I think 3 is very less number for it. An user has to have little bit knowledge about editing articles here. We can fix the ratio equal to 10 which has total contribution in numerator. <a href="../../../u/r/s/User%7EUrshyam_d8c5.html" title="User:Urshyam"><font color="black"><b>Shyam</b></font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/s/User_talk%7EUrshyam_3871.html" title="User talk:Urshyam"><font color="orange"><b>T</b></font></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Urshyam_5801.html" title="Special:Contributions/Urshyam"><font color="red"><b>C</b></font></a>)</sup> 20:52, 17 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What you are saying is very detailed, however, if you say that for every vote a user puts forth, they must contribute to ten things. This means, one must then have at least 1000 edits under the belt before that person can vote 100 times. At the current number of nominations that gets churned up each week, 100 votes can easily be made withing 2-3 months, forcing the user to make an astounding number of contributions. As well, I believe that this discussion has completely veered off topic, in the sense that this vote is for a general agreement on whether there is such thing as an unqualified registered user. Should the detail of the qualification be on the judgment of whoever is maintaining the project that that time? Remembering that when a user is removed from a vote, he or she is placed under the <b>Removed Votes</b> section, and so if there is a disagreement for that paticular case, then people argue about it at that point in time, for this is more of a case by case problem. Certain users might make a big edit, while another user might make 10 small edits to achieve the same result.

<li>I am in agreement with Steven. Shyam, I am appreciating that you are looking at this from different angles, however, I do not believe that placing very strict requirements on who can vote is a good idea.</li>

<dd>1) Yes I am biased against this; according to this rule, I'm not even eligible to vote more than three times. But bias aside, having a very strict vote requirements means that less people will be able to participate in the AiD.</dd>
<dd>2) As a <s>n00b</s> beginner Wikipedian (I just completed my first month here.), I was drawn to the AID because it gave me a chance to improve an article without having it to do it all alone; I had the other thirty voters to help me do that. I know I might be in the minority, but on the contrary I believe that the AID should be one of the first places a new Wikipedian should visit; they do not necessarily have to vote (and I suggest that they don't until they make two or three edits first), but they should have this opportunity to familiarize themselves with Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>3) Some Wikipedians are more "readers" than "editors"; they use the Wikipedia too, and they should have a say on which articles they want improved.</dd>
<dd>4) We don't want to make it seem that the AID is controlled only by the Wikipedian "elite".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In short, while the voting requirements are a good idea, we should stick with votecounts between, say 3-10. This would let new users contribute, and if sockpuppets want to vote, they'll look suspicious anyway once we look at their contribs. If any of us feels suspicious about an individual user, we can deal with it on a case-by-case basis. <a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><i><b>(^'-')^</b></i></a> <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovington_6d97.html" title="User:Covington">Covington</a> 23:56, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>After mulling over this discussion, I believe that the rule should be something like: "A registered user may submit his or her initial vote on the Article Improvement Drive only if (1) the user has made at least one edit/post on Wikipedia other than voting or (2) the user submits a comment in conjunction with the vote." This would be a clear rule (without any need to resort to vote counts or ratios), which would allow new users to submit votes, but only if they do something other than mere voting. Accordingly, I oppose the proposal as currently written.--<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottwiki_b826.html" title="User:Scottwiki">Scottwiki</a> 23:06, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wait, aren't you supporting my vote then? You say that the person voting must have a contribution of a comment (hence a contribution) OR another contribution to any other part of Wikipedia aside from voting. Is that not what my vote is saying? --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 20:34, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Why the "Er..."? ("Er..." seems to imply that I have missed something quite obvious, which I believe I didn't. Or does "Er..." mean something else? You used it earlier, apparently towards yourself, so perhaps I don't understand what you mean.) I suggested new wording at the start of this thread: "A registered user may submit his or her initial vote on the Article Improvement Drive only if (1) the user has made at least one edit/post on Wikipedia other than voting or (2) the user submits a comment in conjunction with the vote." I'd be happy to hear constructive suggestions about it. I'd also be happy to make it the subject of Vote #8, if Vote #7 is ultimately inconclusive. -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottwiki_b826.html" title="User:Scottwiki">Scottwiki</a> 02:11, 19 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Here is why I used "er...". I believe that the two proposals say the exact same thing except for one small part. What my current proposal states is it anyone with only <b>votes</b> as contributions should not be allowed to vote. What your proposal states is that anyone with any other kinds of contributions, including a vote with a comment is allowed to vote. However, your proposal stills agrees with my proposal that anyone with <b>no other contributions besides votes</b> should not be allowed to vote. Remember that the details are not discussed in this vote, for its more of a case-by-case basis. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 20:28, 19 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I believe that the current proposal is not clear, while my suggested wording is clear. I don't think that the rule should be interpreted on a case-by-case basis. I think, rather, the rule should draw a clear line between who may vote and who may not. Therefore, I do not support the current proposal, unless the proposal as implemented on the project page includes wording that is substantively the same as my suggestion. -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottwiki_b826.html" title="User:Scottwiki">Scottwiki</a> 06:16, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Very well, how about if I reword the proposal to the following: <i>A registered user may submit his or her vote only after making a contribution on another part of Wikipedia. <b>However</b>, this contribution may not be for the purpose of voting.</i>--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireswordfight_62ed.html" title="User:Fireswordfight">Steven</a> 21:21, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

At this point, the only voter qualification is to be "a registered user." Moreover, since some newbies gravitate immediately to AID, I don't think we can simply presume that a new account is a sock puppet. Accordingly, I recommend that we restore the votes by registered users that have been removed. -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottwiki_b826.html" title="User:Scottwiki">Scottwiki</a> 09:34, 20 April 2006 (UTC)
