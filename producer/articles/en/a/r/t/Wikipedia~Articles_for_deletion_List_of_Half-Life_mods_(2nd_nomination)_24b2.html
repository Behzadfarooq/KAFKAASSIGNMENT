<dd>Wikipedia is neither a directory (which this seems to be), a repository of links (which this is) nor an indiscriminate collection of information. Yes, this list isn't indiscriminate but it makes Wikipedia seem that way. This is the kind of thing better suited to specialised websites. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMER-C_4926.html" title="User:MER-C">MER-C</a> 12:39, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Pardon me if this seems like lawyering, but one article being a directory&#160;!= Wikipedia being a directory. And the WP definition of directory is a phone book, Internet guide, plot summary, or cookbook. This is neither. Lists aren't uncommon in WikiPedia. If Keep nom fails, though (and I don't think it will, based on the quality of the arguments I have seen - in this case, I'm judging by consensus, not straw poll), allow article time to be <b>gamiafied</b> to Encyclopedia Gamia. The information is notable.--<a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWaltCip_235e.html" title="User:WaltCip">WaltCip</a> 13:21, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep or categorise</b> The fact that the article already has references and external links already proves that the article has some sort of notability. Let me also bring up the fact that <a href="../../../g/a/m/WP%7EGAMES_2f8a.html" title="WP:GAMES">WP:GAMES</a> states that notability can be achieved if a game or the like has been reviewed by non-trivial published works; that's good enough for me. Unfortunately, I see no reason to AFD here, other than people saying, in short, "because it's crufty", which is a vio of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. That being said, blocking out people from saying "Keep, I've played them" knocks out a large portion of people who intend to vote in this debate, since those who have played the mods know the full degree of their notability. You could easily domino-effect to games in general, which I certainly hope you are not implying. The article is fit for print, according to the policies and the reasons through which I have cited. In fact, in the previous AFD, <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> was close at hand, so this whole DRV and repeat AFD hubbub shouldn't even exist.--<a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWaltCip_235e.html" title="User:WaltCip">WaltCip</a> 03:47, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> "Keep, I've played the game" is not based on policy either, so if a user intends to argue based on that, their argument (because AfD is not a vote) is invalid.

<li>Well, no one has used that argument yet, but by denying people that argument, you're effectively suppressing them regardless. And AFDs have been decided on non-policy arguments before as well. See the Esperanza or the humor articles. Actually, I wouldn't mind a few of you chaps deleting those silly articles after this AFD is over.--<a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWaltCip_235e.html" title="User:WaltCip">WaltCip</a> 23:01, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We haven't "suppressed" them. We can't prevent them for using whatever reason they feel like, it'll just get discounted because it's not policy. Esperanza/humour pages are different because they're not in article space, thus not subject to article policies (they're not even decided in AfD, they're decided in MfD). <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 15:37, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Two basic issues at hand here- do the individual mods pass our policies? If so, should we have a list of them in addition to a category? Most, if not all, of the mods listed in these articles have received independent coverage in gaming magazines/websites. So... should we have a list of them? Lists are much more useful than categories, especially in the case of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Half-Life_2_mods_bcbc.html" title="List of Half-Life 2 mods">List of Half-Life 2 mods</a>. This article does a pretty good job of differentiating between them all.

<li><b>keep</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is really nothing other than a list of external links, i.e. a web directory. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. If this were considered encyclopedic, then lists of links to popular <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> videos can't be far behind.

<li><b>Keep</b>. These articles are of a good quality (hey, I've seen a lot worse) and they're not just lists, they've had work put into them, there's images and an infobox and all the formatting is correct. All of the information in the articles is verifiable. The reason I bring up the amount of work put into it is that that means people <i>do</i> pay attention to it and so the wiki process will improve the articles over time. As the two users above me have stated, a list is not redundant to a category because articles allow for more content than lists, (explanations of individual mods, pictures, not just a list of articles). If I'm not mistaken it is possible for things to be notable enough to mention them somewhere in Wikipedia but not notable enough to have their own article so lists contain more information. They're not really lists <i>per se</i>, so maybe editors ought to consider making them more like just "Half-Life mods" and "Half-Life 2 mods" and then of course have the whole "history of modmaking" and all the rest of it (with reliable sources cited of course). Oh and there should be a brief mention of what ModDB is and how "authoritative" (for want of a better word) it is, it's referred to for a lot of them.--<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiSlasher_63a7.html" title="User:WikiSlasher">WikiSlasher</a> 09:52, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> These articles have good encyclopedic content and actually serve an important function for gamers. Also, these lists are certainly not "lists of indiscriminate information," as they have incredibly clear parameters and are not/could never be infinite. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 14:34, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I feel that the mod community involved with these games is strong enough to generate enough verifiable info in order to list articles on individual mods. In turn, a list like this can be useful for skimming and acquiring info on each mod.</li>
<li><i>However</i>, both lists should only contain mods with articles on WP - if it can't stand on its own two feet it shouldn't be crawling around on this list. There seems little point trying to maintain an incomplete list (even in terms of not containing every HL mod listed on WP) if the articles contained on that list aren't properly referenced and could be AFD'd at any time. I'd ask contributors interested in these articles to make sure their efforts are aimed at improving the articles already on WP and ensuring they remain.</li>
<li>As a side note, having websites listed after each mod name is irritating to read and smacks of advertising - they should be in the mod's article as an external link. Also, there are several mods with articles on WP which are not listed here. Hooking up articles to this list and any categories that exist will be of use to readers and encourage contributors to follow the path and improve articles/update the list - that's what it's all about. There's an opportunity here. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 16:03, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In fairness, having looked again, there are links provided next to most if not all of the mods, there has been some good work done here.

<li><b>Keep</b> per above. Also, I don't see why calling something "useful" as a reason for keeping should be discounted. Whether an article is useful to have on Wikipedia or not should in fact be at the heart of each AfD debate. Now, it is fair to ask for someone using that reasoning to expand on that, but a comment saying that shouldn't be outright disregarded. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 07:58, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <s>The purpose of a list of Half-Life mods is mainly just that, having a list. The partitioning into categories makes sense but it shouldn't be used as a reason to keep a list.</s> A reason to keep a list would be that it offers significantly more information than a mere category (such as the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Category%7EHalf-Life_mods_4fe9.html" title="Category:Half-Life mods">Category:Half-Life mods</a>) does. I don't think that a link to the article, description and optional award is sufficient to justify a list. Perhaps it should contain the same information which is given in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_webcomics.html" title="List of webcomics">List of webcomics</a>: Name/link to article, author, date of first public (playable) release, date of last update, and ... the link to the website. This last piece of information is arguable because WP is not a repository of links, however it's also in the web comic list, so why not here? --<a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizzahut2_8d0a.html" title="User:Pizzahut2">Pizzahut2</a> 11:26, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>One <b>strong delete</b> doesn't match several <b>keeps</b>, I'm afraid.

<li><b>Keep</b> IF it can be restored to its former usefulness - the current edit is totally useless and ought to be deleted. Single-player mods are the 'red-headed stepchildren' of the gaming world and this article was the _only_ place where one could get a feel for the status of the community (can't do that now, of course. Looks like the thing was edited by a very non-npov person from the 'single-player mods suck!' school of thought.) Also, to the idea that a non-released mod is, by definition, non-notable, ah...hogwash. I'd to like to hear the argument that the Black Mesa mod is non-notable; that project has Valve's direct blessing, for one thing.</li>
