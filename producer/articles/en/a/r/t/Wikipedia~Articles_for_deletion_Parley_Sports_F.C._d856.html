<li>Actually, it very much does. Provenances of sources is important. If the sources of the information were <i>independent</i> of the club, and were in-depth articles about the club published in magazines, newspapers, books, or suchlike, then they <i>would</i> count towards notability. See the <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">primary notability criterion</a> in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>.

<ul>
<li>Bad choice of wording on my part there I think, Uncle G. I took the choice of the word "supply" to mean that the anonymous user was suggesting that the article should stay solely because it (the article) had been created by someone who is a member of the club, that's what I was suggesting isn't sufficient to justify it being kept.....I think..... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 11:33, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Possibly not the best place to do so, but initially I wanted to raise the suggestion that we be more flexible when proposing club articles for deletion. If there is an article on a club, even sub level 10, but which already contains a significant amount of information within it, including links to other wiki articles, our focus should be on reasons to <i>keep</i> the article not why to deleted it. The <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> policy says a club is notable if <i>"The club... has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the club... itself"'</i>, so if one can find a multiple of mentions of the club on articles from independant websites, then the article should be retained.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In this instance, however, the article is not that detailed. I can find little mention of the club other than in football databases and similar online encyclopedic sites. Furthermore, I cannot find the club itself's website - I have found the club's youth football website <a href="http://www.parleysportsrangers.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.parleysportsrangers.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Parley Sports Rangers</a>, which contains no link to a senior club - which raises the question whether there is a senior team? Added to the confusion about a possible notable past player (see here) and all in all I am inclined to vote to <b>delete</b> this article. --&#160;<b><a href="../../../m/l/d/MLD_b5b6.html" title="MLD">MLD</a></b>&#160;<small><b>·</b>&#160;<a href="../../../m/l/d/User_talk%7EMLD_aa63.html" title="User talk:MLD">T</a>&#160;<b>·</b>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MLD_8977.html" title="Special:Contributions/MLD">C</a>&#160;<b>·</b></small>&#160;<font face="Courier">@:</font>&#160; 13:44, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>you lot are like a bunch of old women god whats the big problem&#160;? I made an article about Parley Sports F.C and none of you can say that it's has proof of notability, why dont you contact the Dorset F.A or even the Dorset Premier League for Parley Sports history, the information i added was taken from the Bournemouth Daily Echo can't you phone them to confirm notability. And also I no we are not a top level 10 club but we used to be as you will see in are history we resigned from that League in 2000. <b>Check Are Hits Out On Google</b> for a small village team that used to play in the 'Dorset Premier League' thats pretty good, and as your see the first search result to be found is <b>Parley Sports FC - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</b>. So that means most people will use WIKIPEDIA to search history about it. And you want to 'Delete IT' you want to take a look at other pages that are just as bad as are's with nothing on them at all. You look throught the 'Dorset Premier League' pages of teams for this season and see how many have history about them selfs, not many i'll thing your find!<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.29.92.124 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.29.92.124_8519.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.29.92.124">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, the google evidence works AGAINST your arguement. In order to be valid subject matter for a Wikipedia article, then the subject needs to have notability outside of Wikipedia. Wikipedia is NOT a means to gain notability; it only documents subjects that have notability verified by reliable third party sources. If a WikiPedia article turns up as the first hit on Google, it is usually a red flag that the WikiPedia article (and NOT an outside source as required by the WikiPedia policy against <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>) is the only major place to find this information. As such, it should be deleted. If you have evidence to the contrary, then IMPROVE THE ARTICLE. <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">Calling experienced editors names</a> or complaining that the club should be kept without providing hard facts will not work in your favor. Also, proof of existance is NOT proof of notability. The fact that a single local newspaper wrote about them does not mean that anyone outside of the immediate area has even heard of this club. If they have, then PROVIDE REFERENCES to show that the club is widely known and regarded outside of the immediate Bournmouth/Dorset area. If there is no such evidence, the article is not notable. Even if they were the best level-15 club, that makes them like the 500th best club in England. Again, my Church softball team is pretty good. But it's not the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> or even the <a href="../../../t/o/l/Toledo_Mud_Hens_7294.html" title="Toledo Mud Hens">Toledo Mud Hens</a>. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 20:14, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> unless I'm very much mistaken it's the responsibility of the creator of the article to demonstrate the notability of the subject, editors participating in an AfD debate shouldn't need to start phoning up local newspapers to find these things out.... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 10:48, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's the responsibility of people to substantiate their assertions with cited sources.

<li>"If article X then article Y." is a fallacious argument. Each subject should be assessed on its merits. The best approach, I suggest, is to go through each article and research the subject. Find out what sources exist. If you find good sources, add them to the article (as references or as further reading) in order to improve it and in order to let other editors build upon your work. If you cannot find enough material of suitable provenance and depth to satisfy the notability criteria, <i>then</i> think about deletion. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:15, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorset_Premier_Football_League_0154.html" title="Dorset Premier Football League">Dorset Premier Football League</a> used to be one level below the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wessex_League_68c7.html" title="Wessex League">Wessex League</a> back when the latter was only one division. When the Wessex League essentially absorbed the Hampshire League, the DPL was placed below the 2nd level of the WL, at the same level as Wessex Div 3 (now called Div 2). That's why the DPL clubs have articles, along with a number of other level 11 leagues: <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sussex_County_League_eadd.html" title="Sussex County League">Sussex County League</a> Div 3, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Western_League_5b24.html" title="South Western League">South Western League</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devon_County_League_c73f.html" title="Devon County League">Devon County League</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Midlands_League_75d1.html" title="Central Midlands League">Central Midlands League</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spartan_South_Midlands_Football_League_94f5.html" title="Spartan South Midlands Football League">Spartan South Midlands Football League</a> Div 2. These leagues are among the strongest at level 11 (indeed, the CML has applied for level 10 status and the SWL and DCL are merging to form a level 10 league next season). Club pages in a garbage level 11 league like the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northampton_Town_League_e5c2.html" title="Northampton Town League">Northampton Town League</a> are questionable, but club pages in the previously mentioned leagues I think should stay because these leagues consistently supply promotion candidates and <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Vase_c23f.html" title="FA Vase">FA Vase</a> entrants. --<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalerion_82c4.html" title="User:Balerion">Balerion</a> 01:44, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Addition</b> - It's worth noting that Parley Sports played in the DPL for <a href="http://www.fchd.info/PARLEYSP.HTM" class="external text" title="http://www.fchd.info/PARLEYSP.HTM" rel="nofollow">four decades</a>, but have more recently run into hard times necessitating a move down to more regional leagues. The larger issue is how we deal with clubs who drop from what's considered a notable level to a non-notable level. This issue was tested in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Wareham_Rangers_F.C._e8cd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wareham Rangers F.C.">this mass AfD</a>, but in the confusion of the case-by-case basis of each club, nothing was fully discussed. --<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalerion_82c4.html" title="User:Balerion">Balerion</a> 01:54, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> It's also the problem that nearly every football club in England is under the auspices of a single governing body. This includes over 700 teams within the top 11 levels of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_football_league_system.html" title="English football league system">English football league system</a> alone. Levels 12+ include (i did an approximate count) 450 leagues. Assuming, even conservatively, 15 teams per league, that results in 6750 teams in these divisions, meaning we have well in excess of 7500 teams, probably closer to 8000 teams. That doesn't even count Sunday leagues. SOME standard has to be applied. By analogy, the U.S. has a rather extensive Baseball structure running under the auspices of <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_League_Baseball_a0e6.html" title="Minor League Baseball">Minor League Baseball</a>. There are also thousands of smaller amateur and semi-pro leagues. Counting ONLY Major and Minor leagues (down to rookie leagues), and including equivalent independant leagues, there are about 400 teams. Assuming that as a reasonable number of potentially notable teams, that matches well to levels 10+ in the football league system. It is unreasonable that the 700th best football team in England recieves notable press coverage beyond, say, a mere note of game scores in a local paper. This team USED TO be as good as the 700th best team. Its currently about the 3000th best team. That <i>can't</i> be notable. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 04:37, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not necessarily advocating a keep, but there will be tougher calls than Parsley Sports in the future - clubs who spend a number of years at level 9, but then drop to level 13...what do you do then? (see: <a href="../../../t/u/f/Tuffley_Rovers_F.C._3e8b.html" title="Tuffley Rovers F.C.">Tuffley Rovers</a>, which was kept) I'm not the biggest fan of the baseball analogy because the US sports structure, legally, practically, and culturally, especially in baseball is completely different from England's. Minor league teams are essentially independently-owned reserve/youth teams and outside the minor league structure, there is no smooth decline in talent like there is from the Football League to the Conference, for example. --<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalerion_82c4.html" title="User:Balerion">Balerion</a> 06:58, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The History i added about the club should'nt be delete i mean its good for a club of that size to have that amount of history, not many clubs have any thing as big as that on Wikipedia and i thing they should be the pages you should be looking at for DELETION.

<li><b>Reply</b> This is in response to the writings of LUIGI909 and 86.29.94.218(anon) above. NO ONE doubts that this football club exists. NO ONE is denying it, or other facts, such as where they play, what league they are in, what their history is, etc. etc. The question is whether such facts warrant that the club is notable. Word of mouth contacts with people involved in the organization, or with local newspapers, or anything else, does NOT establish notability. Please read <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WIkipedia's guidelines on notability</a> BEFORE you comment on this article. The primary notability criterion is: Does this subject receive 1)<b>significant coverage</b> in 2) <b>several</b> 3) <b>non-trivial sources</b> as 4) <b>a primary focus</b> of the writing. So far, this subject fails on all grounds. We have no evidence of coverage beyond a single newspaper, and no evidence that the coverage is more than scores and results of games. Passing mention in a sports section does not qualify. Do we have articles that review their performance? Have books been written on their history? Are they the subject of ANY critical analysis? If they are, then PROVIDE THE SOURCES. Simply saying "I think the local paper wrote an article on them a few years ago" isn't good enough. Provide book titles and authors, website URLs, newspaper dates and by-lines; give us something to work with. If the ONLY way we can get more information about the subject is to call someone, then they aren't notable. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 19:36, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
