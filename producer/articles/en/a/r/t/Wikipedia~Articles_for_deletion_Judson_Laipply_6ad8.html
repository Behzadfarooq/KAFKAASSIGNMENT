<p>Not sure, but nothing is cited here.

Though there is a lot of claimed coverage, it isn't cited nor can I find it in a search (though my browser has been acting up ever since the last update so this may be the cause). I am going to stay neutral on this but let people decide in AfD if it should stay or go. <a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 02:35, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> with clean-up. His act has been seen by millions of people over the internet, therefore he passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (<i>A large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following</i>). The first citation on the page is from the guy's own site and the second is broken (no longer links to the specific newspaper article), so some of the facts on the page need to be cited.<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindyLooWho_85d4.html" title="User:CindyLooWho">CindyLooWho</a> 03:31, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> You took that out of context to fit your arguement. If you read it IN CONTEXT then it says <i><b>Notable actors and television personalities</b> who have appeared in <b>well-known films or television productions</b>. Notability can be determined by: A large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following</i> . This only applies to movie and TV stars...not internet celebs. Nothing is cited on this page and per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> 'multiple' sources are needed...not one. So your arguement basically is just <i>keep</i> with nothing supporting it.--<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 04:03, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> <b>1.</b> As someone who seems to be "up" on Wikipedia rules, you should know better than to make an edit (even a small one) to someone else's comments in a discussion thread. I'm sure you wouldn't appreciate it if I started doing it to your comments. Please don't do it to mine. If you think I took something out of context, then YOU can put it into context entirely in YOUR comment. <b>2.</b> I agree that I took criteria from "notable actors and television personalities" <i>because</i> there is no criteria for internet video personalities and yes, I could have made that clearer. <b>3.</b> The subject still passes the alternative <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> "Google Test" (gets lots of distinguishable hits on Google or another well known search mechanism) by a country mile - 65,800 hits on Google for "Judson Laipply" and 634,000 for "Evolution of Dance". That alone gets <i>my</i> <b>keep</b> vote. <b>4.</b> I've already agreed that independent citations are needed for a couple statements made on the page. I've fixed some and requested one more. I'm sure it can be found. If not, it only means the deletion of one sentence - not the entire page. In my personal opinion, there is <i>no way</i> this page should be deleted.<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindyLooWho_85d4.html" title="User:CindyLooWho">CindyLooWho</a> 05:51, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I almost never use this phrase, but his "Evolution of Dance" video is a <i>notable Internet meme</i>. I'll check the citations on the page to make sure there is support for its media coverage. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:48, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I have to agree with <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a>. Numerous sources of citation are online and simply need to be added to the article; the video is indeed a notable meme as well (and he wasn't just on YouTube - he had the #1 viewed video on YouTube. Well, that is, according to him). --<a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitterro_78d4.html" title="User:Jitterro">Jitterro</a> 05:12, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Now that we have some citations of coverage, I'm thinking this would pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Seems notable, sourced and cited. Although I haven't personally verified, it seems verifiable. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 06:57, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Multiple, verifiable, non-trival sources. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatchpole_52c3.html" title="User:Catchpole">Catchpole</a> 07:16, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless the popularity of <i>Evolution of Dance</i> can be verified from somewhere <i>other than Laipply's own website</i>. That seems to be the only claim to notability here. <a href="../../../j/c/s/User%7EJCScaliger_7ada.html" title="User:JCScaliger">JCScaliger</a> 20:50, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>His video can be seen on <i>multiple</i> independent sites. Among others, YouTube.com has no ties to Laipply - and they have had over 31 million downloads of his video (this number is seen on YouTube's "Evolution of Dance" download page). This fact <i>is</i> already cited on the Wiki page. Quite frankly, I think this a real no-brainer keep. Tens of millions of people know who this guy is (although granted most probably don't know his actual name). That's <i>plenty</i> to warrant a Wikipedia biography. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindyLooWho_85d4.html" title="User:CindyLooWho">CindyLooWho</a> 23:37, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then the article should <i>say</i> so, and not mention his website at all. This might have avoided the AfD altogether. <a href="../../../j/c/s/User%7EJCScaliger_7ada.html" title="User:JCScaliger">JCScaliger</a> 14:37, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Cindy, I need to point out this to you: Popularity on YouTube means nothing for notablility here at Wikipedia. The video could have 3 views or 3 billion...it doesn't matter. YouTube does not count as a 'source'. The only sources that are accepted are the media articles (magazines, books, newspaper articles, and tv reports). I just wanted to make that clear. I have seen 9 (nine) videos from YouTube (which all appeared on the most watched of all time list) removed because they did not have any reliable sources (YouTube and blogs don't count). --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 04:41, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The article <b>already includes citations</b> of articles from the Boston Globe and the Sydney Morning Herald (the latter is actually an Associated Press article which appeared in multiple newspapers), both of which support the number of views being in the multi-millions. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 07:35, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but clean up - he's notable, the fact the YouTube website says he's had 31 million views should surely be enough to keep him. However, the page does need cleaning up. Shouldn't Wikipedia be about giving people information on stuff that's notable? This guy seems notable enough to me. --<a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyron1_1a14.html" title="User:Tyron1">Tyron1</a> 14:03, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - interesting personality <a href="../../../d/o/x/User%7EDoxent_a17d.html" title="User:Doxent">Doxent</a> 12:25, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> -- And why is it that we seem to have go through this process for each and every person from Youtube? Can't we agree that after 4-6 keep votes on other Youtube folk that we can just agree to keep them until proven otherwise? I know we don't want articles about anybody and everybody. But we have people attacking the most famous Youtube people over and over. I think we should pick some criteria to use for this... be it number of video views, number of videos, google hits, or some combination of these and other things. But going through this whole process each and everytime is getting to be incredibly time consuming and dare I say <b>stupid</b>. I'm also getting more and more PO'ed at folks who ask for citations from various media sources, which they are then given. They then act like they were never told of them and say there are none over and over, as if "The big lie" is part of their AfD strategy. It may work in real-world politics folks, but I'm getting sick and tried it on Wiki. Dave 06:26, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
