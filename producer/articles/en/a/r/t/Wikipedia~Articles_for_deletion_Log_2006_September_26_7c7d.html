<li>There is no <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy deletion</a> criterion that covers out-and-out fabrication, no matter how blatant. If I write an article saying that "Alfred E. Neuman was the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1956 and is widely considered the greatest thinker of the 20th Century"; it can't be speedied because (a) it isn't patent nonsense and (b) it asserts notability.

<p><b>Query</b> Wikipedia may not be a directory of spyware, per se, but it is a directory of information entries. The reason articles do not exist on Google, relating to this software, is that noone has prepared any (and most likely will shortly). The majority of Google hits are indeed forums entries, as that is the only medium the average user has to discuss this software. Thus the Wiki entry to inform others. But if original research cannot be sourced, and there is no information available, how can one inform others?</p>
<dl>
<dd>No idea, but it's not Wikipedia's job to inform people about nonmajor spyware, especially since no one's likely to find it unless clicking random page. --<a href="../../../n/i/r/User%7ENiroht_1118.html" title="User:Niroht">Niroht</a> 02:44, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>This page is is not a notable publication. It describes an online company newsletter. According to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, the article MUST meet any ONE of the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.</li>
<li>The website or content has won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation.</li>
<li>The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster</li>
</ol>
<p>The subject of this article meets NONE of these criteria.</p>
<p>In addition, a PROD was put on this article earlier. The original author of the article removed the PROD in <i>bad faith</i> by NEITHER:<br />
a) making any improvements or changes to the article to show that the subject was notable OR<br />
b) by even acknowledging the concerns expressed by the PROD and making any defense of the article on grounds that it MIGHT be notable. As such, I propose that the article is <b>deleted</b> as per <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>, and <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guidlines -- <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 02:32, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Jayron32. This is one of a series of articles written by the same editor; the remainder have been tagged for PROD. In fact, the entire category is full of redlinks, but I have insufficient expertise to determine which are relevant. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERisker_ce88.html" title="User:Risker">Risker</a> 04:53, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To piggyback on what Risker has noted, I have made a cursory check of the SAP category, and the ENTIRE category consists of articles that are circularly linked to each other and EACH seems to be an article that exists solely as an advertisement for whatever services this SAP company provides. An administrator should SERIOUSLY look at this category. There are dozens of pages there, and they ALL seem like vanity/advertising pages. If all that can be done is to AfD-tag each page individually, then we should get on it, but SOMETHING should be done. It reads like someone who is associated with the company is familiar with the Wikisystem is gaming the system for advertising for his company. That MAY not be the case, but if it IS not, then the original authors OR others should be pushed to improve these articles. If notable ALL of these articles should be improved (at best, they should ALL be merged into a single article. 2 dozen seperate articles describing each product or service that this SAP company makes or offers seems a bit, well, <i>you know</i>...). If not notable, they should ALL be deleted. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 05:26, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's nothing to stop non-administrators reviewing the articles in the category, and pushing for improvement; or even <i>trying to improve the articles directly</i> by looking for sources, citing sources, and adding content. If you wish articles to be improved, then pull out <a href="../../../p/a/g/Template%7EPage_fixing_tools_9088.html" title="Template:Page fixing tools">the toolbox</a> yourself and use the tools in it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 08:52, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good point Uncle G, and I agree with you to a point. However, there has been no assertion of <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notability</a> made on any of the articles, so I am currently leaning on the side of the fence that says that this entire category is not worthy of inclusion. I lack the expertise in the area to improve these articles. I am also under the belief that <i>if</i> they were worthy of being kept then their creator or someone else should improve them. SAP may not, <i>a priori</i> be worthy of deletion as a subject, BUT there has been no effort made to defend them as such. This AfD should either push for changes or delete entirly. Either way, in my opinion, wikipedia improves. I am not myself 100% for deleting ALL of the articles. This information is not giberish, but there is nothing internal to ANY of the articles that merits their inclusion. So barring some rewrites, as they are written now, they ALL need to go. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 18:48, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was complex.</p>
<p>The deletion nomination was a very poor one. Much of the lengthy (but commendably cordial) debate below could have been avoided by a well researched deletion nomination. No biscuit.</p>
<p>The issue of verification was raised, and is the critical discourse here. Of the sources tendered as reliable sources, only the The UTD Mercury is without debate. Thanks to the fantastic research by ImmortalGoddezz, most would concede Brand Republic as a reliable source as well.</p>
<p>But not a very good one in this case. A source's reliability is not uniform. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a> is not the best resource on itself. Brand Republic can probably be counted on to get it's big stories factually correct, but a little one-page lacks the editorial oversight required of a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#What_is_an_independent_secondary_source.3F" title="WP:RS">secondary source</a>.</p>
<p>An article with only one reliable source is standing on very thin legs.</p>
<p>However, another positive argument was presented, that this was "notable." Many editors did not provide a reasoning beyond "it is." No biscuit for them, too. Evidence of notability was given as number of Google hits, an on-line poll, <a href="../../../l/e/a/Least_common_denominator.html" title="Least common denominator">least common denominator</a>, and the previously mentioned Brand Republic/Orange marketing piece.</p>
<p>Google hits are not a reliable source when demonstrating notability. On-line polls except in very special circumstances are not even a reliable source of their own existance. Working upwards from the lowest bar in the form of "if you've kept <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foo.html" title="Foo">foo</a> we must keep <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar.html" title="Bar">bar</a>" fail to understand that Wikipedia isn't perfect yet. Thus we must again fall back on the Brand Republic/Orange piece, like a dog returns to its bone.</p>
<p>Getting picked up by a major retailer for an ad campaign does not count as "independent distribution"as the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">web material</a> guideline discusses. Questions of inclusion at this level defer to consensus, both as measured in this small sample and as demonstrated over time.</p>
<p>There was no consensus to delete this article at this time.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually what I am saying in a round about way is that if the article could be edited to include more (amongst other things) citation (thus my <i>improve</i>) then it should be kept. Since it has been in a constant state of editing lately I state <i>keep</i> in hopes that an article with appropriate citation will form. It might be putting the cart before the horse but I've seen people vote keep with less. Additionally if this article does not meet criteria for notability then I think all of the comics should be re-evaluated per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> since when viewing the <a href="../../../2/0/0/Category%7E2000s_webcomics.html" title="Category:2000s webcomics">Category:2000s webcomics</a> a great deal of the articles have no citation. Examples being <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_of_Wands_dede.html" title="Queen of Wands">Queen of Wands</a>, After Eden, Carpe Diem (comic), and Greeneyes all of which have very few outside sources or citation. I do not bring this up to start an argument (and frankly my plate is too full to get into an argument like this online) but only because I see variation in how webcomics are being handled and believe that if one is handled in this form that all of them should be given the same consideration and critiqued in the same manner. --<a href="../../../i/m/m/User%7EImmortalGoddezz_7596.html" title="User:ImmortalGoddezz">ImmortalGoddezz</a> 03:57, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I think it's time to give this webcomic the article it deserves. It has shown merit as a webcomic that people actually enjoy on a daily basis: it's not some unnotable nothing. It's linked all over the internet (especially on social networks like myspace and livejournal) and its forums have gained thousands of posts over the last two years. Some have commented that they find the humor of the comic lacking: that should have no influence on the significance of Cyanide and Happiness! Just like many things on TV (The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, Futurama, etc.), the humor may not be to your taste, but that doesn't mean that the topic isn't significant... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Ducat_bf96.html" title="User:Chris Ducat">bernlin2000</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_Ducat_65f4.html" title="User talk:Chris Ducat">∞</a> 14:46, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

Simple "externality" is not our sole concern when determining the reliability of a source. Fan blogs, online polls, press releases, college newspapers, the Digital Bulletin article which doesn't contain the words either "Cyanide" or "Happiness" -- those are not reliable sources for much of anything, let alone for determining that a webcomic is of some historical importance. I like to think of wikipedia as having standards for verifiability and reliable sources that are at least as high as a junior high school research paper rather than a place for my original research about my favorite things on the internet. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 20:49, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> You bring up a good point in determining the reliability of a source. I do understand where you are coming from, I personally have used the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> recently myself, though I might comment on the links. I see no fan blogs anywhere, a blog by Kris Wilson one of the editors of the strip yes, fanblog? No. All it is doing is establishing the fact that another book is being self published. According to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Self-published_and_dubious_sources_in_articles_about_themselves" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">WP:V Self Published</a> It is relevant to the person's or organization's notability, It is not contentious, It is not unduly self-serving, It does not involve claims about third parties, or about events not directly related to the subject, and There is no reasonable doubt about who wrote it. <a href="../../../j/o/y/Joystiq.html" title="Joystiq">Joystiq</a> is a notable video gaming weblog, notable enough to have it's own wikipedia article, given the fact that it has established notability for itself it would, I hope, establish notability for any polls, articles, etc it publishes. But the main point of inserting that citation is to point out the fact that it has gotten word about about Cyanide and Happiness and does have a reader base. Additionally if you look through the 'what links here' a few articles do use <a href="../../../j/o/y/Joystiq.html" title="Joystiq">Joystiq</a> as a reference. The "Press Release" I assume you're commenting on the Brand Republic article is not a press release and Brand Republic has been cited before (in <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsenal_F.C._0a5a.html" title="Arsenal F.C.">a featured article</a>) without comment, additionally while it does not have "Cyanide and Happiness" it mentions 'web-comic team Explosm'. According to Haymarket Publishing, Brand Republic is <i>UK's leading website for news and jobs from the advertising, marketing and media industries. It is also the home of Campaign and Marketing magazines online.</i> <a href="http://www.haymarketgroup.com/products/index.cfm?fuseaction=ShowProduct&amp;productID=47" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.haymarketgroup.com/products/index.cfm?fuseaction=ShowProduct&amp;productID=47" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> The Marketing Society says <i>With over 150,000 articles from 12 leading industry magazines, Brand Republic also contains more than 1,000 jobs, book reviews, industry data and reports.</i> <a href="http://www.themarketingsociety.org/main.asp?page=enuggets-content-provider&amp;id=3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.themarketingsociety.org/main.asp?page=enuggets-content-provider&amp;id=3" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. A not for profit company ABC Electronic has audited BrandRepublic for traffic and it has established that it is indeed a high traffic site with over a million page impressions over the period of 30 days. <a href="http://www.abce.org.uk/cgi-bin/gen5?runprog=abce/abce&amp;type=page&amp;p=brand_rep.html&amp;menuid=about_abce%7Ccase_studies%7Cbrand_rep" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abce.org.uk/cgi-bin/gen5?runprog=abce/abce&amp;type=page&amp;p=brand_rep.html&amp;menuid=about_abce%7Ccase_studies%7Cbrand_rep" rel="nofollow">[10]</a><a href="http://www.abce.org.uk/ABCE_PDFS/BrandRepublic1105w.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abce.org.uk/ABCE_PDFS/BrandRepublic1105w.pdf" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> To me it sounds as if this is an established UK marketing website. Not only that but the writer is on staff at Brand Republic so it has not been imported from another article, sounds notable enough to me. College Newspapers might be toeing the line, but featured articles such as <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornell_University_7419.html" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_University_c8f9.html" title="Duke University">Duke University</a>, and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_State_University_3713.html" title="Michigan State University">Michigan State University</a> all use their own newspapers as sources and citation for themselves not only have they been used like that but college newspapers have been used in several other articles (not just it's associated school article) , I don't see a problem here as college newspapers have been accepted as reliable sources in the past. Not only that but I believe that it is held in good regard in not only the community but the state as evidenced by <a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/news/archive/2006/mercury-awards.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.utdallas.edu/news/archive/2006/mercury-awards.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>.

As you've said <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> It's not featured. Its flaws are acknowledged, and it's a work in progress. If I might say so this article is not defining jargon, publishing original material (what is on the page has been cited and sourced verifiable to some and not to others), propaganda, a repository of links, personal home page, indiscriminate list of info, or a crystal ball. Granted when you go do a google search for this you don't come up with much unless you dig because most of the links are hotlinks to blogs, which is the main goal of the site, which I suppose they've accomplished. I'm personally of the thought of just leaving the page alone for the next few months and see how it develops. I guess what this really boils down to on here are people's opinions (or the closing admin) on whether it deserves to be on an online encyclopedia. Many people keep saying does it show historical importance?, but when you look 50 years down the road I can't see <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_Friendly_bca9.html" title="User Friendly">User Friendly</a> being a paragraph in an encyclopedia, nor can I see <a href="../../../c/t/r/Ctrl%2BAlt%2BDel_6254.html" title="Ctrl+Alt+Del">Ctrl+Alt+Del</a> being in their either, neither can I see how they have been important enough in a historical sense so far but that's just me. As I said before I have far too much on my plate to be arguing about this (except for obviously this past weekend), and I hope that those who read it take it in a kind tone as I mean no offense. I'm just stating what I think/feel/have researched in regards to this article. I'm sure some will find my reasoning wrong/skewed/whatever else you can come up with, quite frankly you're entitled to your thoughts as am I. I am just stating plainly for all to read and have no intention of debating this particular section further as I have stated all of my thoughts and ideals about it.

<li>I hugely object to this. I've never read C&amp;H; I have no idea whether it's controversial or not. I did relevant thing and checked around for notability. I certainly would never vote 'delete' on something just because I didn't "like" it, and not a single person here has given any reason to delete the article not solidly rooted in WP guidelines. From what I can see, the only mentions that it's lame or unfunny were accompanied with a 'keep' vote. So I don't see how your complaint has any relevance or fairness. (Your examples don't make any sense either. What on earth is OR on <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sailor_Moon_media_and_release_information_c39a.html" title="Sailor Moon media and release information">this page</a>? There's barely any content. And are you honestly suggesting Monty Python is non-notable? Sure, it's only a B-ranked article, but doesn't that speak for itself? B rank! It's not featured! Its flaws are acknowledged, and it's a work in progress. Isn't that the point?) --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 23:46, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't claim that people were voting delete because it's controversial. I said they were selectively applying standards, and setting a much higher "burden of proof" because it's controversial, whereas less controversial articles survive AfD with a few blog links and a link to the page the article is about. Stuff like the articles that I suggested (although some of them may have been bad examples), or especially ImmortalGoddezz's links don't get that type of scrutiny, and are held to a much lesser standard. I don't see anything wrong with having standards, I just have a problem with selectively applying them as seems to be the case here. --129.25.30.59 01:08, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I feel the same way, and I deal with it by tagging things that need citations, and when I know how, finding them myself.

<li><b>Delete</b> Non notable. Just because it exists, does not make it notable. The fact that there could be another page of equal status not yet deleted, does not make this notable. This is a compulsory organisation in a single university. A section of the Uni page seems fine.

<li><b>Weak Keep/Merge</b> I've tried to make the page better by removing a lot of the irrelevant material there, but I still feel it isn't particularly notable.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. <i>Shall I compare thee to a Slashdot post?</i> I mean, there was a Slashdot article and as such this is probably somewhat known. However, as above comments say, it's still pretty much esolangwiki material.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A quick search on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> shows 664 hits, of which the first 10 are from the designers of this computer language.

<ul>
<li>The original AfD (this is a relisting following a Deletion Review) was based on notability and verifiability. This AfD doesn't have a nomination, it's a relist; saying 'Keep, no arguments given to delete' is fine, but this would mean that you considered the above variants of 'delete' invalid. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 16:39, 4 October 2006 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> 153.25.87.34 makes a good point; it's unclear what policy this breaches. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is an essay, and the Slashdotting seems to help with that; <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is policy, but the interpreters that are available and a listing on <a href="http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net" class="external free" title="http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net</a> (which does its own checking) mean that there are probably enough sources available to write a verifiable article.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. As with the vast majority of AfDs, the point is that an article for a non-notable topic should have never been created as <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENOT_aef6.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>.

<p>Dear Editors! My name is Kiera bateman and i'm writing to you to confirm the bands authenticity. They were signed onto Sony/BMG in Australia on i believe late 2005. The band memebers are Tarek moore and Ryan Joseph Sheperd. They do have a current album out in australia called "full fontal" which is doing quite well in the aussie charts. They are what australia calls the new "katalyst", they are the younger versions of our old aussie punk band.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi, i can't believe you all havnt heard of Katalyst. Their a new band in australia and their kinda new, so its quite obvious you wouldnt have clue. Yes, it seems odd that there are no links for them on the net, but if u waited a while then somethings sure to bound up. It's just like waiting for an article from wikipedia to pop up on google. And if you keep deleting articles which you ASSUME are incorrect, than wikipedians are not going to have access to information.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This has to be the most inexcusable and unacceptable justification for deleting an article I have ever seen. Not one word or clause of the nominator's "reason" is a valid cause for deletion. There are about 37 tags that could and should have been applied to ask for rewriting the article or providing sources, and age is not an automatic disqualifier. The article makes explicit claims of notability based on the type, format, partnerships, facilities, approach and innovative practices used by the school. This AfD, and the fact so many sheep will submit knee-jerk deletes, demonstrates in one sentence the fundamental problems with this process. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 02:57, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I support standards; nothing I state here opposes them. While I have come to a different conclusion from those who have specified delete, I respect the fact that they have read and researched the article and came to an independent opinion that the article should be deleted based on their interpretation of Wikipedia standards. What I oppose are individuals who will take a blatantly invalid excuse for an AfD and then make a "knee-jerk" vote "Delete per nom". Those people are "sheep". <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 15:07, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I claim no gifts of telepathy. I am simply stating that the rationalizations used for this AfD are invalid. Any person (as above) who says "Delete per nom" is a knee-jerk response by an individual who will agree that articles should be deleted because they are "Badly written", which covers the overwhelming majority of Wikipedia articles. I wish these individuals would express an opinion, as others have, based on the content of the article, not on the text of the AfD nomination. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 16:05, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The sole stated objection to this article, that it has "no limits", has no actual foundation. The limit was clear to me, for one, from the article's title alone; and upon reading the article I found that the entries in the list corresponded with the limit that I expected. This is a list of weapons that exist in works of fiction but that do not exist in reality. (Compare this with the explicit statement at <a href="../../../f/i/c/Category%7EFictional_weapons_1e36.html" title="Category:Fictional weapons">Category:Fictional weapons</a>, which says pretty much exactly that.) That is a set that is clearly limited. There is not an infinite number of fictional weapons, for starters because there is not an infinite number of works of fiction.
<p>Furthermore, this list is <i>not</i> comparable to the other two lists mentioned in the nomination. The other two lists were lists of <i>real</i> firearms, in films and videogames. In contrast to those two lists, <i>this</i> list excludes <i>real</i> weapons. It isn't a list of the weapons that appear in works of fiction. Unlike the other two lists, this list will <i>not</i> potentially have several thousand historical novels listed against "sword". It is the list of weapons that appear in works of fiction <i>excluding all of the real ones</i>, which narrows the scope of the list significantly from what, per the nomination, it appears some editors erroneously <i>think</i> the scope of the list to be. The crossbows, guns, swords, and so forth in historical fiction are all are excluded from this list because they are real weapons.</p>
<p>The only real reason for considering deleting this article, which hasn't even been mentioned in this discussion, is whether the categories (note the plural) do the job a lot better. They currently don't. The categories don't include duodecaplylatomate, the DeLameters, and the Sunbeam from the <i><a href="../../../l/e/n/Lensman.html" title="Lensman">Lensman</a></i> series, for example, and cannot include them because we (rightly) don't have individual articles on them. There are plenty other fictional weapons that similarly don't warrant whole articles to themselves. There is a clear place for this list to supplement the categories, and the list is neither too broadly construed to be maintainable nor too narrowly construed to be useful. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:50, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Although the number of weapons in fiction is technically finite (as the number of books that have been written is finite), it's <i>effectively</i> infinite, as there are a very large number of novels (and movies and comic books...) which invent weapons, particularly in science fiction. Can we expect to be thorough in this coverage? No - there are entirely too many books to realistically expect that we've covered everything that's been envisioned. Does this list serve a specific purpose in grouping these things together? No - these weapons bear no relation to each other, besides that they're all fictional. The only reason for its existence that I've seen mentioned is for listing fictional weapons which are too minor to get articles of their own, and I don't really see how this is particularly useful. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 01:07, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> this person has not read the sources. The published books cited in the article, in particular, set the scene for Venice Beach in California in the 1960s and 1970s and identify Swami X as a noteable part of the scene. It is inarguable that Swami X's name is widely copied and parodied as a persona and that his witicisms have been published and quoted so often that <b>NOT</b> to include his biography in Wikipedia would be to omit a notable personage from a source that is supposed to supply knowledge where the standard publications fail to do so. The addition of "Swami X and his lady (in her leopard skin bikini and bellydancer's fancy waist-encircling jewelry) sat on the steps of Billy's Boarding House playing chess" underscores the matter of fact relationship between the subject of this article and the social milieu of Venice Beach in the 1970s. How can those of you who have not been there be so dismissive? How do you respond to the fundamental point, that a stand-up comedian who works on the street, i.e. a <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busker.html" title="Busker">busker</a> (<b>look it up before you comment further</b>) is not "reknowned in his own field".

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Anyone quoted as widely as Swami X, who has been a noteable personality and performer in the the second largest metropolitan area of the United States (Los Angeles) for over 35 years, is worth an article in Wikipedia.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Elcajonfarms (<a href="../../../e/l/c/User_talk%7EElcajonfarms_4f82.html" title="User talk:Elcajonfarms">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Elcajonfarms_8e3d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Elcajonfarms">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>, but <b>Edit as appropriate</b>.

The notability criteria for Wiki people <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> pose some obstacles for performers who do not regularly appear in corporate media sponsored venues such as radio, television and movies, and for that reason the proposed policy is more appropriate for the consideration of comedians, particularly street performers and other buskers. A review of the article on <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busking.html" title="Busking">busking</a> should suffice to confirm that <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swami_X_2283.html" title="Swami X">Swami X</a> satisfies these criteria for notability within his particular field.

<li><b>Comment</b> that's a misrepresentation of the meditor's comment. The comnment is the article now "asserts notability". Asserting notability is <b>not</b> the same as demonstrating notability.

<dd><b>Response to Comment by Gwernol</b> your suggestion that my comment was a "misrepresentation" is actually a false misrepresentation in and of itself.

Noam Chomsky, whom you should read before voting on issues you evidently ignore, says: "<i>US domestic drug policy does not carry out its stated goals, and policymakers are well aware of that. If it isn't about reducing substance abuse, what is it about? It is reasonably clear, both from current actions and the historical record, that substances tend to be criminalized when they are associated with the so-called dangerous classes, that the criminalization of certain substances is a technique of social control</i>". Chomsky on <a href="http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/223/noamchomsky.shtml" class="external free" title="http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/223/noamchomsky.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/223/noamchomsky.shtml</a></p>

<dd>No incivility and personal remarks please. You are creating an article with a title no one uses, which makes it original research from the start. If Chomsky criticizes the War on Drugs, add that to the article <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Drugs_b75e.html" title="War on Drugs">War on Drugs</a>. What we want is articles on neutral, widely used terms, which present both sides of the argument (if there is an argument, like in this case). What we don't want is people using Wikipedia as their soapbox, not even when it is a sourced soapbox. Please read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Chomsky is not talking about "pharmacological dissidence", that is a term you seem to have invented, and that is the main problem with this article. Censorship has nothing to do with it. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 07:08, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, if you read the article you will note it adscribes the actual coining of the term to Antonio Escohotado. So it´s not original. I´ll put the quotation with page number soon, but searching in spanish in google for "disidencia farmacológica" brings results, so the term can´t be invented by me, can it? And an american equivalent (though less academic in its formulation) is Drug War dissent, which gives 58 results in google...</p>
<p>The adjective pharmacological with the substantive dissidence are a possible and perfectly understandable description for certain political position, not original of mine, and which I try to describe in some detail.</p>
<p>And Chomsky doesn´t talk about pharmacological dissidence, he demonstrates it in his argumentation against drug war propaganda and strategies. He is called a dissident and he deals with pharmacological issues, doesn´t him? <a href="../../../d/r/c/User%7EDrcaldev_d54c.html" title="User:Drcaldev">Drcaldev</a> 07:19, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm afraid I didn't notice the tour link, otherwise I might not have afded.

<li><b>Comment</b> Yeah, I looked again, the media link is actually just pictures and stuff, but there's several google hits and interviews and stuff I found. The tour dates on their site only have about four TBAs, but other venues are questionable (Salvation Army?). This article is actually pretty close to the line, it depends on interpretation of tour, and my take is this: I've known lots of guys in bands that were medium-big locally that never got it together enough to tour another state, my feeling is if a band tours straight through at least three time zones, that's a tour. Their website is pretty pro-looking, too. <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuyanakoolaid_5548.html" title="User:Guyanakoolaid">Guyanakoolaid</a> 03:47, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not going to withdraw the nomination, but I have to agree that they certainly meet the tour criterion. This is a good example of why the notability requirement for bands is too lax - does Wikipedia really need every band that piles itself into a VW Microbus and tours bars and Starbucks across the US? I don't think so, but I guess others do. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 07:05, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> none of the named sites make a point of checking their sources. In particular, Zug is humor site, avowedly uninterested in the underlying truth of a good story.

<li>So <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Register_1954.html" title="The Register">The Register</a> doesn't count? Furthermore, hoax or not, its managed to become an example of scamming in general, and has tended to appear w/o the creator of forray's intervention. Places I haven't even expected to see this story come out of the woodwork years after this thing is done. I could expect different out of something that happened very recently, but its a meme that's managed to stick around after 2 years, which is saying something. Though I'll admit I'm a little biased on this matter. This thing is the example for my own threshold of considering an internet meme to be worth an article, but if the register won't do it, I'm not sure what you expect to see out of something that's not <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_kid_473a.html" title="Star Wars kid">Star Wars kid</a>. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 03:06, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>True, but the issue raised in both of those was notability. I would argue that this is notable because even I'd heard of it before it got its article nominated for deletion, and that only happens with so many of these things that draw out supporters (and sometimes rather fanatical cult-like ones, but that is another issue). I, personally, would like to see this stay, but when you're dealing with a policy like <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, it's pretty clear cut. Unless somebody can demonstrates where this has been given non-trivial coverage in a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, then it doesn't much matter what numbered deltion this is, because it's the one where the nomination focuses on this issue and requires that it be addressed by keep voters.

<li><b>Comment</b> Can someone explain how this anecdote is an <i>encyclopedically notable</i> internet meme, without lapsing into a definition of internet phenomenon which is hopelessly broad and without resorting to "People say they like it on their blogs and chat forums" (and yes, trivial news coverage too) arguments? In addition to "Someone did something clever" anecdotes, there are cute animal pictures, inspirational saccharine glurge stories, emails and that people shouldn't have sent (showing how comically obnoxious they are) that get sent all around the internet to thousands of people all the time. Is every single cute kitty picture, glurge story, silly email and "I did something clever today" anecdote encyclopedically notable? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:04, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ah, well, people have already discussed the notability and I don't think that's a productive area for discussion (it's too subjective, and always seems to be reduced to a says-I says-you argument). If we can't find any reliable non-trivial (etc. etc.) sources talking about this phenomenon, however, there's really no disputing whether it should be here or not. If there are satisfactory sources, it harms no-one for it to stay (and I'd vote keep). <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font style="color:#DC2163;">Z</font>iggurat</a> 00:28, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> I don't you can dismiss notability as an issue so easily. There is a large section on notability guidelines on Wikipedia which play a major part in afd discussions, and they certainly don't boil down to simple subjective views as you frame it. Just as the "harmless" argument holds no water either, both these arguments blithely ignores the fact that Wikipedia is first and foremost an <u><b>encyclopedia</b></u> and isn't supposed to be a free-for-all dumping ground for any information out there that has trivial sources (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>). Using Wikipedia as a dumping ground in a thousand ways like this does do grevious cumulative harm - to the project's mission and identity as an authoratitive encyclopedia I can find local newspaper reviews for the little kebab shop or the mom and pop diner around the corner - this doesn't make these establishments encyclopedic. And the news media - even internationally prominent news sources are also full of trivial news stories and non-news content which is far from encyclopedia. Take <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=teddy+bear+trout" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=teddy+bear+trout" rel="nofollow">this story about a "killer" teddy bear</a> for instance - 130 media sources (including FOX News, the Washington Post, USA Today, and others outside the US... this far far more coverage than the powerbook stunt will ever get) have published a story about it as shown by google news. The teddy bear has had more practical impact than the powerbook stunt. It's a apparently funny anecdote we can pass on to each other and we can use it to provide a lesson for the kids. Does this make it suitable for an encyclopedia? No, because its trivial ephemera, just like the Powerbook stunt. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 18:00, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Respond</b> The notability argument has been discussed in three previous AFDs, while the verifiability issue has not been previously discussed. Arguments to delete on the basis of non-notability alone encourage "keep" arguments that avoid the verifiability issue. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 23:05, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That reading doesn't make any sense in that context. That would imply that all schools would automatically get articles from those reports and other governmental reports. That can't be what is intended by that attempted guideline because it would make the rest of the guideline superfluous. Furthermore, note that generic government reports are not considered non-trivial for purposes of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> which uses the same phrasing. A much more sensible interpretation therefore is that trivial in this context means something closer to "commonplace" or "ordinary" possibly with some reference to the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trivial_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Trivial (mathematics)">mathematical meaning of the word</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 23:27, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The point of the guidelines is to ensure that subjects have enough verifiable information to sustain an article, so the definition of "of little value or worth" makes more sense here. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 23:30, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You seem to be under the misimpression that the guideline is an attempt to limit the number of school articles; on the contrary, it assumes that every school that can support an article can have one, supposing someone will write it. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 00:24, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Presuming this to be the case: why don't we a) apply these standards to corporations or b) re-word it or add a note to make it clear that the standard here is not the same standard as for <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> even though they use exactly the same wording? c) stop claiming that the current <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> criterion is some sort of compromise?

<li>We <i>do</i> apply these same standards to corporations. It is, however, <i>not</i> the case that all corporations have generic government reports written about them.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm truly sad to have to recommend deletion. This looks like an important point but judging from Google it just doesn't seem to be of much interest.

<li><b>Perhaps the article needs to be renamed.</b> It is no great secret that African contributions to world culture are routinely glossed over and there is a strong American/Euro-centric bias regarding which articles are accepted by scholarly journals. There is specific prejudice against articles from African universities. Without publications in scholarly journals, it is essentially impossible for either a university or an individual scholar to obtain professional recognition--hence, it is a vicious cycle. However, I don't think the phrase "anti-African scholarship" really describes those problems and even if it does, obviously no one is using that specific phrase to describe the problem.</li>

<li>I appreciate all the comments. CommuniGate Systems creates CommuniGate Pro, which is the email server f over 15 million Americans as well as 125 million users worldwide. Searches for "CommuniGate Systems" on google will yield over 70,000 results, most of which are reviews or mentions of the product created. This kept in mind, the original version had information concering the products we release and the relivence regarding them. While this was posted, I believe it was removed for reasons along the lines of "Corporate webpages that are here for commercial use should not be included on this engine." That being kept in mind, i did my best to edit and scale this page down to non-controversial non-partisian facts that are backed up with independent research (online magazines, publications such as Mac-World etc.) I am quite stuck as to what qualifies as a wikipedia page minus the concerns around neutrality. Many companies such as Avaya, Nortel Networks, Digium, all who do the same things we do have pages on Wikipedia, and in a couple of cases, these pages are much less inclusive of data than the one currently being petitioned. I can understand how <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> might come up as an issue, and I can accept this, but otherwise please let me know what exactly needs to be done for this to be as acceptable as other "corporations" on the site...

<li><b>Comment</b> Theoretically, it's possible for a company employee to write an unbiased assessment of that company. In practice, I don't know that I've ever seen it happen. The fact that other companies' articles suffer from the same failing is, sadly, undeniable, but not relevant to this one. Maybe the solution is have you write Avaya's article, and have them write yours (just kidding, I think). <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 17:44, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The previous version, as <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> has already explained above, was deleted because it was a straight copy and paste of a copyrighted non-GFDL web page. This current content is only barely less so, and could be argued to be clearly a derived work, since its paraphrasing, of that very same web page, is (to put it charitably) halfhearted. What needs to be done to make this article acceptable is to delete it, in part because of the copyright concerns of the current text, and start again from scratch <i>this time not using the company's press releases and the company's web page as the sources</i>, as was done here. See <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Writing_about_subjects_close_to_you" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">User:Uncle G/On notability#Writing_about_subjects_close_to_you</a> for the <i>only</i> way to create an encyclopaedia article about one's own company. If one cannot follow that advice, one should not write.
<p>The article is an advert, and only slightly less of a copyright violation, of the blurb on the company's own web site, than the previously deleted version. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:17, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hello, I do not get it totally...yes, nobody wants a compay just to post marketing things on the WiKI, but why would CommuniGate not be important to have listed, it is not like they are not known or something? You see Critical Path <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Path,_Inc" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Path,_Inc" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Path,_Inc</a>. You can see Openwave, both of these companies do the same thing, sell big mail servers, so what is the rub? Should we go through and delete all the company listings or inof profiles? I find it useful to see what is up with a company because you often will get more real info on the WikKi than some company website. Let them start the posting and let others put there some real truth about the company.....like do they really do what they say they do etc. User: Marsaro <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Marsaro (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marsaro_6cb2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marsaro">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Userfy and delete</b> There is absolutely asserted notability- claiming to have won a few Emmys and working with "almost every name in country music active from 1986-present" would certainly be notable. However, there's nothing online to support these claims; "Vaughn Skow"+Emmy gets 14 Yahoo! (for some reason, my Google isn't working) hits, and all of them are either message board posts or relate to Skow, but mention someone else as an Emmy winner. In addition, searches such as "Art Garfunkel"+"Vaughn Skow" and "Amy Grant"+"Vaughn Skow" get zero hits.

<li><b>Comment</b> That the suggestion that using "Hermopolitanism" to refer to the "Hermopolitan Tradition" may be an unallowable neologism is understood. But, as recently published studies find wider discussion, the term will probably be needed (in the way that Neptune required a tentative reference, being detected from its effects on the orbit of Uranus before being confirmed by direct optical observation).

Explaining them every time they crop up will just clutter up a variety of articles; a listing here keeps things orderly.

<li><b>Comment</b>. An assertion here of "popularity" is irrelevant.

<dd><b>Additional Comment</b> Many voters have noted that there is widespread usage of the term. While that is certainly good evidence that the term exists as a neologism, it doesn't cite the social significance that the article contends.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The traditional argument for deleting a neologism is "non-notable neologism." To me that implies if a neologism is notable -- ie. a word in widespread use, then merely being a neologism isn't a criteria for deletion. A dicdef of this word would be something like "an alternate spelling of the word women coined by feminists." Since there's obviously more to say about this topic than that (though I agree, it needs to be sourced and verified) I don't see how a transwiki could possibly work. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 19:54, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> No I'm not kidding... If you read carefully the wording in the reasons for deleting or keeping non-notable articles, it clearly says notability alone is not reason to delete any article.

<li><b>comment</b> - You completely glossed over <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which states "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information," "Wikipedia is not a directory of everything that exists or has existed," and "Wikipedia is not a soap box." All of those policies are why there is a threshold of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> articles must meet (<a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> explains that threshold for music). It may help for you to read this <a href="../../../n/o/n/Wikipedia%7ENon-notability_3841.html" title="Wikipedia:Non-notability">failed proposal</a> which argued the same thing you are arguing. Finally, about your argument on consensus: we do not and certainly can not expect "50% of current users" to agree on deletion. That is why a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html#Rough_consensus" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">rough consensus</a> is acceptable. - <a href="../../../e/k/t/User%7EEktar_4af5.html" title="User:Ektar">Ektar</a> 15:19, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I guess I can plea on <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> on the first point. Normal users aren't supposed to memorize contents of all of the pages, just the important rules. Well... This might be totally irrelevant, but I could tell about how I discovered Papaya. Simply. BoA did sing one of their song in one competition. I think it was on some program on TBC or something. What comes to getting 50% consensus on anything, it is matter of narrowing it to specific Portal or WikiProject. Like I implied before, I think it is better to use narrowest guidelines to justify existence of some article. What works with articles about USA or Japan or any other country doesn't always apply with similar articles about Korea. Also when there is people involved who know more than average Wikipedian about this specific area (for example Korean dance music) it is easier to explain if article is better expanded or just plain trashed. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonni1995_fca8.html" title="User:Monni1995">Monni</a> 18:43, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>comment</b> - I guess it comes down to this: I believe all articles should meet the same standards regardless of where the subject is from. It seems to me you disagree with that, at least when it comes to Korean music articles. - <a href="../../../e/k/t/User%7EEktar_4af5.html" title="User:Ektar">Ektar</a> 19:28, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> I guess it comes down to this too: People think differently, people are individuals, people don't agree on every thing. Like I said, I do agree that verifiability is a good thing, but I also said that all important rules should be mentioned in the main guideline/rule, not hidden across several pages. I also implied that sometimes we need to assume that using common sense is not original research and as such non-verifiable. We need to assume that contributor was in good faith when he/she did weigh if some controversial clause is fact or fiction. Also... I think strongly we need to get rid of clauses which say or imply something "alone" isn't reason to delete <u>and</u> isn't reason to keep things; clauses that contradict itselves. Wikipedia isn't a book of laws, it is community driven encyclopedia. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonni1995_fca8.html" title="User:Monni1995">Monni</a> 19:52, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>comment</b> - Wikipedia is certainly not a book of laws, but the "community" does have a "book of policies" to determine what is notable enough to be included. I agree with some of the things you are saying but like it or not, the policies exist and this discussion should stick to the topic of whether or not this band meets those guidelines and not argue the merits of the policies themselves. - <a href="../../../e/k/t/User%7EEktar_4af5.html" title="User:Ektar">Ektar</a> 19:32, 2 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> - Well.... I still believe the article should be kept, if just for being borderline case, as there has been previous vote already about keeping article that is close to be notable (refering to recent vote on <a href="../../../m/o/u/Moulann.html" title="Moulann">Moulann</a> article, which I did participate in too. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonni1995_fca8.html" title="User:Monni1995">Monni</a> 19:58, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>comment</b> - Your argument that "We kept X so we should keep Y" is misleading. First, the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Moulann_13d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Moulann">afd for Moulann</a> resulted in a "no consensus" which maintained the status quo (also meaning that it can very easily be nominated for another afd). That is not "a vote for keeping" the article. Second, the only thing, germane to this discussion, that those two have in common is that neither meets <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>, which is obviously not a good reason to keep the article. - <a href="../../../e/k/t/User%7EEktar_4af5.html" title="User:Ektar">Ektar</a> 14:46, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> Well... Duh... "No consensus" is a consensus too. It does say that we really don't care about <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> and their so-called policies. I'm not saying that it is totally useless WP, but some of their work clearly is against one or two ground rules of Wikipedia. They sure do piss off some of the users and that is something we should try to avoid. Well... I guess I should just turn this vote to "no consensus" too so we have two cases when someone tries to use <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> as excuse to delete something. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonni1995_fca8.html" title="User:Monni1995">Monni</a> 15:49, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"not an indiscriminate collection of information" in AFD rationales usually means nothing more than "I want this article deleted.". (We need "'Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information.' is not an indisciminate rationale for deletion.", I suspect.
<p>The clearly applicable policy in fact is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, as one can see by reading Talk:List of Thirteens (A Series of Unfortunate Events). The author (according to the talk page discussion) never states that the number 13 is special in this series of books, and the idea that it is is an inference that is being drawn, with no evidence presented that this analysis and conclusion have <i>already</i> been made <i>outside</i> of Wikipedia, by Wikipedia editors. Searching, I can find no such evidence, either. Arguments that it is "obvious" don't wash. Cases for other numbers, such as 26, are equally "obvious". One can find apparent "codes" in any reasonably substantial work of fiction, if one works hard enough.

<p>Hmmm you obviously missed the point about Robin Cooper, for that was name, and his book. It was a waste of time in trying to educate people about the finer things in the world, such as waspard, I thought that might be something that wikipedia might understand and support.

<p>I refer users to my notice on the page, regarding the encyclopaedia I own from the times of the Empire. I am happy to photocopy and distribute the reference in my personal collection (I am sure that this tome is now public domain!). Jamesr84</p>
<p>Thank you for your support regarding my article - There are, few reliable sources on the topic on the internet regarding waspard. Although I am in possession of several reference papers, which include how to make ‘waspard’, and it is something which I have grown up with. I can quote several titles and there relevant ISBN numbers, which relate to waspard directly.

<li><i>There are, few reliable sources on the topic on the internet regarding waspard.</i> Then this topic does not belong on Wikipedia - Wikipedia is a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a> and thus articles need primary sources and references from outside sources to support them.

There were also three articles from the naitonal press, including a piece in Hampshire BBC news.

<dd>The hampshire chronicle featured a monthly update on the debate, from 1994-1996. BBC Hampshire News covered the event on 6th March 1996. Local papers such as The Gazette, Mail &amp; Star and the South of England Lawn Bowls Society newsleter covered the events in greater detail. I am happy to distribute scans of any of the articles, if not all! I think we should get off the debate on wether this occured, and instead refer back to the reason that this article is placed on this list; is it notable. This is a debate I would welcome, rather than a cowardly attack on my character. Thank you.</dd>

I used to reside at 45 Bagers Farm Road, a short drive from the Anchor Inn, to save you the trouble of verifying this address on google, I have posted a link to multi map. Although I do no condone blood sports, my neighbour was in truth was the owner of a small Staffordshire Pit-bull Terrier, which competed, sadly unsuccessfully, in Pet Duel III</p>

<p>I wished to join the wikipedia community, and have recieved nothing but scorn. I wished to write a good article, and could not work out what to write about, until my dad's scrapbook reminded me of the silly competition that got out of hand in our pub. For your information, I used to live there, and despite my good friends efforts to the contrary, it is still open. <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/19/19971/Anchor_Inn/Lower_Froyle" class="external free" title="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/19/19971/Anchor_Inn/Lower_Froyle" rel="nofollow">http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/19/19971/Anchor_Inn/Lower_Froyle</a> I would also like to know when commenting and participating actively in a public debate meant that anything that came out of your mouth is lies? What has me commenting about a seperate article got to do with my article? Is this because I disagreed with your point of view? To parody myself perhaps this reminds us all of a famous nation in the 1930s. I have the proof by the way, but as I am new I have yet to 1. Upload, 2. Reference. I was hoping with some sort of help in doing this, rather than damnation. Do I need to scan in the paper cuttings? Upload the photographs? Help would be nice, as I believe this is a very entertaining part of Hampshire's local history, and one that people should be aware of, as it shows how a small silly event can get out of hand. Much like National Socialism.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>Hampshire is not a town I’m afraid, my ‘wikifriend’, it is a county a large area, originally the domain of a count or earl. Counties include many towns, cities, villages and hamlets, and many inns, many of them with the same name</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> At the time of these supposed events, I lived around 30 miles from Lower Froyle. I still live in the county. So I'm local enough to know that this is complete and utter bullshit. To put it into context, around the same time there were a spate of attacks on horses in the area, and speculation was published in the local and national press that a "horse ripper" was responsible. Googling "horse ripper" + Hampshire pulls up quite a few relevant results. The fact that google can't find ANYTHING about this event tells me it's crap, regardless of my personal knowledge. And of course I can always phone the Hampshire Chronicle tomorrow and I'm 100% certain they will know nothing about a "monthly update on the debate, from 1994-1996".

Right, with all due respect, will you please read what I write. I have said do your research in respect to knowing what Hampshire is, or in your case, what it certainly is not. Secondly, I stated QUITE CLEARLY, that I am but a humble beginner, and I extended a warm handshake to you, my friend and subject in the Great Imperial Colonies, and asked for assistance. I have the sources, and I wish to put them on. As stated before, I do not know how. I am asking for assistance with this. You cannot find reference for this anywhere, as a someone said, that is because many things live outside of Google. I for instance, cannot be found on Google, but I most certainly exsist. Faith too, is absent on Google, and yet I know many who have found that. Thank you in advance, and Godspeed.</p>
<p>The LORD will demonstrate his holy power before the eyes of all the nations. The ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God." - Isaiah 52:10</p>
<p>Is swearing at me and telling me to go away really in the spirit of wikipedia? I have offered the proof, I am not lying! I merely wished to make a contribution. Thank you for your help, rather than saying, please come forth with the sources, this is how you put them into the article, you use deplorable language and insults. I think I may just go away, this is certainly not a very nice community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Look, just post the scans and we'll beleive you. Most major press sources are extensively indexed by google and signifigant coverage should be detected via a google search. It is possible that some how this story slipped through, but you need to show us that by posting scans (or links) to the articles in question. Otherwise, <b>delete</b>.

I would also like to point out that i would quite happily 'upwikiload' my sources regarding Waspard (my favourite condiment). Its funny you say that your not on Google either, the same thing happened to me, maybe google needs to cite more sources, or we might have to take google out of the 'wikifunclub'.

<p>I wish people would read what is written before comment. I wish to post the sources, so that all of the morons who live life by the judge before trial philosophy can apologise to me. However, as I have written a millions times before, an offer of some assistance would be welcome. If this is not possible; i.e. if you don't want me to upload the files, and help source the article, then this would be very distressing.

The Pet Duel debate seems to have become quite quiet now that some assistance has been requested. Perhaps the 'wikicommunity' allows it's pupils only to baldly critisize people contibutions, rather than offer assistance or even constructive critisism. Many thanks P. Longhurst</p>

<li>Unfortunately it seems the user who wrote the original article was not an experienced wikipedia writer, similar to myself in that respect. As an old Salopian myself, however, I took the liberty of researching the topic and found the real verifiable source in "Salopian Slang", published around 10 years ago by Salopian Publishing. Thus I dare say the article is not eligible for deletion for the cited reason of "Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day". In fact, this proposition is a deep misunderstanding and neglection of the public school culture, a relevant topic for any encylopedia and therefore more than at home on wikipedia. Any attempt to delete it, I propose, is undermining what I consider to be the values of wikipedia and is thus, I hesitate to add, fairly hypocritical. Might I also propose that users refer to the "shrewsbury school" article on the site, which indicates a good deal of the school's ancient tradition and, notably, defines it as a public school- not a high school as on user mentioned on this page. I hope this is helpful.213.254.171.194 20:16, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am unable to find any indication that any book entitled "Salopian Slang" exists, nor is there any record anywhere of a company called "Salopian Publishing" ever having existed. This is apparently the second nonexistent book that someone has tried to cite as verification. (Regarding the use of terms, a large number of Wikipedia editors are Americans, for whom "public school" means something totally different (opposite actually) than it does in the UK, and "high school" indicates any secondary school. To use "public school" would have been confusing and misleading.) <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 20:22, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> I thank Fan-1967 for his/her comment, though I feel a little hurt that he/she considers the book I quoted, "Salopian Slang", to be nonexistent. I question whether the user is looking in the right places. Allow me to assure him/her that the book exists (I have a copy on my desk at this precise moment) and urge him to look harder. As a relative 'noob' to wikipedia I ask the user how best to put a copy (perhaps scanned) onto the internet in order to make it truly verifiable, bearing in mind that it is a commercial publication and thus has copyright issues attached with it. (I again thank the user for his comments about public school/high school but, as a proud Brit myself, and given that the school in question is in England I will continue to refer to it as a Public School.) <b>Proud in Opposition.</b>213.254.171.194 21:45, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I'm not suggesting that the article is wholly uninformative. However, even if we assume it to be accurate, it must meet other criteria for inclusion in the encyclopedia, and I'm suggesting that it fails there. I could write an article about myself (as it appears the author did in the case of this article), but that doens't mean it's worth including in Wikipedia.

I can see moving the <i>Design Win</i> page into the <i>Design Chain</i> page, but to completely delete them is ridiculous indeed; it says that the method doesn't exist. However, it is readily apparent by the fact that there is an entire magazine devoted to the subject of <i>Design Chaining</i> that this subject is of importance to the business world. As a matter of information I am not in any way associated with Cadance nor their magazine, but am a technologist in the industry whom specializes in design chaining. As is readily seen by the edits of the pages I have edited out any additions that would benefit the company for which I work and will continue to do so until it is deemed ethical by wikipedia.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> <i>Absolutely</i> no notability stated nor implied whatsoever. It was an insignificant city building which existed for 60 years and then was demolished. Nothing demonstrates that this building has any historical worth. The three external links are: 1) a page that merely states that the building existed, had 6 stories and was torn down; 2) a photo; and 3) a two-sentence mention at the bottom of an article about many buildings in the neiborhood in which this structure used to stand. The link within the article is to a biography of (apparently) the building's architect, who was non-notable. How does any of that qualify it for a Wikipedia article? -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 23:57, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. At the time it was built, it was a prestige building, not an insignificant one. That's probably why it was designed by a non-Canadian architect. It's too bad that Wikipedia doesn't have an article on the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Board_of_Trade_c86a.html" title="Toronto Board of Trade">Toronto Board of Trade</a>, after which the building was named. It would have been the subject of considerable coverage during its construction and when it first opened, but I'm not prepared to look through old (1890s) Toronto newspapers on microfilm to get an exact citation. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 02:03, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Correction</b> Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge was not a non-notable architecture firm (1886-1915).
