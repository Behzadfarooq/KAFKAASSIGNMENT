<li><b>Delete</b>. Blogs, forums, and Flickr pages ain't reliable sources, especially for something as non-notable and small as this. Could probably be deleted as db-spam, to boot.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Speaking as a gaijin living in Tokyo five years now, I heard about it when I first arrived and I even rode on it last year. I've talked to a number of gaijin who have either heard about it, known someone who has ridden it, or have ridden it themselves. It's quite an established bit of Tokyo lore. Though the article says it started in the early 90s, the event may very well come back some years before that so it's a fairly well established event. The Ohmynews article in the link is not a blog, by the way, and I would think the pictures and video show that the event does indeed exist. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by on 87.75.6.127 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__on_87.75.6.127_87e1.html" title="Special:Contributions/ on 87.75.6.127">contribs</a>) 23:28, October 25, 2006.

<li><b>Keep</b> Why exactly is this article in debate for deletion? It is an event and a phenomenom that has been held almost every year for well over a decade. As the reporter for the original article (not Blog, mind you) linked from OhMyNews - not the wiki article - I can assure you that said event exists as I have witnessed and participated in it and later reported on it for OhMynews. Like the above UK poster who lives in Japan (why the identity of the ISP address became a minor issue is beyond me to fathom unless certain people don't beleive in travel anymore than they do in Yamanote halloween trains), I have lived in Tokyo for almost 5 years. While I didn't hear about it the moment I arrived (I arrived in mid-December), I did hear about it my first Halloween here and every year after until 2005 when I witnessed it myself. Before and after that event I spoke to a number of people to gather info on the background of the event and learned that the event had been held semi-annually for well over 10 years. I recently got an email on my Ohmynews account from someone who said they rode the Halloween Train in 1992. They had heard from participants that the tradition had started sometime ago before that - so the event could almost be close to 20 years old for all we know. For those living in Tokyo who haven't heard of this event, I suggest you get out more. Most people I know have heard of the event, participated in it, or know friends who have. In short - the Yamanote Halloween Train DOES exist and debates to contrary are ridiculous seeming to reveal more a biased prudishness to the antics of foreigners (and Japanese) on the Yamanote rather than a legit concern about the integrity of Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Crossfire (<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrossfire_96be.html" title="User talk:Crossfire">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crossfire_e69e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crossfire">contribs</a>)  at 13:45, October 27, 2006.

<li>And I repeat, oh brand-new person, OhMynews is distinguishable from a blog or wiki HOW, exactly? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 15:51, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Oh, brand new person? What are you babbling about Calton? Keep your remarks confined to the article in question and let go of your smarmy remarks that do little to further this (and I use the term lightly) debate. As to your question, how is OhMyNews not a blog, it is a citzen journalist newspaper. People report on events and the like then submit to OhMyNews who decide to publish their article or not. There is an editorial process. It's not a print up anything under the sun. Now my question - what have you got against this wiki article exactly? The event exists and has existed for over a decade and will continue to exist. As for the Ohmynews article, I reported it by speaking to a number of people before and after witnessing and participated in it myself. What I gave was an eyewitness account accompanied with photos and videos. You have yet to present a case for deletion other than your blind refusal to accept the reality of a proven event.

<li>If you read some of the blog entries/forum posts that come up on a google search, there are several references to the Tokyo police officially discouraging the practice, or to police involvement in breaking up/monitoring the event. It would seem that all is necessary for more references to and validity for the event is to find the official announcement by the police, or to look up old police blotter records (do Japanese have those?) for references to the party.

<li><b>Delete</b> this is a non-notable event (though real in a trivially small way) that does not rise to the encyclopedic level — <a href="../../../h/o/l/WP%7EHOLE_7127.html" title="WP:HOLE">WP:HOLE</a> is intended for biographies, but the principle applies here <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Epopt_6905.html" title="User:The Epopt">➥the Epopt</a> 14:44, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per The Epopt. This may be real, but it clearly is not important enough to have received mainstream media coverage. Lots of people have Halloween parties every year, and lots of them are even broken up and/or tolerated by the police. The fact that this one allegedly takes place on a train does not automatically make it an important subject that requires an article in an <i>encyclopedia</i>. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 18:33, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, an extended interpretation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Per The Epopt and Haeleth, too - I won't bother refactoring their points, as I totally agree with them. <span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant">Daniel</a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">.</a><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDaniel.Bryant_8f7b.html" title="User talk:Daniel.Bryant">Bryant</a></b></span> 01:24, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, This is an actual, real event. I rode it last night, accompanied, might I add, by several members of the local Police Force. It seems that the Tokyo Police know that this is real. The fellow gaijin (and Japanese) on the train (which would have numbered well into the hundreds at the peak of the ride) also obviously knew of its existence. I can't see how two self-appointed expert gaijin can shoot down this article based on their inability to discover any "verifiable" evidence online. If they were in fact in Tokyo (it seems like location has been the central part of this debate) they could have come and seen for themselves. Lushman 03:07, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>You rode the Yamanote line last night, as in October 28? Not Halloween? And there were hundreds of people aboard? How exactly is that different from any other night on the Yamanote? <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 08:06, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> and salt. Real isn't the issue. Notable is the issue. Would life be noticably different without this particular party? I dont't think so. It's just a party.

<p><b>Keep</b> - yes, 'Exploding Guy' it was held last night and the difference from any other night would be all the people in Halloween costume and the general party atmosphere. If your only objection to this entry is that it is unverfiable, I can tell it does exist and I was there (along with a LOT of other gaijin). Perhaps you should have popped along and seen it for yourself. I apologise if I haven't followed the correct procedure for logging this but I have never before felt the need to comment on an entry and don't have a login and also thought this way my IP shows and you can at least verify that I am in Japan.

<li><b>Keep</b> I fail to see any reason for deleting this, anyway if the article is deleted but the event continues to take place every year then wont someone eventually just re-create this article? Look around, there are a lot of 'cultural' articles of WiKi that would never make it into a normal encyclopedia. I for one see these articles as a good thing, wikipedia is now a one-stop-shop for information and part of that success is because of it's huge store of 'limited interest group' articles like this one. Anyway thats my two cents... or yen.</li>
