<p>Ways To Find the best broadband provider for you.</p>
<p>A little effort goes a long way towards finding the best provider</p>
<p>Most things in life take some amount of work. To find the best product at the optimum price takes some research. This is true for everything, including finding the best broadband provider. The first step is being familiar with your needs from a broadband provider. Anyone can say how well a service works for them, but if it is too much or not enough for your needs, it is simply a waste of time. Time and money are two valuable resources that should never be wasted.</p>
<p>It is necessary to get a good idea of what your really need from a provider to get the best broadband provider for you. Make a list of your needs. Decide if you only need Internet service or if you would do better with bundled phone and Internet service. So many great deals exist for bundled type services from companies such as BT broadband, Wanadoo Broadband, and Homecall Broadband. Each of these companies is well established in the UK market. They are eager for their share of the broadband market and each is notable for their services and prices.</p>
<p>Going back to your needs-perhaps you are the owner of a home business? Decide if the service is for a company that you own, or do you have personal home business needs? The answers to these questions will help direct your research efforts to find that perfect broadband provider. And once you have finished with this personal research, you will have a very well formed idea of what kind of broadband package you need. You will not be swayed into purchasing something you don't need by a fast-talking salesperson. The fact that you have done your research will provide you with a blueprint of what you are looking for in a broadband provider.</p>
<p>Now comes the opportunity to discuss pricing options with the companies that are trying to get your business. Get a list of prices. Then go talk to people who are actually using the broadband services you are thinking about. Avoid the canned information available on the company website. Ask around, talk to your neighbors, friends, and colleagues about the advantages and things they don't like about the various broadband providers. This is an invaluable way to weed out the providers who have great deals but don't follow up with the best service.</p>
<p>For people who spend a lot of time on their computers, finding the best broadband service is key for making it a pleasant experience. It could even save you money on things like your phone bill, too. It is always interesting to see people who stop using dial-up for the very first time and try broadband service. Even if it is a smaller bandwidth type of service, the difference in amazing to them. It is very possible that dial-up could go the way of the Dodo bird and become extinct because of the ever-growing success of broadband services. This is becoming more apparent now with the excellent broadband deals available and the affordability of broadband for the average consumer. So it is even more important to stress that finding the right broadband service for you is the most important key to having a great Internet experience.</p>

<p>FG modelsport is a German large scale model car manufacturer. It makes 1 main chassis and drive train. This is then formed into both an off-road an on-road variant.</p>
<p>The off rorad car goes by the names of Marder, monster beetle and Pajero. These are all different bodyshells on which the car is based.</p>
<p>The on road car goes by the names eco-line, sports-line and competition line. Needless to say these are three spec levels the eco-line being the entry level model and the competition-line being the all out racecar.</p>
<p>All of the FG rance is 2 wheel drive as standard and is powered by a 23.5cc 'Zenoah' 2 stroke engine. This engine revs to around 20,000 RPM and produces 4-5 BHP.</p>
<p>Aftermarket upgrades for both the on and offroad FG's include independant disk brakes, alloy upgrades for nearly every component, and increased bore for the engine to increase power, K&amp;N air filter to improve filtration and increase power, a limited slip differential, alloy wheels, and many different body shells. In some cases the road car can have a smaller chassis fitted to suit different cars dimensions, effectively keeping their proportions correct.</p>
<p>The track car is used competetivley in many 'large scale' races in the world. Against even the most cutting edge new cars the FG still is very competetive and is always seen at the top of the championship tables.</p>

<p>Many people have been trying various flavors of Linux, which frequently installs using GRUB as a dual-boot setup with Windows. Distrowatch shows thousands of downloads a day.</p>
<p>For a lot of people, especially the amateurs, problems with modems, printers, etc, end up with an attempted un-install, either to try another version, or going back to Windows only. A failed un-install involves the Master Boot Record and other complexities that can require a lot of expertise to fix.</p>
<p>All the web pages I found on uninstalling GRUB issues are either obsolete, conflicting, vague, or far too geekspeek for average users.</p>

<p>Flarp!, also known as "noise putty", is a clever novelty item that makes boisterous fart-like sounds when the putty is jammed into it's plastic container. Flarp provides hours of fun for children who want to annoy their parents, or adults who want to wreak havok on their fellow co-workers. Flarp comes in multiple scents including orange, bannana, strawberry, grape, lemon, and pineapple. Flarp can be found in the toy section of department stores or in smaller convenience stores like Walgreens or Dollar General. Flarp is safe and non-toxic.</p>

<p>Notes</p>
<p>Reverend Ralph Wheelock, Puritan, educator, and founder was born in Dorrington, Shropshire, England on 14 May 1600. His family origins can be traced back to the tenth century in Wheelock Village, near Sandbach, in the County of Cheshire. Ralph was educated at Cambridge University, Clare Hall. He matriculated in 1623, obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1626, and a Master of Arts in 1631.</p>
<p>At that time, Cambridge was the center of the dissenting religious movement that gave rise to Puritanism. His contemporaries at Cambridge University included John Milton and John Eliot, whose liberal views he seemed to share. The persecution of those with Puritan beliefs ran high during this period, which undoubtedly motivated Rev. Wheelock to participate in "The Great Migration" which brought many new immigrants to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. By one account, 20,000 came to New England during the peak years of the migration between 1630 and 1640 [1].</p>
<p>On 6 May 1630, in England, Rev. Wheelock was ordained priest by Francis White, Bishop of the Norfolk Diocese [12]. Shortly thereafter, on 17 May 1630, he married Rebecca Clarke. At least three children were born to the family in England (Mary Wheelock, baptised in Banham, County of Norfolk, 2 Sep 1631; Gershom Wheelock, baptised in the village of Eccles, County of Norfolk, 3 Jan 1632/33 [2]; and Rebecca Wheelock, baptised in the village of Eccles, County of Norfolk, 24 Aug 1634 [10]). Rev. Wheelock served clerical duties at the parish in Eccles, where Gershom and Rebecca were baptised, indicated by his signature as "local curate" on the register pages that record his children's baptisms [11].</p>
<p>Rev. Wheelock, his wife Rebecca, and at least three children sailed for the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1637, just 7 years after Boston was first settled, and during the peak of the "Great Migration" [3]. Some Wheelock historians have suggested that Rebecca gave birth to a daughter aboard ship, but no definitive proof is available [4].</p>
<p>Upon arrival, Rebecca and Ralph Wheelock settled in Watertown, Massachusetts. There Rev. Wheelock participated in a plan to create a new settlement further up the Charles River, to be called Contentment (later renamed Dedham). In 1638 Rev. Wheelock became one of the earliest settlers and a founder of Dedham. He lived there with his wife for more than a decade, and played a leading role in the affairs of the town. The records at Dedham show that Ralph and Rebecca had four children there: Benjamin, Samuel, Record, and Experience.</p>
<p>In July 1637, Rev. Ralph Wheelock signed the 'Dedham Covenant' which was in effect the founding constitution of the settlers of Dedham. In 1639 he and seven others were chosen for "ye ordering of towne affayers according unto Courte Order in that behalf." The powers that these eight men had were probably similar to the town selectment of modern times. He was also appointed to assist the surveyor ("measurer") in laying out the boundaries of the town.</p>
<p>On 13 Mar 1638/9, Rev. Wheelock was declared a freeman [5], which allowed him to exercise the full right of suffrage and to hold public office. To become a freeman, it was necessary to be a member in good standing of a local church, and to appear before the General Court and take an oath whose essential elements swore to good citizenship and good religious character.</p>
<p>In 1642, Ralph Wheelock was appointed the General Court clerk of writs. The General Court was the central court of the Bay Colony, with powers granted by the British Crown to decide legal matters, to dispense lands, and to establish laws. At this point in time (1643), the population of the Bay Colony was about 18,000 [6].</p>
<p>In 1645 he was appointed one of the commissioners authorized to "solemnize" marriages, which at the time was a civil rather than religious duty.</p>
<p>Although Rev. Wheelock was an ordained minister, his greater inclinations were toward teaching, which he did with great fervor and in various capacities throughout his life. Rev. Wheelock was probably the first public school teacher in America. On 1 Feb 1644 a Dedham town meeting voted for the first free school in Massachusetts, to be supported by town taxes. Rev. Ralph Wheelock was the first teacher at this school. Three years later, in 1647, the General Court decreed that every town with 50 families or more must build a school supported by public taxes. [9]</p>
<p>By the late 1640's Dedham was becoming quite populous, and it was decided to establish a new township further up the Charles River, out of a tract of land that was then part of Dedham. Rev. Wheelock was appointed leader of this effort, and in 1649 he and six others were given the duties of erecting and governing a new village, to be called New Dedham, later renamed Medfield.</p>
<p>In May, 1651, the town of Medfield was granted the full powers of an independent town by the General Court of Massachusetts. In this year Rev. Ralph Wheelock and his family removed to Medfield, where he lived the remaining 32 years of his life. The records at Medfield show that Ralph and Rebecca had one child there - Eleazar Wheelock whose grandson would become the founder and first president of Dartmouth College.</p>
<p>Though others participated in the establishment of the Town of Medfield, Rev. Ralph Wheelock is considered to be it's primary founder. As leader of the previously mentioned committee of seven, it is almost certain [7] that Rev. Wheelock wrote the document called "The Agreement" which, for a time, every new settler of Medfield had to sign. "The Agreement" stated that the signatories were to abide by the town ordinances and laws, maintain orderly conduct, and resolve differences between themselves peaceably.</p>
<p>Rev. Ralph Wheelock was granted the first house lot in Medfield (12 acres), and served on the first Board of Selectmen (1651). He subsequently served on the Board of Selectmen in 1652-1654, and again in 1659. In 1653 he took up a collection for Harvard College, the first college in America. Fund raising for Harvard was probably a regular event, being a primary source of revenue for the fledgling institution.</p>
<p>In 1655, the town voted 15 pounds to be used to establish a "schoule for the educataion of the children, to be raised by a rate according as men have taken up lands, and the rest of the maintenance to be raised upon the children that goe to schoule" [8]. Rev. Ralph Wheelock was the first schoolmaster. In his book "Mr. Ralph Wheelock, Puritan", the Rev. Lewis Hicks speculates that Rev. Wheelock remained schoolmaster for a period of 8 years.</p>
<p>Every year, Medfield chose a representative to the General Court in Massachusetts. Rev. Wheelock held this position in the years 1653, 1663, 1664, 1666, and 1667.</p>
<p>Rebecca (Clarke) Wheelock died on 1 Jan 1680/1 in Medfield. Two years later, Rev. Wheelock died, in the 84th year of his life.</p>
<p>Rev. Wheelock played an active and important role in the settling of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He was instrumental in establishing two new towns, and held virtually every office of importance in both of them. Furthermore, he was at the forefront of establishing the educational foundations of the country.</p>
<p>His descendents would also prove to play an important a role in settling New England and the rest of America. His son, Benjamin, was a founder of the Town of Mendon. Among his great-grandchildren were founders of several New England towns, as well as Eleazar Wheelock, the founder of Dartmouth. Succeeding generations would push farther west, settling the frontiers in New York, Michigan, Illinois, Nova Scotia, and Texas, establishing impressive credentials as teachers, writers, soldiers, pioneers, and businessmen.</p>

<p>[1] "The History of the Town of Medfield, Massachusetts, 1650 - 1886", by William S. Tilden, published by the Medfield, Massachusetts Historical Society, pg. 23.</p>
<p>[2] Genealogists have variously reported that Rev. Wheelock married Rebecca Barber, Rebecca Wilkinson, and Rebecca Clark. An article by Christopher Gleason Clark, in the January 1998 issue of "The New England Historical and Genealogical Register", vol 152, entitled "The English Ancestry of Joseph Clark (1613-1683) of Dedham and Medfield, Massachusetts" provides compelling evidence that Rev. Wheelock indeed married Rebecca Clarke.</p>
<p>The key components of this evidence are as follows. First, the parish registers of Wraplingham, County of Norfolk, England, contain a recording of the marriage between Ralph Wheelock, cleric, and Rebecca Clarke, 17 May 1630. Second, the will of Rebecca's father, Thomas Clark, refers to his grandaughter Marye Wheelock. Third, the baptism of Marye Wheelock, daughter of Ralph Wheelock, cleric, is recorded in the Banham, County of Norfolk parish registers. (Banham is near Wraplingham). Fourth, the will of William Clark, uncle to Elizabeth Clarke, is witnessed by Ralph Wheelocke "in his unmistakable hand".</p>
<p>Ralph Wheelock's will refers to George Barber as his "brother-in-law". This led to the speculation that the maiden name of Rebecca must have been Barber. But it is shown in the article that George Barber married Rebecca Clarke's sister, Elizabeth Clarke, thereby explaining the reference in Ralph Wheelock's will.</p>
<p>[3] No record of Ralph Wheelock's passage to America could be found in "The Complete Book of Emigrants, 1607-1776" by Peter Wilson Coldham.</p>
<p>[4] "The Wheelock Family in America (1637-1969)", by Walter T. Wheelock, privately published, pg. 93. It is suggested here that Rebecca gave birth to a daughter while at sea. (Mr. Wheelock's original source is not known at the time this footnote was written.) Other Wheelock genealogies have reported that Rebecca was born at sea, and that Mary was born at sea. The research of Christopher Gleason Clark disproves the assertions that Mary or Rebecca were born on ship, leaving Peregrina as the only candidate, since the birth place of the remaining children is well accounted for.</p>

<p>Upon arrival, Rebecca and Ralph Wheelock settled in Watertown, Massachusetts. There Rev. Wheelock participated in a plan to create a new settlement further up the Charles River, to be called Contentment (later renamed Dedham). In 1638 Rev. Wheelock became one of the earliest settlers and a founder of Dedham. He lived there with his wife for more than a decade, and played a leading role in the affairs of the town. The records at Dedham show that Ralph and Rebecca had four children there: Benjamin, Samuel, Record, and Experience.</p>
<p>In July 1637, Rev. Ralph Wheelock signed the 'Dedham Covenant' which was in effect the founding constitution of the settlers of Dedham. In 1639 he and seven others were chosen for "ye ordering of towne affayers according unto Courte Order in that behalf." The powers that these eight men had were probably similar to the town selectment of modern times. He was also appointed to assist the surveyor ("measurer") in laying out the boundaries of the town.</p>
<p>On 13 Mar 1638/9, Rev. Wheelock was declared a freeman [5], which allowed him to exercise the full right of suffrage and to hold public office. To become a freeman, it was necessary to be a member in good standing of a local church, and to appear before the General Court and take an oath whose essential elements swore to good citizenship and good religious character.</p>
<p>In 1642, Ralph Wheelock was appointed the General Court clerk of writs. The General Court was the central court of the Bay Colony, with powers granted by the British Crown to decide legal matters, to dispense lands, and to establish laws. At this point in time (1643), the population of the Bay Colony was about 18,000 [6].</p>
<p>In 1645 he was appointed one of the commissioners authorized to "solemnize" marriages, which at the time was a civil rather than religious duty.</p>
<p>Although Rev. Wheelock was an ordained minister, his greater inclinations were toward teaching, which he did with great fervor and in various capacities throughout his life. Rev. Wheelock was probably the first public school teacher in America. On 1 Feb 1644 a Dedham town meeting voted for the first free school in Massachusetts, to be supported by town taxes. Rev. Ralph Wheelock was the first teacher at this school. Three years later, in 1647, the General Court decreed that every town with 50 families or more must build a school supported by public taxes. [9]</p>
<p>By the late 1640's Dedham was becoming quite populous, and it was decided to establish a new township further up the Charles River, out of a tract of land that was then part of Dedham. Rev. Wheelock was appointed leader of this effort, and in 1649 he and six others were given the duties of erecting and governing a new village, to be called New Dedham, later renamed Medfield.</p>
<p>In May, 1651, the town of Medfield was granted the full powers of an independent town by the General Court of Massachusetts. In this year Rev. Ralph Wheelock and his family removed to Medfield, where he lived the remaining 32 years of his life. The records at Medfield show that Ralph and Rebecca had one child there - Eleazar Wheelock whose grandson would become the founder and first president of Dartmouth College.</p>
<p>Though others participated in the establishment of the Town of Medfield, Rev. Ralph Wheelock is considered to be it's primary founder. As leader of the previously mentioned committee of seven, it is almost certain [7] that Rev. Wheelock wrote the document called "The Agreement" which, for a time, every new settler of Medfield had to sign. "The Agreement" stated that the signatories were to abide by the town ordinances and laws, maintain orderly conduct, and resolve differences between themselves peaceably.</p>
<p>Rev. Ralph Wheelock was granted the first house lot in Medfield (12 acres), and served on the first Board of Selectmen (1651). He subsequently served on the Board of Selectmen in 1652-1654, and again in 1659. In 1653 he took up a collection for Harvard College, the first college in America. Fund raising for Harvard was probably a regular event, being a primary source of revenue for the fledgling institution.</p>
<p>In 1655, the town voted 15 pounds to be used to establish a "schoule for the educataion of the children, to be raised by a rate according as men have taken up lands, and the rest of the maintenance to be raised upon the children that goe to schoule" [8]. Rev. Ralph Wheelock was the first schoolmaster. In his book "Mr. Ralph Wheelock, Puritan", the Rev. Lewis Hicks speculates that Rev. Wheelock remained schoolmaster for a period of 8 years.</p>
<p>Every year, Medfield chose a representative to the General Court in Massachusetts. Rev. Wheelock held this position in the years 1653, 1663, 1664, 1666, and 1667.</p>
<p>Rebecca (Clarke) Wheelock died on 1 Jan 1680/1 in Medfield. Two years later, Rev. Wheelock died, in the 84th year of his life.</p>
<p>Rev. Wheelock played an active and important role in the settling of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He was instrumental in establishing two new towns, and held virtually every office of importance in both of them. Furthermore, he was at the forefront of establishing the educational foundations of the country.</p>
<p>His descendents would also prove to play an important a role in settling New England and the rest of America. His son, Benjamin, was a founder of the Town of Mendon. Among his great-grandchildren were founders of several New England towns, as well as Eleazar Wheelock, the founder of Dartmouth. Succeeding generations would push farther west, settling the frontiers in New York, Michigan, Illinois, Nova Scotia, and Texas, establishing impressive credentials as teachers, writers, soldiers, pioneers, and businessmen.</p>

<p>[1] "The History of the Town of Medfield, Massachusetts, 1650 - 1886", by William S. Tilden, published by the Medfield, Massachusetts Historical Society, pg. 23.</p>
<p>[2] Genealogists have variously reported that Rev. Wheelock married Rebecca Barber, Rebecca Wilkinson, and Rebecca Clark. An article by Christopher Gleason Clark, in the January 1998 issue of "The New England Historical and Genealogical Register", vol 152, entitled "The English Ancestry of Joseph Clark (1613-1683) of Dedham and Medfield, Massachusetts" provides compelling evidence that Rev. Wheelock indeed married Rebecca Clarke.</p>
<p>The key components of this evidence are as follows. First, the parish registers of Wraplingham, County of Norfolk, England, contain a recording of the marriage between Ralph Wheelock, cleric, and Rebecca Clarke, 17 May 1630. Second, the will of Rebecca's father, Thomas Clark, refers to his grandaughter Marye Wheelock. Third, the baptism of Marye Wheelock, daughter of Ralph Wheelock, cleric, is recorded in the Banham, County of Norfolk parish registers. (Banham is near Wraplingham). Fourth, the will of William Clark, uncle to Elizabeth Clarke, is witnessed by Ralph Wheelocke "in his unmistakable hand".</p>
<p>Ralph Wheelock's will refers to George Barber as his "brother-in-law". This led to the speculation that the maiden name of Rebecca must have been Barber. But it is shown in the article that George Barber married Rebecca Clarke's sister, Elizabeth Clarke, thereby explaining the reference in Ralph Wheelock's will.</p>
<p>[3] No record of Ralph Wheelock's passage to America could be found in "The Complete Book of Emigrants, 1607-1776" by Peter Wilson Coldham.</p>
<p>[4] "The Wheelock Family in America (1637-1969)", by Walter T. Wheelock, privately published, pg. 93. It is suggested here that Rebecca gave birth to a daughter while at sea. (Mr. Wheelock's original source is not known at the time this footnote was written.) Other Wheelock genealogies have reported that Rebecca was born at sea, and that Mary was born at sea. The research of Christopher Gleason Clark disproves the assertions that Mary or Rebecca were born on ship, leaving Peregrina as the only candidate, since the birth place of the remaining children is well accounted for.</p>

<p>The traditional world of the product and the marketing stategies have profoundly changed. Today, in a saturated and unbredictable market, it is not enough anymore to have a good traditional product or service, even when supported by a strong brand. Nowadays, a company, to stand out, has to sell not only products but also “solutions” designed to satisfy the needs of its customers. In order to offer “solutions” it is necessary to design, in the context of the product, an articulated system, made of a good distribution network, an innovative service and a specific communication strategy. The challenge for the future is to create a company network that combines everyone’s know-how and, once a potential customer group is identified, offers integrated solutions. To face this symbolic and systematic dimension, a company must rely on a new figure: the Business Designer. This is the person who is oriented to the production of capital, starts from the pluspoints and peculiarities of each of the companies to integrate them into a network, or to use them as input for the creation of new services and products. The Business Designer can create landscapes that increase the value of resources that can be used in fields that are totally different from the current ones of the company. This can lead to the creation of new businesses and to the improvement of the existing ones by developing new markets and trategies. Business Design combines market research, market strategies and the design of new products and services in a single elaboration process. Instead of the needs of the end user, the starting point of the Business Designer is the market and the selling properties of the “service” (or product). This is because when the service is moulded on its capacity to satisfy a need, it has a lot more probability of commercial success. The creation of new landscapes is based on the synergy of the pluspoints of the company and a new strategical approach. The starting points are explicit or latent needs of the market that are identified by a strategical marketing approach. After identifying all the pluspoints of the companies that belong to the network, it is important to verify everyones feedback and, if their validity is recognized, the newly designed business can be determined as a valid one. These pluspoints can be the most divergent: technology, distribution, material, supply network, know-how and even the clients. It is up to the Designer to create an additional “value” getting the most out of the available resources. The Business Designer is a new figure that is extremely useful for the marketing team or for the company management, because he can be helpful leading and developing projects of Corporate Strategy, Growth Strategy, and Business process redesign. Once the technical information is acquired, he has the capability of creating new technology landscapes and applications, and to adopt new strategies moving with mental agility and a holistic view of the whole process, from the market to the product, from distribution to the consumer, from communication to brand identity, in order to recognize and capture the profit zone. The creation of new businesses can lead to the realization of new products with innovative distribution methods, determining synergies between companies, cooperative business among operators from different branch offices. It can even lead to the creation of new spin-offs. The birth of new figures and strategies in the industrial field is not a rare case, in the 80-90’s for instance, some companies have foreseen that the consuming world was changing from the old product-centered model to a new customer-centered landscape. This is why companies like Swatch, Coca-Cola, Microsoft and others have renewed their strategies to specifically satisfy their customer’s needs. Probably in the future, companies, with the increasing competition and specialization - for example the new Chinese manufacturers - will have to reposition theirselves in a new landscape that is networkcentered, learning how to stay up-to-date with the continuously changing market requirements and how to offer services that are completely new and sometimes not even belonging to the company tradition. This, however, always starting from every resource that the company and its background has to offer. The profit of the future will not be just a consequence of the creation of the best product design but also of the best and most integrated business “system”.</p>

<p>Alan Lauder Morton was a diminutive Scottish international footballer during the inter-War years, best known for his stirring play as an outside-left and commitment to the administration of Glasgow Rangers football club for whom he gave long and devoted service as a director after retiring from active play in 1933. Even today a portrait of Morton in his Scottish strip stands at the top of the marble staircase at Ibrox’s Main Stand such is his enduring stature at the club.</p>
<p>Morton began his career in 1914 with Queen’s Park, the famous amateur club, of Glasgow, and became William ‘Bill’ Struth’s first signing as manager of Rangers. Morton only measured 5’4’’ in height but his talent lay in his physical balance, speed and thought. As a result of this association, Struth's intuitive training and the combination of an array of internationals (not least Bob MacPhail and Davie Meikeljohn), Glasgow Rangers enjoyed a sustained period of success. Highlights included the famous 1928 Scottish Cup triumph against Celtic in which Rangers ended a 25-year wait to win the Cup 4-0, as well Morton went onto receive winners’ medals as Scottish League champion in 1921, 1923, 1924, 1925, 1927-31 and as a Scottish Cup Winner in 1930 and receive a runners-up medals in 1921, 1922, 1929. Morton made his debut for Rangers against Airdrie on August 17 1920 and played his last game against the same opposition on January 7 1933 in between which ‘The Wee Blue Devil’ played 495 times and scored 115 goals.</p>
<p>Morton had already been capped as an international before joining Rangers (making his debut for Scotland on 26 February 1920 against Wales) but would go on to play in every international against the Auld Enemy, England, from 1920 to 1932 bar the Wembley fixture in 1926, eventually winning 31 caps (29 with Rangers). In addition he made 15 appearances (scoring 1 goal) for the Scottish League (making his debut on 22 February 1919 against the Football League at St. Andrews, Birmingham) and 3 Scotland Victory International appearances (the first of which was on 26 April 1919 at Goodison Park, Everton in front of 45,000 in a 2-2 draw).</p>
<p>It was in the 1928 full international in London where Morton was to achieve mythical status when part of an under-rated Scottish side that beat England 5-1 in driving rain to record a famous triumph that exhibited wonderful combinations of football and the legendary moniker the ‘Wembley Wizards’. Three of Morton’s crosses were converted by Huddersfield's Alec Jackson. Ivan Sharpe, a famous football writer, wrote of the victory: ‘England were not merely beaten. They were bewildered – run to a standstill, made to appear utterly inferior by a team whose play was as cultured and beautiful as I ever expect to see.’</p>
<p>After retiring Morton’s impact was felt as an administrator becoming a powerful figure within Scottish sport and, further a-field, demonstrated an inclination toward Unionist politics in reaction to the rise in post-War Scottish nationalism.</p>

<p>In 1995, Craig Byrnes (member of the Chesapeake Bay Bears, Washington, DC and known to many bears of this area as Mr. Baltimore Bear Cub '93 und Mr. TBLC of Virginia '94), thought it might be fitting to design a flag that would best represent the bear community, since there was no "official" flag yet. After drawing and sewing four variations, Craig presented those prototype flags at the "Bears of Summer" events of the Chesapeake Bay Bears in July of 1995. Bears were asked to put a quarter in the appropriate box to vote for the flag that they liked best. The money was donated to the Chesapeake Bay Bears to add to their AIDS fundraising collections. The winning flag shows a simple design: a field of horizontal stripes with a paw print in the upper left corner. The colours represent the fur colours and nationalities of bears throughout the world (here the animals are meant).</p>
<p>Craig Byrnes always was very serious about getting the flag out and visible. He had been very generous about donating flags to bear clubs, but you also could buy the flags from him. His company "Bear Manufacturing" became the nameplate for a whole line of bear-focused products. Early in 2002 Craig Byrnes announced that he does not intend to follow up on the trademark so that the International Bear Brotherhood Flag can be used free by the bear community. Craig Byrnes also closed his company "Bear Manufacturing".</p>

In November, 1971, the citizens of Grand Rapids freely elected Parks as the city's mayor, and he openly defeated Boelens &amp; several other candidates. In 1975, Parks lost the mayoral race, but continued to serve the City of Grand Rapids as a clerk in the city's Traffic Bureau, while continuing his dedicated service to the church full-time. In 1982, he was appointed to the State Officers Compensation Commission by Governor William Milliken.</p>
<p>Parks served as pastor for Bethel AME Church in Marion, Indiana from 1944-47, and as pastor for Bethel AME Church in Richmond, Indiana, from 1947-1951. In 1951, he received an honorary Doctorate in Divinity from Allen University. He served as pastor at the Bethel AME Church of Ann Arbor, Michigan, from 1952-64, and pastor of the AME Church of River Rogue, Michigan, from 1964-1966. In 1966, Parks became the pastor of First Community AME Church in Grand Rapids, Michigan where he served until 1986.</p>
<p>In 1986, Parks retired from his position as pastor of First Community AME Church, and became pastor of Greater Institutional AME Church in Chicago, Illinois until his retirement in 2000. Parks and his wife Cleo returned to Grand Rapids, Michigan, to enjoy their retirement in January of 2001. Together, they have 6 surviving children, 14 grandchildren, and 3 great-grandchildren.</p>

<p>Minimores are generally small furry creatures, believed to be reincarnated cushions. But may 'appear' as any household object that has soft stuffing and a soft or furry exterior. They will sometimes take on the appearance of a 'teddy bear' or another similar child's soft toy</p>
<p>You will know if your soft toy is a Minimore because it will be attracted to magnets (i.e. it will show a liking for them), it may frequently get lost and when you see it you will usually feel a rush of affection for the creature</p>
<p>In fact, a boy named Thomas Mellors had a sofa that mysteriously manouvred itself overnight into proximity with his magnet collection, which was later confirmed by subject expert Sean Young to be the largest known minimore in existence</p>

<p>The Volksempfänger ("Peoples Reciever") was a cheap subsidised <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a> set sold in Nazi Germany to enable working class citizens to hear <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> broadcasters.</p>
<p>Unlike most other sets on sale in Europe at the time the Volksempfänger was not designed to be capable of recieving foreign broadcasting stations easily nonetheless such reception was (contrary to popular belief) often possible.</p>
<p>Only German (and later Austrian) stations could be listened to legally in Nazi Germany. In occupied countries similar restrictions were in place with all radio listening In some countries non Germans were not allowed to possess radio sets at all&#160;! Penelties for listening to foreign stations ranged from confiscation of radio's to imprisonment (and in later years the death penelty) Attempts were also made at <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamming.html" title="Jamming">jamming</a> some foreign stations.</p>
<p>Volksempfänger sets were designed to only have sufficent sensetivity to recieve nearby stations. <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shortwave.html" title="Shortwave">Shortwave</a> bands were not included. It was common practice at the time among European radio manufacturers to mark the dial positions of all major stations both domestic and in neighbouring countries but on Volksempfängers only pro German stations had their dial positions marked on the tuning scale (the cheaper versions didnt have a proper tuning scale at all).</p>

<p>Knights back in the middle ages were not as chilverious as we thought they were.</p>
<p>Knight were actaully very cowardly. After saving someone, a lot of the time the knights would steal their belonging and leave them for dead. The knights were horrible criminals.</p>
<p>The word we usually use to describe knights, chilvarous, actually doesn't mean, "brave and witty". The word came from the gaelic word, <i>chivalronicia</i>, which means, "use of the black knights sword, in a galant way".</p>

<p>Created by Lager from Taiwan. Fairyland currently exists in a few different language versions like: Taiwanese, Hong Kong, Europe, and US version. The game itself is the same, with the difference of the release date and hence the number of patches that version had acquired. Taiwanese version is currently the one with the latest patch. For English players in the US version are still behind by about some patches. There will be a new patch usually after 3-4 months. The current English patch is Aladdin. Each patch delivers new content and gameplay and is free to download.</p>
<p>Faryland is a very childish game with cute graphic, the story is taken from many of the world's most known fairytales. Like Cinderella, Little red riding hood, Alladin and the 40 robbers, Sleeping beauty, Snowwhite and the 7 dwarves. Due to it's cute graphic you can easily find many female players.</p>
<p>There are 3 races: Human, Elf and dwarf</p>
<p>Player can first at level 1 pick to be apprenticeship as a: Diviner, warrior, or journeyman.</p>
<p>Then at level 10 they can further change into: Diviner apprentice: Acolyte of light, acolyte of darkness, priest, mage. Warrior apprentice: Axeman, bladesman, swordsman. Journeyman apprentice: Martial artist, beastmaster, trader.</p>
<p>At level 60 they can for one final time further change into another advance class, if they wish. They will gain more skill/spell.</p>
<p>Acolyte of light -&gt; Architect of light. Acolyte of darkness -&gt; Schemer of darkness. Priest -&gt; Pontifex. Mage -&gt; Archmage.</p>
<p>Axeman -&gt; Beserker. Bladesman -&gt; Blademaster. Swordsman -&gt; Swordssage.</p>
<p>Martial artist -&gt; Kungfu Master. Beastmaster -&gt; Beastlord. Trader -&gt; Merchant Prince.</p>
<p>Gameplay will remind many about the Final Fantasy 7 game. They have almost the same battle system. A player will walk around in the wild, and randomly a battle will spawn. You and up to 4 others (not counting your pet) in your party will line up against up to 10 other enemy monster. Battle is turn based. The character with higher number in dexterity will move first and there is a fixed counter that tells you how much time you have before making the battle commands.

<p>Samuel Barratt is little known Nazi activist believed to be currently residing in the Northamptonshire countryside (UK). Little is known about his whereabouts as shortly after full time education – he disappeared. He was arrested in the early 90’s but Northamptonshire police refused to confirm or deny rumours that he had escaped whilst being transferred between NCP (Northampton Community Prison) and NSB (Northampton medium-Security Barracks (Formerly known as Northamptonshire’s Self correction facility – NSCF))</p>

<p>Some psychologists believe that his unorthodox upbringing led to his criminal behaviour. Raised as the child of two male parents, Barratt was constantly tormented at school; interviewees were known to have said that Barratt was unusually active during discussion of race riots and the holocaust, consistently displaying his opinions from a far-right perspective. Firstly they believed that this was due to beliefs at home but found no further evidence to back this up.</p>
<p>Barratt had a younger male sibling who later changed his name under the Witness protection act (1979) to avoid any further unnecessary danger to himself. For the sake of comprehension, we shall refer to him as “John”. John was frequently the subject of sexual attacks from his older brother, much to the disbelief of DI Dixon.</p>
<p>DI Dixon: “We found it hard to believe the nature in which “John” was attacked. At first we could not comprehend the ferocity that his own brother used against him. We cannot release anymore specific details except that they were deranged attacks with weapons, disturbingly, some involving cutlery.” Source: Northampton Chronicle and Echo 1986</p>

<p>Barratt was frequently excluded from his Secondary school (High School) for hate crimes and racist acts against fellow pupils; he was first noticed as a racist when he took part in a mock election, standing for the BNP (British National Party). He took their already controversial views and added his own sadistic twists to them. The school later withdrew his entry for election because of reports of anti-Semitic acts towards the son of the leader of the local Synagogue, Chief Rabbi Iain Topham. He completed secondary education and disappeared at the age of 16 achieving exquisite grades in music and history.</p>

<p>Barratt was found in the store rooms of a famous East London Football Club dealing class A drugs along with stolen Eastern European pornography. However, he was not dealt with immediately and disappeared once again into the vast London metropolis. In his early twenties he was rumoured to have linked up with other previously convicted felons only known as “The Mask of Dorro” and “The Bald Eagle”, both of which continue to trouble the London metropolitan police. Because of the time of his capture,(late September 2001) the national media decided it was too sensitive a time to release details about Barratt. He was known only by locals who crossed paths with him and local residents who heard about him in their local newspapers. They were shocked to learn that not only was he a thief, but frequently held racial hate rallies and urged followers to commit hate crimes. He was caught in a drugs raid where two other dealers were caught. He was first taken back to Northampton to be convicted of earlier crimes. Then he made his escape.</p>

<p>Third Verse Lyrics:</p>
<p>And when I think that God, His son not sparing, Sent hime to die, I scarce can take it in; That on that cross, My burden gladly bearing, He bled and died to take away my sin.</p>
