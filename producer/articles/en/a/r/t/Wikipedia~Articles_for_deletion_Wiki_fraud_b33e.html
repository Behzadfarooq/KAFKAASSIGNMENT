<p>An essay on factual inaccuracy and lack of citation on Wikipedia. Prod (which pointed out that the article itself has a lack of citation) removed with the comment: <i>WIkipedia has no policy requiring that everyone cite their sources.

<li><b>Delete</b> "Wiki-fraud" or "Wiki fraud" (the article uses these terms interchangably) is a non-notable neologism, made up by the author of the article as far as I can see. The article also (regardless of what the authour says) breaches <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> by not citing sources. Also appears not to be written from a NPOV (i.e. suggesting 99% of articles subject to wiki-fraud, reference to people referring to Wikipedia as "slack-jawed yokels").<a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules</a> 11:23, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

(<small>Also, the "driving force behind the American Scholastic Board's barring of using Wikipedia as a source in any student's Ph.D thesis paper" isn't "wiki fraud", but a desire for primary and secondary sources in such writing - citing an encyclopedia in a thesis paper would get you laughed at; although Wikipedia is a nice encyclopedia, it remains an encyclopedia.

</ul>
<p>THIS IS THE AUTHOR OF THE ARTICLE</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, Wikipedia's rule on Reliable sources is:</li>
</ul>
<p>"Edits that rely on primary sources should only make descriptive claims that can be checked by anyone without specialist knowledge. Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable, published secondary sources wherever possible." Keyword - whenever possible. So if it is not possible (for any reason at all, as there are no stated guidelines as to what defines impossibility) an author does not have to specify the sources of his facts, or even have any sources for his facts, period. AND since the author did not specify a source, one has no way of knowing whether this fact has come from a primary reference or secondary reference - thus, every uncited fact is arguably taken from a secondary source, which do to SOME factor, whatever that factor may be, citing that source is impossible. Hence, the unreferenced fact is fully in compliance with wikipeida's rules on reliable sources.</p>
<p>Thus, an unreferenced fact is a reliable source! (Wikipeida's rules, not mine)</p>
<p>Hence, the argument that this article should be deleted because not citing sources is against wikipedia policy is spurious at best.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Second, this article has been proposed for deletion because of wikipedia's policy on neologisms. However, wikipedia has plenty of article's on neologisms already - wikipedia's page on deletion says email is a neologism, but wikipedia has an entry on e-mail. Thus if you delete the page on wiki fraud, to be consistent, you have to go delete EVERY article on neologisms; now what kind of so called "Encyclopeida" would wikipedia be if it did not have an article on e-mail.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Thirdly, as to the claims that this article is inaccurate: Where are your sources? (Show me your sources and I will show you mine.) By Proposing that this article should because deleted because the facts contained in the article are inaccurate, without providing evidence in support of your own claims, is a little hypocritical at best.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Finally, in response to "thought police officer's" comment: "Most of this is already covered in Essjay controversy anyway. No use rubbing salt in anyone's wounds. -- - (Elkspeak)"</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, we see the real reason why this article is being deleted. It is being deleted, not because it is against any of wikipedia's policies, but because it points out the major flaws in wikipedia - it rubs salt in wikipedia's wounds. Hence, Jimmy Wales' Thought police, have been sent out to squash all opposition, as always.</p>
<p>That's why the article is being deleted; not because there is anything wrong with the article, but because its against your own beliefs'. Thus, wikipedia's ugly secrets make make their presence known again. This is not an encylopedia; its a mere forum where one party's beliefs are presented as fact, and any questioning/critism of these facts is immediately eradicated. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Dimdawg (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dimdawg_cf76.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dimdawg">contribs</a>) 2007-03-09 09:27:04 (UTC)</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as a neologism. Where does it say that "email" is a neologism? Catchphrases passed through chain emails may be neologisms, but email itself is not.

<dd>Quoting Wikipedia's entry on the word Neologism</dd>
<dd>" neologism (from Greek νεολογισμός "νέος" [neos] = new; "λόγος" [logos] = word) is a word, term, or phrase which has been recently created ("coined") — often to apply to new concepts, to synthesize pre-existing concepts, or to make older terminology sound more contemporary. Neologisms are especially useful in identifying inventions, new phenomena, or old ideas which have taken on a new cultural context. The term e-mail, as used today, is an example of a neologism."(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism</a>)</dd>
