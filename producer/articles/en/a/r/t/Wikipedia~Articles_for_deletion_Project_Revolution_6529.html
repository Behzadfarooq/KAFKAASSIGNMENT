<p>A non-notable mod that's still being created, not notable outside of creators. Also confusable with <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_Revolution_dcb8.html" title="Nintendo Revolution">Nintendo Revolution</a>. Wikipedia is not <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_b5e0.html" title="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a>.--<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatCheng_566b.html" title="User:PatCheng">PatCheng</a> 01:34, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - While it's still being created, and not necessarily notable until release, as many mods of otherwise notable scope go unfinished and unreleased, I'd say this mod's scope would definitely qualify it as notable if it was actually completed. Furthermore, some of the nomination's comments seem strange to me - some quick research shows that <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Revolution_6333.html" title="Project Revolution">Project Revolution</a> (apparently founded in 2003) predates the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_Revolution_dcb8.html" title="Nintendo Revolution">Nintendo Revolution</a> (unveiled in 2005). Furthermore, this material doesn't really belong on <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_b5e0.html" title="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a>, not being a commercial game nor a guide to a game, and I was not aware that similarities in name were a reason for an AfD. -- <a href="../../../i/m/b/User%7EImban_8637.html" title="User:Imban">Imban</a> 01:43, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - if it becomes big after being released, then it'll merit an article.

<li><b>Keep</b> - ""Project Revolution" Starcraft" returns many relevant results, in multiple langauges.

<li><b>Delete</b>, however, allow re-make of article after the project is released, and if it becomes particularly notable(especially if it shows up in a magazine article)--<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVercalos_9f82.html" title="User:Vercalos">Vercalos</a> 06:55, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Article author here. To the person who mentioned magazine articles, Project Revolution has already been in several of them, most notably twice in "Computer Gaming World". However, please understand that these articles cannot be pasted or linked to for proof due to copyright reasons. I no longer work for Project Revolution, and if this article gets deleted it will not likely return unless someone else does it. - Siloh

<ul>
<li>In that case, just google for "Project Revolution" "Computer Gaming World" (as one phrase, with the quotes). There are far too many links to list here. - Siloh
<ul>
<li>Which is exactly what people with no <i>real</i> evidence tend to say — they don't need to prove anything. But an argument without cited evidence is just an opinion. Don't expect other people to make your case for you. Show us one or two links you think are representative.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am Cooler one of the coders for the Project. We have been in gaming magazines two times as Siloh said. I would have to disagree with the fact that this project is not well known. We have over 1700 fan base registered users on the site alone. As well as our parent site Warcraft 3 Campaigns the leader of the wc3 mod community who has over 10,000 active members we are considered the largest and most famous of wc3 mods to date. We are also have an exclusive deal which <a href="http://www.sclegacy.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.sclegacy.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sclegacy.com/</a> one of the largest SC fan sites who also owns the famous blizzforums who has over 28,000 users and our mod is constantly mistaken by them and the web for starcraft 2. This is one of the main reasons for this article to stop confusion that a starcraft 2 is in production by blizzard. If I am not mistaken this one reasons why wikipedia exists to stop information confusion on the subject if this articles is removed at least put line in the SC one that says and any screen shots of sc2 are more then likely that of this wc3 total conversion.Also how could the article have rumors in it when it comes from the staff who is creating it. So all information is as accurate as possible. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECooler2_0107.html" title="User:Cooler2">Cooler2</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECooler2_5a71.html" title="User talk:Cooler2">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cooler2_0102.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cooler2">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I found this article extremely useful - isn't that what wikipedia is for? There is a lot of information here that I'm glad for, and if the mod does get released it will be extremely popular. -- <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_d67c.html" title="User:Anonymous">User:Anonymous</a> 11:59, 5 March 2006 (UTC) <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 12.214.214.227 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.214.214.227_0c88.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.214.214.227">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> If anyone actually bothered to do an in-depth research about PR, they would find that it won second place on Mod DB awards, a huge mod site, <a href="http://features.moddb.com/111/?fpage=15" class="external free" title="http://features.moddb.com/111/?fpage=15" rel="nofollow">http://features.moddb.com/111/?fpage=15</a> PR won against fierce competition and only lost the first place to a mod who benefited from Half-Life's enormous popularity. And if that is not enough to guarantee that PR will be a huge success when released, then consider that PR is a TOTAL conversion, one that is intended to make StraCraft 3D that is much like the much-anticipated StarCraft 2. PR also benefits from StarCraft's popularity. PR is seeking multiple large sites to mirror it when released, proving that the staff has reason to expect mass downloading. I believe that a person qualified to vote here should at least know just how anticipated StarCraft 2 is and what PR represents to the SC fanbase. I am CNX, a PR forum user.Elenalkarnur 21:05, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
