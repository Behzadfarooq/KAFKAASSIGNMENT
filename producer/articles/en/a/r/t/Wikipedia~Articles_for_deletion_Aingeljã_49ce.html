<dd>Wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopedia and not an art gallery. The other articles on conlangs may not be appropriate either. I am not singling you out for any reason — I merely noticed that you added Aingeljã numbers to the numbers article. Maybe there is a conlang wiki somewhere where you can display your art.

<li><b>Delete</b>. While I am a conlanger and support efforts to make conlanging more widely known, Wikipedia is not the place for this content. Instead, individual conlangs should be documented in personal sites and linked to from Wikipedia. (I also assert that articles such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scream_bf00.html" title="The Scream">The Scream</a> should be combined with the articles related to their creators, unless the artist in question is sufficiently prolific to make it difficult to find information in that format.)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scream_bf00.html" title="The Scream">The Scream</a> is a prime example of why we shouldn't combine them with the author; you don't need to know who painted <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scream_bf00.html" title="The Scream">The Scream</a> to be familiar with the painting, and there are many reinterpretations of the painting that stand independent of the original artist. You can be interested in The Scream without caring about Edward Munch. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 21:53, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Aingeljã is an excellent conlang with an excellent web presence. I dó think, however, that Wikipedia is not the place to accomodate its entire grammar. IMO the article should be a short description of the language, not an outline of its grammar. But all in all, I don't think a VfD is warranted on that base. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 23:13, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I still think that the article is OK here, as it only shows a summary of the summary of the summary of the Grammar of Aingeljã. Anyone who finds it interesting can learn more at the official website. However, in order to guarantee that it isn't deleted, I can rewrite the contents of the article, if the majority of Wikipedians votes so. But I think that, as far as this conlang exists today and anybody can study it or read about it somewhere else, there's no reason to delete it here. I'm an enthusiastic Wikipedian user and I'd be completely disappointed with Wikipedia if this article, and those about other artistic conlangs, were deleted. Don't get confused about an <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_auxiliary_language.html" title="International auxiliary language">auxilanguage</a> like <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a>, which tries to help the communication between people, and an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_languages.html" title="Artistic languages">artlang</a>, which is a personal work of art, modest and humble after all. Please <b>keep</b> the article. <a href="../../../a/s/s/User%7EAssdl_0f29.html" title="User:Assdl">Assdl</a> 14:50, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><s><b>Delete</b>. As a conlanger, and much as I would like to make public the art of conlanging to the greatest extent possible, I really don't see the need for grammatical treatises and descriptions of individual conlangs here on the Wikipedia.</s> There is already a good Wikipedia article, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_language.html" title="Artistic language">Artistic language</a>, which should serve as a central locus for this particular art form. Though I disagree with the terminology "professional" v. "amateur" (I really don't think Syldavian counts as a professional conlang, as it's merely part of a corpus of literature), there is quite a long list of conlangs there. I think it vèry meet and right for conlangers to link to their own pages or to some other conlang oriented source, if they wish to do so. I wouldn't create a Wikipedia article for any of my conlangs, and if I found one, I'ld delete it for the reasons stated. -- Specific to the query below, "I really don't understand why you don't like my article about Aingeljã" I don't think the problem has to do with style or contents of the article itself. The problem is that the Wikipedia isn't the appropriate location for the article. A conlang related Wiki would be more appropriate, and that article could easily by linked to from <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_language.html" title="Artistic language">Artistic language</a>.

<dd>As pieces of art, they deserve articles in the same situation as any other pieces of art. There's no reason to not include an article just because it's a conlang. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 21:53, 24 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm certainly not against this in principle. My position isn't really that this conlang or that does not <b>deserve</b> an article, the question is really whether it <b>warrants</b> an article. Wikipedia describes itself as striving to offer the internet public what they could otherwise get in a paper encyclopedia but is also kept up to the minute. Generally speaking, authoritative encyclopedias don't cover fictional worlds and similar works of art (unless they are famous). It can (and should) certainly cover the art of conlanging or conculturing; I think it's quite sufficient, given the purpose and scope of the project, to link to an external article about a conlang or conculture. Elemtilas
<dl>
<dd>But that's a lousy description of what Wikipedia is. Wikipedia offers the public a depth and richness that no paper encyclopedia reaches. <a href="../../../k/r/y/Krypto.html" title="Krypto">Krypto</a> is an article that no general paper encyclopedia could afford to spend the paper on, but that doesn't mean it should be deleted. We have the space and the power to be far more comprehensive than a paper encyclopedia and we historically have been far more comprehensive than a paper encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 21:21, 25 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Lousy as that description may be, it is condensed from the article <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>! If we can and should afford to keep around articles on Captain Kirk or Krypto, then by all means we should keep articles on Aingelja and Wenedyk. Elemtilas</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> -- having found and read the deletion policies, I have to reconsider my opinion. I still don't think most conlangs warrant individual articles, but they are works of art and as such should not necessarily be removed simply because some people don't get the artform or can't think of anything better than personal attacks against the artists that create languages. Anyone who wants to create such an article on a conlang should be responsible enough to really consider whether this piece of artwork warrants an individual and unique article of its own. If possible, this article should be merged with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructed_languages.html" title="Constructed languages">Constructed languages</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_languages.html" title="Artistic languages">Artistic languages</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>, for all of you who have complained about the extension and detail of the text, I've reduced considerably the article. I hope you'll like it more now.

<li><b>Delete</b>. A spiffy language with a well-done webpage, but not notable enough for Wikipedia: no evidence of its being influential on other conlangs, or having any speakers besides the author, or indeed any strong fans.

<dd>Yes, I agree. I do not entirely agree with all your notability criteria, but I have to admit that you made an excellent beginning. Furthermore, I agree: Aingeljã's website is one of the best of its kind, but what I find an even more astonishing achievement is the 116 p. long grammar, written in the language itself!

<dd>Hi, I really don't understand why you don't like my article about Aingeljã). This is an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_language.html" title="Artistic language">artistic personal constructed language</a>, there is already a category in this Wikipedia about this kind of languages. This is a very short summary of the Grammar, which can be read thoroughly in the external links.
