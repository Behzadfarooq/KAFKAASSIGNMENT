	    <p>I am the owner of the Oxygen Network. Before marking it for deletion, I suggest that in the future a bit of research and perhaps a simple email to the admin (since the email address is clearly available on each website) is sent.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The Oxygen Network was originally started in 1999. Toby Butterfield, Oprah's legal representive, had a past legal dispute in early 2005 with the Oxygen Network. It was found that Oh Oxygen did NOT succeed with the dispute since there was no relation between the two sites and Oh Oxygen was only international in 2000. (Of course emails can be provided proving this fact) I should also add that whether or not people intend to search for Oh Oxygen and get the Oxygen Network is of no relevance. The Oxygen Network has worked hard to receive it's current footing. It would be as if someone was searching for Apple Computing and inadvertantley went to Apple Corp's website.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The Oxygen Network (<a href="http://network.oxygen-inc.com" class="external free" title="http://network.oxygen-inc.com" rel="nofollow">http://network.oxygen-inc.com</a>) is indeed a non-profit organization because it supports a variety of sites from different individuals who cannot afford to run their own server or need help getting started. Obviously it would be difficult to prove such a fact, however I am willing to show expenditure compared to any income received at all.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Finally, in regards to wikipediax.org, since you are representing Wikipedia as a moderator or admin, you should also seek out more information regarding that site. WikipediaX was originally a site that used the WikiMedia script in order to provide a humourous version of Wikipedia, after a couple of emails and discussions with Brad Patrick (Wikimedia Foundation), I decided to simply redirect wikipediax.org to wikipedia.com out of gratiousness in order to show no foul intent rather than make a fuss.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I hope that clarifies a few points. Perhaps it can also be integrated into the original page if needed.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Kind regards, K Saleh</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I should also comment on this "This article has been around for a while, and a few people commented on it and blanked it" Those comments and blankings were by the same individual, a person who has a grudge against myself after I was selected over that person to design a business website.</p>
<p>"The article does look very promotional, and most of the sites on this "network" have little or no content (such as WikipediaX), and certainly seem nn." I apologize if it looks promotional, I was/am unfamiliar with how to format it correctly. Many of the sites on the Oxygen Network are quite well known among various communities. A few sites are also undergoing a redesign, if any sites within the network seem to have little or no content I can assure you that is not the case. With regards to Wikipediax it has been mentioned above. AnimeOfficial is being redesigned, but what other site has no content, why is it said that most of the sites have little content. Not all sites can be as full and elaborate as others.</p>
<p>By all means, I understand that Wikipedia tries to control a level of relevance in order to provide information that is true and appreciated, and that is why I am explaining things.</p>
<p>I merely hoped that others would be able to add to the page rather than myself. Note that I never actually replaced the original page but shared the space with Oh Oxygen (I am referring to the Wikipedia page)</p>
