<ul>
<li>You didn't appreciate why I said it was needless. I didn't vote a simple keep, I voted merge/redirect. You can place a redirect without an AFD. If this was List of Jo Blough Remixes, an AFD would be warranted. You could put in a redirect by youself, in under a minute. Instead, you'll waste 5-days, and several peoples time. Also, next time you do an AFD, be sure to put the text "AFD" in the edit summary, so watchers of the article are aware of what you've done. Also, as deletion is not "minor" please don't mark the addition of the AFD tag as a "minor edit", as you did. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 20:03, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete/merge</b> is certainly reasonable. This is not, and doesn't look like it even could be, an encyclopedia article. I'm not sure I agree that the Afd is pointless tho. It gives us the chance to come to the conclusion that this list should not be an entire article by itself. I've no prejudice against some of the content being merged elsewhere, as appropriate. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 20:39, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. BTW, depending how the Afd goes, it might make it harder to merge. There seems to be a growing feeling that a prior Afd prevents merging after it's over. I don't agree with this even a little bit, but many other editors apparently think that way. Also, I'm not sure this is useful as a redirect, so even if merging is the main goal, the deletion question probably still needs to be resolved. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 20:42, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: I though generally merge+delete (combined) is not an option, due to GFDL, which requies retention of edit history of old article, if its content are used in another article, in order to ensure attribution requirements are met. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 20:54, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Could be, I'm far from an expert on licensing issues. At any rate, there's no actual content here, so maybe it's not an issue in this case? If the names of notable remixes get used elsewhere, who's to say that it came from this article and not from a CD jacket or somewhere else? <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 21:06, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Just because the school is closed does not mean it is insignificant. Even if a politician did <b>not</b> attend that school, keeping an article on it (and expanding it) would be a valuable tool to historians who do not live in the immediate area of the school and do not have access to town records. Is that not one of the purposes of Wikipedia? To provide information that might otherwise be hard to access? Being a former public school, it is certainly significant enough to include in the ranks of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirenexx_d9a9.html" title="User:Firenexx">firenexx</a> 15:14, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b>. As far as I am concerned, the point of concern here is that the school is non-notable, not that it has closed.

There were three hits, all articles about boxing; none of them mentions any "Rocky Day." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:35, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>**<i>Not Delete'</i> Hmmm, some people waste their time to put important things here, but others say delete it, Rocky day is not a hoax and if you read it its a day of good intentions. Talk about War in Iraq, majority of people believed it was good in usa, now they do not. Now, if something is not popuplar or not known today, that does not mean it will not be tomorrow, simple as it sounds, so if you idiots want to delete it, fine, but when the day becomes popular I will make sure Wikipedia has no right to have these articles, because you people run the way you like it and think the way you like it and in your small minds you think you are rights based on the lousy standards you created.</b></p>
<p><b>It would also be good to grow up and realize that google does not carry everything in the world, then again, we may agree with you, you do have a little point, but in that case, instaed of deleting you can always put an asterix to the side that claims that neutrality of this article could be disputed... BUt of course, people with little minds can not think of that...</b></p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - Come on people, we should have an article about the history of sexual abuse as a social problem, it's an interesting subject.

<ul>
<li>Well, my reply to that would be: We should definitely have <i>information</i> about the history of sexual abuse as a social problem. But only once we actually <i>have</i> that information should we have an article on it. As JZGYK says, it's much better to develop the subject at the existing article, and spin off into a sub-article if and when we have enough for such an article. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:20, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I might be revealing a little POV here, but just because Beevis &amp; Butthead used it doesn't mean it belongs here. I second the above notion, which is that I don't even see why Wiktionary needs this entry.

<li><i>Most</i> dictionaries include slang words, and Wiktionary is no exception. To know what the standards are, please read the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion" class="extiw" title="wikt:Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion">Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:59, 31 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Granting that, I wonder if Wiktionary needs to include <b>vulgar slang</b>? Vulgar slang would be different than mere slang; there is a big difference between say, "yinz" (Pittsburgh slang) and the entry in question, Assmunch. I would also challenge the Attestation angle for inclusion in Wiktionary; mention of the term in Friends and Beevis &amp; Butthead wouldn't seem to meet any of the four criteria for Attestation. If it were sent over to Wiktionary, it would be likely challenged there by people who know much more than I do; in that event, it would be like "passing the buck" to Wiktionary <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 20:40, 31 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The term under consideration fails the Wiktionary criteria: (1) it is not clearly in widespread use, (2) it is not used in a well-known work, (3) it doesn't appear in a refereed academic journal, and (4) it is not used in permanently-recorded media, conveying meaning, in at least three independent instances spanning at least a year (as far as i know). <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <span class="user-sig-date"><small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">12-31</a>&#160;20:36<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></span></i></span></li>
<li>Whether a word is a slang word, vulgar or otherwise, is irrelevant as far as the Wiktionary inclusion criteria are concerned. You are conflating two different things, by the way. Whether this word satisfies the Wiktionary criteria for inclusion is not the same as whether this specific article should be transwikified to Wiktionary. Sometimes words will satisfy the criteria for inclusion, but Wiktionary already has articles, or simply could do better (than the dictionary articles mis-placed in Wikipedia) from a standing start. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 05:03, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't recall any guideline that says they are, or are not. I suppose <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> could be used to argue that they're not notable. However, go with common sense: many aristocrats are notable (a lot of people get titles <i>because</i> they're notable), but there are just as many who are not, who sit around looking like horses and flipping through <i>Burke's Peerage</i>. This sort of thing needs to be judged on a case-by-case basis, not as a simple, blanket "aristocrats are/are not notable" thing. I'd say being an aristocrat makes them <i>much more likely</i> to be worth knowing about, but doesn't quite seal the bargain. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 18:23, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi. Sorry I confused hoaxing and nonsense, although there's enough absurdity to make me label it nonsense. Anyway, even if the article claims subject is important, it still qualifies as a speedy nn-bio. The only reason nn-bio would not be a good reason is if some <i>indication or evidence</i> of notability was presented in article. None is in this case. For example, initiating a reading group is not support for notability, and neither is receiving A levels (not to mention his alleged result). In other words, if you see an article that looks like an nn-bio but it starts out by saying the subject is very famous or important, it's still a speedy under nn-bio. That's my understanding. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 14:14, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy criteria</a> disagrees with that. An assertion of notability is all that is required; not evidence.

<dd>With all due respect, it doesn't. Please take a closer look at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_of_vanity_articles_63d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion of vanity articles">Wikipedia:Deletion_of_vanity_articles</a>. It notes that it is important to consider only <i>significant</i> assertions and the plausibility of an assertion. Assertions of notability should be at least "remotely plausible". Note that the more complete policy (not the snippet you quoted) says "An article about a real person that does not assert that person's importance or significance - people such as college professors or actors may be individually important in society; people such as students and bakers are not, or at least not for the reason of being a student or baker. If the assertion is disputed or controversial, it should be taken to VFD instead." It should at least be clear from this that what is meant by "assertion" is quite different than what you mean. Here assertion means a statement of some fact that would indicate notability, not an outright statement such as "he is important". If we couldn't speedy articles that started with "X is notable", simply because it asserted notability in this way, a lot of vanity articles would not get speedied the way they do now. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 01:33, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To quote <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_of_vanity_articles_63d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion of vanity articles">Wikipedia:Deletion_of_vanity_articles</a>: "Only those articles where there is no remotely plausible assertion of notability should be considered for Wikipedia:Speedy deletion." Rejected speedies show up on Afd all the time because notability was claimed. But we're going astray of the main purpose of this page.

<p>My response to this&#160;:</p>
<p>I am not the person you name but I did the articles based on extensive coverage he receives in the Scottish printed press &amp; television, not just "on a bit of protest coverage by the BBC". Winning Parliamentary debates which turn into successful legislation &amp; changes in regulatory rules, helping users of a required service - that of a solicitor is on the whole, more than 'a bit of a protest'.</p>
<p>You can delete the articles if you like. It is your privilege to do so.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, in the short statement left in the blanked article, there was no one identified by name who "demanded " that the article be removed.</p>
<p>i note the matter &amp; issues arising. Based on this, I am no longer interested in wikipedia.</p>
<p>As far as Google searches go, Life in Scotland doesn't yet hang on their every reference. I note the reference to <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>. There's plenty of that around anyway so it will do no good to add to it then. Please therefore delete the articles forthwith.</p>
<p>So, Tomlillis, two days on, the article has not been deleted, contrary to my request to do so, but one of my articles certainly has. What gives&#160;? Since I am happy for the articles to be deleted, along with my userid, quoting Wikipedia's policy on such matters as expressed in the terms of deletion, I don't see why the article should be kept around longer, unless it's just to get some more knives stuck into it.</p>

<li>User:EditingAllison has been steadily adding these one-line episode lists this evening; see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/EditingAllison" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/EditingAllison" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> (and see more AfDs below).

<p>Per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: "Collections of photographs or media files with no text to go with the articles. If you are interested in presenting a picture, please provide an encyclopedic context, or consider adding it to Wikimedia Commons." I have tried several times to explain to the two editors on <a href="../../../m/a/i/Talk%7EMaine_Coon_a908.html#Pictures" title="Talk:Maine Coon">Talk:Maine Coon#Pictures</a> about this policy, and the other flaws with this page; apparently my interpretation is wrong and once "consensus" has been reached on an issue, you can't touch anything. I even spent time creating a gallery on Commons, <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Maine_Coon" class="extiw" title="commons:Maine_Coon">commons:Maine Coon</a> and linked to it, as is the norm, but my efforts were swiftly reverted (and my other edits unrelated to the issue keep getting reverted in the process, so this may be a case of <a href="../../../o/w/n/Wikipedia%7EOwnership_of_articles_36eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Ownership of articles">article ownership</a> instead of objective reasoning).

<p>Here's the whole history. Obviously this afd tag is a ploy to force action by user jiy. I noticed you left out a few things about the issue. Nothing like making a whole new page to hash out what has already been decided by consensus because you think you know better. Your know your edits were reverted because they violated a previous consensus, were made without ANY previous discussion or warning on the talk page, and constitute a narrow and incorrect interpretation of policy. Stop crying "poor me!" and acting like you've been wronged. You blatantly ignored the history of the article and when no one agreed with you you started this. If you had used tact and correct ettiquite, maybe people would be more willing to listen. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">Pschemp</a> 04:50, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is an elaborate little article, but it's author seems to have invented the term. For starters, the "syndrome" at hand is most commonly related to a much older incident - the switching of Darrins in 'Bewitched' - but also, Google returns no results for "Jonas Quinn Syndrome", so I'm guessing the term started right here with an enthusiastic Stargate SG-1 fan. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlastic_editor_1eff.html" title="User:Plastic editor">relaxathon</a> 07:01, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This "syndrome" is not sufficiently defined (does it apply to replacement of characters only, or also to actors playing the same character successively?), nor is the term in common use per Relaxathon. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 08:19, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree the term may be made up (though there are other mentions on the web), but this is a list rather than original material. This is very similar to <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Cunningham_syndrome_4787.html" title="Chuck Cunningham syndrome">Chuck Cunningham syndrome</a> page. It may need a clean up and perhaps a new name, but this material does not seem to meet delete criteria. At a push, perhaps a merge with Chuck Cunningham page - though characters swaping is different to characters vanishing, or to new actors playing the same characters (the Darrin thing)<a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EObina_7738.html" title="User:Obina">Obina</a> 10:22, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't understand this reasoning - Chuck Cunhingham Syndrome is an age-old TV term at garners many, many search results outside of Wikipedia. The link you provide for JQS is from another open-edit Wiki site article that was created around the same time as this one. Should we really open up the floodgates to people inventing any new term that pops into their head and creating a Wikipedia article for it?

<dd>This illustrates what I mean by the syndrome being insufficiently defined. This Wikipedia article says that Jonas Quinn Syndrome occurs when the original actor/character returns to the role after quitting the show, while the tvtropes.org article uses examples where the original actor/character never returned to the role, including some where the original actor never could have returned because he had died (<i>8 Simple Rules</i>, <i>NewsRadio</i>, <i>Cheers</i>). The term does not have a standard definition yet, nor does that definition have a standard name yet. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 01:07, 2 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I see your point - both the "actor leaves and comes back later" and the "character is replaced with a carbon copy character when an actor leaves or dies" are worthy of discussion because they have happened a lot in TV but without a term like Chuck Cunningham or Cousin Oliver they can't at the moment. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPMA_64d9.html" title="User:PMA">PMA</a> 01:54, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The policy of excluding candidates for political office that have not previously held an elected position is biased only to the incumbent in any particular election race. The intent of wikipedia is not to influence an election outcome, one way or the other, but to provide information on all candidates running in an election.

<li>Wrong. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia. It is not a free wiki host for the posting of candidates' summaries. The "bias" (which is non-political in nature) is towards candidates that have already satisfied the criteria for inclusion, no more and no less.

<li>But not a company that has actually done anything new, i.e. non notable. Wikipedia is not engaged in speculation on what a person or company listed in an article might or might not do, or whether they will someday do anything notable. I cannot even tell from the article what it is new that they are trying to do (assuming that even mattered for this discussion, which it doesn't because they haven't done it yet) <b>Delete.</b> <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 05:22, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No Deletion</b> But you see its an open source art project. Not something that "they may or may not do". And the independent film company that is doing this project I think deserves to be on wiki.

<ul>
<li>Well, you are a registered user, so you are an editor too. Feel free to rewrite the article into something worthwhile if you don't think it should be deleted. It's not a well written article which is part of the problem. Take the time to rewrite the article, clarify what they are doing, supposed to have done, and why they are notable. You obviously have some firsthand knowledge, and I suspect you of being either a puppet or the original author, but take all of this in stride and just fix the article if you can. Convince the Wiki community by actions why this is an article on a notable subject and not just and advertizement stuck into Wikipedia. If you can't do that, then you have no argument. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 07:04, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Consensus should not trump NPOV (or any other official policy). A group of editors advocating a viewpoint do not, in theory, overcome the policy expressed in Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not concerning advocacy and propaganda. However, a group of editors may be able to shut out certain facts and points of view through persistence, numbers, and organization. This group of editors should not agree to an article version that violates NPOV, but on occasion will do so anyway. This is generally agreed to be a bad thing.</p>

<p>As someone who's actually read the works of Galambos has pointed out, Galambosianism as we describe it doesn't actually exist. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Galambosianism_af82.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Galambosianism">previous deletion discussion</a> ended up as a keep under the assumption that the few sources we had were accurate about the subject (the actual arguments for deletion centered around notability); as it turns out, they're probably not. Please read the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_Galambosianism_%282nd_nomination%29_f44b.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Galambosianism (2nd nomination)">talk page</a> of the article for a discussion on why Galambosianism as a concept is likely someone's interpretation of Galambos' ideas rather than any actual part of his work. As such, whether it's amusing to read or not, it should be deleted as being <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">not verifiable</a> by credible sources, unless someone can show otherwise. Galambos' actual ideas may yet deserve an article, but Galambosianism probably isn't it. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 14:11, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't. Dollars to doughnuts almost nobody can, since the topic is so obscure. I dragged this to AfD to see if people agree with the comments left on the talk page. The only "merge" I could perform is replacing the whole thing with a redirect. I don't like that sort of "sneaky" delete. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 10:29, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li>Delete it. My reasoning is on the discussion page of the article. In sum: "Galambosianism" is a non-concept, unrecognizable term to anyone that is even remotely familiar with his work, and who doesn't want to mock it. It is similar to calling Einstein's work "Einsteinianism" instead of Special Theory of Relativity, etc. The article itself cannot be saved or merged because it makes no sense, is not true, is poorly referenced and researched, and would not apply to either Galambos' biography or to his Theory of Volition. I must say again that it is not the oft-referenced, so-called "obscurity" of the works of Galambos that make this article unable to be fixed. Unless of course by "obscurity" you mean that you can't learn about it yourself on the Internet in 60 minutes or less. Additionally, I concur that a "re-direct", along with maintaining this current article, would be absurdity squared. The article on "Galambos" is also almost complete dross too. I would be willing to go into more depth in support of my opinions if anyone would like me too. There are also thousands of normal, moderately intelligent people out there who have read and studied the works of Galambos, i.e. "Volitional Science". Unfortunately for my case, they just don't seem to read or care about Wikipedia. AK 18:17, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Google again gives little reason to suppose that "galambosianism" exists. Delete. As for "volitional science", the term does seem to exist -- though <a href="http://www.bridgetofreedom.com/Lexicon.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.bridgetofreedom.com/Lexicon.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> gives me no reason to think that it's more substantial than any of numerous other self-described (fringe) "sciences". -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 13:45, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Article fails to establish any other notability apart from "It was a hit". To quote <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">user:FuriousFreddy</a>: if a song article is nothing but a recounting of how the song was made, and how well it did, without explaining that it was, in some way, important and influential to the music industry, there's really no reason for it. Just write good album articles, and selected articles on the important singles and album tracks, and let's keep the encyclopedia balanced. Encyclopedias aren't supposed to be "complete"; they are supposed to provide overviews and guide users to further information on a subject if they want to go beyond the standard level. Something like a Christina Milian fan wiki would be a fine place to have an article on every Milian song, but a general-purpose encyclopedia is not.

Article fails to establish any other notability apart from "It was a hit". To quote <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">user:FuriousFreddy</a>: if a song article is nothing but a recounting of how the song was made, and how well it did, without explaining that it was, in some way, important and influential to the music industry, there's really no reason for it. Just write good album articles, and selected articles on the important singles and album tracks, and let's keep the encyclopedia balanced. Encyclopedias aren't supposed to be "complete"; they are supposed to provide overviews and guide users to further information on a subject if they want to go beyond the standard level. Something like a Christina Milian fan wiki would be a fine place to have an article on every Milian song, but a general-purpose encyclopedia is not. See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Pop_music_issues_ef8d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Pop music issues">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Pop music issues</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_Songs_a34d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines/Songs">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines/Songs</a>.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> The term "Military Martial Arts" seems at first glance to be nonsense, since "martial" = "military." The article is about a notable subject (assuming "military martial arts" is a subject separate from "martial arts"), and mentions many subjects upon which there already exist Wiki articles, but the article itself is poorly written and of little value as it stands. I note that there is a cleanup tag on the page already but if nobody cleans it up soon (i.e. if the original author doesn't care enough to clean it up), it should be deleted. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 17:42, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> There are hundreds of thousands of professors in the world, and to claim that they are all notable is presumptuous. I cannot find a paper of his that is newer than 1995 (and only two at that), he does not seem to have won any significant awards, and therefore he is not notable. All the Google hits are news articles based on his death. Notability is indeed a factor (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> IIRC), and since his funeral is over and done with, it is really no longer a current event.

<li><b>Comment</b> - In general, "emeritus" is a term applied to almost any former titled professor (as it's based on more than a PhD) who has retired and is still alive. That in and of itself is not notable. That is like saying a professor emeritus at a community college is notable - emeritus does not make notability. He doesn't really predate the Internet, and there should be a list of publications available someplace or some citations if his work was really that groundbreaking - that's the nature of scholarly research - and there isn't. I mean, Hawking oredated the Net, and he is heavily cited everywhere. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 03:42, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete or merge</b> - There is nothing here information-wise that isn't already covered in the shootings article already mentioned, and if there's no more biographical info than what is currently available, this will never be more than a non-notable stub. Academic position is not notable; there are plenty of professors (emeritus or otherwise) in plenty of fields who have published seminal works any many papers on their topics in their countries, and almost none have Wikipedia articles on them, nor are they deserving of such, as those pages amount to nothing but vanity pages. I can think of three presidents of the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_for_Asian_Studies_86cd.html" title="Association for Asian Studies">Association for Asian Studies</a> who do not have articles on them, for example, and this is really the same type of situation. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 07:41, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Looking at this entry fairly, I don't see why this is an "article" or why it's necessarily encyclopedic. I note the following in support. First, it's written in jargon which is about half incomprehensible to me. Wikipedia is a general audience encyclopedia, so articles should not be written in jargon, Wikipedia is not an encyclopedia for professionals. That at least merits a strong cleanup tag. Second, it seems to be a promotional article for a video game and should be deleted on that issue alone, having no other value. Finally, other than the first nearly incomprehensible paragraph, the rest of the "article" is mostly screen shots from the game and lists of features, programmers, and play testers. All of this adds up to a delete vote <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 18:00, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't think it should be deleted at all. Millions of people all over the world play Half Life 2 (HL2) and this is one of many wikipedia entries describing in detail the various modifications (mods) to the game and where they can be found. This mod, along with all the other HL2 mods, is free. Therefore, this is not an advert by any means. It is an informational page for HL2 enthusiasts and is entirely useful as an information source. The jargon you refer to is necessary technical detail and would be understood by anyone looking for information on HL2 mods.</dd>

<dd>An unsigned endorsement for keeping the page. The game is basically a commercial product, at some point along the line, each of the owners of this game paid money. That makes it an advert, even if you classify it as a free modification to an existing program. I wouldn't write an article about the latest free upgrade to my shareware floating desktop clock program, and if I did, I'd expect a speedy delete. If you want to make an "informational page" of this sort, for "HL2 enthusiast" that belongs on a fan site or a game promotion site. Wikipedia is neither. Further, Wikipedia is a general free public encyclopedia, so saying that the "technical detail" is necessary and "would be understood by anyone looking for information on HL2 mods" is not an argument for keeping an article that consists of one paragraph of technical jargon and a bunch of lists and screenshots. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 19:22, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>First of all, I didn't put this page up for deletion. I saw it on the Afd list, looked at the page, and voted for deletion. I know nothing about the pages you listed, but if they exist and they are as you represent, then they should be deleted as well. I am advancing as a princple here that individual articles should not exist for modifications to video games. All of the reasons I stated here--they are advertizments, they are not really articles, they are not notable enough to deserve an encyclopedic article, and that they all belong on fansites and game promotion pages, which Wikipedia is not, would apply equally to all of the pages you mentioned. I am not here arguing whether they are "valid mods" or not, since I have no idea what you mean by that, I am talking in terms of encyclopedia content. If these pages are as you say, then I will seek to take this discussion to a higher level and have it endorsed as a principle by Wikipedia that pages about individual video game modifications are not encyclopedic content. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 14:09, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Unencyclopedic. This is an incredibly weak premise for a wikipedia article since it is based on a throw away paragraph in a newspaper article. Yes, it got some attention from a few bloggers but it remains pure speculation based, it seems, on a joke by a few police officers in Toronto. This should not be an article until and unless there is evidence that it's a <i>credible</i> theory ie it's being discussed seriously in academic circles, there are published articles on it in the media (rather than a passing, half-joking reference) etc. Homey 17:02, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> According to an article in Mclean's (May 30, 2005), there is forthcoming research on the subject: "Seto and Eke are continuing their research, and will soon start combing through the police files of close to 400 child-porn offenders across Ontario, searching for commonalities and patterns of behaviour. One of the things they will be looking for is reports of suspects with sci-fi collections, especially Star Trek." I think it should, at present, be rewritten to emphasize the uncertain nature of the research, but a definite keep. Note the McLean's article was 4 pages and dedicated to this topic as well. It may well be conjecture (or better put, a hypothesis), but notable conjecture as it is the subject of current academic research. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansnesse_9523.html" title="User:Hansnesse">Hansnesse</a> 18:33, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Unproven claims permeate areas like Alternative Medicine on Wikipedia. They are just notable unproven claims. Specifically by pointing out where the research stands I think this would be useful to a Wikipedia user. Truth should not be the criteria for inclusion, since it would eliminate important but false scientific hypotheses (<a href="../../../p/h/l/Phlogiston_theory.html" title="Phlogiston theory">Phlogiston theory</a> for example) or yet poorly supported hypotheses (<a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">String theory</a> for example).

<p>No delete. I bellieve this could eventually get around and become a big thing. Yeah, its foolish, but werent all the other 4 letter "bad" words in the dictionary?</p>
<p>I think that the word Nyk should be kept on Wikipedia. I happen to know these kids who put this here and there just trying to do the same thing Paris Hilton is doing with "That's hot." They come from a very small town and have no other way to get it out there.</p>
<ul>
<li>I would note that the previous comments were posted by user Jake Lykins, one of the kids mentioned in the article. Jake, Wikipedia is not a medium for you to try to make a word that you or your friends invented catch on and become a national phenomenon. Wikipedia is in no way comparable to the media outlets available to Paris Hilton, and you certainly are not in the same celeberty class as Paris Hilton. I am sure that you are not nearly as cute, and you probably have a lot more brains. If you want to make a phrase "cool" become famous, but don't try to use Wikipedia to promote words that you made up at school one day. I suggest you read the previous link to understand why this is not acceptable in Wikipedia. Wikipedia is about compiling the "sum of all human knowledge" to which your entry does not contribute in any significant way. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 02:47, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thank you GestaltG! I am smarter than Paris Hilton! If you have any idea on how to get Nyk to be a big phrase, other than getting famous, please tell me, because I beleive that it could be a big thing one day. I really don't know any other way to do that. I don't think I could get famous. I'm just an odd kid from Wheatcroft, Ky. I understand that it's not good to try to market Nyk by putting it on Wikipedia after I read all of that stuff. But I have hope in Nyk, and you, yes YOU, will hear Nyk one day or see it wrote on a shirt, and you will remember this. I may not become famous, but Nyk will!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In my own personal opinion, there are some things on wikipedia other than "Nyk" that do not contribute to human Knowledge. If you look up "The Game" you will find a useless rule setting for a game that is so simplistic that it must have been made up by someone. Now... If wikipedia is truly the sum of ALL human Knowledge... then even the simple words made up by people were contributed to human Knowledge. "The game" is much more idiotic than "Nyk." So, do not delete.
<ul>
<li>If there is such an entry, then move it for deletion. But don't drag Wikipedia down by trying to twist this argument into something it is not. It may work at home to say, "See, what I didn't wasn't bad because he did something worse!," but that does not apply to this particlar debate here (which is what you are trying to do) because we are not talking about morals or right and wrong in that sense, but rather, what is encyclopedic and what is not. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 05:04, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>um, not to be too contradictingg to what you are sayingg, but if this is not about morales, then take out all the religious articles. They are all about morales, and in my opinion they are not required to be in the encyclopedia. Now, jake is having outbursts, but i am trying to show you that wikipedia does have entries not relevant to human knowledge.
<ul>
<li>I am not going to spend days arguing about this, I am busy editing. But if you think "morals" not part of the sum of human knowledge, whether in the form of religion or philosophies, then you should go back to school and learn something. What I said was that Jake could not use the argument that "you can't delete my article because there are more worthless articles" (similar to "I didn't do anything bad because he did something worse" type arguments you use at home) here because the standard here is what is encyclopedic. If you don't understand what is encyclopedic, do some research on Wikipedia's standards. This argument is not going to go on and on, because, first, this is the last time I am going to respond to your kids arguments, and second, an admin (and I am not an admin, so you are arguing with the wrong person) will eventually make a decision to delete your silly article, and that will be the end of it. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 21:45, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article was proposed for merging, into an article it repeats. After some time, the articles creator has then made several personal attacks using the articles talk page. After several warnings to the user about Wikipedia's policies, he has continued to make attacks. Minor edits have also been made to the page, which have been reverted with claim of ownership of the user. This article seems nothing more than a made up genre by one person, that is used as a term to seperate out favourite bands from Grindcore and Black Metal. This article is in need of serious attentnion, and then deleting.

<li><b>Comment</b>. As the author invited, I searched for "Norsecore" with Google, and it does indeed seem that the term is rather more widely used than "a made up genre by one person". e.g. see <a href="http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/BW-WB.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/BW-WB.htm" rel="nofollow">this interview</a> with someone named Hartmuth of Barbarian Wrath Records who claims to have invented the term. btw according to the Wayback Machine this interviews dates back at least to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/BW-WB.htm" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/BW-WB.htm" rel="nofollow">February 28, 2003</a>. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStormie_b829.html" title="User:Stormie">Stormie</a> 10:14, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Good on yer for asking for comments. So, umm, don't take this the wrong way, but ... no! Stop! BAD! While I'm not one of the "no such thing as cruft" or "cruft is offensive" whiners, frankly, just saying "-cruft" is <i>not</i> a good argument for deletion. When you nominate an article, you should give your argument for why the article should be deleted — is it non-notable (why?), unverifiable (how have you tried to verify it?), a hoax (where's your evidence?), etc. Cheers, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 15:31, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>What you've said clearly contradicts the notes on -cruft in the Guide To Deletion, "This article is trivia of interest only to hardcore fans of a specific film, television series, book, game, pop singer, web forum, etc.", so perhaps you can expand your rationale on the cruft concept. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMNewnham_fbea.html" title="User:MNewnham">MNewnham</a> 16:05, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I strongly disagree that most songs should merit an individual entry in Wikipedia, and this is a good case in point. If you cannot write more than one sentence about a minor song by a minor group, then it doesn't belong here. If you could expand this article to more than one sentence, it wouldn't be an article about the song at all, but rather an article about the "modern day cynicsm of the British underworld" whatever that is?

<li><b>Keep</b> this page and delete the other two seperate articles. Why are those even seperate anyway..? They are redundant. Also, add more legendary weapons to the this current article (as Phil suggested). However, the slight problem with that is that they don't have pictures like the soul edge and calibur do. Its minor, just a small fact I think everyone should be aware of. Also note that this page was created <i>before</i> the two redundant, seperate articles.-<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanZero_5c06.html" title="User:MegamanZero">MegamanZero</a>|<a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegamanZero_9677.html" title="User talk:MegamanZero">Talk</a> 14:20, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There's plenty of other pages of similar fictional basis that offer even less information than this one does. But I recommend deletion of the separate pages. In canon Soul Edge and Soul Calibur are polar opposites of each other (in terms of good vs. evil) but due to their nature of origin, noting both on the same page is more useful. <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETotalTommyTerror_7cb2.html" title="User:TotalTommyTerror">TotalTommyTerror</a> 21:06, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You may disagree with the nomination but the accusation of "bad faith" is hot air.

<li>Okay, now that that's settled, I'm going to vote <b>keep</b>.

<li>"it was already decided that the name should stay". Decisions can be revisited and reversed. That we "already" decided it doesn't strike me as sufficient grounds to keep the name if not the article. Homey 20:29, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The "childlove movement" is not simply advocacy of pedophilia. The title <i>childlove movement</i> is inclusive and accurate, as that is what they refer to themselves as. <code>// <b><a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParoxysm_2155.html" title="User:Paroxysm">paroxysm</a></b> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParoxysm_da02.html" title="User talk:Paroxysm">(n)</a></code> 21:17, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> What a ridiculous proposition. "Childlove" was not coined by Ashford, it is derivative of <i>boylove</i> and <i>girllove</i>, more specific terms designating a type of pedophilic or ephebophilic attraction. Even if you don't want to believe it, or the thought of pedophilia makes you squirm, that is not relevant here, so I would ask anyone to consider the notability of this subject carefully before kneejerking with delete. To say that this was "largely written by Ashford" is false in itself; it's been edited extensively to keep POV out since its last kneejerk nomination, which, as is apparent, resulted in a <i>keep</i>. Merging this with pedophilia is not a good idea, as the childlove movement is not at all completely composed of pedophiles, but also ephebophiles, and as jd420 tells me at least, normophilic people as well. The "childlove movement" article is already long enough. Moving on... if you're the type of person who judges notability by a quick tap into Google, please note that "childlove" is a rarely used term. "Boylove" and "girllove" are used much more often, so as to segregate the sexual attractions. <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=girllove+-encyclopedia+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=girllove+-encyclopedia+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">"Girllove" gets 18,700 hits</a>, if we exclude all pages containing the keywords "wikipedia" and "encyclopedia." "Boylove," seemingly more popular, receives 332,000 hits. These are only pages Google has spidered. There are thousands of websites dedicated to this crusade, several organizations (everyone's heard of NAMBLA or MARTIJN at least). The movement <i>is</i> notable: it has thousands of members, usually well-masked behind a shield of anonymity. Activism happens, whether the public likes it or not; ranging from <a href="http://www.glgarden.org/ppp/" class="external text" title="http://www.glgarden.org/ppp/" rel="nofollow">promoting what they see as the correct use of the word "pedophile,"</a> to <a href="http://216.220.97.17/" class="external text" title="http://216.220.97.17/" rel="nofollow">advocating the abolishment of age of consent laws</a>. To say that "childlove" is a euphemism is POV itself. It is a term invented by the movement to describe themselves (in fact, it's basically just using the root Greek meaning of "pedophilia"). We have articles on organizations within the movement itself. I find it almost obscene that someone would propose deleting this article and not <a href="../../../n/a/m/NAMBLA_7d55.html" title="NAMBLA">NAMBLA</a>. The FBI has even acknowledged the existence of a large movement working to "legalize child molestion" in a newspeice on Ashford I seen recently. <code>// <b><a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParoxysm_2155.html" title="User:Paroxysm">paroxysm</a></b> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParoxysm_da02.html" title="User talk:Paroxysm">(n)</a></code> 21:05, 31 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First of all, by definition, the term <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephebophile.html" title="Ephebophile">ephebophile</a> (attraction to post-pubescent youth) excludes those we commonly refer to as "children" (ie pre-pubescents) so I don't accept your claim that "childlove" is not a synonym for pedophilia and that therefore "childlove movement" is not a euphemism for "pedophilia advocacy" as we don't generally refer to teenagers as "children". The primary definition of child is a prepubescent human hence ephebophiles are not attracted to children and the term "childlove" does not accurately describe their feelings or behaviour. I don't deny that there are those who wish to legalise pedophilia. My problem is in using a POV term to describe that movement. Homey 21:44, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The title is inherently POV (per Homey's comment below). The opening sentence is POV (you confuse claims with facts). Also, this is clearly a POV fork. It's a way you can put in stuff, that might not get as much attention elsewhere. This whole article is written with the basic, and false, assumption the groups seeks what it claims to seek. That of course is rubbish. I would also vote to delete an equally POV title Childhurter movement, even though it would be more accurate in its description than the current title. Be happy Wikipedia (unlike 99% of society) will let you freely and fully particpate and contribute to articles in an NPOV manner, but don't think for a second you'll be allowed your own little POV fork to promote a movement. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 21:49, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I understand you're saying that "boylove"/"girllove" is a useless excercise in euphemisms. Assuming that to be so, I think the fact that pedophiles campaign for political issues is a notable thing which deserves an article, and <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">Pedophilia</a> is very long-- the whole thing won't fit. The "childlove movement" (especially NAMBLA) has a long history tangled up with the gay rights movement etc. There needs to be a general article to describe this, so take this one, NPOV it, and move it to your favourite title. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <small><a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a></small> 23:10, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There <i>is</i> press coverage on the childlove movement; it's just not referred to as the childlove movement in their reports because media can apparently not stand to use the word "love" when describing pedophilic or ephebophilic attractions.

<li>the kind of notability/verifiability of at least the name childlove is per wikipedia standards: <i>it is essential that any primary-source material, as well as any generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of information or data has been published by a third-party reputable publication (that is, not self-published) that is available to readers either from a website (other than Wikipedia) or through a public library.</i> So if newspapers have articles but no third party publisher calls the movement what the movement calls itself, then we don't have some verifiable source calling it that, then wikipedia can't call it the childlove movement either, because we can't verify how widespread the term is, or it should be left to publishers of original thought to determine the occurance of the term "childlove" not original research on wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 07:00, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

There is little non-wiki serious usage of the term in the results, with much of it being the usual "scraper sights" (e.g. search for anything and you get something on their sight). This actually proves that Wikipedia itself is the biggest promoter of the term. Now, sadly, others will likely follow. This shows the movement had great success with Wikipedia, as we forget how influential we are. Other people doing similiar "Google tests" will now make similiar judgements, to accept this term. Also, I would note, in your first search "Childlove" by itself, obviously has meaningings unrelated to the perverted one being discussed here. Even combined with other words, I expect there are people who use the term in the more literal non-perverted sense it's been used in the old article name (e.g. as in "childlove" means "child love" not sexual abuse of innocent children by people who are mad that I called it abuse). Finally, in all Google tests, keep in mind shorter simpler words, that are easier to spell, always get bigger results, and that doesn't tell you which is the proper term. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 13:37, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As a patron of the online boylove community for almost ten years now, I had never heard the term "childlove" until Wikipedia renamed its "boylove" article into "Childlove movement" (if I remember correctly). I remember it as a conjured-up term to merge articles on "boylove" and "girllove". I have since noticed "childlove" being used quite often, when wanting to denote the collective boy- and girllove communities (and I've also noted many in the boylove community shunning the term "childlove"). So either I was ignorant of the term before the Wikipedia rename, or Wikipedia itself has contributed significantly to the usage of the term. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayboy_b087.html" title="User:Clayboy">Clayboy</a> 18:13, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> The nomination appears to be an attempt to silence <i>highly unpopular</i> political or social views by refusing to allow them to be described on Wikipedia.

<li>You can make that allegation if you can demonstrate that somebody voted to keep an opposing POV fork, while voting to delete this POV fork. However, that's not the case. Also, you fail to address the serious lack of *reliable* verifiable information to back up this article. Also, we actually do try to "silence" any POV soap-box pusher on *any* side. If somebody wishes to push an agenda, they're free to do so elsewhere, but Wikipedia is not the place. You're partly right though. Their views are highly unpopular, and argueable "suppressed". Hence, they're rarely published. However, Wikipedia does not champion the rights of the unpublished. In fact, we're quite hostile to the unpublished. We don't (or shouldn't) write anything about anyone unless it's been published by reliable sources elsewhere. Is that fair? No. But that's the price of verifiability. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:25, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> Many of us can agree that this article is filled with nonverifiable information. This article could be uniquely about the activism, but information is continually being added that subtly or not describes pedophilia from an unpublished viewpoint. If this article is not deleted it can be weeded down to its' verifiable components. If the verifiable and scholarly parts of this article don't amount to more than a stub, then Pedophilia Advocacy can be redirected to Pedophilia and the content moved there. People who vote either way should help edit this article, although of course delete voters may have more ideas of what to edit. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 04:05, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It clearly would amount to more than a stub. There <i>is</i> advocacy, and it's perfectly sourceable.

<li><b>Comment</b> The dividing of the articles should be along <b>subject</b> lines, not along lines of POV. "Pedophilia" should be about the medical and scientific ends, with perhaps a mention of any alternate POVs. Childlove...I think "Ped. Advocacy" or something along those lines might work. But I'm not so convinced "Childlove" is so POV as people seem to make it out, or even <i>want</i> it to be. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 16:06, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think separate articles is a little much, although this article mixes those two issues and several others together rather badly. But I'm unaware of any sources that specifically call for helping people who have medically defined pedophilia in the strictest sense. There are articles proposing possible revisions to how to treat pedophiles in psychology, which is hardly the issue of pedophilia advocacy. I think what you're describing is "Debate over pedophilia treatment" and really there isn't that much of that in the article. Personally, I haven't got the strength. If it is created, I will do my best to read over the peer reviewed journal references and make things as informative as they can be, but it would be better if an article like that was started by someone with the professional expertise to begin with. I mean, it's acceptable to make an article from reliable sources without having the professional expertise, but it's exhausting too. Part of the reason people only read a fourth of most of these journal articles and then make up their own conclusions is because the things are so long. <a href="../../../l/o/t/User%7ELotusduck_82e8.html" title="User:Lotusduck">Lotusduck</a> 14:50, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The mixing of issues and definitions is exactly why I don't want it merged with pedophilia.

<p><b>Keep.</b> I will give an example: In democtatic contries one can find Nazi and Communsit parties. The reasons for they existance are many, including the right of <b>political freedom</b> and the fact that these parties are indicators of the general political state in a given country (i.e. if their popularity start going up, it means that the mainstream politicians do something wrong). A similar argument can be put in the present case. First, if there are peple <b>paying attention</b> to the childlove movement, it is an indicator that it has a political basis, regardless how small it can be. Second, if the arguments of the "movement" are weak, then it will be easy for everyone to refute them again and again. -User:Nllsq (moved from talk page. first edit)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> the idea of the reuse of thirteen within this series of novels is obviously deliberate and important, not least with the example of having 13 books, each with 13 chapters despite the books varying in length from 150 or pages up to several hundred pages- the books don't all lend themselves well to having just 1 chapters.

<li><b>Keep</b> - its nothing bad about the site and the article. Some people like it, some other dont, as usuall. Definietly is big player on social networks market so I dont see any point to ommit it in Wiki... <a href="../../../p/k/u/User%7EPkuczynski_56db.html" title="User:Pkuczynski">Pkuczynski</a> 23:51, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I use this site myself and managed to get in touch with a friend I hadnt seen for years - I think many other members have also had very positive experience: check: <a href="http://www.wayn.com/wayn.html?wci=splash&amp;page=testimonials" class="external free" title="http://www.wayn.com/wayn.html?wci=splash&amp;page=testimonials" rel="nofollow">http://www.wayn.com/wayn.html?wci=splash&amp;page=testimonials</a> chanoines</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, I have been looking into this and all seems very clear:</p>
<p>WAYN allows its members to import their contacts from various address books: for the moment, they seem to have this too working for Hotmail, AOL, Gmail and Yahoo….The process is fairly straight forward and it is made clear what actually happens: by importing your contacts onto the site, an invitation is automatically sent on your behalf – you can check this at the following link: <a href="http://www.wayn.com/wayn.html?wci=register2" class="external free" title="http://www.wayn.com/wayn.html?wci=register2" rel="nofollow">http://www.wayn.com/wayn.html?wci=register2</a></p>
<p>Their privacy policy is also making this process even clearer – you can check this at the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wayn.com/wayn.html?wci=StaticPage&amp;page=Privacy" class="external free" title="http://www.wayn.com/wayn.html?wci=StaticPage&amp;page=Privacy" rel="nofollow">http://www.wayn.com/wayn.html?wci=StaticPage&amp;page=Privacy</a> – detailed below:</p>
<p>5. Invite a Friend</p>
<p>If a user elects to use our Invitation option to invite a friend to our site, we ask them for the friend's email address. WAYN will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the site provided the user agrees to obtain consent from their friends to send them an invitation. WAYN stores this email address for the purpose of automatically adding the respondent to the friends list of the user sending the invitation, and also to send reminders of the invitation. WAYN does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. The friend may contact WAYN to request the removal of this information from our database.</p>
<p>6. Uploading your Contacts</p>
<p>If a user elects to upload their contacts, they accept that by doing so, an email invitation will be sent on their behalf, to the email addresses of the contacts that are being uploaded and that from time to time, a reminder email could be sent to that contact. By inviting their contacts to join the site, the user agrees that they have obtained prior consent from their friends to send them an invitation. WAYN stores the name and email address of the contacts for the purpose of automatically adding the respondent to the friends list of the user sending the invitation and to send reminders of the invitation on the user’s behalf. The users' username and password will not be saved anywhere on the site. The names of the contacts being uploaded will also be searchable via the name search facility to enable other WAYN users to find old friends. Other WAYN users will be able to send an anonymous email to the user who uploaded the contact name being searched, with a description of the person they are trying to get back in touch with, enabling the user who uploaded the contact to potentially connect the two people together. WAYN does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. The user or the users' contacts can request the removal of their details from our database by sending an email to remove@wayn.com.</p>

<li>Of course foreign relations are notable. However, the future acceptable article is not going to contain any of the present one; it will be a complete rewrite out of POV necessity. That's the issue. Deleting the article doesn't mean that the article isn't warranted, but rather the article's current content. Deleting this entry <b>is</b> clean up. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamrush_d410.html" title="User:Adamrush">Adamrush</a> 19:46, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> If this article is cleaned up, it will be content-free.

<li><b>Delete</b>, this is unreferenced, contextless POV. There is nothing to cleanup. "Cudgel War: alienation Finns–Swedes" - says who? Why? How? The topic of Finnish-Swedish relations is important and interesting, but this is really not the article which Wikipedia should have on the topic. Any article on this topic has to be started from scratch. If this is kept I suggest erasing everything in the article which is not sourced and properly discussed in its historical context. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 16:47, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, Sorry i'm a bit late in the discussion here (did not notice there are separate afd-talk pages), but even though the decision is already made i thought i'd give it my comments for the record. I agree with Uppland about this article being so bad that there is jsut two choises, deletion, and or re-write pretty much from scratch. I think this is also such a big matther that teh person re-qriting it should have a specific perspective in the area (not just "i feel that..."). SO unless no-one steps forward to edit it throughly deleting it could be a good idea auntil someone does write a better one.</li>

<li><b>Keep and Fix</b> I think the problem with this article is that "fortified district" is a generic term with no specific reference, it is not a notable term at all. The article is apparently intended to be about Japanese fortified districts during the occupation of China and Korea in World War II. The article then goes on to provide a list of fortified districts. I think the starting point here is to change the name of the article to something more specific and descriptive of it's actual content. Further, each one of those fortified districts mentioned in the article could be a separate article by itself if written by someone with detailed knowledge and maps, which I do not possess. After that point, the renamed article would exist as a general text article on Japanese Fortified Districts, with links to specific articles for specific fortified districts mentioned in the article. In the alternative, this article could be renamed Japanese Fortified Districts and a number of articles merged into it, such that each of the named areas is a subsection of this article. I am <b>not</b> voting for deletion here, as it is a notable subject, but I disagree that it's a notable term.<a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 16:18, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note that I'm voting delete on this. Obviously it shouldn't be kept, I'm just saying that it can't be speedied.

This article relates to an actual phrase used by a number of people (presumably), fits under no <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>, and thus cannot be speedied.
