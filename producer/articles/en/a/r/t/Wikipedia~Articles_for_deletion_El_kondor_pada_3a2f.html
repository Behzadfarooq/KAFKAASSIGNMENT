<p>Recreation of previously-deleted content under a different name. The original article was deleted because there are absolutely <i><b>zero</b></i> references to indicate that this song has any notability. The song article keeps getting recreated, keeps getting deleted because it's a recreation, and keeps getting undeleted with no valid reason, there are <i><b>still</b></i> no references to support the contention that this song is notable. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:16, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The song has a good number of Google hits, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22el+condor+pada%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22el+condor+pada%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">80 for "el kondor pada"</a> and even <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22el+condor+pada%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22el+condor+pada%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">254 for "el condor pada"</a>. Unfortunately they're almost all in Serbian, so I can't read them, but they do seem to indicate the song is notable. Serbia is not the most Internet-wired country, and half the country uses <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrillic.html" title="Cyrillic">Cyrillic</a> (including, presumably, the most anti-NATO parts, so there are probably even better searches that can be done), so over 300 links is notable. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> 18:25, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>All we need is <i><b>one</b></i> reference, even in Serbian, which a Serbian speaker can vouch for and translate, but we can't even get that. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:27, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>You got that. See the article --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">dcabrilo</a> 18:28, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I can vouch and translate, if you trust me&#160;:) See, the thing is that we can't link to most "references" because they include links to mp3 songs and lyrics, which are probably not most appropriate for us, because of the copyright issues. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">dcabrilo</a> 18:32, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>What does the site say about the song's notability? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:36, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>First of all, it's from '99, during the war, and it says that "Popular group Indexovo (radio) pozoriลกte" already recorded songs and videos that are satirical, including <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_kondor_pada.html" title="El kondor pada">El kondor pada</a>, Ja sam ja, Oni su oni, and that they are available on mp3.co.yu&#160;:) Anyway, the song was recorded, apparently the video was shot too, <b>it is</b> notable. Indexovo radio pozoriลกte is not as popular as Monthy Python, but it's nevertheless as popular as things in Serbia get. So please, do understand that standards of popularity for art in English cannot apply to other, relatively small, countries and cultures. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">dcabrilo</a> 18:42, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry, existence is not notability. Did it get used at political rallies? Was it a popular hit? <i>That</i> is notability. And I'm talking about popularity within Serbian-speaking areas. How many records did it sell, and how does that compare to other record sales in the region? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:44, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The song was released during the war, and as you can imagine, nobody kept top charts in the country at the time (not that they do otherwise). The song was used on protests, and was popular on the radio. The song, however, was later released on two compilations of songs by "Indexovo radio pozoriลกte" (as they are not a musical group, they don't really release albums), namely "Gotov je!" and "Oproลกtajni koncert". Once again, sales are not kept track of in Serbia. As this is a political song, about a war, made during the war, it's not really normal to have it in your CD player. Prominent Serbian daily newspaper Glas Javnosti, released it as mp3 at <a href="http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.co.yu/audio/audio.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.co.yu/audio/audio.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The CD's where it was released are available on most Serbian on-line shops. You have to understand that the song was recorded during a freaking war, not much entertainment information was posted online at the time, and Serbia simply has no public record of sales or charts. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">dcabrilo</a> 19:04, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(Not intentionally putting words in Zoe's mouth, but) ... and is there a page of text, anywhere, in any language, in print or on the Web, that we can reference, that says that? <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> 19:14, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Like I said before, I can't find online sources. The song was released during a war, Indexovo radio pozoriลกte stopped working in 2003. But, do you really think that all of us who were in Serbia back than are lying? Everything in the article is verifiable, and if I were in Serbia and had extra time, I'd try to call radio stations and ask them. There are many notable things which simply aren't source online. However, the song is referenced a lot and apparantly everyone from Serbia here knows it. I personally hate the song, and I think making songs during a war is disrespectful to the victims, but I was nevertheless constantly exposed to it. And again, this is not a song by a popular band, it's a satirical, political song created by a theater group. There are no charts or sales numbers for it (mind that if you wanted such info for any Serbian music-related article, we wouldn't have any). --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">dcabrilo</a> 19:55, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

I still look forward to some demonstration as to which criteria for notability, as listed in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>, are fulfilled by this song. If this is demonstrated, I will happily change my vote.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not an article about a pop hit, which would need proof of "popularity" to be included. It's locally well-known political satirical song about a relevant historic event, one of the most notable examples of Serbian propaganda war against NATO in 1999. The lack of online sources which would say anything remarkable about the song is simply not reason enough to delete it. It would be great if somebody who actually knows the song could present any arguments for deleting the article. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 19:20, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, maybe. But this reporter was presumably living in Belgrade in those days, talking to Serbs, listening to the radio etc. If this song was so hugely popular, why would he not mention it? Surely it would be juicy tidbit for his readers. Anyway, the point is, clearly one can find Western newspapers writing about Serbian humor during the war. So, presumably, if this song was popular, one ought to find a mention of it in some newspaper, somewhere. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 20:17, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You have not answered me weather you dispute the notability of Indexovci; there are <b>no guidelines</b> for notability of a song on wikipedia. However, a prominent song of a notable band should be notable. I can offer several links poiting to this. First link, from balkan repository project:<a href="http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosovo_crisis/nato/art/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosovo_crisis/nato/art/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> - song is included in 3 Index hits during NATO war.Second, they have published 'oprostajni koncert' on which this song is one of their 10 choices (the main hits of theirs) - it is a fairwall sort of compilation, so this testifies about the importance of the song for indexovci; you can google it, for instance here it is sold,<a href="http://dssound.com/php/trazi.php?qry=3,8,0,0,20,157&amp;session=67c0a097755937ccf911d6d86228ab65" class="external autonumber" title="http://dssound.com/php/trazi.php?qry=3,8,0,0,20,157&amp;session=67c0a097755937ccf911d6d86228ab65" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 20:27, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To quote it: <i>There is consensus that the vast majority of songs do not deserve an article specifically devoted to them. Most songs should redirect to another relevant article, such as on the album the song was originally released on, or the artist in question. Songs should only have an individual article if there is enough verifiable material to warrant a detailed article. If a song has a body of published criticism, the song should probably have an article on Wikipedia. Even if a song is otherwise notable, there is no reason to start an article which can only say the name of the song and who performed it.</i>. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 20:45, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So, if that is a criterion, than it is more relevant that it has some individual relevance than that if it was a hit. The relevance of the song is that it was an expression of a spirit of defiance during the war. That is larger cultural connotation. This context is confirmed in the links provided - the balkan repository project about nato art, the article in Serbian above (explaining the context) as well as what people from the Balkans say. It is not <b>just any</b> song or even hit. It is a song with much more background and significance than <i>just a name and who preformed it</i>. The relevance of this song indeed is greater for Serbian (and other Balkan) people because of this larger social context - it was a phenomenon that it illustrates that makes it notable. This is what makes it different from other songs, and this is, as you can see, why people care about it. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 21:03, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The quotes on google mean you search for exact phrase. So, indeed, there are less hits, but there are still hundreds of hits.

<dd>You misunderstand. Enclosing a sequence of words in quotes simply means that Google is looking for the words in that specific sequence. It does not mean that actual quotes must be present for there to be a hit.

<dd>Look, I am no expert, but here is one possible explanation, based on information from <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_platform.html" title="Google platform">Google platform</a>. When a user does a Google search, he actually connects to one of the servers which is closest to him. These servers, located all over the world, are not completely synchronized, so it would be possible for two users located in different places to get a different number of hits. This is especially true in this case since, as the title "El Condor Pada" was recently created in Wikipedia and is now being picked up by all Wikipedia mirrors, the number of hits should be continually going up. So, that is one possible explanation. Am I certain this is the case? No, so take it for what it's worth. Feel free to change the number of hits to reflect what you are seeing at your end. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 01:05, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>actually, there is non milosevic press and it does mention indexovci and the song. but it is really a little of it available even on the wayback machine - this was in 1999; a link above from the article in 1999 was provided, i am trying to dig up some more, but wayback machine is slow. Note that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> does not ask for such strong proofs of notability, and I would like to see if any other articles have been scrutinized with such attitude of disbelief. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 21:42, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know about other songs, but this song is clearly different, since the main argument for having an article about it is its supposed great political and propaganda significance. Well, if it was so great and all, one ought to be able to find some mention of it in newspapers of the time, or in books about the Kosovo war. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 21:53, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And the song is mentioned in such sources. However, the old newspapers, let alone books, are not available online (and why would all sources have to be online?) - try for instance searching for 1999 serbian newspapers on wayback machine (like major newspapers - politika.co.yu, blic.co.yu; or freeb92 station etc) to see how little is archived even there; Here is one source, online, that is about art during NATO agression and it gives the song in question as an important example of it:</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I can see that Albanian users are mobile here - saying that song is not notable. What evidence you present to that? Serbian users (and users from Slovenia/Croatia etc) that were exposed to radio broadcasts of this song certainly can comment on its significance. They can testify about the song and what they lived through and point out to relevant things. However, the votes of Albanians (who presumably did not hear about the song, which is not at all surprising given that they are living a completely separate lives, and were not exposed to any of the Belgrade radio stations, which did not play in Kosovo, and share little culturally with Serbo-Croat speaking part of the Yugoslavia) are merely asserting that a song is non-notable (I am not able to judge what Albanian song is notable, and would not make such unfounded claim) - for reasons, which I strongly suspect have more to do with serbophobia than honest opinion. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 22:39, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Mention of the song in English newspapers and in books about the Kosovo war would be fine as well.

<dd>Weather the song is mentioned in English press, I do not know. I think Serbian newspapers are stored in few libraries <b>outside</b> serbia, if at all. However, they are available probably in the major national library; some people might store the papers themself - I have a whole bunch of newspapers at my home in Serbia (I live abroad though, and cannot browse them until I go there on holiday), but some other people from Serbia might be able to do it. It is not a small task to browse through the old newspapers though if one does not keep them - since there is probably few libraries that have them. Asking by e-mail the group itself would be the best way to get the references, as they are probably aware of that. See their site <a href="http://www.agitprop.co.yu/irp-web/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.agitprop.co.yu/irp-web/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and write to indexovo@eunet.yu &lt;indexovo@eunet.yu&gt; and ask them about the song references in the media directly. It is probably the shortest way to check it - if you want to make a good faith effort to come to the bottom of this, the best thing is to ask them directly (they do speak english, I am sure). <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 23:26, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can you elaborate.

Also, what do you have to say about aking Indexovci themself about the media mentions of the song on indexovo@eunet.yu - it is a way to verify the claims that the song was indeed used on rallies, that it was broadcasted, to check the copyright status of the lyrics/ask permission etc - they can provide you with the data, since you are not satisfied with what users here are claiming; not all sources have to be online, and then, a claim that such and such a paper contains such and such a thing, verifiable in principle, can be established. And what do you think about the claim that you place an undue burden here? What exactly you want to verify, and how does it follow from <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> policies or policies relevant for AfD <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 23:39, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So far all I have seen are links saying that the song exists and that people liked it, not that it was notable. And it is the responsibility of people making a claim to contact those who might prove the validity of the claim, but just contacting the group who recorded it would probably only get their own inflated feelings of importance. Is there a journalist we can contact? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:48, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was suggesting to verify the claim <b>that there were radio broatcasts</b>, <b>that the media mentioned the song</b> etc. by asking them for references, not opinion; If you distrust all Sebrs whatsoever, that not only violates <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, but also makes it difficult to make any arguments at all. For instance, do you dispute the <b>notability of Indexovci</b>? Unlike for songs, there is accepted guideline for that; I have provided a detailed explanation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion/El_kondor_pada" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion/El_kondor_pada" rel="nofollow">on the talk page</a>. per that guidelines. So, do you agree, per evidence presented (newspaper links with indexovci etc - it has been detailed there) that <b>Indeksovci</b> are notable. And then, the question is what kind of notability about the song you ask to be proved? If it is broadcasting on the media, yes, it has been broadcasted a lot, <s>for instance, on b92 (site freeb92)</s> and one can check with the radio stations that people who claim popularity listened to in bunkers. You can verify it by emailing the radio stations. It is an undue burden to ask people to prove it in a way you do, just to provide means of proving it, as a reference etc. And asking a site is a valid mean - it works that for copyright issues with regard to pictures - providing a way to check copyright status. Why should there be higher burden of verifiability of claims that we make here. Anyone, who doubts it, can ask the radio station about what songs were broadcasted. Given a reference which is not online, it is not a burden of those who reference it to scan it for those who want to see - they have a means to check it, and assume good faith until a reference proves to be bogus. Isnt it that way that it works for copyright issues? Why it would be different for other sources, which are not online? <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 00:01, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What motivated you is of no importance. You can ask for evidence, but I am saying that there is a policy here [WP:AGF]. Also, please state your concerns <b>clearly and explicitly</b>, so that there is no misunderstanding.</dd>
<dd>I have put a detailed argument on notability of the band on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion/El_kondor_pada" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion/El_kondor_pada" rel="nofollow">talk page</a>, per criteria. The notability of the band does not seem to be disputed - they meet several criteria, and reliable sources have been given, as required (media articles discussing them are one example, then their numerous tours etc). So, the argument now seems to be not about notability of the band, that is established, but just about the song - and song itself has relevance; there are no accepted notability criteria, so I ask those who dispute the song's notability to state what they ask from a song to be notable. Then we can check how these criteria are applied in wikipedia, and I would ask that <b>same standard</b> be applied. Also, those who claim song is notable, would at least know what they have to prove to those who are saying that it is not notable. So, please, list your cirteria for notability, and we can then proceed discussion in a constructive way - we have to know what we are talking about, and to see bottom of the dispute about notability here; I would want to know what needs to be shown, and then, the sources can be provided (though not all will be online, but that is allowed as far as I understand) <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 02:13, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you want to write about this event from various angles, nothing is stopping you from adding appropriate sections to existing articles, <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nonviolent_resistance.html" title="Nonviolent resistance">Nonviolent resistance</a>, for instance. Or, even better, write a separate article Shooting down of the F-117A stealth fighter in 1999 during the Kosovo War or some equivalent title, and describe exactly how that happened, with a section devoted to its propaganda, cultural and political consequences. Nobody is attempting to blot that event out of Wikipedia. In fact, given how many Wikipedians seem to feel so emotional about that event, I am actually quite suprised that such an article has not been written already. Anyway, the entire argument here is whether the <b>song</b> merits its own article, according to the rather strict criteria Wikipedia sets for having articles about songs. Let's stick to that straightforward issue. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 01:39, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is <i>no accepted policy on notability of songs</i>, and the proposal that you quoted (it is just a proposal for a guideline, nothing more), says that song has to have greater sociological relevance, and more content and context to it than just a title and authors. This song has exactly that - it was a hymn of Serbian resistance, and such songs do have articles in wikipedia.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think it is high time to see what a proposal for a guideline (best that we have) says:</p>
<p>A song may be notable if it meets one or more of the following standards. If a song meets three or more of these standards, it is probably notable; if it meets two, it is a good candidate for notability, and if it meets one, it may border on notablity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Has appeared in the Top 20 of a national singles chart in a large or medium sized country</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It has been a hit during nato bombing in Serbia, so certainly one of the 20 - this can be checked by contacting by e-mail radio stations b92 (www.freeb92.net), radio index, etc. who can confirm that the song was played during the bombing extensively. Also, listed here <a href="http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosovo_crisis/nato/art/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosovo_crisis/nato/art/" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> as one of the few examples of art in the NATO period (this link is perhaps more relevant in establishing media campagn); as there are no online links establishing popularity directly, verifiability can be best met with contacting the journalists - freeb92 is one of the most popular radio stations, and it is the way to proceed and confirm what Serbian people here say for those who dispute their claims.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Charted in the Top 100 of a national singles chart in a large or medium sized country, for at least six months (need not be consecutive)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I am not sure if this is formally met as there are probably not such charts, but in Serbia, it was popular for quite a few months during and after the bombing, well in the top 100; if there were some charts, it might be possible to dig them up - but system in Serbia is different, and what songs were broadcasted would be the best information that exists. But, under reasonable interpretation, this is clearly true.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Is a song that helped define a specific genre of music</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Not the case</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Is the signature song of a performer</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, index theatre have made few dozen songs, and this is one of their most well known. one can verify that from the index theatre themselves (contact e-mail address provided above). see also the deletion talk page where argument about this was made.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Is a historically notable song for being the first to do something interesting, stylistically or technologically</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>No</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Helped launch a notable record label</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>No</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Has been officially released in at least one remixed version and/or has been the subject of a music video that played on a major music network and/or was the subject of a major publicity campaign</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. It has been published on two compilations and there was a music video - as evidenced by the article from newspapers in '99, quoted above <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040510133505/http://arhiva.inet.co.yu/rat/kecman/index0609.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20040510133505/http://arhiva.inet.co.yu/rat/kecman/index0609.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, that talks about music video being recorded, as well as a major publicity campaign - in fact, anti-nato sponsored propaganda effort; also evidenced in this newspapers article <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040510133505/http://arhiva.inet.co.yu/rat/kecman/index0609.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20040510133505/http://arhiva.inet.co.yu/rat/kecman/index0609.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, corroborated by many users here.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Has been placed on a "best of" or "most influential" list from a major music media source</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I am not exactly sure what is meant here - probably not (what is a major music media source). It has been among "best of" (or the best of) Index songs, is one of the "best of" NATO-war songs, it is on the compilation Oprostajni koncert (evidence provided) but I am not sure if it meets formally the criterion. It was not considered "influential" in some musical sense though.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Has been downloaded a high number of times through digital download websites</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This is also the case. Numerous tribute pages and mp3 links for it provided source for download, and it has been downloaded by many users in ex-Yu and Serbs in the world. However, what high number of times means, is relative. The exact quotes might be available from some sites, like nostalgija.com <a href="http://www.nostalgija.com/muzika/4967.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nostalgija.com/muzika/4967.php" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> - warning - this site has popups; it is a site where much of the ex-yu music can be downloaded (piracy or not - it is the way many people get music from such sites, and one can get a quote from them and get an idea about relative popularity of the song); there are other sites that offer free download, some mentioned above.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Is a particularly well-known song from a piece of musical theater, radio, film or television</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As Indexovci are also a comic theater troup, they have incorporated this song in piece of theatar - that is what they do with all of their songs. No quote yet though - might be available from the indexovci group directly; we have their e-mail, so this is verifiable. also, there is a video of their play with the songs - sold here, cover shown and a synopsis, testifying about this:<a href="http://dssound.com/php/trazi.php?qry=3,8,0,0,20,157&amp;session=67c0a097755937ccf911d6d86228ab65" class="external autonumber" title="http://dssound.com/php/trazi.php?qry=3,8,0,0,20,157&amp;session=67c0a097755937ccf911d6d86228ab65" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>The synopsis: <i>Snimak predstave u Banjaluci odrzane 2001 godine .Na ovoj kaseti cete cuti I sve ove pesme obrade -El kondor pada,Sta ce mi zivot bez tople vode,Narasli su dugovi,Kada pocnem drugi dnevnik ja,Madlenka,Ja sam ja I oni su oni,Mi smo mi,Donatori gde ste da ste,Govovi se da me vavas,Lepa li je Dano vlast u krugu dvojke,Taze tursija,Sanjala sam nocas da te nema,Zazmuri,Doslo je do krvi,Ne odlazim,Kad sam gladan,Igra ruski rulet srpska Jugoslavija,Zamislim zivot u kom enosis nove cipele,Prica o Bobi Vladackom,Kasno je za brzu prugu,Stranci u Peci</i></p>
<p>Translates: a recording of the play held in <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banja_Luka_fddc.html" title="Banja Luka">Banja Luka</a> in 2001; you will get to hear their songs: El kondor pada (<b>notice it was listed first</b>), Sta ce mi zivot bez tople vode (what do I need life with no hot water), Narasli su dugovi (debts have grown)...(list of other songs performed during this musical play).</p>
<p>In short, it seems that there are quite a few criteria met, and some are completely documented at this point as well. So, it reiterates the notability claim; nothing to say of the larger war context. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 03:18, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> and add a request for additional references as and when they can be produced. I know that this doesn't normally work as an argument on Wikipedia, but I've checked with a Serb friend (I know, I know!) and he confirms the song's existence and notability. For a non-English language song from a small nation with limited internet penetration to get the Google hits it does is reason enough. I have to say (personal observation again) that various supporters' behaviour on this page has not helped their case, but that doesn't alter my vote. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 09:41, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>That is not what I said, and I think you know it perfectly well. There are on-line references listed, some of them fully establish points for notability; but not all of the points are established by on-line references. Popularity of the song is <b>not</b> confirmed in a way you want it by an online reference (if you dont count google hits), but it is verifiable, since one can check with the station. Other points are (for instance, claim that the song was part of a play - there is a recording of a play being sold; then that the song is Index theatre major song; than that there was a music video; that the song was used in media campagn etc.). But you insist that the popularity is to be proven - while providing contact address for the radio stations (like www.freeb92.net) is, especially for the purpose of this AfD, quite enough - just as providing means of checking copyright status of a picture is enough. Copyright issues were always greater concern for wikipedia than notability of some articles. And why would there be tags for notability etc. if any article that did not present the proofs for notability (and some have much, much less indications and proofs of notability than this article now has) would be imediately deleted. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 17:32, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Also, note that only a few points are needed to judge song notable - one and it is on border of being notable, and three or more mean that song is notable, per the proposed guideline. This song satisfies more than enough points, and would not even depend on the popularity. So, it would be quite malicious not to take all this into account in judging notability of the song. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 17:39, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Notifiability and Verifiability do not have the same standards. Per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, the content of an article must be verifiable: "Facts, viewpoints, theories, and arguments may only be included in articles if they have already been published by reliable and reputable sources". Per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, "a topic has notability if it is known outside of a narrow interest group or constituency, or should be because of its particular importance or impact". However, note that there is no requirement that <i>the notability</i> of a topic has to be verifiable in the sense of <i>already been published by reliable and reputable sources</i>. That's the standard we often use for both, but I think this is one of the few exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we have half a dozen Serbian editors giving first hand testimony that basically the entire country regularly heard the song in their bunkers; and we have a good number of links to the song in Google, considering the country and age of the song. Sure, we can't write that in the article - but per <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, and given the fact that no one is denying it, and not giving any argument against it, we can take that as evidence of popularity. I'd be much happier if someone found an "already published" reference for popularity. But if not, the already published references for verifiability, plus this unpublished evidence of notability, should be sufficient; because the standards for the two are not the same. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> 18:07, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The fact remains that we just don't have any verifiable sources for the song's notability. So, in my opinion the best way to resolve the issue for now is to merge the contents of this article into <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indexovo_radio_pozori%C5%A1te.html" title="Indexovo radio pozoriลกte">Indexovo radio pozoriลกte</a>. The article about that group, which has been shown to be notable, is a sad stub at this point and could use some content. Once verifiable sources are provided, the article can be created again. Let me again quote the first two sentences of the guideline, with my emphasis added: <i>There is consensus that the vast majority of songs do not deserve an article specifically devoted to them. Most songs should</i> <b>redirect to another relevant article</b>, <i>such as on the album the song was originally released on</i>, <b>or the artist in question</b>. <i>Songs should only have an individual article if there is enough</i> <b>verifiable</b> <i>material to warrant a detailed article</i>. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 18:31, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But there is plenty of <b>verifiable</b> <i>material to warrant a detailed article</i>. The only thing that isn't verifiable is notability. But there isn't any doubt of notability, given the testimony of the editors, and the many Google sites. Given that, I don't believe <i>verifiable sources for notability</i> are required. That's my whole point. Verifiable sources are required for all information in the article, and the article must be about a notable topic, but the notability merely needs to be true, not verifiable. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> 19:20, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But is that testimony entirely accurate? How can we be sure? For example, some editors claimed above that supposedly B92 radio played this song all during the war. However, that radio was actually closed down by the Milosevic regime on April 2, 1999 (see <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990424073033/http://www.b92.net/" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/19990424073033/http://www.b92.net/" rel="nofollow">archived internet page</a>), and only reopened in 2000 (according to information on <a href="../../../b/9/2/B92.html" title="B92">B92</a>). Could someone care to explain this discrepancy? (the F-117 was shot down on March 27) <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 19:38, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>IIRC, B92 was taken over by government, not closed down. The old team formed Radio FreeB92 and regained the control of B92 only after Milosevic was deposited. I don't know when and how long the pro-government B92 broadcasted.</dd>
<dd>But that's slightly beside the point. All of the editors from the wider cultural area, from different countries and different political positions, people who are often in disagreement over minute details of articles about local affairs, says that this song was popular and notable. Yet you continue to doubt them and bring up small incosistencies in their acconts of events which occurred 7 years ago.</dd>
<dd>May I ask on what grounds? <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 20:45, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Simple. On Wikipedia, you cannot source facts based on the testimony of anonymous editors. I find it puzzling that some contributors to this discussion are unable to understand this. My demonstration here simply served to illustrate how memories are imperfect, facts can get mixed up, emotions can get the upper hand, guesses might be made about facts which turn out to be wrong. This is why <b>verifiable</b> sources are essential. Don't take it personally.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 21:09, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But it is not about sourcing <b>facts</b> in the article, it is about judging notability. And confirmation for some points on the guideline do exist even online (see the talk page), while other claims can be verified by checking what was broadcasted (regarding popularity, though major broadcasts are just part of popularity, as the whole phenomenon of cult movies etc. is a sort of underground popularity - how is that to be checked?)<a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 21:22, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>For the record: the only user who mentioned b92 was me, as a suggestion how to check the claims of those who were listening the song in those times, simply because it was the first radio station to come to mind. I personally was not in Serbia at the time, and was suggesting how to check the claims of users who were. And journalists of b92 might still be able to say weather the song was played in Serbia and to what extent, but it seems that contacting other radio stations might be more relevant (someone who was in Serbia during the bombing can say which stations). That I suggested b92 does not change what they said at all. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 20:54, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, as far as I know, when a song in Serbia is popular, it will be broadcasted at most radio stations (if they play that type of music at all - some stations for instance do not play folk music etc.), so my guess is that any Belgrade radio station would do; and probably B92 has some of the evidence too. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 21:02, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Here is a very specific statement you made: <i>If it is broadcasting on the media, yes, it has been broadcasted a lot, for instance, on b92</i>. So you asserted it has been broadcasted a lot on b92. That assertion is wrong, but it was allowed to stand. No Serbian editor corrected it, even though if they were in Serbia they must have known that B92 was taken off the air, as this was a very big deal at the time and even I remember it being mentioned in Western press. Like it or not, this demonstration of one inaccuracy in your facts puts a dent in the credibility of your other claims. In the light of this, I again insist that <b>verifiable sources</b> are essential, and we cannot just take the word of anonymous editors for notability, as shown here. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 21:14, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Is it wrong? As I said, any popular song would be broadcasted at most stations, and that B92 was taken over does not change that. I still think that it was broadcasted there by the new station policy; however, others are in better position to say it.

<dd>The notability of the song (a satirical song during the war, not ordinary music hit) lies in its sociological relevance - it was sort of a chief resistance song during the war. So, it is actually more notable than the compilation itself. Also, please see the criteria listed to judge songs and how this song fits into them on the talk page of this deletion page. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 21:26, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Would you please read the article before voting? There are no singles, there is no band, it's a theater troop which often performs songs and sometimes publishes them. Anyway, probably no single of any kind was released in Serbia since 1980s, especially not while the country was at war with NATO. This is not a popular commercial hit, it wasn't even available in stores when it came out. It was a political statement and is notable and became popular because of that.

<dd>Balcer, when El kondor pada was released, B92 did not exist. It was raided by the police on the night the war started, and it didn't come back to life till after the war. Most newspapers, except for <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politika.html" title="Politika">Politika</a>, were coming out irregularly, and usually had 4-5 pages (just to give you the perspective of media at the time). Second of all, Indexovo radio pozoriลกte is not a pop band. They don't release records, but they do have some compilations. P.S. the only single from ex-Yu I remember during the 1990s was by Van Gogh, somewhere around 1997.

<dd>Since you are the first to come up with the claim that "that no records were produced in Serbia during the 1990s", you will have to find evidence yourself. "Produced records" are not "released singles". From the death of vynil singles until the age of cheap independent production of CDs, only albums were released in Yugoslavia and later Serbia. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 21:48, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are right, I took <i>singles</i> to mean <i>records</i>. My mistake. My point was to suggest that maybe the Serbian music industry was not in such disarray in the 1990s as some people claim.

<li><b>Comment</b> Here's just something for people to chew: Should the verifiability criteria put as the question "can verifiable third-party sources be found?", or the question "is there a <i>possibility</i> that verifiable third-party sources can be found?" It's almost like the question on Original Research: "Are there sources?" vs. "<i>Can</i> the statements be sourced?" I'm personally always leaning on the latter of these interpretations: It's not OR if something <i>can</i> be sourced to some work, it's Verifiable if the primary source exists, and there's a <i>possibility</i> that some independent source will show up and verify the claims.<br />
These rules are in Wikipedia to stop crackpots from pushing their theories as undisputedly valid knowledge. The rules aren't meant to stop discussing cult fictional works - that's what <i>notability criteria</i> is for! What I'm seeing here is trying to delete a work by simply stacking charges: we're proposing the article's deletion as a matter of <i>technicality</i>. "You can't verify this." The way I see is this: <i>Could</i> a reputable game magazine cover this game? (I'm guessing someone might already have.) <i>Could</i> some notable blogger review this game, for example? (Probably, and may already have.) <i>Could</i> some researcher go and conduct a methodical study of EO's player base? Now, you can ask these questions, and answer is a definite "maybe". Ask similar sort of questions about some crackpot scientific theory, and you get a definite "hell no, not even probable". --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 07:39, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>For the record, that was a statement I really regret making (as can be seen by anyone who takes a look at my user page), because I knew it would be twisted, and this AfD clearly shows it was. I'm <b>NOT NOT NOT</b> advocating <i>complete</i> lack of verifiable sources, just that <i>if the subject has provided statistics</i>, they can be considered verified (and this is what the verifiability criteria does concur with!). Further, this was a case where such thing was <i>present and forward-looking:</i> The game existed, it had statistics, and people <i>could</i> go there and research it further. I believe that particular principle was applicable in the AfD <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Endless_Online_%282nd_nomination%29_80bb.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Endless Online (2nd nomination)">I used it in</a>, because we were talking about a case where there was absolutely <i>no reason not to believe</i> the statistics put forth by <i>the subject of the article.</i> That AfD was about a net game, where this was pretty much clear-cut: The game publishes live statistics, we should believe them unless there's documented evidence to contrary. However, <i>this</i> AfD is a bit different: The article doesn't really provide any such evidence of popularity from the primary source, and the claims are vague. This is same as no sources <i>at all</i>, which is <i>not</i> fine with me. Also, this article deals with a <i>past</i> event; it's not something that can simply be verified by sending in the researchers and letting things observe the supposedly popular phenomenon. This article is about something that <i>was</i>.

<dd>Dzoni has been a disruptive user, and Zocky blocked him for the insults that he had thrown (on nationalist basis). However, he is Serbian (judging by his knowledge of the language, and other things) - was communism vandal Serbian? I find it curious - I will take a look who is the original communism vandal. To me, Dzoni seems to be a very bitter Serbian user, who has lost his house in Croatia and a nationalist, I dont know abut the other stuff. But this is not relevant for this particular discussion, as enough users from the area (Zocky, Dijxtra - Slovene and a Croat), and Serbian editors (dcabrilo, bolmagurski etc) have made the case. I dont think that Dzoni has helped this cause much (even if he started the article) because of his disruptive behaviour, and in fact it seems that this has probably played the role in the first hasty deletion (which went against the majority keep votes).

<dd>There are enough pieces even without verifying the popularity - there are more elements to notability of a song (per proposed guidelines) than just popilarity. And I disagree with you what verifiability means. Saying that a public broadcaster has broadcasted something is verifiable per se, as it is a public information. Saying that portugese (or polish) television has broadcasted some series or TV show in the 60s or 70s might also not have any on-line references, but people will not question good faith of those who remember this and enter such things into the article. Such information is verifiable since there are documents about it, as public information. Verifi<i>ability</i> does not require what you claim, and that poit was already made to you. Also, as I said, even if you were right, since the popularity is not the only claim of this song to notability, and since notability does not even have an accepted policy, the common sense is to be applied here. You could maybe ask for verifiability of verifiability, and go as many steps upwards, but at some level you have to rely on common sense (we can determine something - that there are sources, but you ask to source the fact that there are sources; then you might as well ask to source the facy that we can source the fact that there are sources, and so ad infinum; in fact, for notability, we apply common sense directly, for facts in articles, we provide sources and apply common sense that they are sources, and even there we do not source the fact that they are sources). <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 04:32, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I mentioned above, the number of hits one sees appears to be dependent on one's geographical location. I am located in Canada and when I click your two last links, I get 67 and 23 links respectively. And no, my url does not show google.ca. But who knows, maybe my settings are off somehow. Anyway, I accept your numbers, as we should of course take the maximum. Still, 300 hits in total for a supposedly major song does not seem like much.

<dd>BTW. I just found another reference. Once again, the reference does not talk about how many songs were sold (because they weren't, it's not a pop album, we went over it again and again), but <a href="http://kapija.narod.ru/Authors/Ajdacic/ajd01_bombard.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://kapija.narod.ru/Authors/Ajdacic/ajd01_bombard.htm" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> (it's slow to load from North America) talks about humor during nato bombing. It lists jokes, several emails which were circulating usenet at the time, jokes on the banners on protests, etc. Look for "ะผะพัะธะฒ ะพะฒะพะณ ะฑะพะผะฑะฐัะดะตัะฐ ะฝะฐัะฐะพ ัะต ะธ ั ะฟะตัะผะธ ะะฐ ะฒะพะทะธะผ ััะตะปัะฐ 117-ะฐ ะะฝะดะตะบัะพะฒะพะณ ัะฐะดะธะพ ะฟะพะทะพัะธััะฐ". The article talks only about one song, and that's our baby here&#160;:) The article goes on about bomber 117A, and dedicates that paragraph to saying that "motif of this bomber occured in song I 'drive' stealth 117A (most people heard it on the radio/TV, apparent ambiguity about the song name)", and goes on to retell the song, in similar manner as the article in question does. The article is well written, and shows that the song was important part of that humor (or cynicism some would say) on the Serbian part. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">dcabrilo</a> 05:07, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for digging up the author's bibliography, it was not linked from the page given. I will let the community judge whether this one sentence mention in one article, the only direct mention we have been able to find after presumably extensive searches, is enough for evidence of notability. For me it is not, and I am sticking to my vote for merging the content into the article about the group which created the song. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 13:44, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not all should go but some definitely should. But that is a subject for another discussion.

Don't you find it odd that at this point the article about the one song of this band is longer than the article about the band itself?

<dd>Agreed. I must say my contribution to the discussion here was extensive and might not have been entirely objective (though I tried to be polite and not break any rules). Maybe I was ticked off at least a little at the first, atrociously bad version of this article, which was created by User:Dzoni, a ridiculous troll who has now been permanently banned. I will stop at this point and let the community make its decision. But I still hold my opinion that the best way to proceed here is to merge the content to the article about the band and leaving this as a redirect. That will not remove any information that has been entered so far, and will mean we will have one stub article instead of two (at this point). Plus, that will be in accord with the spirit of Wikipedia guidelines.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 16:51, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's a review of the steps that brought us to this point:</p>
<ol>
<li>A rather incivil newbie editor creates a bad article about a Serbian song at the wrong title.</li>
<li>It gets afd'd. Local editors uniformly say that the song is notable and that it should have an article. Despite minority opinion for delete, the article is deleted for lack of references, prompting a rather premature RFC.</li>
<li>The incivil editor recreates the bad article at another title, this time correct but misspelt.</li>
<li>It gets afd'd and then speedied as recreated material.</li>
<li>A group of established editors writes a new, proper stub about the song at its proper title.</li>
<li>It gets tagged for speedy deletion. The tag is removed by a yet uninvolved editor.</li>
<li>An old hand speedies the article twice and finally puts it on afd after it had been undeleted twice by different editors.</li>
<li>A series of editors from the wider cultural area consistently say that the song is notable.</li>
<li>The incivil editor is first blocked, then permabanned.</li>
<li>The old hand that afd'd the article accuses the editors who wrote the article of bad faith and, in user talk, refuses to back it up or take it back.</li>
<li>We establish that the song is one of the most important songs by probably the most important satiric radio and theater troop in Serbia and that it has a number of google hits and web references.</li>
<li>We go through a painful tit-for-tat repetitive argument about notability, verifiability, sourcing of facts, sourcing of sources, workings of google, state of Serbia in 1990s, etc.</li>
<li>We finally establish that the song is notable, by finding a discussion of it in an article by a prominent Serbian ethnologist, who happens to be the head of university library at the Belgrade University, by far the most important education institution in Serbia.</li>
</ol>
<p>And here are some things we hopefully learned along the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Topics should be judged on their own, not by the editor who first created an article about them.</li>
<li>Shouting IN ALL CAPS and insulting people will make things harder for your side of the argument (and get you permabanned, of course).</li>
<li>Pick your fight wisely. When a wide-ranging group of editors disagrees with your actions, it's good to check what's going on and who's doing what before engaging in knee-jerk reactions and personal attacks.</li>
<li>When a long series of people who are likely to be familiar with a topic because of their education, experience, or location, consistently says that it's an important subject, it's likely that it is.</li>
<li>If you're out of your depth on facts, no amount of bravado, rethorical devices, appeals to authority, nit-picking and reiteration will make your case better in the long run.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's hoping that next time we'll avoid some of the mistakes we made here. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 19:42, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

That sounds a little unfair to me, if it's worth mentioning in one Wikipedia, is there a different standard on this one? This article is a millionth of the encyclopedia, having an article about a song that caused SO MUCH comotion when it was suggested to be deleted, proves its notability, as well as the sources and Google hits given on this very page.

That was a gosh-darned dismissive comment. What do you have to say about the arguments for its notability? Anything of substance? Anything to work with? If it's just a bunch of bickerers, why would you say it belongs on Serbian Wikipedia?

<dd>Thats the problem with democracy. You give them the right to vote, and they abuse it. The user has no idea what El kondor pada means, he didn't read the discussion, he knows nothing about what the hell we are even talking about, and yet, his vote is as valuable as the votes of people who have read the discussion, investigated the notability, and are on top of what we are discussing. Stubbly head, tell me what do you think about resistance movement songs and their impact on government officials? --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBormalagurski_75a9.html" title="User:Bormalagurski"><font color="#003399"><b>serbiana</b></font></a> <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia"><b>-</b></a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBormalagurski_8b57.html" title="User talk:Bormalagurski"><font color="#A61022"><b>talk</b></font></a> 01:35, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Taste should play no role in this discussion. Dcabrilo said that he didnt like it, and neither do I particularily like it, but that is irrelevant. What matters is that this song marked one period - Bombing of Serbia, and it is a notable song by a notable troup which deservs an article. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabaRera_8d30.html" title="User:BabaRera">BabaRera</a> 04:58, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> --- It's funny, and I, as a Serb diaspora haven't heard it before, but find it funny and I agree that this song must have played a key role in keeping the hopes of people in Serbia during the bombings alive, and that made a lot of people rally together.C-c-c-c 03:30, 12 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Funny" and an uninformed "must have" are not valid arguments for keeping. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:54, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>And valid arguments for deletion are what, you've never heard of it? Since when has world opinion been solely based on <b>YOUR</b> statements? If we should delete all <b>"irrelevant"</b> pages on Wikipedia, maybe we should get rid of your user page. I mean really, are you notable, are you famous, and superbly rich? Does anyone here really care about you? Do they really want to know whether you can speak a basic level of Spanish or whether you love/hate user boxes? No one cares, yet no one's petitioning to delete it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>So you know, don't comment you something that <b>YOU</b> are so uninformed about. God, such ignorant Americans.... Oh one tidbit, I was on the phone with my one my cousins in Novi Sad (oh, wait you don't even know where that is!) this morning, and I asked him about the song and he said that it is still very popular. Unless you want me to tap the phone next time, pay a "neutral" translator to translate it to English, send you the tape to prove my point, I suggest you take my word for it and try to better Wikipedia for all, by adding articles insteading of deleting them. The only people that are not voting for keep here are you, uninformed, pro-democracy fanatics and/or Albanian nationalists who have no idea what they are talking about and just want to see anything Serbian wiped off the map. C-c-c-c 19:02, 12 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ouch. Zoe is just trying to do the best by Wikipedia as she can. Please keep <a href="../../../c/o/o/WP%7ECOOL_e649.html" title="WP:COOL">WP:COOL</a>, or read the "How we got here and what we learned" section just above, by Zocky. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> 19:46, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>My comments on this subject have absolutely nothing to do with the language that it's in or even the subject matter, for that matter. My sole concern is for whether or not an article whose only claim to notability is "I remember it, it was played all the time" and "it's funny", none of which satisfied <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Now, please point to any guideline under which your reasons for voting keep are acceptable criteria, and I'll change my mind. However, I also suggest you read up on <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. And your cousin in <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novi_Sad_3a12.html" title="Novi Sad">Novi Sad</a> (see, I know where it is, we even have an article about it) is not an expert on the popularity of songs in Serbia or anywhere else, is he? I do, however, find your comment about "pro-democracy fanatics" deeply disturbing. As a matter of fact, it just struck me: Why are you even <i>voting</i>, if you're not pro-democracy? We should just delete this now, since democracy is such a bad thing and anybody with authority can just overrule everybody else, huh?</li>

<li>Is it possible that Zoe hasn't read anything but the last few comments? Just when the pedants had finally agreed that the song was notable, we get this renewal of the resistance.

<li>Is it more than likely that <i><b>you</b></i> haven't read anything but the last few comments, seeing as how I've been in the middle of this discussion since the beginning, and seeing as how <i><b>I</b></i> was the one who nominated it to begin with, as a recreation of <i><b>two</b></i> previously-deleted articles which were deleted <i>then</i> for being non-notable? 20:11, 12 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry, I get all of you confused. Why haven't you been paying attention to the discussion that ensued from your nomination? <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfnjm_f2dc.html" title="User:Profnjm">Profnjm</a> 20:21, 12 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And on another point: are you suddenly in favor of this being a vote? It seems that the earlier ruling was that some sort of consensus emerges in spite of the vote -- a sort of Rousseauean "general will." Now we are treated to this debate on the nature of democracy, with the Nominatrix arguing that voting is a good thing.

<dd>Nothing "pretty obvious" about any of this. The articles were different in structure, content, motivation of creator, intent. You know that, but you can't overcome your urge to pick at it. Just because I don't have constant edits in here as I dog the creator of the new article doesn't mean I haven't been following along closely. You've taken over Balcer's role as pedant-in-chief. Frankly, it's getting sadistic. These things become occasions for some hyper-motivated admin. to keep saying "but that's not notability," "that doesn't prove a thing."

<p>Of course I support democracy fully, so much, that I wish to vote in the Montenegrin referendum coming up, vote in the British Parliament, vote for Quebec and Alberta separistism, and vote for cheaper gas prices. But what? I can't? You mean to tell me I can't vote in the British Parliament? Why can't I vote in the Montenegro referendum, or for the Bloque Quebecois? What, shouldn't my opinion be important as the opinions of the CEO of Exxon Mobil or Shell? Oh right, because I'm not a citizen in any of those places, or a board member of any big oil companies. This same idea applies with you, you have nothing to with Serbia, you are welcome to comment and voice your opinion but not try to push your own ideas (and unfortunately they will probably be ignored anyways, but that's life). You believe that you have the God given right to vote on anything you wish to even if it has nothing to do with you whatsoever, that's the problem with AMERICAN democracy. Why else are Americans always bombing/invading countries?</p>
<p>They think they have the God given right to change whatever they want, and leave everything they don't want to touch alone (ie. Sudan), but attack places oil rich Iraq. Also when quoting, please quote an entire sentence and not just a word (ie. "funny") so not to change the meaning of what I have said. And what I did say was <b>"... but find it funny and I agree that this song must have played a key role in keeping the hopes of people in Serbia during the bombings alive, and that made a lot of people rally together."</b> There is the reason right there.</p>
<p>My cousin may not be an expert (then again, neither are you), but the point is that in Serbia it is a still a popular and relevant topic, and as my cousin was a teen in those years it would have very popular for people his age, and that is the point. What he says is much more credible than what you can say, or I, because he has always lived there, he's much more familiar with things over there than I, you, or most people here anyways, with regards to Serbia, because he is in Serbia. My parents spent about a $300 every month calling relatives in Serbia, for over two months, to make sure they were alive during the bombings, and kids had nothing else but this to keep their hopes up. Sorry for sounding arrogant and angry, but this is really frustrating as I'm only trying to make the same point as almost everyone here. C-c-c-c 20:49, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry for butting in, guys, but can we get back to talking about the <b>article</b> instead of trading unrelated insults? It seems obvious to this outsider that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "notability hasn't been verified" side will not and cannot not back down unless verification is provided, because at this point it would damage Wikipedia policy to do so.</li>
<li>If any verification whatsoever were provided, the article would be allowed to live, since anything that was at all significant in an armed conflict/resistance clearly has much more long-term notability than thousands of forgettable ditties that do have Wikipedia pages.</li>
<li>The "is notable because I say so" side has suggested some excellent ways to provide verification, by contacting the theater group, radio stations etc. They just don't seem to understand that the burden of doing so falls on themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, could somebody from the "is notable" side please go off to gather such verification, and in the mean time we all shut up and get on with our lives? <a href="../../../m/g/l/User%7EMglg_c3b1.html" title="User:Mglg">Mglg</a> 23:03, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
