<li>This is a printer error message, true, but not just any.... Well written and has sources. I'd say merge to the appropriate printer article, but it seems to cover multiple printers. Merging it to the Office Space article isn't right either. (It doesn't make sense to propose a merge as TBC does, if you can't say exactly where, cleanly... that's an argument that, if notable enough, the article needs to stand alone) It should stand on its own. <b>Keep</b> or, if you must, merge but then make sure that ALL the other articles that reference it are properly corrected to point to the right section of whereever it ends up. Not a delete comment in any way shape or form. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 12:58, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>It doesn't. However we sometimes use as an argument for delete "This topic needs an article, but this one here under consideration isn't it, it's not well written and reflects badly on WP and there is no evidence anyone has worked on it lately to make it better...", thinking that it is better not to have any article than a very poor one. The comment was addressing that argument, should it be raised (which it hasn't been). Sorry for lack of clarity. The key point is that this term is notable enough to merit an article, or some exposition, and trying to force fit it somewhere won't work well, too many different places reference it. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:55, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps to some individuals, particular those who may not be "tech-minded", the phrase might appear pointless; but then, aren't any number of obscure topics which are uninteresting/unknown to the masses also "pointless"? In this case, the phrase is a <a href="../../../m/e/m/Meme.html" title="Meme">meme</a> of a cultural significance within a certain "in the know" group -- so much so, that it's referenced in a song written for <a href="../../../s/y/s/System_Administrator_Appreciation_Day_4cb5.html" title="System Administrator Appreciation Day">System Administrator Appreciation Day</a>: "<i>He's the only one in the office who knows what PC Load Letter means."</i> (by Canadian comedy troupe, <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Dead_Trolls_in_a_Baggie_2448.html" title="Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie">Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie</a>)--<font face="Verdana,San-Serif" size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 16:21, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can see that being badly written would push an article over the edge to be deleted, but I don't think it applies in the reverse situation. Yes the article is well written, but that doesnt overide that fact that its about an error code on a printer. Most of the notability seems to be attributed to its uses for a joke in a movie - in which case, it should have a short mention in the movie's page. However when voting merge, I am not reffering to the entire article. A short description of what it is and what it means followed by its significance as a cultural reference spawned by that movie. If neccesary, redirect the page when it has been deleted to the movie's page. In fact, I am adding <b>Redirect</b> to my vote. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a> 01:02, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The point here is not the diagnosis itself, but rather that HP missed the mark in developing this term for not thinking globally enough. That miss is (within limited scope) culturally significant given how widespread it is, and it has entered popular culture (again, within limited scope). Doesn't really belong on the movie page in my view, rather with the relevant printer (but which one? it applies to many) Hence not mergable. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:55, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, merge where appropriate. If it is notable for being in Office Space then that is where the mention belongs. If there is a band with that name—and there are numerous bands named after all sorts of common or clever phrases—then if the band is notable it will have its own article. Note that the main reason it gets more hits (which without office space references is about 30,000, not 70,000) is that it is a much more common error than for example "PC Load Legal" or "PC Load A4", because Letter-sized paper is far more common. "Paper jam", which gets more than 300,000 hits, does not have an article. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a> 20:27, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
