<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b>. Unusually for a discussion involving so many anons, all who voted passed my personal criterion for suffrage by having a reasonably long editing history suggesting an identifiable personality and commitment to Wikipedia. Three editors wanted deletion, two merge and one keep. There being no consensus, the decision mandated by policy is keep. This does not preclude a merge or redirect. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:59, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Delete. This article was previously listed in vfd as Krishnaology, it was discussed, and deleted, mainly because it was agreed to be a neology with little use. The article has reappeared under this new spelling. The same arguments for its deletion still apply. The term under both spellings produce a total of 76 google hits. Many or most of these hits are derived from the previous article, and from links and insertions of the term into wikipedia by anonymous logins. These additions seem to be an attempt to use Wikipedia to validate the term in wider usage. I listed the article in Speedy deletions yesterday, and the notice was then speedily removed by 66.68.156.175, one of the anonymous logins that has created the entire content in the past few days. Explanations for the removal of the deletion notice were posted on the article talk page, and on my talk page. I'm not convinced. <a href="../../../i/m/c/User%7EImc_99b2.html" title="User:Imc">Imc</a> 17:34, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b>! The present article is not the same content as the vfd article discussed above. This article is about theological infomation, scholarship, new developments, and it is also evolving. There are 5 theological reason for keeping this article.</p>
<ul>
<li>The only term used to discuss theology on the Hindu deity Krishna is Krishnology. It has been used to discuss the theological positions of Vaishnava denominations such as Radhavallabha and Gaudiya Vaishnava.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Although the term Vaishnava Theology is an appropriate application to all subjects within Krishnology, it is also too broad of a term. Krishnology, as an aspect of Vaishnava Theology, is a more specified term and is not aplicable to discussions on the role of other Vaishnava avatara such as Rama, Kalki, Budha, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The most important aspect of this distinguishment is discussed in the article; "An important outcome of Beck and Gosvami's work is that they have demonstrated how Krishnology is intradenominational by engaging both Gaudiya Vaishnava Theology and Radhavallabha Theology."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Just as Christology is a universal term within Christian Theology, and Momonism is specific to a form of Christianity; Vaishnavism is a universal term within Vaishnava Theology, and Krishnology is specific to certain forms of Vaishnavism.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Specialized terms exist to clarify communications. The term Krishnology is a useful term in clarifying the specifics of Vaishnava Theology, as has been shown by recent scholarship.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>SPEEDY DELETE</b> if it's indeed the same content which has already gone through vfd and deleted, then it falls under criteria A4 in <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> and therefore it can be speedied. &lt;<a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrini_e6be.html" title="User:Drini">drini</a> <a href="../../../d/r/i/User_talk%7EDrini_c4b2.html" title="User talk:Drini">☎</a>&gt; 18:55, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Also, if you tag it for speedy delete, it gets recreated, use {{deleteagain}} template.

<li><b>Delete.</b> This article and all the stubs it links to seems to me to be an attempt to promote a neologism that ISKCON does not officially use at this time. The only serious ISKON scholar who has consistently used the term "Krishnology" in reference to Vaishnava Theology is the late Tamal Krishna Goswami, who used the term only to reference his specific points vis-a-vis his theological dissertations as a sort of 'shorthand' instead of having to constantly write "Krishna-Focused Vaishnava Theology" over and over again in his Doctoral Thesis, which he <i>did not complete before his death</i> on 15 March 2002. The entire article and all the stubs that were created to link to it are attempting to promote a neologism that ISKCON does not officially use. <b>Comment:</b> Note, however, that ISKCON is undergoing a period of transformation at the present time, and as the works of the late Tamal Krishna Goswami are reviewed and the works of Dr. Guy Beck become more generally accepted, this term may at some point in the future become accepted as standard theological jargon amoung ISKCON scholars - at that point, it should be included in Wikipedia. It just isn't in common acceptance right now, and this article (and the stubs it points to) seems to me to be an attempt to push this neologism into common acceptance outside the community of ISKCON scholars. <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 21:25, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Merge.</b> I agree with the above in that "<i>this term may at some point in the future become accepted as standard theological jargon amoung ISKCON scholars</i>." In contributing to this article I found the 2 most important concepts specific to the term Krishnology have been; "<i>As a term, Krishnology differentiates itself from other Vaishnava theologies by centering its discourse on the Krishna avatar of Vishnu and distinguishes itself from other Vaishnava theologies centered on Vishnu avatara other than Krishna</i>" and that it "<i>is an academic neo-logism for Krishna Theology.</i>" These are two very valuable concepts specific to the term Krishnology!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As the comments above note; Goswavi used the term Krishnaology to stand for "<i>Krishna-Focused Vaishnava Theology</i>." Given the value of the two concepts specific to Krishnology listed above; this article should be merged under more appopriate titles such as; <a href="../../../v/a/i/Vaishnavism.html" title="Vaishnavism">Vaishnavism</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/i/Vaishnava_Theology_1a14.html" title="Vaishnava Theology">Vaishnava Theology</a>, or Krishna Theology, so that these valuable concepts will not be left out. I would suggest <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaudiya_Vaishnava_Theology_0588.html" title="Gaudiya Vaishnava Theology">Gaudiya Vaishnava Theology</a>, but then <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy_Beck_a033.html" title="Guy Beck">Guy Beck</a>'s work would be excluded.</li>
</ul>
<p>August 4, 2005 <small>(66.68.156.175)</small></p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> If <b>Merge</b> becomes the decision, then the ONLY appropriate place would be under Vaishnava Theology. As stated above, Vaishnava Theology is an appropriate application to all subjects within Krishnology. The other links listed above are inappropriate! August 4, 2005 198.214.51.1</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Or, if <b>Merge</b> is decided upon, then another appropriate area to merge the above infomation would be under <a href="../../../i/s/k/ISKCON_b180.html" title="ISKCON">ISKCON</a> in general. August 9, 2005 198.214.51.1</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It has to be merged with <a href="../../../i/s/k/ISKCON_b180.html" title="ISKCON">ISKCON</a>, because outside of Iskcon, the term is not in vogue.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfvk_7d36.html" title="User:Profvk">Profvk</a> 22:05, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
