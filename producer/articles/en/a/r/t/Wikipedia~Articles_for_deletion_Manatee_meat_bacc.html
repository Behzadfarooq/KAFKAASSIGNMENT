<li>The article you cite is simply a discussion of whether manatee meat is red meat or white meat. There is no legitimate reference to eating or hunting manatees. There is one quote from a person who has apparently tasted manatee meat, which is not a standard or notable practice. I had a steak recently; is that in the Wiki? No, it is not, and for good reason. - <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorporal_Tunnel_bf12.html" title="User:Corporal Tunnel">Corporal Tunnel</a> 17:15, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Huh? It's right there, "Manatees are protected throughout their range in the world but are still illegally hunted and killed in remote areas."

<li>And where, pray tell, does it say anything about eating them? It doesn't. You are correct in spotting my poor phrasing, where "eating or hunting" should have been "hunting and eating." As for steak being in the Wiki - yes, of course it is. But MY steak isn't in the Wiki. Neither is manatee steak. That's as it should be. - <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorporal_Tunnel_bf12.html" title="User:Corporal Tunnel">Corporal Tunnel</a> 17:34, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete.</b> This article has been deleted twice before, which should be reason enough. As it stands it's link spam and contains copyrighted material, and if you remove the spam and the copyright violations all that will be left is "manatees are made of meat, and sometimes people eat them."

<li>I am not casting a vote at this time but I can confirm that MUBOTE is trying to fix the copyright violation.

<li>In reading his Talk page and browsing his contributions, the main thing that comes through here is that he's in ninth grade and has a certain understandable lack of perspective in his past Wiki projects.

<li>The question should be "why keep" (respectively "why create" in the first place), not "why delete". I merged the details on sources into <a href="../../../m/a/n/Talk%7EManatee_4f89.html#Eating_Manatees" title="Talk:Manatee">Talk:Manatee#Eating Manatees</a>, as a central place for not directly deletion-related discussion, and left a pointer at the top of this page. If you want to convince other editors, start there. Those sources <i>aren't cited</i> on this page (beyond the basic fact that "manatees are made of meat and sometimes people eat them"). Instead, your 'taste' section <i>still</i> copies wholesale from Monkeyspit.com. There are <i>two</i> links to eatmanatee.com. Unless you consider a PO address selling books and t-shirts a reliable source, the details in that section are dubious too. Remains the reproduction of an unencyclopedic hunting travelogue. Fix it all, and there is nothing left. <a href="../../../f/e/m/User%7EFemto_bb69.html" title="User:Femto">Femto</a> 21:18, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'll add the lists of books and websites into the sources. Why did you delete them? --<a href="../../../m/u/b/User%7EMUBOTE_83d7.html" title="User:MUBOTE">Adam Wang</a> 00:30, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>I have never been assosciated to any of the websites I used as sources, ever. First, why would I promote their website? I am in 10th grade in Canada, not a college idiot with nothing to do. You may think, "If Mubote isn't affiliated with the websites in any way, why does he care so much?" It's becuase I have pride. Personally, I'm proud of starting the article. You may think otherwise.</p>
<p>Secondly, what would be my initiative? I don't think I'm a moron. I just ran across something interesting, and put it on wiki. Of course, wiki isn't only for "Interesting Things," you need sources. Which I have. There is no evidence that it is a hoax. True, it has been deleted twice, the second time by accident by Yamla. I recreated it after Undelete said I could. Yamla didn't know, and he let me remake. Manatee meat is just as much a hoax as beef and mutton are. Just becuase most people don't eat it, doesn't mean it isn't good enough for wikipedia.</p>
<p>Finally, if wikipedia truly does not censor, then why is this being deleted? I'm sure there are many joke articles on many other meats. Wikipedia has many arcane articles, and manatee meat is one of them. Manatee meat has sources, I'm fixing copy vio, I'm borrowing the books I have listed from the library, and I'm putting it on wikipedia. So please, consider my statements, and vote <b>keep</b>. --<a href="../../../m/u/b/User%7EMUBOTE_83d7.html" title="User:MUBOTE">Adam Wang</a> 00:42, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Adam, you have now voted twice here, which is in keeping with your continuing disregard of the rules and practices of the Wiki. You have also failed to identify yourself as the author of this article. Voting twice is <b>cheating.</b>
<p>You have added completely unacceptable sites as "support" for an entry that boggles the mind with its irrelevance. While you have removed the most bizarre and ridiculous of your subsections, the two remaining both fail as Wiki material. One is quoted in its entirety from a single unsupported web source which is a memoir column written for a tourist site, and the other is based on a joke website that exists only to sell t-shirts and "cookbooks." Your inclusion as an external link of a page on rexcurry.net, which appears to be a repository of undocumented paranoid ravings, is another instance of your failure to read and identify your sources. Your "educational site" is an email quoting a wire-service article about a single instance of <i>illegal</i> manatee meat sale - poaching, not cuisine. The "brochure" on the manatee is a management report which simply reports occasional poaching. The Thinkquest.org citation was written by elementary school students, complete with pictures drawn in crayon.</p>
<p>It appears that you do not understand the difference between a reference work, which exists for the edification and use of the greater public, and a blog or MySpace page, on which you can work out your obsessions in your own private circle. The standing article on manatees already has a sentence on the hunting and eating of manatees, which is more than sufficient for this pointless topic.</p>
<p>This entry utterly fails the first of the five pillars of the Wikipedia: "Wikipedia is an encyclopedia incorporating elements of general encyclopedias, specialized encyclopedias, and almanacs. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. It is not a collection of source documents or trivia, a dictionary, a soapbox, a newspaper, vanity publisher, an experiment in anarchy or democracy, or a web directory. It is also not the place to insert your own opinions, experiences, or arguments — all editors must follow our no original research policy and strive for accuracy." Please familiarize yourself with Wiki policy before you post any further articles.</p>
<p>You are sustaining an argument here as your own personal private joke. It is beyond trivia, pointless and irrelevant in the extreme. Your inability to distinguish between the relevance of beef in worldwide civilization and the relevance of manatee meat is rather alarming.</p>
<p>As far as your argument that "I'm sure there are many joke articles on many other meats" - any such articles will be deleted as they are found, and even if there are others it does not mean that this one should be permitted - especially since you have now freely admitted in the open that this is a joke, which <i>is not permitted here.</i> - <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorporal_Tunnel_bf12.html" title="User:Corporal Tunnel">Corporal Tunnel</a> 01:44, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>First off, I did not admit that this was a joke site. I admited that he monkeyspit site that I recognized that Monkeyspit, a site I unknowlingly used, is a joke site. All information from that website has been removed. Secondly, I did not mean to vote twice. I was just trying to sway other people to vote twice. Thirdly, this article is not random trivia, a dictionary, a soapboax etc. etc. It is encyclopedic fact. Eating manatees is "irrelevant" as "beef" is to cows! I can distinguish the difference between beef and manatee meat. Please don't insult me. Manatee meat is part of a culture, just as beef and other meats are. I have not freely admitted anything whatsoever. I have sources in books. I realize now that yes, my topic is too short for its own article, but no, I don't think that "manatee meat" should be removed completely. I agree with Yamla's idea below to double the existing article in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manatee.html" title="Manatee">Manatee</a>, which I added, and keep like that. When I reffered to Manatee Meat as arcane, I meant that it isn't as hot an article as the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> is. I wrote most of The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_of_Norway_16ea.html" title="Conservative Party of Norway">Conservative Party of Norway</a>. It isn't exactly the most popular article, yet it isn't irrelevant. I would be satisfied by a merge. I do not write joke articles. I am not a vandal. I am not an immature high schooler.

<li><b>Merge</b>. Although I seem to be in the minority, I'm <i>not</i> convinced that this is a joke article. So (for this paragraph, anyway), let's assume this is a legitimate topic. I just don't see enough content to warrant an entire article. The article on <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manatee.html" title="Manatee">manatees</a> has a single paragraph noting that they used to be hunted and that the commercial meat farming has been suggested as a way of preserving the species. This seems to be a relatively recent addition (wasn't there at the beginning of June, for example), so I suspect this article has already contributed to enhancing the main article. I'd like to see us look at the rest of the content and perhaps add some of it to the main article. I'm not talking a huge section, mind you, but we could at least double that section in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manatee.html" title="Manatee">Manatee</a>, I'd think. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 04:04, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
