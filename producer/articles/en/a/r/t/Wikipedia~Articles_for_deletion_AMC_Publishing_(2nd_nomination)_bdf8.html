<dd>Just to clarify my decision. The arguments for keep centered around its notability due to Lisa Macpherson's employment there, the owner being a Scientologist involved in her death and links pertaining to such. Delete argument was based on non-notability. Whilst I agree with the keepers, in that if the employer was linked to her death then perhaps notability would be shown, I fail to see any link at all made in the article. The article provided two sources <a href="http://tampabay.bizjournals.com/tampabay/stories/2000/09/18/smallb1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://tampabay.bizjournals.com/tampabay/stories/2000/09/18/smallb1.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2004/05/29/Tampabay/Scientologists_settle.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sptimes.com/2004/05/29/Tampabay/Scientologists_settle.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. One is about the business "flourishing", the other about the Macpherson case - and it merely states she was employed there. You are welcome to recreate the article <b>when</b> you can demonstrate its notability. I will be happy to provide a copy of the deleted article to anyone for this reason. Glen</dd>

<p><b>Strong Delete:</b> I would like to renominate this one. I was going to put it up for prod before I checked the history as it really is nothing but cruft (Scientology critic cruft, if you will). It has little notability as it is merely Lisa's ex-employer. How does that make it notable?? Other than that it is a Scientologist-owned business. Again, not notable. The point that it is well-documented <i>mentioned in the first nomination</i> is irrelevant to its lack of notability. The sole reason given <s>above</s> <i>in the first nomination</i> is it is notable because of connection to Lisa. Then I guess every one of her Scientologist friends would be notable too? How about her Scientologist hairdresser? Yes <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reductio_ad_absurdum.html" title="Reductio ad absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a> but it makes my point. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 08:27, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I can see how some people can argue that this article is notable in connection with the death case, but I'm leaning towards delete here because the company itself is not notable, outside of the death. i.e. I can see what the nom is saying, so delete per nom. (If the company has a bigger connection to Lisa other than simply being her employer, then I'll probably change my recommendation.) <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECopysan_6de1.html" title="User:Copysan">Copysan</a> 09:24, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I looked at <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bennetta_Slaughter_fbed.html" title="Bennetta Slaughter">Bennetta Slaughter</a> and saw that she is head of Applied Scholastics (<s>really??</s> apparently so, I didn't know that so more to her notability but not to AMC's) and otherwise prominent so to the degree that prominent critics and public (i.e. non-staff) Scientologists are notable then she is notable. But the company she was a part owner in is not. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 15:14, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b>: Listing the employer of everyone that dies in a hospital would be ludicrous and that seems to be the only thing causing this article to exist - that one of its empoyees died. That the owners of a business are Scientologists really has no bearing on anything imo. The test I use as I go through mentally and substitute the word Baptist (or jew(ish) or muslim) everywhere I see the word scientologist and if when I am finished I am left with a mental 'so what?' and a shrug, then the article/newsitem/whatever is judged by me to be a smear job, useful and interesting only to those seeking to malign Scientology (or whatever other subject). ---<a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlightlyright_e659.html" title="User:Slightlyright">Slightlyright</a> 15:27, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Remove the second and third paragraphs and there's really not a lot left; certainly nothing to assert any notabilty for this company. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 16:09, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>McPherson moved to Clearwater from Dallas in 1994 with her employer, AMC Publishing, a marketing firm operated and staffed largely by Scientologists. Like others at AMC, she wanted to be close to Scientology's spiritual headquarters in downtown.[<a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
I really do not see how that makes AMC relevant to the Lisa case in any <s>meaningful</s> <i>notable</i> manner (it is back-story, at best) nor how that makes this article anything more than cruft. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 17:00, 3 December 2006 (UTC)
