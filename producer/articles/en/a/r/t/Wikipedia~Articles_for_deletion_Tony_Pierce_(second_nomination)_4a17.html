<li><b>Keep</b> - 1) This AFD appears to be part of a concentrated and definitely NPOV effort to remove blogging related pages from Wikipedia. 2) Tony Pierce meets the Wikipedia qualifications as an award winning and notable figure within his field, as a published writer and as the subject of media interest. 3) The article does need a re-write - which this process should have began with, in the first place. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlowimperial_dfe0.html" title="User:Glowimperial">Glowimperial</a> 04:20, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b> - He is a published writer - aside from his self-published works, he is paid to blog by Gothamist and his writing is published by them on a daily basis. While his individual posts may not be <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> or anything, the body of his professional work is published online. I really don't see the difference between his gig and that of a magazine or newspaper writer. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlowimperial_dfe0.html" title="User:Glowimperial">Glowimperial</a> 13:16, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>comment</b> - I am not. I would think it appropriate for writers who are pioneering in their field or those who have won the field's major awards be considered to be the subject of a Wikipedia article. I still lean towards a "Weak Keep" on this on the basis of notability. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlowimperial_dfe0.html" title="User:Glowimperial">Glowimperial</a> 15:22, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

That's the closest thing the blogging community really has to a major award right now (that I can think of) - as I've stated before it's a new, developing field. 21:36, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> As per my previous comments, nothing in Mr, Pierce's missive on the other page is notable. Many people have shelves full of minor awards. Many people have contributed on the editorial staff of some small school or local periodical. Many people have kept diaries and influenced others to do the same. Many people have been interviewed by mid-market media for insights on their niche interests. None of the above, even in combination, is notable, and as such neither is Mr. Pierce's bio. <a href="../../../t/f/g/User%7ETfg_2e39.html" title="User:Tfg">Tfg</a> 04:20, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> His blog meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> given the number of other sources talking about him. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:26, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is not a set of guidelines for the notability of people (including bloggers), but a set of guidelines for the notability of web content (including blogs). It should have no bearing on the discussion.
<ul>
<li>If his blog is notable then we should have an article about his blog. What do you know? This would do nicely for it. Whether we have the article at his name or at his blog is a matter of semantics and not a reason to keep or delete. In either case the content should stay. What to call the article can be addressed after the AfD. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:43, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This wouldn't do nicely for it; this article is about the blogger, not the blog, and I think the article fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, the guideline most apropos for this article, in every way. I would argue that by <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, his blog is not notable, either, but that, again, is not relevant to the discussion. We're not discussing an article about his blog. <a href="../../../t/f/g/User%7ETfg_2e39.html" title="User:Tfg">Tfg</a> 05:07, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>

<li><b>Delete</b> After reading the article, I'm not convinced that this deserves its own Wiki entry. Having inspired others to create their own blogs is not sufficient. Perhaps when Tony truly does something substantial for humanity I will feel differently. Mattucd 04:28, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - per Mattucd; clearly not-notable. <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmax-_a23e.html" title="User:Jmax-">Jmax-</a> 04:31, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The ways in which he's notable have been mentioned repeatedly here...

<li><b>Comment</b> I would certainly agree with a rewrite if there could be some notability (not to be confused with notariety) from independent sources. Articles linked to in the discussion and in the article only mention Mr. Pierce in passing.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I agree that the vast majority of the thousands (millions?) of bloggers out there would most certainly fail such a notability requirement. However, as an artist with a large following and recognized <i>numerous</i> times by multiple <i>major</i> media sources, Tony Pierce is an obvious exception. As to your Jeffy Award, keep in mind that most artistic awards—such as the Oscars (a.k.a. the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Awards) and the Bloggies—are given by organizations representing the artistic community producing same said art. While your Jeffy Award might not offer much credibility in terms of representing the larger community, a Bloggie Award IMHO would. --Barneyg 13:04, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The non-trivial sources I have examined make mention to Mr. Pierce as "a blogger" and are not interviewing him explicitly. All of the articles content would remain primarily unchanged if another (I will say popular) blogger were substituted. Wikipedia is not a directory of people who have been interviewed by newspapers. Mr. Pierce does seem to be popular within the blogging community, but it is unclear what he has "contributed" to it outside the existence of his own blog posts. I think perhaps in retrospect, historically, we will be able to determine if he has had an "impact" on some industry. However, being listed as a contemporary, I do not think it is obvious that Mr. Pierce is <i>notable</i>, instead of just <i>popular</i>; thus I vote deleted. There's also the matter that notable people should not mention, and <b>especially not get personally involved in</b> their own listing in an encyclopedia; and while being singularly not evidence of anything, along with other things it slants my opinion in the direction that this is a vanity entry being supported by Pierce and friends. <a href="../../../x/i/p/User%7EXiphoris_85a7.html" title="User:Xiphoris">Xiphoris</a> 16:14, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, Blogging itself is article worthy, somepeople who has done work outside the blog area are worth articles but I just don't feel Mr. Pierce has done enough outside his area of expertise. Also people are finding it necessary to talk about their blog experience or comment on blogs themselves -- thats not on debate here. A rewrite is necessary, and if a rewrite fails to pass the tests again this needs deletion. I believe it fails to pass the<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> test and follows <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">WP:VSCA</a> in most cases fairly well. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMacMan_b672.html" title="User:MrMacMan">MrMacMan</a> 22:27, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I have only found one source, the G4 article. I would appreciate if anyone would list other non-trivial sources about Mr. Pierce below. Also please consider Wikipedia's guidelines regarding blogs as sources before listing any blogs here. I also feel I should point out that I have previously voted <b>delete</b> earlier in this AfD.

<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states as a criterion for inclusion: "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person." It continues, "This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles..." etc. Pierce meets that criterion. A quick search of the Dow Jones/Reuters Factiva service shows Pierce has been the subject of articles from the <i>New York Times</i> (27 May 2004) (followed by an echo to the <i>Times</i>-owned <i>Int'l Herald Tribune</i> on 29 May); Reuters (10 July 2004); <i>Straits Times</i> (Singapore) (5 March 2006); <i>Reforma</i> (Mexico City) (2 April 2006); <i>EL PAIS</i> (Madrid) (20 April 2006); <i>Los Angeles Times</i> (16 October 2003, 27 Feb 2003, 12 July 2004, others); <i>Le Monde</i> (25 June 2005); and others. The search string was (Tony Pierce AND blog). Factiva is a proprietary service, and thus articles in it cannot be pointed to easily. Re the argument that these appearances are "trivial", to maintain that you also have to implicitly maintain that all the reporters involved, in different countries, continents, and languages, all just happened to stumble upon the same "non-notable" source by random chance. While not impossible, <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">Occam's Razor</a> suggests the simpler explanation -- that Pierce is known worldwide as an expert on blogging, and worth getting a quote from -- seems more likely. Re the argument, "But I've never heard of him" -- neither had I, prior to this discussion. I am modest enough, though, to regard my own limited knowledge as not the end-all and be-all.

I think we have to use a stricter rubric with these kinds of things, and in the absence of WP:BLOGGERS, I think the notability guidelines have to be applied ruthlessly.

<li>Firstly, Being in Wikipedia is <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">not</a> in itself a sign that an article actually meets Wikipedia's notabaility standards. Secondly, Pearl-McPhee is vastly more notable than Pierce; I type her surname into Amazon and get a list of books written by her, one of them with #686 sales rank despite being a special-interest book released 9 months ago. I put in "Tony Pierce" and get... one book by him that they don't even sell, with no sign of his blogging book at all. Pearl-McPhee vs. Pierce is a perfect example of how web-fame and the ability to throw readers at Wikipedia in realtime causes people to vastly overstate the notability of full-time bloggers compared to people who are known for something else, and may or may not have a website. <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBCoates_04d2.html" title="User:BCoates">BCoates</a> 09:05, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Considering the New York Times, LA Weekly, G4TV, and Washington Post have all used him in their pieces on blogging, that SXSW has invited him to speak about blogging, that the country of Amsterdam handpicked him among twenty other bloggers to visit and write about their country, would all indicate that he is, indeed, notable in his field. Timecop and others fail to distinguish the difference between FAME and NOTABLITY. Arguing that someone is not notable because you haven't heard of them defies all logic. A "random article" click on Wikipedia will likely turnup someone or something you've never heard of - this doesn't mean the piece should be excluded. Moreover, Wikipedia isn't catalog of things everyone knows, as Timecop and Deskana seem to be in favor of. --LADude 08:37, 6 December 2006 (UTC) <small>— LADude (<a href="../../../l/a/d/User_talk%7ELADude_dd36.html" title="User talk:LADude">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LADude_8078.html" title="Special:Contributions/LADude">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There's too many coincidences to not be true. If I may direct you to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tony_Pierce&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=25330577" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tony_Pierce&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=25330577" rel="nofollow">original revision</a>, you'll note several claims that couldn't have been made by just a friend or somebody who reads his blogs:
<ul>
<li>"His writing style is impromptu, frank, respectfully opinionated, humorous, and uniquely careless of capitalization."</li>
<li>"He is patriotic but politically critical, while at the same time charismatic and quite the ladies man."</li>
<li>"He has published much other material online including photo essays, podcasts, and photos. He has completed several books via cafe press including How to Blog in which he discloses some of his blogging secrets, and Stiff, a novella in which he travels to hell, to meet Kurt Cobain."</li>
<li>"He has also been known to converse with such celebrities as Howard Stern, and Matthew Good."</li>
<li>"He ... believes in writing straight from the heart, and encourages others to do the same.</li>

<dd>So here we have somebody who knows about Tony's writing style, in great detail, knows about Tony's political views and behavior around women, his publication and the content of each publication, who he talks with, what he believes in, and what he does. If this were written by anybody other than him, then the police should get involved, as it would clearly be a case of stalking. Also notable is that this first revision is clearly devoid of any negative claims.

<dd>Actually, pretty much all of these details you mention have specifically been covered in his blog postings over the years, many of them on numerous occasions. Any regular reader could easily have written this article. Barneyg 13:31, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We have to assume good faith on this issue. Regardless of the final decision on Pierce's notability, it has been well established that he is a popular and well-known figure within his field. From my observation, it's highly likely that this article was started by an enthusiastic fan. The problem with this debate is that the irrelevant vanity issue (if vanity was the issue, but the subject is notable, we could do a re-write and be done with this) is muddling the more relevant notability issue. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlowimperial_dfe0.html" title="User:Glowimperial">Glowimperial</a> 13:12, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. In terms of references, all I've seen are passing mentions in articles about blogging, or short interview blurbs used alongside many others. Is there anything specifically <i>about</i> this person? I can appreciate that he's been interviewed, but lots of people have been interviewed and it doesn't establish notability. I don't see references which would allow us to write more than "He is a blogger, he invented a word". I also don't see any evidence to support him being a blogging pioneer. Am I missing something here? Would there even be a debate if he operated a non-blog website?

<dd>What leads you to believe that he is "a award winning and notable figure of media interest"? Slight mentions on the LA Weekly website, and the PC Magazine website do not make one award-winning <i>or</i> notable. They simply make you the basis of an article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Reguarding your comment, being notable in an obscure "field" does not satisfy the notability requirements. One has to be notable in general. Otherwise people would demand an article on themselves, saying they are notable "in the field of eating lima beans" or "in the field of raising weasels" or "in the field of writing in blogs" <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUSER-cacophony_7d2b.html" title="User:USER-cacophony">cacophony</a> 09:10, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I delete a lot of fancruft and non-notable crap from such articles. There is a lot of clean up to be done in these articles. And I would like to point out that I <b>hate</b> episode articles. You've made a very inaccurate assumption from my contributions, and I am very much insulted. You are basically suggesting that because I edit such articles that my opinion shouldn't matter.

<li><b>Comment</b> Cacophony - If you're really serious in your analogy that "raising weasels" or "eating lima beans" are activities comparative in nature to writing blogs then you should probably recluse yourself from this discussion - your bias is showing. If you can't tackle the subject's notability/non-notability without expressing your personal disdain for his field of work, then maybe this isn't a disucssion you should be taking part in. Blogging is no longer an obscure field, it has certainly become a functional part of mass media - accept it. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlowimperial_dfe0.html" title="User:Glowimperial">Glowimperial</a> 15:14, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I was interested in these "more popular than Loony Tunes" comments, so I did the search myself. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22tony+pierce%22+%2B+blogger" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22tony+pierce%22+%2B+blogger" rel="nofollow">I got a slightly different result</a> after specifying that I was looking for Tony Pierce the blogger, rather than Tony Pierce the actor. He got fewer results than all the Loony Tunes characters. Of course, that's only half the equation. The other half is who actually searched. Intrigued, I decided to consult google trends to see who's been searching for Tony Pierce, compared to the Loony Tunes characters. <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=tony+pierce%2Cbugs+bunny%2Cyosemite+sam%2Ctweety+bird%2Celmer+fudd%2Cdaffy+duck%2Cporky+pig&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/trends?q=tony+pierce%2Cbugs+bunny%2Cyosemite+sam%2Ctweety+bird%2Celmer+fudd%2Cdaffy+duck%2Cporky+pig&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all" rel="nofollow">The results</a>weren't very surprising - all the characters are more popular than him.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hasn't it been established time and time again that the number of Google hits is irrelevent? Besides, your logic and evidence is flawed, as 1. Google trends is a Google labs product that only searched some news articles and doesn't give an actual count. 2. You assume that anyone searching for Tony Pierce "the blogger" would make the distinction in a search. 3. Comparing a living person to Looney Tunes characters and arguing notability? A true disservice to Wikipedia that the comparison keeps coming up, regardless of your feelings towards Pierce or the residents of Toon Town. --LADude 09:13, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm all about freedom of speech, but 1) he admitted he was a troll, 2) all people from his organization admit as much. That's not the same as a username mistake. Someone doesn't, by chance, end up stating their allegiance to GNAA, but actually they were mistaken with someone else. If someone goes around downtown New York city, and screams "I'm a member and the founder of al-Qaeda", or "I'm an active member of the local gang that's been guilty of constant murder" - then they would be arrested (especially if other gang members had done the same).

<dd>I think you're right about this user. However, I think you're wrong about people in general.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It is amazing to me that there is even a question about Tony Pierce deserving a Wikipedia entry. I've been blogging since 2002, and when I started Tony was already a well established blogfather. He has spawned and inspired so many bloggers. He has been featured in so much media coverage. If you don't include Tony Pierce, then there isn't a blogger in the world who should be included. The only reason I can think this issue even came up is pure T jealousy. It's very existence is unfair and unjust to Tony.--swearenger</li>

<li>If being "a blogfather" is all that significant, maybe you should go create an article on it. As is, I don't see how his being "a blogfather" is notable when, right now, near as I can tell, the word, itself, isn't. Also, your "there isn't a blogger in the world who should be included [if Tony Pierce isn't]" argument makes it sound as though Tony Pierce is the most notable blogger to have ever lived.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would agree if it were not for the fact that Mr. Pierce has interfered in this process via his website, friends, and directly. He, as a biased party, should not ever have commented on the deletion page of his own article. That he did speaks of something; perhaps the article's vanity, perhaps something else. Whatever it is, I find myself resenting it. <a href="../../../x/i/p/User%7EXiphoris_85a7.html" title="User:Xiphoris">Xiphoris</a> 22:31, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
