<li>A runner-up in a national Idol series is a very liberal application of "promiently featured in major music media," and that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criterion is rarely interpreted to include people who appear on game shows. As I recall, articles on runners-up in Survivor and American Idol (which, unlike Australian Idol, are broadcast internationally) are almost always deleted. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 09:40, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>AFD results have changed. Quite a number Idol finalists have been kept (or often not nominated, based on acceptance). Generally those outside the top 10 have been kept out. If you re-read the nomination, the current version of the article in question, the show article, the person's web profile, the show web site, do a google on him, look at more recent AFD precident, you'll see it's a slam-dunk keep. Also, this is not a 10 minute appearance on price-is-right. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 09:50, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I did all of those things and I still disagree. (Anything that isn't an obvious {{<a href="../../../n/n/-/Template%7ENn-bio_82c9.html" title="Template:Nn-bio">nn-bio</a>}} candidate I Google before nominating.) I was making a distinction between cast and contestant, not comparing him to a one-time contestant on a typical game show. (I just couldn't remember the word "contestant.") The term "television personality" is generally not used to refer to the latter. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 09:58, 20 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I suspect you're using the criterion of who is *worthy* of notability, and not who has generally been found to be notable. Wikipedia shouldn't be picking who it thinks is worthy of notability. Rather, if somebody has been widely found to be notable (media coverage being one factor), that means there is a) sufficient sources of reliable information to make a good article and b) sufficient number of people with an interest to read and edit the article. The fact any of us don't think they "deserve" it, is quite irrelevant. Your views on what a television personality is are a leftover of the 1980s, and no longer apply. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 10:06, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I was applying <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and AFD precedent in what I saw as a straightforward way, not making some sort of worthiness judgement. I'm wholly indifferent to Australian Idol or its contestants. I suspect keeping this article will mean it's a stub forevermore or filled with the sort of silly "contestant profile" trivia one finds on Idol fansites, however.<br />

If he wins, he <i>might</i> in time become notable, but if Wikipedia has a page for every contestant (or even just every finalist) in every national variant of every "reality" TV show it will (IMO) rapidly become completely unworkable. Perhaps the best thing would be to merge all of them into a single article for each (national?) show; they can always be split out again if they do in future become genuinely notable.
