<li>The crucial difference is that while a truly indiscriminate list, such as Actors who have blue eyes, would give no useful encyclopedic information about either category ("actors" or "blue eyes"), the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_in_Playboy_2000-present_43b7.html" title="List of people in Playboy 2000-present">List of people in Playboy 2000-present</a> does give useful encyclopedic information about <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy.html" title="Playboy">Playboy</a>, and the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_Daily_Show_guests_b91c.html" title="List of The Daily Show guests">List of The Daily Show guests</a> does give useful encyclopedic information about <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Show_00d8.html" title="The Daily Show">The Daily Show</a>. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 05:05, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't agree that the List of Playboy people articles <i>do</i> offer "useful and encyclopedic information." The simple fact that someone was interviewed for a publication is not in and of itself notable or encyclopedic. I also think it sets a bad precedent for the establishment of other equally poor lists of people who are connected only by the happenstance of being booked on the same talk show, regardless of how many months or years apart those appearances were. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 05:20, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nothing gives more information about the content of a broadcast or publication than an objective listing of its contents (as opposed to a plot summary, which is an inherently subjective listing). The encyclopedic point of looking at such lists isn't to suggest a connection between the people involved; it's to give information about the contents of the broadcast or publication. It may say nothing about <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cleese_d081.html" title="John Cleese">John Cleese</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Pervez_Musharraf_6841.html" title="Pervez Musharraf">Pervez Musharraf</a> that they both appeared on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Show_00d8.html" title="The Daily Show">The Daily Show</a>, but it most definitely says something about <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Show_00d8.html" title="The Daily Show">The Daily Show</a> itself. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 05:32, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, it says that TDS booked a particular guest on a particular day. To which my response is a politely stifled yawn. Talk shows book guests.

<li>It gives information about what kind of guests The Daily Show books--information which any hypothetical future scholar researching The Daily Show would want to know.

<li>Re: WP:NOT#IINFO: this is not an indiscriminate list and absolute not a plot summary list (why did you say "essentially"?) because I don't see anything about the plot.

Just because it happened on a TV show doesn't make it less of a fact than a list of occurances of a geographical feature?</li>
<li>Re: WP:NOT#SOAP: I see no reason why this is a soapbox. There is no POV advocacy, certainly no self-promotion, and hardly advertising.</li>

Additionally, the nominator has to justify why they are listing it (step two <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html#How_to_list_pages_for_deletion" title="WP:AFD">requires a reason</a>). It would be absurd for a nominator to just list an article without a reason. To get philosophical, if the burden is not on the nominator then every article should be up for AFD the second it's created and, ultimately, every article should have an AFD. And to that extent there is no box for a user to justify why the article was created. And, you know, if the burden really was on the creator then creation of an AFD <b>SHOULD</b> require the creator be both notified and given first chance to respond to the AFD. All things considered: nothing plays to put the burden on the creator. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 05:26, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, I admit there is some level of being a TV guide. "Oh, Jimmy Carter will be on next week...I <i>can't</i> miss that one." Second, there's the opposite issue: "Last month or two there was some woman on about stem cells. Who was that? And what book? Oh, <a href="../../../e/v/e/Eve_Herold_d864.html" title="Eve Herold">Eve Herold</a> and Stem Cell Wars." Third, by topic: "What was that one joke about <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Rumsfeld_67a3.html" title="Donald Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> resigning? Hmm, it was announced on 11/8/06 so...yup, it was probably on 11/9/06." Fourth: "When the heck was <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> on the show? 8/24/04."

And as for "in the absence of clear policies or guidelines against articles on such subjects" what part of "Wikipedia is not a directory" don't you understand?

<dl>
<dd>You mean you actually have an answer and you're just not gonna give it out unless you trade for my answer? The point to my question was practicality, not that there's a guideline saying anything in Wikipedia has to actually have some human purpose to it. I believe actual human readers should be served by Wikipedia because the purpose of a reference work is to serve readers, and all rules of Wikipedia should directly flow from that. Where the rules get in the way of serving readers, the rules should be changed or ignored and the service kept, not the other way around. That's why I usually advocate keeping articles rather than deleting them. But if I can see no use for an article, and if the article also violates a Wikipedia rule, then I favor deletion, and even "strong delete". And when I do that, because I just hate doing that, I look for ways my objections might be met and I try to state them in my comment. And sometimes they are met and I change my vote. What you're demonstrating here is that not only does this list violate the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">not a directory</a> rule, but that there's no practical reason for violating that rule because in the real world there's no real use for this list.

<dd>I doubt Richard Arthur Norton had this specifically in mind, and it doesn't make the direct "red vs. blue link" distinction, but perhaps the foillowing excerpt from the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a> MOS entry could be relevant to Otto's concerns: <i>Selected lists of people should be selected for importance/notability in that category and <b>should have Wikipedia articles</b> (or the reasonable expectation of an article in the future). For example, list of Christians doesn't include your neighbour, because she's not notable for her Christianity, she doesn't have a Wikipedia article, and she may never have. However, it might well include St. Peter.</i> (Emphasis added and Wikilinks removed) (original at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html#Lists_of_people" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)#Lists of people</a>). -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntepenultimate_a059.html" title="User:Antepenultimate">Antepenultimate</a> 05:28, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, preferably by moving to a <i>Daily Show</i> wiki or fansite. Note that I voted to keep the article last time, but I'm changing my mind; now it really <i>is</i> just a laundry list of celebrities. I totally agree with <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">User:Hyperbole</a> that "<i>It may say nothing about <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cleese_d081.html" title="John Cleese">John Cleese</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Pervez_Musharraf_6841.html" title="Pervez Musharraf">Pervez Musharraf</a> that they both appeared on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Show_00d8.html" title="The Daily Show">The Daily Show</a>, but it most definitely says something about <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Show_00d8.html" title="The Daily Show">The Daily Show</a> itself.</i>" However, the same thing could be said in one sentence in the <i>Daily Show</i> article itself. How about, "<i>The Daily Show</i> attracts a diverse cross-section of celebrities, from <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cleese_d081.html" title="John Cleese">John Cleese</a> to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Pervez_Musharraf_6841.html" title="Pervez Musharraf">Pervez Musharraf</a> (the only sitting head of state to appear on the show to date)."?

<li><b>Delete</b> canonical listcruft. There is no encyclopaedic topic "Daily Show Guest", therefor a list of them is arbitrary. Plus it's a directory. Plus it's of no interest other than to fans.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Wikipedia Is Not Paper. This is not a plot summary because The Daily Show interviews are not fictitious. This is useful information to many people - I use this page at least once a week. This information is verifiable and notable.--Pigu 21:17, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I think that the article is very useful to catalog who has been on the show, and it does not contain any actual plot summaries. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernandobouregard_51c0.html" title="User:Fernandobouregard">Fernandobouregard</a> 23:16, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - the articles form a record of events in the show, which, to an extent, represents literary, cinematic, political, and other popular output of the time. Who appears and why has a meaning greater than a simple list. Furthermore, I think the reasons given for deletion misinterpret the policies. <a href="../../../a/l/0/User%7EAl001_0795.html" title="User:Al001">Al001</a> 06:41, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
