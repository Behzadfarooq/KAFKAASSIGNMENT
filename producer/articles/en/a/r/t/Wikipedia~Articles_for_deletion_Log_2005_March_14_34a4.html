<li>Wikipedia isn't paper, but it's also not a newspaper. Sadly, a teacher being arrested on drug charges isn't uncommon or especially notable.

<p>Original research, personal essay. No sources given for any of the statements in it. Nothing wrong with it, all sensible stuff, but all presented on the sole authority of the contributor. Should not be kept in its present form. (By the way, this is <i>not</i> a re-creation of the previously deleted material under this title).</p>
<p>The <i>topic</i> is encyclopedic—and is presently dealt with in the article <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">Historicity of Jesus</a>.</p>
<p>I personally think the disposition of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Quest_for_the_Historical_Jesus_ddd8.html" title="The Quest for the Historical Jesus">The Quest for the Historical Jesus</a> should simply be <b>delete,</b> because I don't think this is an appropriate title, and not one that anyone would be likely to type in when looking for this material.</p>
<p>However, two redirects are worth considering. One is to <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">Historicity of Jesus</a>. The other is to <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Schweitzer_70b0.html" title="Albert Schweitzer">Albert Schweitzer</a>, because the title is <i>extremely</i> similar to <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Schweitzer_70b0.html" title="Albert Schweitzer">Albert Schweitzer</a>'s famous book on this topic, <i>The Quest <b>of</b> the Historical Jesus</i> and is a plausible mistake for someone looking for Schweitzer's book. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:02, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><s>Yes, that's all very well, but what to do with the existing content? It appears to be a well-written essay with very little POV-pushing, and it would be a shame to just delete it. I suggest <b>merging</b> some of the background material into <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">Historicity of Jesus</a>, to offset that article's fragmentory nature.

<li>It's more than just a <i>plausible</i> mistake for Schweitzer's book title; there are numerous references on Google to Schweitzer's book that <i>do</i> give the title as "for". Should probably redirect to Schweitzer. I'd also suggest that the book appears notable enough that <i>maybe</i> an article on the book itself might not be a bad idea; if there already is one or somebody wants to write one, redirecting this title there might be an even better idea. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 02:46, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agree, but I'm not that person... BTW I assume Schweitzer's book was written in German so the title is a translation, but all sixteen copies in several editions in my local public library network's online category use "of." and it has stuck in my mind precisely because "for" would seem more idiomatic... just as <i>On the Edge of the Primeval Forest" has always sounded odd because "Jungle" would seem to be the natural term... <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 11:01, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</i></li>

<p>As the author of the piece, I am heartened by the response. I wrote it only because I did not find the historicity page, which goes far beyond what I wrote, off the cuff, but did find a page whose author read the Bible with little critical appreciation. Redirect it anywhere it should go.</p>

<p>This article reads like it came straight out of a piece of promotional literature and is in no way an encyclopedia article. Information about the "children's play area" and "full parking facilities", totally redundant duplication of a section on the history of steam, and even the museum's phone number mean that this article is entirely composed of padding and once pared down to an acceptable standard would have nothing worth keeping, except for the fact of the museum's existence, which could get a sentence in the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shildon.html" title="Shildon">Shildon</a> article. The author appears to have failed to grasp the nature of Wikipedia and doesn't appear to have read the warning above the edit box: "Please do not create an article to promote yourself, a website, a product, or a business."</p>
<p>I'm listing for deletion on the grounds that the museum is not especially notable, the article is irredemably <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a>, and that anything worth keeping could be easily merged into <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shildon.html" title="Shildon">Shildon</a>.</p>

<li>It's not patent nonsense or original research or an essay; it's an explanation of the contents of <i>Waking the Tiger</i> by Peter Levine. That being said, however, I think I've had this article on my own watchlist for most of the six months it's been on cleanup and I haven't been able to tackle the task of taking it from what it is to something more encyclopedic. So while I support a "Waking the Tiger" article, I'm not sure this is the base to work from. <b>Weak keep and strong cleanup</b>; I'll start the cleanup with an intro that assumes it will be moved to <a href="../../../w/a/k/Waking_the_Tiger_03c6.html" title="Waking the Tiger">Waking the Tiger</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 15:12, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>The book is notable to warrant its own article and is very relevant, I believe.

I will be creating See-also links from articles on or related to Healing and Fear. I don't feel the need to push for this article anymore if the above is well done.

<li>That doesn't negate xyr point, though. What negates xyr point is to note that there's little evidence that "cromulent" is the correct spelling and "kromulent" is not, given that the word is only said and not written and especially given the various other "K" for "C" substitutions that occur in the programme. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:02, 2005 Mar 14 (UTC)

<li>No, but fandom (and consistency with other English words) would imply a "C" spelling. For comparison, Cromulent gets 38800 googles, while Kromulent gets 23. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 15:16, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, but on the other hand, no Wikipedia editor knows everything, and the original article hardly did a good job of persuading any editor who had never come across the story that what it was talking about actually existed. The rewrite is not perfect, but is enough. I'll try to improve the article in a bit.

<p>NOT FAIR TO INCLUDE SEVEN DIFFERENT ARTICLES ALL TOGETHER! CERTAINLY THE WORD "CENTENARIAN" MEANS MUCH MORE IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE THAN QUINQUAGENARIAN.</p>
<p>This is just a case of "WIKTIONARY GONE WILD." Someone just discovered the "fun" of creating dictionary entries and is now on a rampage against the WIKIPEDIA. But let's face the facts: an encyclopaedia tells a whole lot more than a mere dictionary ever will.</p>
<p>While I am not saying this should be deleted I will point out the following problems with this article: It consists of the following: a definition, a calculation which is not year aware and so must be manually edited the first of each year (and is not particularly informative in my opion, but that's just opinion) and a list of people in a certain age range. This list is (1) incomplete and (2) <b>always changing</b> as people age into and out of this range. This would require perpetually manual maintenance. I suggest it be considered if the page, as constructed, is useful or even possible. <a href="../../../r/j/f/User%7ERJFJR_0643.html" title="User:RJFJR">RJFJR</a> 03:25, Mar 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

Keep. First of all, there are people creating these lists, and to them this must mean it is important. To claim that the lists should be deleted because it is "too much work" is an argument that could be made for Wikipedia itself. Second, since few people reach age 110--and even then, the "lists" include only a short, top-ten or something list--this is certainly NOT going to change every day. How many times is the record for "oldest person in England" going to be broken? It was set in 1993, and still stands. Meanwhile, track records fall every week.
<p>I agree that the articles on "quinqagenarian" or whatever aren't very useful, but all you have to do is to trim them and get rid of the "living 50-year-olds" which is a waste of time. But don't throw the granny out with the bathwater. ~~</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not a general information base. People keep wanting to create "list" articles that don't add basic information to the encyclopedia but simply present the results of a hypothetical query against the information present in other articles, assuming that information was in a form that could be queried. For example, this list is the result of the hypothetical query: Select NAME from BIOGRAPHY_ARTICLE where (NOW - BIRTH_DATE)&lt;60 and (NOW - BIRTH_DATE)&gt;=50. The problem is that there are an infinite number of such queries and the list articles that are created by this approach must be manually maintained -- the software is not actually doing the work. Manual maintenance means inaccuracy, incompleteness, and WORK! Furthermore, in many cases the query implicit in these articles is not even of great interest, such as this case. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:10, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I didn't say delete <i>and</i> merge, I said <i>or</i>—performing one but not both of those actions is GFDL compatible; perhaps I should have said <i>xor</i>. Either would be acceptable to me.

<li>No, merge doesn't say 'keep this article', it says move the info and create a redirect. So 12 votes say this isn't good enough for its own article, and 3 say it is.

<li>What do you mean, I'm wrong? <i>"Merge to Example" is a shorthand for "Keep and merge the content into Example, leaving a redirect afterwards"</i> - that from the link you just supplied.

<li>So if an article gets 10 delete votes, 10 merge votes, and 1 keep vote, it's kept because there was no consensus to delete? That makes no sense.

<p>I count 9 clear "delete" votes, 3 clear "keep" votes and 3 clear "merge" votes. The opinion of the nominator is, in this case, ambigous.

<p>This was tagged as a speedy for being "patent nonsense" but it's a serious article and more like a "recipe" or DIY treatment, so I think it could be transwikied to wikisource.

<li><b>STRONGEST POSSIBLE DELETE</b> I'm no doctor and can't be 100% certain whether this is good or not, but I do know that certain things taken as an enema can be extremely harmful and even fatal. A beer enema does not sound to me like a good idea. I strongly recommend that this be deleted until, at a minimum, an actual doctor assures us that the recipe isn't harmful. I've seen some pretty tense issues here on VfD before, but this is the first one I would consider potentially a matter of life and death. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 22:19, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)

<li>A quick Googling mostly confirms my fears about this topic. Using alcohol in enemas can indeed be fatal, apparently it is absorbed into the bloodstream far quicker than it would when drunk, and death by alcohol poisoning can happen even with relatively small amounts. Even the few who claim to try it (as a sex thing, not a health thing) advise a weak dilution of 1 part beer to at least 5 parts water. This recipe is nowhere near as diluted as that, and 8 oz is plenty. And I'm sure none of them would ever dream of doing it daily for weeks as this article suggests. I have strong reason to believe that this recipe could be fatal if the directions are followed. <b>I HAVE NEVER OPPOSED AN ARTICLE AS STRONGLY AS THIS ONE</b> This isn't cruft, or spam, or vanity.

I also think that with a few truly famous exceptions like the Crips, street gangs tend to be unencyclopedic because their activities, members, and notability are almost impossible to verify.

<li>Even the police often have difficulty determining what gang pulled off what crime, how many members each has, etc. If we say "Chicago has 300 street gangs and 50 deaths believed to be gang-related", how do we sort the big-time killahs from the gangs who prefer to sit around and sip weak tea? Or do we assume, with an average of less than 0.35 deaths per gang, that none of them are notable? It's not like any of them put up scoreboards of their hit count or anything. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 00:02, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Perhaps if there was an article on 'Street Gangs of Chicago', their name alone might warrant mention in a paragraph near the bottom as part of a list which could be sourced from news reports; but how can Wikipedia source and verify any of the statements made in this article?

<li>The link doesn't work, and who writes it? To which standards is the information in that link held? Does the gang still exist? Did it ever exists? If it persists, in what form? Is it notable? How can we know that the gang still exists? And more importantly, how can <i>Wikipedia</i>, as a collection of reputable references and links, how can <i>Wikipedia</i> know? If you mean that I should use Google, the first page that emerges is for a gang called the 'Insane Popes', and it's laughable; this page <a href="http://www.racineco.com/sheriff/gang.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.racineco.com/sheriff/gang.aspx" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> has mention of the Popes in passing, amidst a much larger list? How do we know that the gang is not just three people, with a spraycan? How can we reference or source any information in the article, given that they are essentially a 'secret society'? And given that America has amazing lax gun laws, why hasn't anybody gunned the bastards down yet? My position is that (a) the gang's existence is unverifiable, (b) the gang's composition and history is unverifiable and (c) in any case, they aren't notable. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 09:58, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
