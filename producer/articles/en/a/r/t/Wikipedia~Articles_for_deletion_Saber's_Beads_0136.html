<li><b>Comment</b> The first canonical mention of Saber's Beads made was by a Richard Kone from British Columbia ('Targets Not To Miss', Astronomy Sept 06). The national/global magazines Astronomy, Amateur Astronomy, and the Reflector (as well as moonsighting.com) all find the rarely observed phenomenon worthy of mention. Stephen Saber, an accredited observational astronomer and author <a href="http://www.geocities.com/saberscorpx/home.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/saberscorpx/home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/saberscorpx/home.html</a> <a href="http://www.astroleague.org/al/obsclubs/master/mastrwn.html" class="external free" title="http://www.astroleague.org/al/obsclubs/master/mastrwn.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.astroleague.org/al/obsclubs/master/mastrwn.html</a>, was the first to note the exceedingly thin limb's staggered brightness peaks' similarity to those seen during a total solar eclipse. This is not a promotional attempt, except to appreciably boost the search for very young/old crescents and encourage Lunar observing in general. It was others from the astro community that nominated the term in the first place. It is now becoming mainstream. WK should appreciate the entry at its inception. Thanks anyway. -User:Saberscorpx</li>

If the lunar effect really does exist, it's probably going to have another name anyway. <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunStar_Net_0f71.html" title="User:SunStar Net">SunStar Net</a> 08:08, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for now. I would normally be very dubious of anything self-promoted and self-named, but it appears that it indeed was published in Astronomy magazine, and that the name was given to it by someone else, recognizing that apparently Saber was the first to notice it. This can be seen by this discussion on the Astronomy.com forum<a href="http://www.astronomy.com/ASY/CS/forums/307213/ShowPost.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.astronomy.com/ASY/CS/forums/307213/ShowPost.aspx" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. This seems to be another independent source for this<a href="http://moonsighting.com/saberbeads.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://moonsighting.com/saberbeads.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Ans this is the thread that started it all<a href="http://www.cloudynights.com/ubbthreads/printthread.php?Cat=0&amp;Board=lunar&amp;main=971903&amp;type=thread" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cloudynights.com/ubbthreads/printthread.php?Cat=0&amp;Board=lunar&amp;main=971903&amp;type=thread" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. All we need is an outsider with access to Astronomy magazine to confirm that it is mentioned there, and I guess this then deserves an article. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 08:33, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. As SunStar says, if it existed in the past it should have another name. If it's a brand new phenonmenon it's gonna need more than this little article to explain it. Lindsay H. 13:06, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: As far as I understand it (I'm no astronomer) it is quite hard to observe the Moon so close to it's New Moon phase, due to it being close to the Sun (visually). This would explain why it hasn't been noticed earlier (the phenomenon obviously has existed virtually forever, but no one noticed it before). And the Moon get's looked at at a lot, but normally <i>not</i> so close to New Moon, since that is the least interesting period to watch it (why look at a dark surface when you can see it much better one or two weeks later?). Having said all that, I don't really oppose a delete, but not for OR and geocities reasons, but due to lakc of more sources. It can well be argued that one source (Astronomy magazine), even though that is obviously an important one, is not enough to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:23, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_moon.html" title="New moon">New moon</a>, or else <i>very weak delete</i> until/unless more sources are found. The phenomenon is certainly real, and we should mention it <i>somewhere</i>. As for the name, Fram's links convince me that it's a legitimate neologism used by people other than its namesake, but I still feel we need more evidence that it's really catching on, and that it isn't just an indepently coined name for something with another, more established name. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 18:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The article was not submitted without diligent research. A Virtual Moon Atlas software preview can be simulated between .75 and .95 / 29.25 and 29.45 (days) lunation with maximum penumbra. While the solar eclipse counterpart is initiated by direct sunlight through our moon's valleys, Saber's Beads are first detected by the earliest angular illumination of the mountains. How had this obvious and beautiful phase gone unmentioned for so long? There are at least three possibilities; timing, desire, and recognition. Virtual Moon Atlas software simulations show the best aesthetic window to be 18-22 hours on either side of New Moon. How many clear shots at this exact window does one get over, say, 5 years? Not many. Also, veterans in search of record/near-record thin crescents are often waiting for the challenge of something in the 10-16 hour range to test their skills. In addition, except for the celestial players involved, witnessing an eclipse and hunting a Lunar sliver are very different endeavors. The mindset during the separate events may simply preclude immediate recognition of this more subtle but unmistakably similar phenomenon. Our moon's rugged topography and constant libration will also vary the Beads' appearance, which is further enhanced by associated low-altitude scintillation.<a href="http://www.geocities.com/saberscorpx/beads.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/saberscorpx/beads.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> In any case, it gives Lunar observers and imagers something new, challenging, and interesting to watch for. If anything, it should be linked to Lunar Phase, Moon, and Observational Astronomy.If the article remains, Mr. Saber will furnish more sources and images as they become available. Thank you.

<li><b>Delete</b>, nothing in the above comment does anything to distinguish this from original research. To be clear, it's a cool phenomenon (if it exists, which I trust it does), but that's not enough to keep it around. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshleyMorton_4612.html" title="User:AshleyMorton">AshleyMorton</a> 14:42, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
