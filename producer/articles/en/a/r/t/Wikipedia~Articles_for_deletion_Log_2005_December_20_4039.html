<li><a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> is quite right. Whilst Wiktionary will take everything that editors have to give on the etymology and roots of the <i>word</i>, and is the correct place for such lexicography, Wikipedia is the place for discussion of the <i>activity</i>.

<li><b>Comment:</b> The terms tackle and dribble are generic and apply to many sports as their articles show. W.r.t. tackle, many sports (including all types of football) have specific laws dealing with the legality of certain means of tackling an opponent (in some cases it goes further to define what constitutes a tackle and what laws apply when a tackle takes place etc.). "Tackle" is part of the official vocabulary of the sport. Nutmeg is exclusive to soccer and is a slang term which would not be found in any rule book. Consequently there does not seem to be much to say about it besides describing what it is. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 11:04, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment-in-reply</b>: I put up this AFD and can safely say that I love football: the bulk of the current article <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">Football (soccer)</a> was written by me in a series of major rewrites, in addition to almost all the articles on restarts (many new articles), the article on fouls (major rewrite), the article on misconduct (new article), the article on the field (major rewrite), etc, etc. As mentioned above, I just don't think the Nutmeg article as it existed belongs here (essentially a <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">dicdef</a> with a tagged on non-verifiable POV list); I don't think the recent alterations make it any more encyclopaedic.

<p><s>*<b>Abstain</b></s> - not really sure at this stage.

<li>Well, I suppose not, although when somebody is supposedly notable because of the company / industry where he works, I would expect those companies and indistries to have wiki articles.

<li><b>Reply</b> Okay, the argument against this article seems to be that it is not notable. The Google argument has been "beaten" and now we have the automation/CMC Associates not in Wikipedia. Flyboy Will brought up the latter argument. Well, try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_automation" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_automation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_automation</a> and as far as the CMC Assciates not in Wikipedia goes, it is a small, "home business" (see <a href="http://cmcassociates.net/staff.html" class="external free" title="http://cmcassociates.net/staff.html" rel="nofollow">http://cmcassociates.net/staff.html</a> for staff). <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexjohnc3_9f63.html" title="User:Alexjohnc3">-AlexJohnc3</a></li>

It's impossible to sift through all you've written up above and discern your newer comments from the older ones.

(Of course I haven't read _all_(!) of Wikipedia, so it may be adhered to in most bios. I'm prepared to be corrected.) The Position section needs to be removed or rewritten, rather than a quote (IMHO), but I don't think the current edit is <i>too</i> puffy.

<li><b>Keep</b> - he stood for 2 federal elections in a seat that was considered to be a "safe" seat before he first stood, and he changed the balance of power, which in turn had an impact on federal politics overall.

<dd><b>comment</b> - the federal seat of Kooyong is still certainly considered to be a safe liberal seat; Peter Campbell's candidacy has not affected that status.

Note that Kooyong has in fact changed from "safe Liberal status" in 2001 to "fairly safe liberal" now - as per the AEC website entry for Kooyong which is referenced in the article. If you have any doubts about whether Petro Georgiou thinks the Greens are a threat then you could ask him. During the 2002 State Election the Greens polled 19% in Hawthorn &amp; 17% in Kew (lower house). I polled 15% in the upper house seat of East Yarra (now defunct). I have only included content that has been previously published rather than any "original content". Having said all this, I don't mind if the article is deleted.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. He's stood for 2 federal elections and possibly had some political impact. That said, I think the article is slightly POV, so I think a re-write or some editing would help it. - James Foster 13:50, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Userfy</b> - a candidate that has yet to score more than 20% of the vote in any election doesn't make it in the notability department, regardless of country, on running for office alone. The article looks like a political party policy paper. If the survives the vote, I'd suggest a dismabiguation since more people are familiar with another Peter Campbell: the character in the TV series <i><a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_%28TV_series%29_50bd.html" title="Soap (TV series)">Soap</a></i> whose murder midway in the first season propels the events of the next two years of the popular 1970s sitcom. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 16:38, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - As a new contributor, I think there is a problem with the process in train here. I checked the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Help%7EStarting_a_new_page_3f5a.html" title="Help:Starting a new page">Help:Starting a new_page</a> information prior to creating the page. There is no information there about <b>criteria</b> for page creation that is being applied in this discussion; namely that a page can only be created for a person deemed as <b>notable</b>, and that a person should not create their own page for <b>vanity</b> reasons. A Wikipedia search on "notable" and "vanity" yields no meaningful information on what these criteria are and how they are applied. Both appear to be very subjective and open to interpretation, and therefore considerably open to debate and dissent. I think this process needs to be made much clearer. Personally, I think any Greens candidate who scores the highest Green primary vote in any conservative held seat in Australia (in 2001) and the tenth highest Green primary vote for any lower house seat in Australia (in 2004) is notable. I think the top ten Greens seats (and candidates) would all be "notable". I bet each of the top 10 Liberal and Labor seats and candidates are. On the subject of vanity, the page now contains only information from verifiable sources, so I don't think it is "vain". <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 21:44, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I did some searching and found the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Vanity Page Guidelines</a>. Some quotes relevant to this process is:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"vanity by itself is not a basis for deletion, but lack of importance is (whether or not defined by the proposed Wikipedia:Importance)" .</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia (although consensus exists regarding particular kinds of article, for instance see WP:MUSIC). Lack of fame is not the same as vanity. Furthermore, an article is not "vanity" simply because it was written by its subject."</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"The word vain derives from the Latin word vanus meaning: empty."</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> What does charting on garageband.com assert? It certainly provides no indication that they have an impact inside of their genre or community in any real way. Looking at the rating given to the group's single on the site (rated at 2 stars) puts them somewhere down the line after #140 (out of some 1800). We'll need a little more than that to go on.DeathThoreau 03:54, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>"It certainly provides no indcation that they have an impact inside of their genre or community in any real way." - Is it fair to imply that because they are not a household name like U2 or Coldplay, their existence doesn't matter?</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Hey, I made this page for this band because the concert that I saw them in was unreal. All bands come from relative obscurity.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not just saying they will be the next big thing, I am simply stating they are a real band, and deserve recognition of such here in the Wikipedia. The band Motion City Soundtrack has not "hit it big" but they are in the Wikipedia. So why not Chumbly Biscuits? User:Kaox02

<li><b>Comment</b> - First off, if you read the top of your <a href="../../../n/m/g/WP%7ENMG_d058.html" title="WP:NMG">WP:NMG</a> you will see that it states very clearly "these are guidelines...not policy". But if you would like me to explain to pick one, which the article clearly states I need not do to keep a page from being deleted, I will do so. "Has established a tradition or school in a particular genre. " - This could not be more true of this band which if you listen to them, you will know they are more pioneers in music than most bands today. There are tons of bands out there that have a huge fan base but you may not have heard of them, so don't delete this page based on that.User:Kaox02
<ul>
<li>Which traditions or schools have they established and are there verifiable third party sources confirming this? As well, a bands with a "huge fan base" would meet the Wikipedia music criteria by having a charting album or single or complete a national tour or generate significant media. If we had evidence of any of those things, I would change my vote to keep. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 00:02, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't even want to argue this anymore. I've put a lot of work into this page over the last couple day's and I plan on continuing this in the future. If you had a band you were very passionate about and you wanted others to know about them and LEARN about them, which is what the Wikipedia is for, then you would know why I feel so strongly. Just don't delete it, it won't be good for anyone.User:Kaox02</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Most of the keep votes come from either anon 216.0.142.29 and User:Kaox02. There are, therefore, at most, two votes to keep. I suspect that these two might be the same person, and thus represent one person trying to stuff the vote in bad faith. Can anyone verify? --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThephotoman_1da2.html" title="User:Thephotoman">Thephotoman</a> 01:21, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Just so you understand something, by my count, I show 5 votes to delete, and 5 votes to keep. One of them is mine, and if I wanted to "stuff the ballots" as you so call it, I would have a hell of a lot more votes than 4. Not to mention, you voted to keep this page! As for the record label, I believe they are part of Eagle Records, but because I don't remember, I didn't want to put it in there. But they are legit CD's, I can get you one for 10 dolla.User:Kaox02</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. You can check my IP to verify that I am not the guy stuffing the ballot here. I understand that your buisness is to verify info, but the way you're treating this guy is not all together fair. As an innocent bystander of the situation, I've visited garageband.com, read their story and believe what I see. Wiki's purpose is not to predict the future, that much I agree with, but I believe it has a responsibility to report facts big or small. Maybe they don't have the large budget of U2, but they do exist as shown by the garageband.com entry and downloadable music from them. If I were voting, I'd vote keep.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. By the way, for all of you that are using the "Wiki is not a crystal ball" arguement, please read the info on that rule provided by the hypertext. You are suggesting that Chumbly Biscuits has not existed in the past, when clearly they have released material, with songs provided on garageband.com and diskography dates given. Please stop using this as your basis for voting them off. I vote KEEP.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>KEEP! - "after all, encyclopedias don't predict ..." - True. Encyclopedias state that which does exist or has otherwise been theorised to become established experience. I think this band has proven that they do in fact, exist by virtue of its garageband.com entry.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b> - So when do I find out if my page will be deleted or kept? I want to know if I should keep adding all that I know about the band?</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>; That AppleAddict is smaller than other forums in itself should not be cause for deletion. A forum can be noteworthy for accomplishments other than the size of its membership. In this case, AAF was founded and initially populated by members of MacAddict magazine's online forum. Since it's founding, AAF's membership has grown while MacAddict's active membership has diminished. In addition, MacAddict's once highly useful and active website has diminished both in daily traffic and amount of regularly updated content. Daily news articles, weekly feature stories, and a tech-help section previously authored by Mac Addict's own editorial staff have all but disappeared in the years since the AAF migration. The departure of so many forum members is likely not the cause of MacAddict's significant decline, but it is an undeniable marker in the history of a once important Mac enthusiasts' website. In addition, the "Migration" passage is clearly written in an ironic tone meant to depict actual events in a humorous style and tone consistant with the sensibility of AAF. The forum is a small and growing gem of internet culture and, as such, merits inclusion in the Wikipedia. —<a href="../../../b/w/_/User%7EBW_8be1.html" title="User:BW">user:BW</a>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Yes I have read the page, and no, it is not a "rough" guideline. It is in fact a guideline followed by many many editors when deciding on the merits of a website's inclusion on Wikipedia. The fact that the membership falls <i>so far short</i> of the recommended 5,000 is compelling enough for most editors to vote delete. The current non-encyclopedic/whimsical tone and content of the article does not help either. P.s. please sign your comments with four tildes like so: ~~~~, it will expand like so: <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 10:52, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The forum, based on the comment above, falls well short of the 5000 user guideline. It also has not demonstrated that it has an impact outside of it's own community. Also, once again based off the above comments, the site does not have a Alexa rank of 10,000.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I am sick of newbie bashing that often ends up here. The forum has had 472 users on at a time, which, if you can figure that out, suggests a user level well and truly above 5,000. Think about it - if the forum is big enough to get users come on here in droves, then its obviously a big enough forum for us to keep. They have 469,000 articles, which is a pretty good number you know. Just because they don't require all of their members to create accounts in order to post does not mean that they are a small forum. Easily meets the 5,000 required for WP:WEB. Thanks.

<li>Actually, 472 on at one time means a minimum of 472 members. That's mathematics. Claiming it means 10,000 is applying some unspecified theoretical formula. Besides, the site itself claims around 1,100 members, and while I agree that there may be many anonymous users, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> itself states that the <i>5,000 apparently unique users</i> guideline is in fact designed for forums that allow anonymous users.

<li>Utter, utter utter nonsense. If you have 100 users on at a time, you usually have 5,000 unique members. This is a ratio that is in common place and is the accepted average. 50 is usually about 2,000. So ergo 472 would mean around lets see 25,000 unique members. Or are you expecting me to believe that 472 on at a time means 1,100 unique members? For that to be true, the AVERAGE USER would need to be on for almost 12 hours per day. Do you honestly believe that? I think not. This is the most absurd interpretation that you could possibly imagine, and anyone who thinks that 472 on at a time equals 472 unique members has to have their head read. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 01:57, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Point of Order</b> I find no such consensus, and do indeed object. The guidelines that have been referenced many, many times here before have more of an apparent focus on web comics than they do forums. The guidelines for the forums appear to be directed at the average forum -- a forum where the vast majority of registered users do not post, and those that do, do so sparingly. The guidelines inappropriately ignore the potential for a small forum filled with very active members, or a forum that prunes its inactive users. To provide an example of where the AppleAddict entry may find itself useful, consider this: on the MacAddict Forums, it is quite often that references are made to the AppleAddict forums, and allowing a wiki entry for the AAF would be beneficial to newer members of the aforementioned MacAddict Forums who do not understand the history of such a reference. I feel the entry for the AAF represents an important historical reference, and given the nature of the history of the forum, that the entry itself is appropriate and not simply useless vanity. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumbergh_b587.html" title="User:Lumbergh">Dan Parnell</a>
<ul>
<li>We don't have an article on the MacAddict Forums, and if one was started I would speedily merge it back where it belongs - the article on <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacAddict_4a31.html" title="MacAddict">MacAddict</a> magazine. The reality is, the great vast majority of what happens on forums is unencyclopedic. The minute "history" details of who pissed off what to whom and did wrong to someone to cause some great DRAMA... is utterly uninteresting and uninformative to anyone outside the forum. I've been involved in some pretty big forum splits myself. Lots of DRAMA. Pissed off people. Split-offs. But guess what? Who cares? Nobody! Forum drama is unencyclopedic. It's especially unencyclopedic when it's a bunch of utterly uninformative bogus fakery. Please see <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> for an example of a fansite that is doing it right - Gtplanet. They may very well get a consensus to undelete and take another shot, because they've shown in detail why their site is encyclopedic - more than a forum, has reviews, file downloads, etc., notable in its field, etc. Nobody here linked with AppleAddict Forums has done any of that. Instead, y'all threw up a bunch of made-up crap on a page and expect us to keep it... why? <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 00:54, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The content you are referring to is neither 'bogus fakery' nor 'made-up crap'—it is factual. The opinion on a matter of notability from someone who is responsible for devising the notability guidelines has an inherent bias, and your comments are proof of that. —<a href="../../../4/9/9/User%7E499699787.html" title="User:499699787">499699787</a> 01:14, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>NOTE: This comment is addressed to FCYTravis: A "bunch of made-up crap"? All of it is based on fact and is directly related to the style of the AppleAddict Forums themselves. Which, if you'd been paying attention, you would know. Then again, since you also don't know that the relation between the MacAddict Forums and the MacAddict magazine is so extremely loose that merging articles about the two distinct entities would be inappropriate, I suppose it's unfair to assume that you pay attention to what is going on. It's clear you have an opinion, and it's clear that you think more highly of it (and yourself) than anyone with two brain cells to rub together does. I won't be heartbroken if the entry disappears, but if it does, I want it to do so for reasons other than the lame illogic and <a href="../../../f/u/d/FUD_f18b.html" title="FUD">FUD</a> you've been spreading to further your personal agenda and embiggen your ego. It's clear you have an ulterior motive behind your deletion recommendation, and the fact that you still cannot understand why the entry is there or what it is saying irrevocably establishes your inappropriate bias. It'd also be nice if you stopped editing out people who posted opinions on this page you didn't agree with. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan_Parnell_0923.html" title="User:Dan Parnell">Lumbergh</a> 01:23, 21 December 2005 (UTC) || Edited: <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan_Parnell_0923.html" title="User:Dan Parnell">Lumbergh</a> 01:29, 21 December 2005 (UTC) to correct an inaccuracy.

<li>Oh, please! Your bolded comment is a literary retelling of actual events! How inane of you to declare it non-factual without actually having been there to watch the events unfold.

<li>I think we have more then proved why this page should be left on the wikipedia. All those that say "don't delete" seem to have to say is that it's not a big enough forum. I feel, however, that size of something as arbitrary as number of users is rather meaningless. It would not surprise me if there was a webforum on wiki that had many more users but less *active* users. The history of AppleAddict is very much important in the world of the web, espically related to macaddict. For evidence of this, I would suggest one to scroll up and read the comments left. While it is true that perhaps the headings and grammer used may need some modifications, it is policy of Wkipedia to not jump the gun and delete things rightaway; it's always a work in progress. Perhaps if those of you that say delete without really looking into or trying to understand how the forum is pertinent, you would see so more clearly. Also, I would like to say the little box at the top of the page made me laugh my ass off. I really doubt anybody thought this was a vote. I believe most people wrote that as a type of heading to their post; to declare their position clearly. Arguing that you have to have a lot of edits is moot as well: it makes absolutely no sense. Just because someone has edited a few hundred times more then someone else doesn't mean anything. Perhaps the user contributed when you didn't have to register to edit? Also, perhaps the user just found the site. Then what. Then your saying that those that have spent more time going and doing research to edit posts or those that make up their info or those that don't know what their talking about have more authoritah. And that is, quite frankly absolutely dumb. Also, the point is it was deleted once out of haste. We know that it was deleted before. We know, and it still doesn't matter. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychomonkey_6f98.html" title="User:Psychomonkey">Psychomonkey</a> 05:02, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Using this rule of thumb, and defining the number of posts on the AAF at just over 270,000, we can solve backwards for the number of users, giving us roughly, 90,000. 1,100 users are posting enough for 90,000. That seems notable in it's own right. Rgejman 07:11, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You need to read <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> a bit more clearly. The point says first <i>5,000 or more apparently unique members applies to forums which anonymous users can read.</i> I still have no idea where this "472 registered members means thousands upon thousands of unregistered ones" comes from, and the way I read the guideline is that since all anonymous users are necessarily impossible to call "apparently unique", you have to look at the registered user base. I admit that is merely my interpretation and that it is partially what I have based my judgement on. Secondly, the rest of the guideline states that measuring userbase on the number of postings is only for <i>[f]orums which require a user to sign up to read or see messages</i>, so I do not believe it should be applied here (and in fact stating that "1,100 users are posting enough for 90,000 is missing the fact that anonymous users can post). Thirdly and hopefully finally, and again a matter of my own interpretation of the guideline, a verifiable impact outside its own community needs to be a notable impact, and I don't consider the fact that it's taken a lot of users from another forum whose only notability is a weak association to a magazine to be notable in itself. A simple question: Has AppleAddict, or its forums, been mentioned in a newspaper or magazine, significant online news outlet, or by a prominent person? If so, then provide evidence, and then I will reconsider my vote. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 11:33, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Frankly, you said it. You are not operating within the strict guidelines you purport by consistently exclaiming <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. The <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> ""does not"" say that a website needs to have had a notable impact - it says it must have had a ""verifiable"" impact. There is a huge difference there. Now, if you want to argue that what is ""meant"" is notable, then by all means edit the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> - but until then, don't throw the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> at this discussion as if it were the holy grail of wikipedian thought.

<li>Yeah well, even as such, what it comes down to is the page that discusses websites and forums says, in a nutshell "yeah, this isn't real policy, just proposed policy", which means it should be taken with a bucket of salt.

<li>Perhaps if the <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacAddict_4a31.html" title="MacAddict">MacAddict</a> article was edited to add in some of its forum history.

<li>Mostly because all the linked guidelines seem horribly arbitrary in what they deem "notable." As well as the people thinking Wikipedia is the intellectual equivalent to the Oxford English Dictionary or Encylopedia Brittanica. S0sumi 10:00, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Indeed. Poring over every new article like you're trying to cram the sum of human knowledge into ten leather-bound volumes is ludicrous considering what makes Wikipedia unique is that the marginal cost of each new article is so small; it's just extra bytes on a hard drive in Florida. The hostility towards new users and new content—clearly illustrated above—is completely inconsistent with Wikipedia's open philosophy. How many people will continue to contribute after having to battle this Afd process on each article they create? Especially when formerly anonymous users who register so that they can create articles have their opinions discounted simply because they have only a handful of edits. —<a href="../../../4/9/9/User%7E499699787.html" title="User:499699787">499699787</a> 11:02, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>People commonly cite our 'open philosophy' when they try to get what amounts to free webhosting to advertise their life/website/band. Wikipedia is about openness, but first and foremost it is an encyclopaedia. The most important thing, therefore, is that every article is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. Most of this article is not verifiable, parts of it are <a href="../../../b/a/l/WP%7EBALLS_8227.html" title="WP:BALLS">complete bollocks</a>, and even if the whole thing is pared down to that which is verifiable (very little), because this article is non-notable it's not worth Wikipedians who aren't part of the forums trying to keep unverified first-hand stories and suchlike out of the article. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 11:21, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>1) I know you've admitted your analogy is weak, but it's worth bearing in mind that it's more likely that the Americans have a torture camp in Afghanistan than it is that people have been abducted by aliens. 2) We've verified that eight people have claimed that they were in this prison. They were given enough credence to have their claims printed in two sources whom we should have no problem treating as reliable.

They had never even travelled to Afghanistan, prior to their capture.</li>
<li>I think every one of the prisons in the CIA's network of extra-judicial interrogation centres merits an article of its own.</li>
<li>I know some of the regular followers of {afd} consider themselves followers of <b>"mergism"</b>. I am not assuming that you Jamyskis are a "mergist".

WANBULA seems to be a genuine organisation, but I can't find a reference of sadorexia on their pages (although I can't read Spanish to be certain). If this was a genuine eating disorder, there would surely be more references to it.

<p>The whole article sounds like an essay more than an encyclopedic topic; also, it lacks neutral POV, and sounds rather crufty.

<p>The band was the first to use Captain Peacock for its one and only page. THE FIRST PAGE FOR THE BAND THAT WAS DELETED DID NOT FAIL WP:MUSIC. A notification was never sent that the band's page would be deleted to a canceled british TV show. This would have allowed me time to create an alternative page for the band. I felt it only right to take claim of the page by removing Are You Being Served?'s redirect. Why does Are You Being Served need this redirect? Captain Peacock the band holds American copyright and trademark for the name. Perhaps the solution is that we are allowed the page since Are You Being Served? has countless other redirects and let us have this ONE page. Also, perhaps wikipedia should make a "wikipedia UK" (along with one for Australia), as british culture is apparently VERY different from American. That way, all of your "bold redirections" can fit in with the appropriate culture. THE MISSION AND GOAL OF WIKIPEDIA IS TO CREATE KNOWLEDGE AND PROVIDE INFORMATION. BY DELETING INFORMATION - YOU CONTRIBUTE TO THE ABSENCE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR OTHERS. NOBODY DELETED ARE YOU BEING SERVED? SHOW SOME RESPECT AND TREAT OTHERS THE SAME.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: The TV-show-page creator made no attempt to contact the band-page creator that they would like a redirect. Band-page creator would have been happy to add one. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.142.130.16 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.142.130.16.html" title="User talk:67.142.130.16">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.142.130.16_d376.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.142.130.16">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> As someone who googled to find the meaning of the phrase Tactical Chunder I am very dissapointed to find that this article will be deleted. The subject matter is clearly quite vulgar but none the less a part of British culture. I believe the article could be rewritten in a more "encyclopedic manner" but it should not be deleted. With the exception of personal distaste, what reasons do people have for deleting this entry? I believe a merger would be acceptable as long as google can still find it relatively easily. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 152.78.72.113 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_152.78.72.113_8ba2.html" title="Special:Contributions/152.78.72.113">contribs</a>).</small>

Mind you, I'm not stating that "<i>we should keep </i><b>a</b>, <i>after all, look at all of the</i> <b>b</b> <i>we have</i>" is a valid argument. Anyway, if you check the IMDB link, the television show had 120 episodes; although this is a short run for (what I think is) a telenovela, it's enough to be notable, whether or not it's of notice to Wikipedia users who speak primarily English. It is very much ideal for Wikipedia to combat systemic bias, especially in media, where the project has an extremely deep, although narrow (mostly English lang.) focus. -<a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhymeless_6a19.html" title="User:Rhymeless">Tim Rhymeless</a> <a href="../../../r/h/y/User_talk%7ERhymeless_4dd3.html" title="User talk:Rhymeless">(Er...let's shimmy)</a> 04:41, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: In the UK, 'cashback' is something one can get when purchasing goods with a debit or credit card. You could, for example, ask for ten pounds cashback. Your bill is increased by £10, and you get £10 'cash' 'back'. Hence, cashback. It saves going to ATMs, etcetera. That should be referred to in this article. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 12:13, 20 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Hmmm...it is certainly a "rewards program", which is basically a form of loyalty program isn't it?. Maybe it's not <i>exactly</i> synonymous with "loyalty program" but IMHO it would still be better served as a section in the <a href="../../../l/o/y/Loyalty_program.html" title="Loyalty program">loyalty program</a> article. As for the use of the term "cashback" in the UK, that could probably be dealt with when this AfD runs its course. (On a side-note, the loyalty program article itself seems to be almost exclusively about loyalty cards and does not clearly define what loyalty programs are. I'm surprised to find only a link (not even a brief outline) to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequent_flyer_program.html" title="Frequent flyer program">frequent flyer program</a>.) <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 12:30, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Hmmmmm....being on the European side of all this, the name actually implies the system used in British supermarkets, where if you pay with a bank card of some description, you can opt to receive cash as you would from an ATM which will be charged to your card together with your groceries. I think in this sense the name is quite confusing. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamyskis_2c95.html" title="User:Jamyskis">Jamyskis</a> <font size="-3"><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamyskis_5b40.html" title="User talk:Jamyskis">Whisper</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jamyskis_a771.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jamyskis">Contribs</a></font> 13:22, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> as as above if appropriate or <b>delete</b>. The UK meaning of cashback should be defined at Wikionary as it doesn't warrant and entire Wikipedia article. —<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgan_almighty_3d50.html" title="User:Gorgan almighty">gorgan_almighty</a> 14:01, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. For those outside of North America, this is not a loyalty program. The functional advantage is that it saves a trip to the bank. Sometimes people make a small purchase (such as a pack of chewing gum) because cash back purchases are not subject to transaction fees and the price of a candy bar is less than the cost of withdrawing an evening's spending cash from an automated teller.

<li><b>Comment</b> It seems that Cashback mean different things depending on which side of the Atlantic you're sitting. Would it not then be worth having A) a Disambig page pointing to the Loyalty Program AND an article on Cashback in the UK, or B) Keeping this page and expanding it, to explain the differences.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think there's a lot more to say about the concept of "cashback" in the United States than there is for the UK version (where the US definition of <i>cashback</i> is <i>Loyalty Programme</i> or <i>Loyalty Scheme</i> in the UK), but it still has the potential to hugely confuse Commonwealth speakers.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> atleast where I've gone shopping you can get "cashback" when you pay with a debit card and they withdraw the specified amount from your account. This should probably be disambig to point to loyalty programs and Cashback from debit cards. --<a href="../../../p/b/o/User%7EPboyd04_487e.html" title="User:Pboyd04">Pboyd04</a> 03:12, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>This must be <i><b>really</b></i> rare! I went to law school in New York and I have been a lawyer in Texas since 1982 and I have <i><b>never</b></i> heard this phrase.

<li><b>Rename</b> to <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hold_your_horses.html" title="Hold your horses">Hold your horses</a> which is the correct phrase.

<li><b>Question</b> - is it possible to move this to <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hold_your_horses.html" title="Hold your horses">Hold your horses</a> and then have a vote on that? I don't think that there is any doubt that Hold the horses is the less common way to describe the phrase, and should be a redirect to <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hold_your_horses.html" title="Hold your horses">Hold your horses</a>. I think that there is an exceptionally strong case, however, that <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hold_your_horses.html" title="Hold your horses">Hold your horses</a> should remain. But can I move it during the AFD? P.S. I have rewritten the article using references, although it is still a bit sloppy right now.

<li>What do you mean no cultural reference? It means a totally different thing in Australia as compared to USA, and in Australia at least has a big cultural meaning. Its up there with mate and g'day. I can't say what it means in USA or England or anything else though. But its huge here. My grandpa used to say it all the time to us little uns, and my uncles did too.

<li>I know, I wrote it badly. But you know, its hard to do and I get tired. But it should be said that this is predominantly a male expression that is predominantly said to other males, and that the age thing is important. It is almost always said from an experienced older male to a less experienced younger male. That younger male might be an employee, an apprentice, a nephew, a son, grandson, or in any other way under their care. This kind of term is VERY RARELY used by youngsters talking to adults. Almost never. It is also sometimes used with specific reference to <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse.html" title="Horse">horses</a>, more as a joke than anything. It is in unbelievably widespread use. I can think of a game I used to play called Totologies that used this expression as part of the game (it was a horse racing game). Not sure if the game is notable, but the expression certainly is. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 16:56, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Macologist_3526.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Macologist">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rebuttal</span></h4>
<p><b>Argument against deletion</b> Does indeed meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Having been the subject of national or international media attention;</li>
<li>A forum with more than 5,000 users that has made a verifiable impact beyond its own user community; or</li>
<li>Having an Alexa ranking of 10,000 or better.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although the Alexa rank does not meet this standard, the website qualifies on the other two categories. Also I believe the Alexa toolbar (used for traffic ranking) is a windows-only product, which results in a difficult-to-interpret ranking for sites the cater to a non-windows-specific niche of users.</p>
<p>Explanations below:</p>
<p>1) National Media Attention: Macologist has been mentioned three times in one of the two largest industry (Macintosh computer) print magazines in the US ("MacAddict") three times in two years: Oct 2004, Oct 2005, and Dec 2005. Coverage of Macologist is also frequent in the only other website on this topic of note, macgamefiles.com. The other major magazine is "MacWorld", which uses software developed at Macologist (see below in Impact section).</p>
<p>2) Forum size, verifiable impact: Forum size: The (publicly viewable) forum has &gt; 5000 members. (Currently 8455).</p>
<p>Forum size and media attention as above are extraodinary for such a young site that was only founded in June 2004.</p>
<p>Impact outside forum user community: As for impact beyond its user community, several game publishers refer their users directly to the site for technical support. For example for the popular game Doom 3, at the publisher's site <a href="http://www.aspyr.com/games.php/mac/d3/" class="external free" title="http://www.aspyr.com/games.php/mac/d3/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aspyr.com/games.php/mac/d3/</a> , click on Support&gt; then Optimization, and there will be a link to Macologist. Also their telephone and email technical support staff will refer users to this Macologist URL. Also note that the website for Feral Interactive also has several direct links to game reviews from Macologist, for example Chessmaster 9000.</p>
<p>References are available from the director of development of Aspyr Media, and the public relations director of Feral Interactive, two of the largest publishers for this platform.</p>
<p>Editors for Macologist have also been recruited into beta testing (Mac Ninjas, console) and other media (Mac Games Radio) <a href="http://www.macradio.com/press/igameradio/gamepr051118.php" class="external free" title="http://www.macradio.com/press/igameradio/gamepr051118.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.macradio.com/press/igameradio/gamepr051118.php</a></p>
<p>The largest Macintosh magazine "MacWorld" uses software developed by Macologist for Unreal Tournament 2004 in their benchmarking suite: <a href="http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/editors/2005/05/speedmarkblog/index.php" class="external free" title="http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/editors/2005/05/speedmarkblog/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/editors/2005/05/speedmarkblog/index.php</a></p>
<p>Finally, entering the search term "Macologist" in the Apple.com website will return two entries. The software above used by MacWorld magazine for benchmarking is also listed at Apple.<small>—<i>preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment by</i> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESantaduck_f61f.html" title="User:Santaduck">Santaduck</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESantaduck_54a8.html" title="User talk:Santaduck">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Santaduck_dcdc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Santaduck">contribs</a>) 22:03, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Per original author. I put this article in in order to make sure that the original inventor of telematic auto insurance receives at least some credit for his breakthrough. If you Google "pay as you drive", or "telematic auto insurance", you will get an appreciation for the enormous potential impact of this invention. By virtue of my own consulting practice, I've been studying telematic auto insurance for many years.

<p><b>Delete.</b> As the progenitor of the article, I originally fought against requested deletion/redirection because I felt the article had merit; this is no longer the case. As I mention on the article's <a href="../../../p/a/r/Talk%7EParodies_of_the_ichthys_symbol_33ea.html" title="Talk:Parodies of the ichthys symbol">talk page</a>, the page's purpose is to list a <i><b>large</b></i> amount of non-notable information, a list of things which taken as wholly equal is almost staggaringly long. I believe that the phenomenon while notable is and of itself, should be noted as a parody on the original article: the <i><a href="../../../i/c/h/Ichthys.html" title="Ichthys">ichthys</a></i>. — <b><a href="../../../p/d/_/User%7EPd_THOR_e92e.html" title="User:Pd THOR"><span style="color:#CC0000;">THOR</span></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../p/d/_/User_talk%7EPd_THOR_67ac.html" title="User talk:Pd THOR"><span style="color:#FF9933;"><i>=/\=</i></span></a></sup> 08:04, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep and cleanup</b> - The Darwin and Gefilte parodies are notable phenomena in their own right. Daykart 08:12, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep and cleanup</b> - The article definitely serves a purpose, but has lost a lot of its focus due to the name. Perhaps re-titling it as "Darwin Fish" will give it more focus and relevance. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Bearded_One_153c.html" title="User:The Bearded One">The Bearded One</a> 14:17, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I am not sure this is the best name for the article but the material seems encyclopedic to me. Perhaps it should be merged with some other article (not sure why <a href="../../../i/c/h/Ichthys.html" title="Ichthys">Ichthys</a> has the name it has, but it is the best choice though... plus it has more redirects to it than any page I've found yet!)

<ul>
<li>Comment... Daykart kindly messaged me with the derivation of "Ichthys", my comment was more wondering whether ichthys is the best name for the main article than wondering what Ichthys meant... sorry for confusion and thank you for that just the same... ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> 21:21, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

But it should <b>not</b> be merged with the main <a href="../../../i/c/h/Ichthys.html" title="Ichthys">Ichthys</a> article, because although the parodies of a subject are notable, they are not relevant to an article discussing the main subject its self. For example, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spaceballs.html" title="Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a> is a parody of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a>, but it would hardly be relevant on the Star Wars article. —<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgan_almighty_3d50.html" title="User:Gorgan almighty">gorgan_almighty</a> 16:46, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nominator is conflating their dispute over what they perceive as a biased point of view in the original article with whether the article should exist.

<li>This explanation is going to be messy. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">User:Geo Swan</a> was also the sole <i>keep</i> vote under the original AfD discussion <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Catalan_negationism_d692.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Catalan negationism">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Catalan negationism</a>. As someone who holds a university degree in history, I can assert that this title is inappropriate regardless of the outcome of the original vote. <i>Revisionist history</i> has distinctly different meanings in academic and popular use. See <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_revisionism.html" title="Historical revisionism">Historical revisionism</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_revisionism_%28political%29.html" title="Historical revisionism (political)">Historical revisionism (political)</a>. In academic circles this is a legitimate pursuit that reexamines events in light of new evidence and new interpretive techniques. Someone who admitted to not understanding that distinction suggested recreating the article under this title and <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">User:Geo Swan</a> endorsed that faulty idea. The change adds inherent POV to the stub's unresolved problems: it still appears to be original research. All of the author's English language references are tangential to the article's central claims. One is even a Wikipedia mirror site - possibly an effort to give the appearance of scholarship by creating a superfluous external link. Neither term has a Google presence. The stub names no historian or journalistic source. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">User:Geo Swan</a> fails to substantiate the claim that the nominator is reacting to perceived bias. If the original stub can be saved it should be merged with a larger article. Its present content is not worth keeping.

<li>I second that conclusion. From what I can roughly derive (based on my limited ability to read Croatian): the text describes some student project entitled, "Teaching quality evaluation", which also includes a sample of (a part of) a student questionnaire. "Definition... Why evaluating... Evaluation method... ", based on self-analysis, statistical analysis and student poll targeted both at the teaching process itself and at the teaching staff; suggestions for which criteria to use during the evaluation, etc. I am not sure how this can possibly become an article, because it seems to be some unfinished piece of student-level research or a survey proposal or such, without any verifiable source too. My vote on this is to delete, no transwiki. Perhaps, still a good idea would be not to move this entry for a while longer, so that someone who is actually fluent in Croatian language could take a look at this review and confirm. - <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntrovert_e3fe.html" title="User:Introvert"><font color="#004161">Introvert</font></a> <a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EIntrovert_66c0.html" title="User talk:Introvert"><font color="#004161"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 08:26, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have a huge problem with being serious even when I need to be; but seriously, searching for feminist veganism is like searching for "socialist aerodynamics", or "slavery and ancient philosophy".

While that article was (and unfortunatley still is) in need of much additional work, and that article consisted of a few fragmentary sentences, "The result of the debate was keep per general consensus that high schools are notable." Given the far more extensive content of the current article in question and the fact that it clearly meets the qualifications laid out at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>, this article should be kept. Furthermore, as this is a regional school serving four separate municipalities, it would make no logical sense to insert the content into all four of the constituent pages, as might be the case if it were a high school in a single community.

<p><b>Redirect/Delete</b> Original research; it was proposed to fold this article into 'The Red Badge of Courage' article, but this text is clearly either plagiarized or original composition/interpretation. Additionally, if this article was meant to define what the "red badge of courage" signifies in the novel (hence the listing in lower-case), it completely fails to accomplish that.

<li><b>Keep</b> The reason I wrote this article was because they were mentioned on a few other pages here with no further info and since I was familiar with them I figured I'd give it a shot. It's fair to say that this band has never charted but the genre of music (<a href="../../../g/r/i/Grindcore.html" title="Grindcore">grindcore</a> <a href="../../../t/e/c/Tech_metal.html" title="Tech metal">tech metal</a> <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metalcore.html" title="Metalcore">metalcore</a>) is so obscure that most of the other bands listed with pages here have never charted either but have still sold thousands of records and have tons of fans as witnessed by other people adding them here on Wikipedia. The page on <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psyopus.html" title="Psyopus">Psyopus</a> for example desperately needs to be cleaned up but I don't know enough about the band to do it. As for simply deleting the band because they named themselves after Tony Danza I don't think that's a fair reason to delete a page. This isn't some fly by night garage band that I made up. A simple google search will confirm that they are quite real and have a viable music audience. If my article gets deleted I'm not going to cry about it but it's kind of weird to list the band on other Wikipedia pages and not have an article explaining who they are.-- <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMaddhatt_6fe2.html" title="User:Maddhatt">Maddhatt</a> 13:01, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>A "vote" backed up by an excellent argument is better than two or three "delete nn ~~~~" or "keep ~~~~" "votes".

<li>For me a principal question is how to decide whether software is notable or not... This here is an alpha version and provides no binaries (according to project site). I think if any software project, however new, unfinished, and alpha, would be listed in wikipedia, it would become terribly overblown. What's more, the article seems to be written by the author of the software him/herself, which could be regarded as <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_propaganda_machine" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">self-promotion</a>. I suggest, the article should wait at least until the software is more developed and binaries are provided.

<li>Well, other than this article's being absurdly written, it's about a little-known 'fictional saint' invented by two nn artists with little more than 30 mentions on Google (and not many of these mentions are anything but fleeting.)

<li>La idea me parece buena. El articulo necesita algo de edicion. Parece algo que va ha ir progresando.
<ul>
<li>It needs more than editing, 209.178.213.118. It needs <i>references</i>. For starters, it needs a reference that gives the correct name of the artists. Was the first artist Eduardo Garaico or Carlos Garicoa? Without references, readers cannot even verify that basic fact from the very first sentence of the article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:16, 20 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly, Uncle G: but what I ask to you all is... do the artists themselves even merit their own Wikipedia page? If not, then it is rather crazy to give a page to a single character from a work of theirs. I mean, only a few big writers get pages for all of their inventions: so, giving the same liberty to relative unknowns is really frivolous. We can barely justify the artists' notability... can we justify the inclusion of subsections of their work? I think that, unless these guys have some reknown, which doesn't seem so, the answer has to be no, or we're making a strange precedent. <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">Iinag</a> 17:58, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is yet another <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_fork_623c.html" title="POV fork">POV fork</a> attempt by CyclePat. Apparently, the CCM light delivery safety bike picture is being taken off of the main <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> article, so now pat has created this fork, which has absolutely no purpose. The motorized bicycle topic really only needs one article, but we have 2 now with the timeline article (also created as a fork) and now this. Please delete it. Absolutely no reason for it. The problem if we let this in is that then Pat is going to create more forks.

<li><b>comment</b>: This is not a POV fork. This analisys is based on the precedence from the similar page titled: gallery of motorcycle trikes. Yes! CCM light delivery can be found at <a href="../../../c/c/m/CCM_%28bicycle_manufacturer%29_4f63.html" title="CCM (bicycle manufacturer)">CCM (bicycle manufacturer)</a>. Precendence sugest that we should at least include the name of an item to avoid a POV. This being said. Woohookitty's analisys needs some reviewing. The alleged concensus to remove the picture of CCM picture of the article <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> has not been proven. What will happen when others attempt to place the many thousands of different model electric bicycles on this page. Either we put them in the [[category:motorized bicycle]]? As for the assumption that <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_motorized_bicycle_history.html" title="Timeline of motorized bicycle history">timeline of motorized bicycle history</a> is a fork, this article has been previously nominated for deletion and failed to be accepted for deletion. We discussed this issue. A precedence exist such as within the article of <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle.html" title="Bicycle">bicycle</a> that show that a fork for the history is possible. The problem is if we don't let this in our article will be limited to one POV of 2 or 3 people that seem to be ganged up together and offended by my manerism. (<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a> has even used some offencive language) As for threathening to do fork I can not understand where he would get such an idea.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The idea that the CCM was removed by consensus is dotted around the talk pages of the two articles. You have more than once used the analogy of the Toyota Prius. It is a good one: if the CCM were among the first vehicles of its class manufactured by manufacturer whose name is a household word on every continent, the bike would indeed merit inclusion in the articles on the motorized bicycle. But it is neither, as you have acknowledged elsewhere.</dd>
<dd>Your single-minded determination to raise the profile of this machine shows admirable enthusiasm, but as I thought you understood by now the purpose of these articles is to document the significant, not to elevate that which individual editors admire. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 20:33, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>comment</b>:No, you see, you're putting words in my mouth again. And you are avoiding the main subject wich is the deletion of this "entire" article. If you have POV issue (which I apparently have when you remove this item) I sugest we move the discussion to the appropriate place. But to argue about the CCM, that talk page does not show any conclusive evidence of concensus. The idea that an item needs to be "Popular" is not a very sound argument for dis-inclusion into an article. I'm sure there are some un-popular and much more contreversial subjects on wikipedia. A question for you. If you where working on the article of <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telephone.html" title="Telephone">telephone</a>, would you not include a picture of a 1932 telephone into the article? If that telephone was a rare one, wouldn't it be even more intriguing to add at "least" a little sentence on it. (for example: what if, I dunno, <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avro.html" title="Avro">Avro</a> built a rare telephone and it was suddenly removed from the market. It's popularity might not be extreme, it's alleged significance might not be "comprehensible," however this telephone did exist. (I strongly believe a quick blurb should be included in the article... where is another question, which obviously seems to offuscate you via your literally bolded comments from <a href="../../../m/o/t/Talk%7EMotorized_bicycle_cc4d.html#1st_POV_.28THE_CCM_Pixie_bicycle_motor.29_that_was_recently_removed" title="Talk:Motorized bicycle">Talk:Motorized bicycle#1st POV (THE CCM Pixie bicycle motor) that was recently removed</a> stating...</dd>

<dd>Pat, your English <i>is</i> idiosyncratic. So is mine. But "attested", for example, is not a word used in everyday discussion by most people - I (usually) manage to keep to everyday vocabulary in articles, that's all I'm saying.

<dd>You will noticed that I have added a new picture to the Gallery of motorized bicycle. For those user that started the page <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> you will notice it is a perfectly good picture that we used for more than 2 months. Image:Motorbike2.jpg <i>(A motorized bicycle (the motor unit is above the back wheel and appears to eb a friction drive unit). This is an aftermarket conversion.)</i>. This picture was recently removed from <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> article. Seeing as it is inpractical to include too many pictures in the main article of "motorized bicycle," it only makes sense to be able to mention this finely researched and perfectly relevant "machinery" elsewhere. What better way then a gallery which is somewhere quite relevant to the main article. The utility of this gallery page that is currently up dor deletion, is important to the development of the article <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> and is preceded by the example of gallery of motorcycle trikes. <a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">user:CyclePat</a> 12:41, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>comment</b>: Yes! what if these pictures are a POV. I'm assuming that they are motorised bicycles.... but have they trully been defined by "someone" that is non partisan. (ie.: National Post says that Bionx is a motorised bicycle... actually they would probably say it's an electric bicycle but anyway.) I hope you realise that if this gallery is POV because of it's content inherently the content on the main page will also be. However if the pictures are not POV then inherently they should be able to be displayed. The idea that this article be up for deletion is against commen sense. As those that vote delete... I assume this is because you see some sort of POV. Can you explain because right now, I really don' see any logical POV. If there is one, maybe the photos (as afformentioned) and in that case the main article would also be POV, making for the removal of these pictures all together.

<dd>Missing the point again. What is POV is your promotion of this insignificant machine in this and other articles. The bike (and this picture) already has a place in the CCM article, where it belongs. As has been stated more than once, if you want it in this article or the timeline fork you created and from which it was also removed, all you need to do is show its relevance to the global history and development of the motorised bicycle - something you have consistently failed to do. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 10:08, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"Missing the point again." (humm... just that comment seems to lead into your POV that this motorized bicycle is insignificant.) I have neither stated if this CCM bicycle is significant or insignificant. All in all, if what you are saying is true, (that of which you alleged I have POV, I believe you are fighting a useless battle. This is because again I haven't stated the significance or insignificance... it simply is a motorized bicycle, just like African pussy willow is simply a <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flower.html" title="Flower">flower</a> (I think, or a bush or something). (asside: It would be somewhat difficult to find non-original research that seems to support most historic significances of our wiki category that "we invented"... and for some reason called "<a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a>." A gallery, is worth a million words and doesn't need to elaborate into the historic significance (that of which can be elaborated within it proper article... such as the <a href="../../../c/c/m/CCM_%28bicycle_manufacturer%29_4f63.html" title="CCM (bicycle manufacturer)">CCM (bicycle manufacturer)</a>) Now, according to <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html#What_to_do_with_a_problem_page.2Fimage.2Fcategory" title="WP:DP">WP:DP#What to do with a problem page/image/category</a>(in "Article is biased or has lots of POV") this the proper step to take if you believe their is a NPOV issue is to to add {{npov}} or {{POV check}} to the article. Again, this does not require a delete. Having this page nominated for deletion, I believe, is a waste of wiki deletion process. Which I believe is somewhere on wiki guidelines.</dd>
<dd>Now after reading through, the <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> (Problems that don't require deletion) I noticed this article could use: {{disputed}}, {{stub}}, arguably (left-wingedly) it could be {{mergeto|article}} and possibly "Annoying user". Under the problems that require deletion I could not find anything.</dd>
<dd>So let's talk about <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> even though this should be elsewhere then on this delete page. So, I believe <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. You apparently have a dispute with the content and with "<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">me</a>", and we have dispute resolution mechanisms for that. This isn't one of them. Finally, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> <i>"(Neutral Point Of View) is an official Wikipedia policy which states that articles should be written from a neutral point of view, representing all views fairly and without bias."</i> So after perusing quickly through the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#What_is_the_neutral_point_of_view.3F" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#What is the neutral point of view?</a> I figured that the issue might be that we are accerting, through inferance from the title, that these are pictures of motorized bicycles... yet according to Wikipedia's policy we are supposed to be "presenting conflicting views without asserting them." (For those of you joining in on the conversation, the reason there is conflicting views is because of the entire subject itself. Already we have had much discussion on what the big difference is between a <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> and a <a href="../../../m/o/p/Moped.html" title="Moped">moped</a>... take a look at those two article and tell me if you can see a difference?) According to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Making_necessary_assumptions" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Making necessary assumptions</a> it is necessary to make some assumption and present some idea for the "enemy".

Humm... I was going to type "and finallly"... Another issue you should look at is <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Lack_of_neutrality_as_an_excuse_to_delete" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Lack of neutrality as an excuse to delete</a>. It is my opinion, seeing as you nominated this article for deletion under a spell of rage (afformentioned vulgur language or <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">user:Woohookitty</a> <a href="http://www.mopedarmy.com/forums/discuss/1/232057/231620/" class="external text" title="http://www.mopedarmy.com/forums/discuss/1/232057/231620/" rel="nofollow">ability to openly state he doesn't like me</a>), that you have done so as a type of punishement or lesson.

<dd>Finally as for the guidelines from <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_forks_f202.html" title="POV forks">POV forks</a>, this is a gallery of pictures that have an article themself. It is there for easy access so people can say "oh! look this is a motorized bicycle! wow!" and not have to be an expert like you or many others that have commented or edited this article and look around for <a href="../../../v/e/l/Velosolex.html" title="Velosolex">velosolex</a> or <a href="../../../c/c/m/CCM_%28bicycle_manufacturer%29_4f63.html" title="CCM (bicycle manufacturer)">CCM (bicycle manufacturer)</a>.

<li><b>Bizarre</b> - not vanity at least, since it ended in 1996. But this article title could be rewritten to refer to the predominance of groups like this. In Sydney there were hundreds of such groups (by various names) and some of them had over 100 members. Actually, for such a group, 140 was pretty huge.

<p>I originally marked this with a <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> A7 speedy delete, as I couldn't see a claim to notability. An objection has been raised, so I have moved this to AfD. The objection was noting that the subject of the article is involved in Twentieth Century Enders, which I have separately nominated for deletion. Aside from this, there is no evidence of notability/significance, just a lot of grandiose claims (for example he is a "modern day prophet"), and links to personal homepages. <b>Delete</b> as <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a>. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 17:53, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Band qualifies under point: "Has been the subject of a half hour or hour broadcast on a national radio network" - Beat 106 is national radio station in the country of Scotland - the band featured heavily as part of the alternative music show, with dedicated time-slots and website reviews.

<li>Well there's not much else that can be used to prove for Beat 106 - radio stations don't keep public logs of such. The article proves that the band featured in the Beatbreakers show - which is a week-long feature, with regular airplay - easily confirmed on the main site. As for the BBC etc - if need be, I'll provide the email address of the DJ at BBC Radio who we are in contact with to verify this situation, as well as email from Jim Gellatly of Beat 106. I suggest removing the earmarked for deletion tab till it is brought up by someone else.Boorishbehaviour 17:07, 20 December 2005 (GMT)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'm curious... this article has been earmarked for deletion again, but no comment has been left as to why. Any particular reason?</li>
</ul>
<p>I re-added the tag because the AfD nomination was never closed off properly in the first place. IMO, the qualification for WP:MUSIC is weak, and since WP:MUSIC is a guideline and not policy, I'd vote delete. I don't feel The RipOffs are notable enough for their own entry yet. If they gain greater success in the future, the article should be re-created, but in the meantime <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a> 10:41, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. In my round-up of candidate articles today, I was trying to avoid articles that had been around prior to the current election. I must have forgotten to check the history when looking at this one. In any case, there's no information in this article that's not already in the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Results_of_the_Canadian_federal_election%2C_2004%7E_Quebec_and_Atlantic_Canada_69e4.html" title="Results of the Canadian federal election, 2004: Quebec and Atlantic Canada">Results of the Canadian federal election, 2004: Quebec and Atlantic Canada</a> article. There remains nothing to indicate notability beyond having run in an election (which I have seen cited in numerous other places as insufficient to merit inclusion in Wikipedia). --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrantNeufeld_99cc.html" title="User:GrantNeufeld">GrantNeufeld</a> 04:15, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

It is also not a <i>message board</i>, as it fields organized units in the games in which it plays. The public portion of the forums is not a significant part of the unit and it makes no claims to being a "gaming community", a gaming news site or a professional "clan". --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 17:53, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>so it hasnt won anything. its not professional. its a bunch of schoolboys playing videogames. despite the article calling it a "an online gaming syndicate" and "gaming clan", its not, in fact, a community or clan. all good reasons why its not notable.

<li>I'm no great fan of gaming clans of any stripe having articles, but that's a misrepresenation.

Habap merely asked me to come take a look and give my opinion. So I did. He did not ask me, nor any of us, to vote to keep.

<dd>Agreed re rights. How about the section of the article that mentions Sturmgrenadier? Is it a mention or a paragraph or something more? It may sound trivial, but it can help establish notability. | Klaw <small>¡digame!</small> 22:32, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I just read the article (someone sent it to me). It mentions Sturmgrenadier in passing. Not nearly as impressive as I thought.

<dd><i>Four years ago, Taylor and two friends started Sturmgrenadier (www.sghq.com), a group that plays cooperatively within online worlds. Now up to 800 members, the group has gotten together for mini-conventions in Las Vegas and Orlando. Some, Taylor included, are helping test Star Wars Galaxies.

<li><b>Neutral</b>. Firstly, I will note that I don't think it's a good idea to do AfD campaigning from either side of the argument; it really does affect your ability to think in an unbiased fashion. This is a borderline case; it is relatively large and well-established, and it claims to be verifiable.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Someone's been overdosing on the Christmas crackers; we're into Holiday Folly season. To be serious, though, for a minute: there are several reasons why this article does not belong in Wikipedia. Some are on stylistic grounds. Some are on promotional grounds. Some are on significance grounds. I'll try to go through all of them without breaking into my usual <i>sine</i>. First of all, the claim that they had this big article in USA to-day seemed dubious to me, so I checked it out. A case of googlum ad nauseum, the only references of its having been mentioned are in the same claim, repeated so many times with slight variants: 'do you want to be a part of a group that was recognised in USA To-day?'</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>By reading above, I found that the 'article' was a mere stub, if you will. It's given as an example. That does not reflect on the site's quality. Nor on the site's cultural impact. It just means that they used Sturmgrenadier as an example of a gaming syndicate. Like they might use Mr. Boer as an example of a farmer, or The Blue Café on Elwright Street as an example of a business. It does not classify Sturmgrenadier as remarkable. A proper article might.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, this Wikipedia article is highly one-sided and self-promotional. There is no counter-view. It is written with bright rose-coloured glasses, as you would expect. It is not encyclopædic to rhapsody about people coming to-gether on the internet. Promoting games syndicates should not be encylopædia activity. Wikipedia should be here to inform about the general consciousness, and about contributions to thought; a bunch of gamers on a site is not exactly general consciousness, nor is it a contribution to thought. Information on 'clans' on Wikipedia has been wiped out before. Although Wikipedia does not operate on a binding precedent basis, there is clear foreagreement that Wikipedia is not a promotions hall for sites such as these. The only reason that this has survived, compared to the other articles, is the slyer way in which this was written, and the fact that a whole support group, enlisted by one of the key writers of this article, props it up. I have to say that such campaigns debase the whole system of Wikipedia as a consensual zone. Anyhow, to return: there is not much original invention at all. It's all about playing games that they never even made in the first place. It provides no new knowledge; riding on the coat-tails of someone else's work is no original contribution to the world as we know it. I have nothing against people meeting up, and talking about games. That's cool by me. But you're having a vitsln if you think it merits a page. <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">iinag</a> 23:51, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: With all due respect, out of the few edits to Wikipedia that you have made, there's only one-- an anti-monarchist merge request about the Queen-- that has <i>not</i> been about Sturmgrenadier. To say that your vote is that objective is pushing it, since you would hardly vote against something that you helped to create. Also, although I'd say that this cliquery to get past the system and save your self-promotion is rather petty, I can't see why a bunch of Wikipedians from a wide strand of backgrounds coming here to oppose nn self-promotion is 'fascetious [sic]'.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Wikipedians, with a 'wide strand of backgrounds' were also involved in the previous VfD which ended in a non-consensus. The original VfD was started by a disgruntled former member with a vendetta. Yes, very petty. I agree with another wikipedian above that nobody cares about Gaming Clan Drama (tm), so that should be looked past. The fact remains that these are ad hominem attacks, driven by facetious motives and jealousy.

<li><b>Delete</b> First, let me respond to Destinova1 and others: the prior VFD (the mere fact that it was a VFD and not AFD lets you know it was at least a few months ago) was closed as a "no consensus", which means it didn't have a conclusion, let alone a forever binding one. And even if the consensus had been to keep, that would not be an eternal "get out of jail free" card against future deletion nominations any more than a deletion closure would forbid people from ever recreating the article (in a form that was not substantially identical). As such, the prior VFD's outcome doesn't mean diddly squat - or at least, you shouldn't let it. Anyway, as for the article/topic itself, props to iinag for the eloquence. Also, let me point out that in addition to a meaningless reference-in-passing in a USA Today article, it has currently "no ranking" at Alexa for sghq.com, and in the prior VFD, both Alexa rankings cited were lower than the ranking at which Alexa itself tells you the rankings are based on so few hits that actually trying to compare rankings is just guesswork. Finally, 800 may be large for an online gaming "clan", but 800 is hardly a large number as far as the total online gaming population... especially if it's spread among "several countries all over the globe". <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 00:18, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The <i>USA Today</i> entry didn't support the case for notability, unfortunately. I'm not thrilled with the possibility of a bad faith AfD, but in the absence of evidence I have to assume good faith. Leaving that and the campaigning aside, I see a run of the mill gaming site/group that doesn't have anything to distinguish itself from other such groups. It's not a reflection on the site or the people in it, but I think a site has to at or near the top of its genre to merit a Wikipedia article. | Klaw <small>¡digame!</small> 00:19, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The fact that I need even to vote is utterly disappointing. Whether it's a club you belong to or not, this sort of vanity garbage doesn't belong on Wikipedia.

<li>weak <b>Delete</b> The article in my view needs more information to show readers why this particular gaming clan is notable. The article says "These events were reported in an article in <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_23.html" title="June 23">June 23</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>." It would really help if the External Links section linked to that actual article, or if that sentence had a link TO the USA Today article, just linking to USA Today's article here doesn't establish notability. (assuming the article doesn't just mention the clan without saying much else... heck, I've been on local TV morning news shows several times and that doesn't make me, or the club I was promoting, especially notable, I don't think) Further the tempers seem to be running a bit high here on both sides... calling people schoolboys won't win votes, nor will lashing out at others presenting reasoning against (or for) retention...

<li>My summary <b>Comment</b>: On the one hand, I'm disappointed that the article is considered unworthy. On the other hand, it's good to see that normal users who know nothing about it (the original VfD was due to "Gaming Club Drama" <sup>TM</sup> as noted early on in this process) sat down, read the article, checked Google, looked for information and considered whether it was worthy. That (removing my sometimes emotional nonsense) gives me faith in Wikipedia. I think the balance is that notability is not established. If at some time down the road, verifiable notability can be established, someone will probably write a new article.

<li>looking at that article, it says the league is "open to all registrants".... this implies there is no entry barrier, unlike, say the MLB, where (i assume) you cant just gather your buddies and sign up on a website and say your an MLB team. so imho mere participation is too low a bar, they should have won something. in any case the evidence so far consists of a team list, which as you say by itself is not really sufficient. <a href="../../../z/z/z/User%7EZzzzz_e5d0.html" title="User:Zzzzz">Zzzzz</a> 09:41, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Googling on 'team cloud nine cpl' I got a few hits that indicate they're at least slightly notable within the e-sports community, but nothing that would really establish notability here. As others have said, some verifiable wins in some of the big e-sports tournaments added to this article would really make it a <i>keeper</i>, but without it the article looks like just another vanity page for a dime-a-dozen clan. <a href="../../../a/e/v/User%7EAeverett_b346.html" title="User:Aeverett">You can call me Al</a> 14:05, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>- In response to all who concider this not suitable for the encyclopedia. Here is the basic reasons for it to remain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historical value:</li>
</ul>
<p>This may not seam relevant now today, but who's gonna write about it in 50 years time? The veteran producers who's reminding the old gold days as youths when they produced hardstyle music:</p>
<p>"If I can remember correctly we used some sort of artificial synthesizers, what's the letter combination again? Oh VST it was, to produce all sorts of synthetic noises..."</p>
<p>Who will write about it in 100 years time? The people who posess the historical knowledge, but who have no experience in producing the music itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>For technological reasons:</li>
</ul>
<p>We are living in a world where technology is new tomorrow at breakfast and will be obsolete tomorrow by midnight. The technology that is used to produce music of today truly deserves a place in the encyclopedia.</p>
<ul>
<li>For future preservation:</li>
</ul>
<p>So the historics of tomorrow have some sort of reference to lean back upon when they describe the music of the 21st century.</p>
<p>If there is anytime this should be written it is right here, right now. Today as the music is produced for the reasons stated above. It will be too late in 10 years time, let along in 50 years time. Most of the older producers will be dead by then. But if we preserve the knowledge today the elements that build up this style can be reused and reviewed by everybody in the future music to come.</p>

<li>There are all sorts of words findable by Google searches that don't exist (to be more specific, that aren't established terms with agreed-upon meanings, which is what I meant by "there is no word <i>rhoticism</i>" above). I can find no evidence of an established term <i>rhoticism</i> in any dictionaries or linguistics books.

<li><b>Delete</b> An article devoted to two words commonly confused is a waste unless there is something notable about the confusion. There is nothing notable here.

<li>No. But Wiktionary will happily address both usage conflations and mis-spellings that have become so widespread that they satisfy the criteria for being attested words. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:00, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There's no such subject for an encyclopaedia article, because there's no such word, and thus no such conflation, in the first place.

<li>The current consensus on unelected candidates permits a merged page for "X Party's candidates in Y election".

<li>Consensus doesn't require a vote; if the discussion dies prematurely, then in the lack of a clearly defined policy statement the results that have actually been applied here in practice stand as the consensus.

<p>I am new to wikipedia (not reading it of course, but everything else). Anyways, thank you for trying to get that Berko and Benson page deleted. I am actually the Benson part of that "group", but we are nothing more than a couple buddies making noise. Not an actual legit band, and we have no business being in Wikipedia. Someone that I dont know put that up, and me not realizing what to do, tried deleting it but apparently I was doing it wrong and "vandalizing" the page. So thanks.

<p>I guess it's your choice what you keep and what you don't. I have carefully avoided the issue of Notability in Wikipedia Fiction. Personally, I wouldn't rate this article as "Fancruft", and have carefully stayed away from that. I would also argue that due to issures raised recently about public spending in Britain, this is an article that contains importance and notability. Anyway, Fancruft is not a reason to simply to delete an article, unless it is "poorly written" or "POV" and I believe my article is balanced and written in understandable prose <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Flinn_6223.html" title="User:Earl Flinn">Earl Flinn</a> 09:13, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
