<li><b>Keep</b> DVPH, The Formula, and GLiL, as these articles all assert sufficient (and verifiable) notability via winning notable awards and being mentioned in multiple reliable media sources. <b>Delete</b> Crazy Watto, Fanboys, and Broken Allegiance, as I can't find much importance for any of them. The BA article claims "the film garnered major media coverage and was screened at numerous local and international film festivals to great response," but a Google search of "Broken Allegiance"+"Star Wars" does not confirm any of this. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 20:57, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Their association with www.theforce.net is important &amp; the notability of the Star Wars franchise confers greater notability on its major works of supposed "fancruft" than if they were associate with a less notable franchise.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> on all. Especially Broken Allegiance and George Lucas in Love. Broken Allegiance won the Audience Favorite Award in the 2003 I-CON Film Festival, and was a finalist in the 2002 Australian Effects and Animation Awards. Fan Films Quarterly recognized Broken Allegiance as one of the 10 most pivotal moments in fan film history during FFQ's Summer 2006 issue (issue #4), released in June 2006. The film has over 12,000 google hits.George Lucas in Love has won several awards, including the Canal+ Short Film Award at the 2000 Deauville Film Festival, the Audience Award at both the Florida Film Festival and the San Sebastián Horror and Fantasy Film Festival, and was awarded Best Short Film at the 2000 U.S. Comedy Arts Festival.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> on all. I don't know why independent films should be less important than ordinary commercial movies. Fancruft is for all these films here an absolutely inappropriated word. I could call many commercial movies commercialcruft too but I don't want to delete them. Projects should not be judged only because it's fan work otherwise someone could have the stupid idea and call even Wikipedia fancruft because it's not commercial and made also by amateurs. Deleting of articles about important fan films would be a great lack for Wikipedia and there is absolutely no need for it. The fan film scene is an important and growing scene and should not be excluded by Wikipedia. It should not only be made a decision for not deleting these articles but a general decision to keep articles about fan films with a certain popularity with perhaps at least 500 or 1000 Google entries because such article get requests for deleting from some ignorants with no good reason frequently. Someone who is not interested in this stuff should just ignore these sites but not request to delete them. I'm also not interested in every article of Wikipedia but I don't make a request for deleting. 217.184.70.211 23:38, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
