<li><b>Keep</b>. This page is a very good reference for the fans of the NC comic. True, NC may not be that mainstream, but doesn't mean it should be (pardon the pun) neglected. <a href="../../../s/p/k/User%7ESPKx_dabc.html" title="User:SPKx">SPKx</a> 01:57, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It reveals a lot of information which cannot even be found by looking at the site.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Sean Kelly and I worked our rear ends off on this. NC was the first sprite comic, and it is a neglected one (bad pun intended). 8-Bit Theater, Bob and George, PennyArcade, VGCats etc. have lots of stuff on the Wiki, and they do not see any deletion. To delete this would not only be an insult to those who worked on it, but to Jay Resop, Lord Reid, CodieKitty, and everyone else who put their time and efforts into making something that deserves far more attention than it gets. Brian Clevinger and other spriters get lots of praise and even appear at conventions. Jay doesn't get this kind of praise (in fact all he ever seems to get from something other than fans is ridicule). If someone were to make a list of Family Guy references (which are very similar to these), it wouldn't get deleted at all. Please save this page! Also, thank you to all those who came (or will come) out in support of this project. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyswordsman_e813.html" title="User:Crazyswordsman">Crazyswordsman</a> 02:41, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm doing (extensive) research as I edit this page. I also flip back and forth between sections depending upon need (because I can keep track that way). I also may edit a word or two if it appears that I made a mispelling or grammatical error. I usually edit as many references into a particular section before switching.

<li>I want to go on record by saying that Crazyswordsman has been very ambitious in compiling this list. He worked for over 10 hours, without anyone asking, to make this page. Jay has been very impressed with the results and, no matter what, he wants to keep this list whether it's on wikipedia or not. - <a href="../../../s/p/k/User%7ESPKx_dabc.html" title="User:SPKx">SPKx</a> 05:41, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: That's great, and admirable and all that. I hope he gets to put his work to good use somewhere. However, the fact remains that this page is not something you would/should find in an encyclopedia, and "hard work" is not enough to justify that. And to Crazyswordsman's objections throughout this discussion, please do nominate similar pages elsewhere. I would vote delete on anything this granular about any topic of similar notability/verifiability.

<li>If this is cruft, so are all the Family Guy references in the FG related articles.

<li>I would be interested in putting this work onto NC, if it is ultimately decided to be deleted from Wiki.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm going to say Keep, but I'll respect any decision that the people here at Wiki ultimately decide, since I'm not one to impose myself. In this article's defense, <a href="../../../n/e/g/Neglected_Mario_Characters_3f59.html" title="Neglected Mario Characters">Neglected Mario Characters</a> has already been accepted as suitable Wiki article. If the main article is acceptable, and if there are other similar lists for similar articles (See <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_Bob_and_George_f693.html" title="Characters of Bob and George">Characters_of_Bob_and_George</a> for an example of a similar page), then I don't see why this one should be deleted. But if you all decide to delete it, then that's all right. Personally, I'm simply honored that <a href="../../../n/e/g/Neglected_Mario_Characters_3f59.html" title="Neglected Mario Characters">Neglected Mario Characters</a> has been allowed to be a part of Wikipedia, and I don't want to press my luck, heh. If it's deleted, I would be interested in putting this article onto my site instead.-jay Jay Resop 14:23, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I've nothing against documenting cultural references to stuff in principle, and someone's obviously gone to a lot of effort over this, but I can't help feeling that this list is... well... useless. Webcomics, by their nature, tend to be full of pop-culture references, and a list of them is rather like a list of joke punchlines with the questions left out. The difference between this list and a list of cultural references on Family Guy is that Family Guy humour is mainly situational and surreal, not pop-culture-based, and therefore a list of cultural references is more manageable. Basically, I can't think why someone would read this list instead of reading the webcomic, which is, after all, free. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 14:46, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

I have the page archived on my user page (so those of you who are interested can visit it) and can edit it at will. I plan to put in the references to the NC Chronicles, the one part comics (including Ye Old Taco Hut of Horror), then I will move on to the Deathmatches, Shorts, Flash Movies, Election flyers, and finally, the unpublished Mushroom Wars remake Alph made on the NC Forum.

<li><b>Delete</b> - OMG, I cannot believe that this article actually exists. OK, so list of cultural references in the pokemon series was a keeper, well the pokemon series is watched by tens of thousands of people at least, and has millions of fans. This is a sprite comic.

In the scale of notability where does <a href="../../../n/e/g/Neglected_Mario_Characters_3f59.html" title="Neglected Mario Characters">Neglected Mario Characters</a> fit?

Are the "keepers" here claiming that every TV show, ever is notable enough to have its own "cultural references" article, or every published book could have its own cultural references article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Since no one has responded to this, I just wanted to point out again that <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_Bob_and_George_f693.html" title="Characters of Bob and George">Characters_of_Bob_and_George</a> is a list similar to this one based on a similar sprite comic. I don't see the difference that allows <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_Bob_and_George_f693.html" title="Characters of Bob and George">Characters_of_Bob_and_George</a> to remain on Wiki while this one is up for deletion. I'm just curious where the line is drawn. I know my site (NC) isn't as popular as BnG, but they have both been accepted as suitable web comics to feature at Wikipedia. Also, just to make it clear, I'm not forcably trying to push an article about my site on Wikipedia. Whatever is ultimately decided about this article is cool with me. I'm just curious about the standards of Wiki between this article and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_Bob_and_George_f693.html" title="Characters of Bob and George">Characters_of_Bob_and_George</a>. Just for my own curiousity. Thanks.-jay Jay Resop 18:33, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think the difference lies in the difference between "characters" and "cultural references." Characters are easily verifiable and it is easy to decide what is significant enough for an article. Also, I would argue that they are more the "heart" of the webcomic. Cultural references, on the other hand, are generally going to form a boundless list of unrelated things, which probably aren't of interest to many people outside of the initial creator. It's impossible to decide which are verifiably significant enough to warrant consideration. Also, they seem more tangential to any discussion of "What is Neglected Mario Characters?" If the characters section on the main article got too big, I don't think many would argue with spinning that off as has been done with Bob and George.
