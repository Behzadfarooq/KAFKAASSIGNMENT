<p>This page describes a small pile of rocks with a navigation light on it. The rock pile has no interesting properties; it is unremarkable in all respects. It is certainly no more interesting than any of thousands of other such anonymous piles of rocks with lights on them. I've been sailing in the waters around it for 20 years and I've never heard anybody refer to it as "Lighthouse Island". This article has no potential to become encyclopedic. I don't think I would go so far as to call it vandalism, but it certainly is pointless trivia. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 02:10, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for helping me think through this. Let's see if I have correctly summarized the community consensus here. &#160;:)</p>
<p><b>Summary of opinion</b></p>

<li>In this case SourcePage = [ <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution_and_creationism.html" title="Evolution and creationism">Evolution and creationism</a> ] and TargetPage = [ <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_vs._evolution_debate.html" title="Creation vs. evolution debate">Creation vs. evolution debate</a> ].</li>
<li>Where the substantive points of SourcePage have been paraphrased on TargetPage such that there remain on TargetPage no direct quotations of SourcePage, still the contributor edit history of SourcePage should be preserved by a "Merge and redirect" rather than a "Delete and redirect."</li>
<li>The "Merge and redirect" shall be accomplished by the following. After the substantive points of SourcePage have been at least paraphrased on TargetPage:
<ol>
<li>Replace all of the text of SourcePage with the #REDIRECT [[TargetPage]] line, and</li>
<li>Put in the "Edit summary" a statement like the following: "Replacing text with a #REDIRECT where the substantive points of this page have been at least paraphrased on [[TargetPage]].</li>

<li>Bad content is a basis for deletion when there is no real hope of an adequate rewrite; in this case, the needed content already exists and writing the replacement is essentially a clerical task. And we know of someone who can be reasonably expected to take that task on: there's an editor who's disgusted enough at the existing content to cast a vote that will be futile unless the current 5-2 vote turns into a 5-10 one, and who will surely will feel a strong itch to edit when the VfD is closed with a Keep decision. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 17:28, 2005 Jan 6 (UTC)

<li>Bad and inaccurate content should always be a reason for deletion. That way when someone finds the red link they may actually write a good article.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I appreciate that you don't consider notability a valid criterion, but it is necessary to acknowledge that a multitude of other Wikipedians do, to the extent that it can be considered a community practice. Leading on from that, notability is necessarily linked to the <i>readers of the encyclopedia</i>; otherwise, a five-year-old's favourite toy automatically becomes a high-priority topic, to Wikipedia's external embarrasment, and negligible advantage. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Lacrimosus</a> 08:36, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Some feel that "notability", a slippery concept with no clear definition, should be the standard for inclusion, but I don't see why it is <i>necessary</i> to acknowledge them. They're pretty good at putting that across for themselves. The widespread use of it as a term does not, however, make it an item of policy -- nor is it likely to become one, <i>because</i> it would be very difficult to define. One person's "notable" is the next person's "not notable", as we discover here every day. I don't understand what you are talking about when you discuss the "readers of the encyclopaedia. Our policy page very wisely points out that an encyclopaedia ought to include under each title what a reader <i>would expect</i> to find there. It is also careful to exclude items of only personal note, so a five-year-old's actual toy is excluded (although the type of toy is, rightly, included). I don't see what "external embarrassment" has to do with it. I'd be embarrassed by a Wikipedia that did not believe schools were worthy of inclusion in "all human knowledge".<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 03:16, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"All human knowledge" isn't what we're arguing, as that is clearly not what Wikipedia is for. It is for the relevant, important and notable bits of human knowledge. The argument is whether a primary school is sufficiently worthy on it's own. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 15:28, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>"Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing." -- Jimbo Wales.

<li>Methinks you two are talking at cross purposes here. The article in question here is a far cry from narcissistic drivel. On the other hand, it would be easy to construe the "sum of all human knowledge" in a way that is inappropriate to the WP. I've considered that quote as part of my basic understanding of what WP is, too. But I think of the "sum of all knowledge" as different from "all knowledge." Essentially, it's what knowledge boils down to; it's the knowledge you can't get rid of without losing something important. And this article is an example of such knowledge; it's important to understanding the community of Stevenage, and the discourse community constituted by Stevenage people. -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 15:25, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

Some of these merit Wikipedia articles, based on notability, and some do not.

<li><b>Merge &amp; redirect (or delete)</b> as ShaneKing suggests; it shouldn't have its own article. I agree with BM's second comment. I think schools should have to meet some set of notability requirements, just as fire stations, businesses, or any other type of organization must establish notability. Their specific notability requirements don't have to be the same as those for businesses, but "because it's there" isn't enough. That's enough for cities, but that precident shouldn't necesarily extend to a more granular level. Some might argue that since every school will likely host many thousands of kids during its lifetime, it gains notability by sheer numbers (more than 100 people have heard of it). But any single supermarket will host many thousands of shoppers over time (most of which shop there many times a week for years on end), yet we're not rushing to give each individual supermarket location its own article. - <a href="../../../e/i/s/User%7EEisnel_29f7.html" title="User:Eisnel">Eisnel</a> 23:39, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The simple fact that a school is small is no reason to exclude it from an encyclopaedia whose length is not limited.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Some additional content and references have been added. I would say it's now a fairly decent stub. I don't suppose that will change the mind of anyone who remains attached to the nebulous notion of notability ... but I mention it nonetheless. ... For this topic, as for so many others where extensive information is not available online, a properly encyclopedic article requires someone with genuine local knowledge. I suspect that there are many folk in Shephall who could contribute just such an article, detailing the role of the institution in local life and politics, and I don't see any reason to assume <i>a priori</i> that none of them will ever join the Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 08:48, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've taken a first pass at addressing these concerns.

<li>That's fair, plus there are a lot of articles on individual video games.

<li>There are less than a handful of actual articles on this list. Empty links do not count. There is no valid reason to set up a list like this with so few listings.

<li>If there is enough <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italo_disco.html" title="Italo disco">italo disco</a> artists that are notable then the list should be kept otherwise the (then pretty short) list of artist belongs in the main article and this list is useless. - <a href="../../../j/e/l/User%7EJeltz_23d5.html" title="User:Jeltz">Jeltz</a> <a href="../../../j/e/l/User_talk%7EJeltz_3bb8.html" title="User talk:Jeltz"><small>talk</small></a> 01:08, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> this, it can grow into something way helpful. What's more, this sort of list is just the thing for bands who aren't notable enough for a WP article of their own yet, but who are active in the genre. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 02:35, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I know nothing of this genre, so I checked. A few google searches on a couple of the the people on the list, Alisha and Gazebo, chosen at random, suggests they do exist and are notable enough in their field to be listed on Wikipedia.
<ul>
<li>A reader/reviewer on Amazon says this on <b>Alisha</b>:
<ul>
<li>All Night Passion charted at #3, US club charts, April 1984</li>
<li>Baby Talk #1, US club charts, March 1986</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Masterpiece (1982) missed #1 in Italian charts "by a whisker"</li>
<li>I like Chopin (1983) "number one in Italy and 15 other countries that sold eight million copies around the world and contributed to the popularity of the nascent Italo-dance style."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To summarise, these two artists check out and sold oodles of records that people still talk about and play now. I expect the same would be true of at least some of the others. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 02:47, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Please don't add an artist without listing one of their songs too. Also, there are some songs listed with the year next to them, but to be consistent we should either do that to all of them or none. I don't think it's very necessary, but either way is fine. The list is getting super long now, I never would have thought there was so much italo. - <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilk_72b1.html" title="User:Milk">Milk</a> 00:50, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Vorash, "The Chase" isn't dance music? What are you talking about? Of course it is. You need to add it back. Again I remind you that you even listed it under the Italo article as one of the first Italo songs, by legendary producer Girogio Moroder. Also, I haven't heard the other songs by Transvolta, but at least the one listed "Disco Computer" has a disco beat, with lots of synths/effects and vocoders, so it should be listed here too, so please add it back as well. - <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilk_72b1.html" title="User:Milk">Milk</a> 23:16, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Disco Computer" has a disco beat??? Are you saying that Italo and Electro are the same. If so you should also add another 300 artists like Telex and Kraftwerk. Also <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alisha.html" title="Alisha">Alisha</a>'s bass line in "Baby Talk" is very similar to Madonna's "Into the Groove" , (because they are both from <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>), so we probably should add Madonna too and another 300 US dance artists from 80s together with her, according too this logic. <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italo_disco.html" title="Italo disco">Italo disco</a> article defines Italo as a <b>style of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_music.html" title="Electronic music">electronic</a> <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance_music.html" title="Dance music">dance music</a>'</b>. According to <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance_music.html" title="Dance music">dance music</a> article "Dance music is music composed, played, or both, specifically to accompany social dancing." The "Chase" is not a music for social dancing, it's a theme for a movie. I don't have any problem with this song specifically, but we have 100s of songs like this one (for example "Alpha"(1976) of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vangelis.html" title="Vangelis">Vangelis</a> is also "Italo") and it's impossible to add all these songs here.<a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVorash_082f.html" title="User:Vorash">Vorash</a> 23:51, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>We should define a policy for additions to this list, otherwise it will grow to some "Monstrous" thing with 1000 dance 80s artists from all around the world.<a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVorash_082f.html" title="User:Vorash">Vorash</a> 15:39, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are many movie themes that are also dance songs, look at Saturday Night Fever. Just because it was made for a movie doesn't mean you can't dance to it. That is so retarded to come to that conlcusion. "The Chase" is an electronic dance song, so add it back. Italo and electro have many common ties/elements but they are not the same thing. But some artists could be considered a little of both, like "Spacer Woman" for example. With Alisha, she doesn't sound like Italo exactly. I think she should just be considered 80's synth-pop, but I'll let that go. As far as guidelines to adding to the list, I haven't seen a problem yet except for your subtractions of "The Chase" and "Disco Computer", and earlier you also mentioned Kraftwerk, Madonna, and Vangelis in the Italo article. So the problem your describing sounds a lot like yourself. As I've said you seemed to be going through the article and list, and taking out things you think aren't correct. If anything you should check other websites first, then ask here so you can get feedback. Don't just go deleting things to make it fit your view. - <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilk_72b1.html" title="User:Milk">Milk</a> 02:14, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Many people have added dozens of artists and a few of them are not really considered italo. Stacey Q for example and most of Bobby Orlando's productions are more Hi-NRG/80's pop. I think we need to be a bit more critical of additions. My personal method is if I have seen the artist listed as being italo on several other websites and if I've heard their songs, then I can add them. Also, people have added 5 or 6 songs under some artists. I feel this list should be a little more simplified and have only 2 or 3 of the artist's 'well known' songs, so as not to clutter the page. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilk_72b1.html" title="User:Milk">Milk</a> 17:13, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
