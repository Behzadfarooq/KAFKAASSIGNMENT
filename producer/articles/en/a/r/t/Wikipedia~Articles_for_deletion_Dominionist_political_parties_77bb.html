<dd><b>Addendum</b> (taken from the related TfD): <i><b>According to the article creator</b></i>, <i>"Dominionism is, as the article describes, "a term used to describe a trend in Protestant Christian evangelicalism and fundamentalism [...] that seeks to establish specific political policies based on religious beliefs." These parties and thinkers meet that standard by any fair and NPOV assessment."</i> <i><b>I responded</b></i>, "This definition is both too general to be useful and too specific not to be discriminatory. Is a Catholic party that "seeks to establish specific political policies based on religious beliefs" not a <i>dominionist</i> party? Or isn't it just a <i>Catholic</i> party. Is a Hindu party that "seeks to establish specific political policies based on religious beliefs" not a <i>dominionist</i> party? Or isn't it just a <i>Hindu</i> party. Is an Atheist party that "seeks to establish specific political policies based on religious beliefs" not a <i>dominionist</i> party? Or isn't it just an <i>Atheist</i> party. Etc. Etc. <i><b>ALL</b></i> parties seek to establish specific political policies based on a set of moral beliefs, religious or otherwise. All laws are based on some moral belief. Driving 55 mph was a law based on moral belief. If a person is religious, <i>ALL</i> laws he advocates are "religious" by definition, because everything is filtered through his worldview. If he proposes a 55 mph speed limit, it because he believes that God wants us to value human life, and driving 55 will save more lives than 75. Does this make him a religious fanatic? Does this make him a <i>dominionist</i>? By your definition it does. But, of course, that is absurd. He is not radical in his beliefs. Your definition is flawed. Your list is flawed, and slanderous." &#160;<font style="background: lightblue" color="#000000">&#160;&#160;<b>GUÐSÞEGN</b>&#160;&#160;</font>&#160;–&#160;<small><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_3d46.html" title="User:Guðsþegn">U</a><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User_talk%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_daf2.html" title="User talk:Guðsþegn">T</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Gu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_319a.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Guðsþegn">E</a><a href="../../../x/_/_/WP%7EX_5545.html" title="WP:X">X</a></small>&#160;– 05:18, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>What's the basis for "speedy". Also why is more time needed? If the person adding these parties, was doing so from a reliable source, they could have easily provided the source, when making the list (surely they knew the name of the source they're using). If they were unable to find a reliable source, then they should not have created the list in the first place. How could you possibly know there are reliable sources to add, if you can't name a single source. Or if you can name a source, then please do: in the article. How about just one for starters. I could understand, if we had a huge list of uncontested items, and it was taking a long time to add sources, but in this case, its a short list of contested items. If deleted, it could quickly/easily be recreated with sources in the future, if those reliable sources actually exist. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 18:53, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have to conur with JJay on this. It's frustrating how, in so many AFDs people refer to sources that do not appear in the article. Please, put the sources in the article. Generally, a well sourced article speaks for itself, and needs little explanation in AFD. In this case, we need to confirm that the term is used by each party itself, or is widely used by reliable sources to refer to party. I find it very disappointing, that people are still making entirely unsourced new articles. Wikipedia seems to be adding unsourced information faster then we can add sources to old stuff. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 05:26, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Change to <b>delete</b> per Rob above and below, and because although I can find some apparent evidence for the term, I can't find any reliable authority for the identification of individual parties as Dominionist, and in any case per my usual preference for categories, a category would be more likely to be picked up by the editor community on a given article and challenged if wrong, whereas lists can and have been used to attribute falsely. So I think on balance the best thing would be to delete this and have a category instead, which would have the benefit of being self-maintaining. This is not connected with the validity of the term, which I still think has at least some evidence of validity. JJay is right: I was being inconsistent, and extending existence of evidence beyond its real applicability. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 19:18, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

This page violates core policy of verifiability and neutrality. Even if this page is 100% true. It seems we have a case, of Wikipedians doing some original research, in applying a definition of a term to each case. That's original research. Even if you come to the correct conclusion, you can't attach a label yourself. You have to go by external reliable sources. Also, readers must not think Wikipedia takes a political position on what to label political parties. They must see who is saying what party has what label, know it's not us personally saying it.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hmmm, an absence of supporting cites in an article is not evidence that an article should be deleted, only that it needs to be better supported. Nor is the difficulty in finding cites. Just zis Guy you know? can attest to the lengths and expense Wikipedians have gone to provide supporting cites for contested content. The first response at Wikipedia is always to fix what is useful and can be fixed, not just delete it. The <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Heritage_Party_of_Canada_d7c7.html" title="Christian Heritage Party of Canada">Christian_Heritage_Party_of_Canada</a> is very poorly supported. In fact, it has no supporting cites at all. Should it be nominated for deletion as well? Of course not. Claiming a lack of supporting cites as justification for deletion is a specious argument. As is whether or not any particular group agrees with how other segements of society view and describe it. And BTW, there's no shortage of credible sources per WP:V that are available as supporting cites that connect Dominionism to various political parties and movements, starting with National Review, Harpers, PBS: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kurtz/kurtz200505020944.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationalreview.com/kurtz/kurtz200505020944.asp" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.harpers.org/SoldiersOfChrist.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.harpers.org/SoldiersOfChrist.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.harpers.org/FeelingTheHate.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.harpers.org/FeelingTheHate.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/politics/hedges05.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pbs.org/now/politics/hedges05.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.

<dd>That first article you cited, from National Review <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kurtz/kurtz200505020944.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationalreview.com/kurtz/kurtz200505020944.asp" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, is absolutely an <i>excellent</i> article. I don't think it does the work you think it does, though. Kurtz points out how overblown the "academic" critique of dominionism is; how its critics (including the one with an article at Wikipedia) <i>want</i> dominionism to be bigger than it really is, for their own political purposes; how the critics are trying to draw connections to larger groups and political parties where none actually exist. You have to read through to the end, past the sarcastic bit at the beginning. &#160;:-) Thanks for that link. &#160;<font style="background: lightblue" color="#000000">&#160;&#160;<b>GUÐSÞEGN</b>&#160;&#160;</font>&#160;–&#160;<small><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_3d46.html" title="User:Guðsþegn">U</a><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User_talk%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_daf2.html" title="User talk:Guðsþegn">T</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Gu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_319a.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Guðsþegn">E</a><a href="../../../x/_/_/WP%7EX_5545.html" title="WP:X">X</a></small>&#160;– 22:55, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And precisely what work do you think he thinks it does? Are you assuming FM didn't read it through? If so, I have little doubt that your assumption is in error, as is what I believe your assumption regarding what work FM "think[s] it does". As a source, it merely supports the fact that Dominionism exists, although any importance of Dominionism would be downplayed in the National Review (editorially conservative publication) in the same way it would be played up in an editorially liberal publication. Nonetheless, the question is this: does Dominionism exist? The answer is yes. Thus, as with any other political or religious movement it rates an article in Wikipedia. It really <i>is</i> that simple. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 08:26, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"<i>does Dominionism exist</i>?" is *NOT* the question for *this* AFD. That would be the question for <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominionism.html" title="Dominionism">Dominionism</a>. You say "<i>it rates an article in Wikipedia</i>". Yes, <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominionism.html" title="Dominionism">it</a> does, but this doesn't.

<dd>BTW, lack of critical support in an article simply reporting the existence of an organization is one thing.

<dd>Perhaps it would help to explain the slander this way. Say the article was called "World domination parties", and on that list was the same as this list, plus the US Republican Party (on the theory that since Bush is trying to export a political ideology, democracy, at the point of a gun; and since he's a nutty evangelical Christian). <i>Can you not see how this is slander?</i> Even with starting an unwarranted and foolish war in Iraq, and even given that he originally called it a crusade, he (and we America in general) have no desire to <i>dominate</i> Iraq in any way that doesn't mean letting the Iraqi people govern themselves. The party doesn't desire world domination. This <i>is</i> what this list is saying. So, combined with the fact that any rational human being who did not desire world dominion would not want to be labelled such, it is clear that the the very tag itself is slanderous. &#160;<font style="background: lightblue" color="#000000">&#160;&#160;<b>GUÐSÞEGN</b>&#160;&#160;</font>&#160;–&#160;<small><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_3d46.html" title="User:Guðsþegn">U</a><a href="../../../g/u/%C3%B0/User_talk%7EGu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_daf2.html" title="User talk:Guðsþegn">T</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Gu%C3%B0s%C3%BEegn_319a.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Guðsþegn">E</a><a href="../../../x/_/_/WP%7EX_5545.html" title="WP:X">X</a></small>&#160;– 17:49, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps I missed it, but nowhere in the WP article was the Republican Party mentioned -- in the Harpers article, yes, but not in a way that said the party itself was Dominionist (that the NRO took the quotes out of context is hardly surprising).</dd>
<dd>The example provided is essentially a misdirection; while domination and dominion have the same etymology they do not inherently have the same meaning.

<dd>If they got that impression that could only come from a lack of reading comprehension and not bothering to read what dominionism was.

<dd>Also, after that first sarcastic article in NRO, the PBS page, just had a reference to the NRO story. Another one of your links, didn't even use the term (and I can't figure out why you used it). You actually only cited Harpers, as using the term on its own. Also, the dispute with references isn't the existence of the term <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominionism.html" title="Dominionism">Dominionism</a>. It is it's usage when applied to specific parties. You gave exactly one source (Harpers) that (sort of) applied the term to a party. But, it applied it to only some people in the <b>Republican</b> party. Just try and add the Republican party to the page (and related category). You'll see how fast it's reverted. Given how your efforts to find sources, have failed so miserably, its clear there's little hope of sourcing this ever.

<dd>If you only spent half as much time looking for sources to improve the article as you've spent arguing to see it deleted. Then you'd know that there are plenty of notable instances both in and outside of the mainstream press associating certain political parties with Dominionism. That they exist merely need to be added to the article are the only relevant points here and put the lie to your jusitification for deleting this article.

<dd>Uh, that's just a link to Google. I know about Google. I used it already. If you have a source that is reliable, that proves *any* of the parties listed is Domionist, then put it in the article. What is the delay? If there are so many reliable sources, then why can't you go and reference this article. Every time you argue here, *instead* of fixing the article, you prove you can't fix the article. Incidently, from the beginning, I've been willing to be proved wrong. If you can prove there is a properly sourced list of "Dominionist" parties, from *neutral* *reliable* sources, I'll happily accept the article, and change my vote. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 00:50, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Meanwhile, back at wikipedia, the list remains completely unreferenced, although I will say that it is shrinking nicely.

<li><b>Delete</b>. "Dominionism" is, by and large, a straw man created by the American political [far] left that has no bearing on the actual ideology of most of the people labeled as such, and <i>certainly</i> does not play a rôle in the political ideologies of <i>any</i> of the parties listed in this horrific misbegotten excuse for a WP article. While it's true that the article could be cleaned up, there's no reason to do so...it covers a complete non-topic with no bearing in reality (unless you're an American antireligious leftist and honestly fall prey to the ludicrous notion that "dominionism" is a real political ideology with any relevant following, but that sort of delusion is not a strong enough argument in favor of keeping such a silly article)... <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 10:34, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Here we have a list of parties that do not seem to claim to hold the ideology in question and are not generally described as characterized by the ideology in question. The main usage of the <i>political term</i> Dominionism seems to be almost exclusively as an "attack phrase" - not an academically-identified distinction and not a "movement" that individuals or groups ascribe to (some seem to call themselves "Reconstructionists" instead). This largely defeats the purpose of having such a list - it's a lot like having a "List of politicians described as idiots by their political opponents and critics, although not generally characterized as such by themselves, or their supporters, or by the media in general, and despite the fact that academic work has identified neither a coherent pan-idiotic movement nor a wider phenomenon of independent movements sharing similar characteristics that can be labelled as idiotic" and then giving the article the name "List of idiotic politicians". In general, if an article is badly referenced, we tend to let is sit there with a "please fix my references!" tag on and just hope it isn't going to be harmful until it gets fixed. Since this list seems unlikely to ever be fixed in this way, and has the potential to be harmful until it is (who can tell which parties should be listed on it?), it ought to be removed, at least for the moment and until better references present themselves. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 03:57, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
