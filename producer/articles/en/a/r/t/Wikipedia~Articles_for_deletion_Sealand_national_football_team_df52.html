<p>This is (apparently) the Danish team "Vestbjerg Vintage Idrætsforening" which also doubles as the "national team" of a fictional nation. It's not notable in either capacity, as far as I can tell. There's no substantial coverage about them in reliable independent sources, and judging from the article there seems to be little verifiable information about them at all. They also don't seem to play in any professional league. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 22:39, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, they argue that it's not notable because it does not meet the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability guideline</a>, which states in pertinent part:
<dl>
<dd><i>A topic is <b>notable</b> if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Wikipedia%7EIndependent_sources_664e.html" title="Wikipedia:Independent sources">independent of the subject itself</a> and each other. All topics must meet a minimum threshold of <b>notability</b> in order for an article on that topic to be included in Wikipedia. This requirement ensures that there exists enough source material to write a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, encyclopedic article about the topic.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Which in the case of this team is very much not the case. Not every team that has ever kicked a ball is notable, only those that have their matches covered by substantial, reliable, independent sources. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 17:09, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The RSSSF link does have information about the match against the Aland Islands. Since no one has nominated the Aland Islands team for deletion, I can only assume we agree that they are notable. In addition, <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2536497,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2536497,00.html" rel="nofollow">other articles</a> talk about Sealand having a national football team. Plus, there's some evidence of a game against Northern Cyprus from earlier this year <a href="http://www.fifi-wildcup.de/newsflashdetail.php?sid=13" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fifi-wildcup.de/newsflashdetail.php?sid=13" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatken4_840d.html" title="User:Patken4">Patken4</a> 22:05, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The issue is not whether they exist. The issue is whether they have enough <i>substantial</i> third party coverage to be notable. A passing mention in a newspaper article is not substantial coverage, and neither are mentions that they might have played the odd match against this or that other team. There's just not enough material here for a verifiable article. We don't even know the players' names!<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 06:25, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If that's your criteria, then you might as well nominate every NF-Board team because none have <i>substantial</i> third-party coverage, even in the areas they represent, with the possible exceptions of Sapmi and Northern Cyprus. What difference does it make if we know who the players are? Do we know who the players representing <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Moluccas_national_football_team_e397.html" title="South Moluccas national football team">South Moluccas</a> or <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kiribati_national_football_team.html" title="Kiribati national football team">Kiribati</a> are? My criteria is that they have been officially recognized to represent Sealand and they have played at least one match against international competition. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatken4_840d.html" title="User:Patken4">Patken4</a> 12:29, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'd support this if this team would be representing a real country instead of a figment of the imagination - but in that case, we <i>would</i> have substantial third party coverage. Which is not <i>my</i> criterion for notability, but our community's, as per the consensually adopted guideline <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.
