<p>I nominate the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_perspectives_on_dinosaurs.html" title="Religious perspectives on dinosaurs">Religious perspectives on dinosaurs</a> article for deletion for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first section mentions how this issue is inextricably intertwined with evolution; really, this article is simply a part of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">Creation-evolution controversy</a> and is largely covered there.</li>
<li>Dinosaurs in the Bible is not that important; it isn't very prominent, and seems to simply be a duplicate of rather unreliable stuff from the Behemoth article.</li>
<li>Dinosaurs according to the metaphorical take on various scriptures doesen't really say anything at all and is totally unsourced.</li>
<li>Dinosaurs in Young Earth Creationism is already covered in <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Earth_Creationism_a76b.html" title="Young Earth Creationism">Young Earth Creationism</a> and this section adds nothing not said there.</li>
<li>Earth created with age's only source is a site criticizing the viewpoint, and again, is covered by various <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> articles.</li>
<li>Jehovah's Witnesses section is already covered in Beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses, and again, is simply an outgrowth of rejection of evolution – they believe dinosaurs are ancient, they simply don't believe in evolution, and I'm not sure if this is independently notable.</li>
<li>This page is essentially fundamentalist Christian perspectives on dinosaurs, and no one has added any other religious perspectives to the article even months after a call for them to do so.</li>
</ol>
<p>If this article IS deleted, being a subarticle of the <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a> article, some of it would need to go into that article. I think a simple mention that the antiquity of dinosaurs is rejected by young earth creationists, and those who reject evolution don't believe in the notion that dinosaurs are the ancestors of modern species. As this is basically all the article says anyway, and we can simply link to <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> and/or <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">creation-evolution controversy</a> in the section, I don't see any reason not to do this. It is not very important to the <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a> article, and as it is sufficiently covered by <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> and related articles I see no need for this article, as it isn't really notable in and of itself. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 10:53, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Come on... this is purely speculative. Wikipedia is not a church, it is a place for <i>facts</i> and <i>fact</i> is that dinosaurs predate mankind by a wide margin.

<li><b>Keep</b> So I'll comment, since I created the article originally, and since I've been one of the core editors on the <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a> article since January 2006. Basically, there were around two years of constant tussling over the presence and nature of a religious views paragraph in the main article on Dinosaurs (check that article's talk archives to see what I mean). Relocating the content to the Religious Perspectives article was a compromise solution, and one that has almost entirely prevented subsequent conflict in the parent article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Would I personally prefer that "religious perspectives on dinosaurs" not be a topic covered by Wikipedia? Surely; I also personally think that being overly inclusive is not a useful exercise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However... the presence of this article has contributed in a significant and very positive way to the quality of the parent article since I started editing it in January 2006. Christian-viewpoint editors -- who are legion on Wikipedia, and who might have been tempted to add to the Dinosaurs article, as happened constantly prior to the creation of the religious perspectives fork, have instead worked to improve the sub-article (where the content is more appropriate). And the content IS appropriate, I should emphasize -- it's reasonable to include <b>significant</b> minority perspectives about dinosaurs in Wikipedia even if they aren't "scientific."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the religious perspectives article is deleted, we can look forward to many more disagreements over the addition of religious perspectives information to the parent article... Killdevil 02:45, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Honestly, that's not a reason to keep an article. Yeah, defacement is annoying, but really, I don't even think there are that many even looking at the article; they've probably all moved onto <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah%27s_Ark_8421.html" title="Noah's Ark">Noah's Ark</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a>, and similar articles by now. Bowing down to trolls is not a good policy, though, and we have to keep the standards up. And if we link to the creationism and similar articles, won't they be diverted there anyway? Or we could just remove it as irrelevant junk not supported by RSs. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 04:27, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> OR <b>Keep</b>, <i>not</i> Merge with <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a>. I don't care wheter this article stays or goes, but I strongly oppose merge the content back into <i><a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a></i>. The reason this article was created in the first place was to keep the embarrassing, barely-relevant creationist perspectives on dinosaurs out of the main dinosaur article. Any attempts to integrate this content back into that article will be reverted immediately by the editors of Dinosaur who have been content with the existance of the article as a comprimise since last June. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinoguy2_fb24.html" title="User:Dinoguy2">Dinoguy2</a> 15:18, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I fully understand the situation you are experiencing. However, granting these people their own article to continue this nonsense is not the way to deal with vandalism of the <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a> article. If your article is vandalized again they should be warned/blocked/banned. I am saying this to you in full respect and understanding of your situation but we need to be firm on this. People who vandalize by adding nonsense must be blocked, not granted their own article to keep soapboxing. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 16:00, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> to preserve the intergrity of the <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a> article. There is no question that Wikipedia should report on the scientifically nonsensical and misguided attempts of some religious groups to discredit the established fossil record. The article makes clear in a neutral manner the fact that these movements place themselves in contradiction to entire fields of geology and biology. The existence of such views among fringe groups has been reported on in many major media sources, and keeping the article does not validate their ideas. "Delete because it's all unscientific nonsense" is not a valid argument, since if that were the case we'd have to delete <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">Flat Earth</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a>, and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greys.html" title="Greys">Greys</a>.

<dd>My reason for deletion is not that it is unscientific nonsense; the reason it has been proposed fo deletion is that the article is not independently notable. That is to say, it is essentially a part of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">creation-evolution controversy</a>; the entire article is duplication of what is said elsewhere in Wikipedia in the relevant articles.

<li><b>Delete</b>: I feel sympathy for the editors trying to keep nonsense and cruft out of the dinosaur article, but to create a POV fork for that purpose is the wrong solution. Send editors who wish to edit about such stuff to Creation-Evolution controvery, Young Earth Creationism, etc. I'm sorry your job is hard sometimes, but this article is nonsense. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 11:24, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Delete</b>, DO NOT merge, per <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinoguy2_fb24.html" title="User:Dinoguy2">Dinoguy2</a> above. Article <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a> is a <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">Featured Article</a>, consisting of useful, verifiable information of an encyclopedic nature. Creationist cruft gets sent to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_perspectives_on_dinosaurs.html" title="Religious perspectives on dinosaurs">Religious perspectives on dinosaurs</a>, and we frequently delete attempts to add religious stuff to <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a> or any of the genera articles, directing them here. I am <i>very</i> concerned that this well-meaninged attempt to rid Wikipedia of a bad article will eventually cause the excellent <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a> article, which <a href="http://hemlock.knams.wikimedia.org/%7Eleon/stats/wikicharts/index.php?lang=en&amp;wiki=enwiki&amp;ns=articles&amp;limit=1000&amp;month=12%2F2006&amp;mode=view" class="external text" title="http://hemlock.knams.wikimedia.org/%7Eleon/stats/wikicharts/index.php?lang=en&amp;wiki=enwiki&amp;ns=articles&amp;limit=1000&amp;month=12%2F2006&amp;mode=view" rel="nofollow">receives 1.5 million visitors a year</a>, to suffer. The people who attempt to add material of a religious nature to <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a> are <i>not</i> vandals, and cannot be blocked (an admin who blocked a user for adding sourced material could lose his or her admin buttons). This article at the very least gives those users something to edit.

<dd>They don't have to be blocked unless they're being disruptive; as I pointed out above - a link to <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> would divert them, and obviously it could be explained why it is inappropriate for the article. POV Forking is unacceptable. Yeah, I know, it sucks dealing with unreasonable <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationists.html" title="Creationists">Creationists</a> sometimes, but it happens, and if the article is really that popular, it is probably well policed.

<dd>Inserting unsourced obviously non-factual information in an article <i>is</i> vandalism by the very definition of the word. choosing not to deal with them through the usual channels for doing so and allowing a POV fork instead is unacceptable. Once again I appreciate your situation and your desire to keep the article at its high level of quality but this is not the way to do so. If an admin is taken to ArbCom and desysopped for blocking a user for claiming that dinosaurs were alive during biblical times I will be there, defending him with my teeth! <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 12:36, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The last time this was a major issue in the dinosaur article, we had an admin involved in the debate -- he blocked people who violated 3RR by removing religious language from the article... which is just to say that many of the people who have commented here are dedicated to keeping "science" articles "scientific" but that this is NOT a universal sentiment among editors on Wikipedia, and not among admins either. This fork was a reaction to the difficulty we had in keeping religious language from creeping into the article. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilldevil_764d.html" title="User:Killdevil">Killdevil</a> 13:39, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Looking through the last 1000 edits it seems apparent that the vandalism from anons haven't stopped although they are of a different nature now. Second, the insertion of POV non-sourced information prior to the forking came primarily, at the end anyway, from one anon with a static IP. But this is also about something bigger than the Dino article. It is about the fact that these people effectively bullied their way to an article that shouldn't be here. And that is unacceptable. As for 3RR it does not apply to fighting vandalism and as mentioned above there should be plenty of people policing this article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 14:17, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please also note that during the recent December ArbCom elections, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Candidate_statements#Kelly_Martin" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Candidate_statements#Kelly_Martin" rel="nofollow">at least one editor</a> ran for ArbCom on the platform of a "zero tolerance policy for administrative misconduct: any administrator who abuses administrative privilege (where "abuses" means uses in a manner inconsistent with policy where such use tends to create or intensify a disruption in Wikipedia") will be, at the very least, temporarily suspended as an administrator. Admins on Wikipedia have had a free hand for too long."

<dd>No, I fully understood your argument, and that you fully support a scientific basis for Wikipedia's <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a> article. My point was simply that not everyone sees it that way, and both regular users and admins need to be careful when editing/blocking, as those priviledges (editing and blocking, respectively) can be taken away if the majority of the group decides maintaining a scientific point of view, and reverting non-science edits, is "abuse". You stated above you would fight for an admin who was taken to ArbCom over protecting an article from Creationist POV edits, but that does no good if 41 others support desysopping an "abusive" admin, right?&#160;:) <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 07:35, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Who says abortion is a "highly controversial" topic? Or even a political one? It is, by the simplest definition, a <i>medical</i> topic, and should require no more ideological forks or coverage than <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appendectomy.html" title="Appendectomy">appendectomy</a>. But, this does not remove the fact that many people construe it as a deeply political and ethical topic. As much as I would like to take a strictly "firm" approach to Abortion in terms of notability, verifiability, etc. (Do we <i>really</i> need a "Fetal pain" sub-section?), I have found all efforts toward this end to be disasterous. If you brook no concession <i>ever</i>, you're forgetting that Wikipedia <i>is</i> a collaborative effort, and is intended to be inclusive of many POVs. Thus, "firm, but fair" is my solution at <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">Abortion</a>; we compromise sometimes, attempt to accommodate editorial concerns/minority views sometimes, but, ultimately, only to a point. I see the situation at Dinosaur as being analogous to our own; they have accommodated minority views, but drawn a line, and said, "No more." These sorts of compromises are fair and have led to relative stability on both Dinosaur and Abortion. I appreciate your efforts to try to preserve article integrity against OR and NPOVUW violations, but, again, there needs to be compromise. And, as for giving people their own "soapboxes," POV forks off major articles are nothing novel: <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality_and_religion.html" title="Homosexuality and religion">Homosexuality and religion</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_and_abortion.html" title="Religion and abortion">Religion and abortion</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_and_sexuality.html" title="Religion and sexuality">Religion and sexuality</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery_and_religion.html" title="Slavery and religion">Slavery and religion</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism_and_religion.html" title="Fascism and religion">Fascism and religion</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_and_the_internet.html" title="Religion and the internet">Religion and the internet</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender_and_religion.html" title="Gender and religion">Gender and religion</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_and_politics.html" title="Religion and politics">Religion and politics</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>, do not merge. Of course this is essentially part of the controversy between creation and evolution, but there is no reason for having only one article about that controversy. For instance regarding Roman Catholic sacraments there are plenty of articles, and essentially these are all about believing or not in the holiness of such. Mixing the non-scientifical approach of the world with one that is based on scientific empirism, is bound to continuously jeopardize the objectivity and quality of an article and cause truly endless discussions, for water and fire cannot be one. The current weasel wording in the style of <i>some people</i> does however require naming at least a few people or groups of people with a proper source.

<li><b>Delete</b> My deepest sympathies with those editors dealing with vandalism of their beloved dinosaur article. Seriously. However, we Wikipedians tend to be smart... clever even.

Also, I find the argument that "this needs to be included so I know how religious people deal with dinosaurs" deeply flawed, because the vast majority of Christians, many of my family and friends included (full disclosure for COI purposes: I am not a Christian), are not biblical literalists, and "believe" in evolution, so to speak. If the subject's notability rests entirely on the fact that a sub-group of a religion holds its belief, then that subject's notability will depend partly on how notable that group is, and Creationists are not as notable as Christians generally (through they may be more outspoken). On the other hand, part of the notability of a belief is unrelated to the groups which hold it: to think otherwise is to think that <i>every</i> belief, held by <i>any</i> notable group is <i>therefore</i> notable, and this is obviously untrue. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 12:07, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I think I change my mind to a clear request for keeping it. There have already been many long discussions regarding several articles about which ones should be merged or kept as an independent article. If this article was deleted, it would not make the discussion more easy. And I clearly think that the information in the article is something that should be known. I feel that many in here just want the article away because they do not like the viewpoints the article describes. <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESummer_Song_7ecf.html" title="User:Summer Song">Summer Song</a> 14:53, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>To give some additional comments: Wikipedia shall not proclaim christian standpoints. Wikipedia shall not proclaim creationist standpoints. But it shall not proclaim anti-christian or anti-religious standpoints either. And it shall not proclaim a point of view that it is only sickness or madness that cause someone doubt the main evolution theory, or other teachings that is generally considered proven as fact. It may seem like many in this discussion just want to mock every attempt to question the evolution theory or other scientific thoughts. There are several types of creation beliefs. There are some creation beliefs that are just laughable, but there are also some with at least some more educated thoughts. And that is exactly what this article is talking about. The article presents various thoughts that are held by religions on the topic. I think that the article has a value. <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESummer_Song_7ecf.html" title="User:Summer Song">Summer Song</a> 15:07, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Geez... calm down. No need for the personal attacks. A bit of assuming good faith would be nice here. I am not anti-christian and I never called anyone sick or mad. Yes, the article represents a point of view but nothing else. Where are the reliable sources? Where can I verify that this in fact is not something made up? Those are answers that ALL Wikipedia articles must provide answers to, not just the Christian ones. I have been called everything from a islaomphobist, anti-jew, dumb liberal to stone-age conservative here. But never anti-christian. That was a new one. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 15:33, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> because otherwise this material will keep finding it's way back into the main <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">dinosaur</a> article, and lead to endless problems there. Besides, as a viewpoint with so many supporters, it does deserve an article (however, probably a shorter one, in more of a neutral point of view). Why delete when rewriting solves problems? <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 21:09, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> POV forking is allowed if the minority view is culturally important (read: notable) in and of itself. Persistent vandalism of the nature described here is but one of the signs that another view should be accomodated in a separate article. This is why <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a> isn't part of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primate.html" title="Primate">primates</a> article and why <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_earth.html" title="Flat earth">flat earth</a> isn't part of the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">earth</a> article. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 00:22, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Forking isn't the main issue here. The main issue is that the article viokates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. If we are to invoke the "exceptions can be made in special cases" argument then we need to make it clear here that we are <b>not</b> endorsing this way of dealing with vandalism. Otherwise this is just a way of bending the policies that ensures the integrity of Wikipedia. Also, it is worth noting that all articles must meet these requirements. There are no exceptions for special minority groups. Having ones wievs on Wikipedia is not a right, all articles must meet the same requirements. I appreciate the difficult situation for the people at the dino article but I am also concerned about Wikipedia as a whole. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 00:43, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Regardless of whether much of the material of the article has been discussed elswhere, the present article draws together the variety of thoughts about a topic which constitutes a major point of contention between scientists and many religious individuals and groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>The subject of the article is <i>not</i> the presentation of <i>facts</i> from a fundamentalist Christian viewpoint. The subject of the article is that such differences of philosophy and opinion exist, and what those differences are. <i>Any</i> belief that is held by a significant number of people is worthy of an encyclopedic article in an encyclopedia that can afford to be as large and diverse as this one. I do think that it would be good to get paragraphs written by people who are familiar with viewpoints other than Jewish and Christian ones. As for the balance of opinion, the article states that within these faiths there is both acceptance and non-acceptance of the scientific assessment of the evidence. Note that I have done a little rewriting, because we are dealing essentialy with <i>belief</i> rather than fact. We now have disagreement with or support for theory or assessment rather than disagreement with "fact". This honours the "fact" that the article deals with "ideas" and has moved from the realm of science to the realm of philosophy. --<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmandajm_0a38.html" title="User:Amandajm">Amandajm</a> 10:32, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
