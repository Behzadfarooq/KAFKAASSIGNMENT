<dd><b>Keep</b> [reason] We need a reference guide to smaller characters. As a on going show, we get many rumours and speculations posted on One Piece related pages. For that reason pages such as this are needed purly to resolve such debates. Also, most of these characters have play extremely important roles or are generally important things to the series. If this page is deleted a lot of important information would be lost. These characters also don't warrent their own pages because they don't have enough imformation for them. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngel_Emfrbl_46cc.html" title="User talk:Angel Emfrbl">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angel_Emfrbl_0295.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angel Emfrbl">contribs</a>) 12:33 2006-07-27.</small></dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> One Piece bounties page- There is too much bits of imformation on this page for the One Piece main page. To place all this on that one page would clog it up or create confusion. It is here to act as a reference, it also helps conpare rumours and speculations since this is related to an on going show. This page collects together the information for debates, comparisons and quick referecing. Its uselfulness was proven today when I correct correct several One Piece pages because a someone came in and altered them, this included <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dracule__Hawkeye__Mihawk_4ffc.html" title="Dracule &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Mihawk">Mihawks</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monkey_D._Luffy_b95b.html" title="Monkey D.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Both the Manga adaptions and the Anime adaptions pages were orginally one with the One Piece Main page. What we found is that it cause confusion and inconsitancey with other parts of the article. When we seperated the information it allowed us to clean up the One Piece main page and gave each section a chance to grow on its on without repeated information or inconsistacies. Also, this page is fairly new and as such has not been completed yet. At least it needs a couple more weeks to bring it up to scratch with wikipedias standards. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 13:53, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> One Piece Template. Size wise, we are actually trying to strink that, it is work in progress and discussion has been on going. Half the trouble is tha the series itself, One Piece, is the most populaur anime in Japan and therefore has a lot of information in general, much of it important to the storyline and worth noting on the One Piece pages. We haven't finished with the template, we need a few weeks to sort it out. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 14:03, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The One Piece crews being listed, that has only just been created as such and while has a list of crew and information doesn't provide much information on roles and importantce of the crews themselves. The individual Pirate Crew pages list the roles they've played, as well as information that cannot be summed up in a few short sentances. Another reason for them being the way they are is that there are so many (One Piece is afterall a show on PIRATES) that there is a lot of different crews. To put it plainly, you can't sum up EVERYTHING on the pirate crews in one list like on that page without loosing a lot of information important to the series. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 14:01, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>- This is a world encyclopedia, not a US one. Just because they're bigger in Japan and EU than here is no reason to delete. --<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPresN_40fd.html" title="User:PresN">PresN</a> 17:56, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, there are plenty of game companies that are only very active in a certain area. For example, there are numerous ones only active in the US and/or Europe (Microsoft's console games are not popular in Japan at all) but that does not make them any less notable. At any rate, certainly keep the template, but it looks like there's a lot of cleaning up to do around there. <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> <sub>(t|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Syphonbyte_b9d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Syphonbyte">c</a>)</sub> 18:15, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Everything you listed for deletion is a valid compendium of information for this series. Regardless of what you think about the amount of pages and detailed information, the fact of the matter is that the One Piece franchise has alot of details in its plot, characters, and general information overall. All of these pages are usefull for compiling information on the anime series, manga, video games, etc. --Lordshmeckie 18:47, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I may be wrong, but judging from your initial comments, you, good sir, seem to be under the assumption that One Piece is primarily a game series, while it is in fact an anime/manga series. Since Naruto et al gets to keep its attack lists and such (<a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninjutsu_%28Naruto%29_8413.html" title="Ninjutsu (Naruto)">like this, for instance</a>), One Piece should keep its own. Concerning the minor and filler characters--would you prefer if we made individual articles for each one? To quote the <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a> article:</li>
</ul>
<p>"Non-notable minor characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be merged with short descriptions into a "List of characters." This list should reside in the article relating to the work itself, unless either becomes long, in which case a separate article for the list is good practice. The list(s) should contain all characters, races, places, etc. from the work of fiction, with links to those that have their own articles." <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigmasonic_X_df4d.html" title="User:Sigmasonic X">Sigmasonic X</a> 06:46, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
