<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>, without prejudice to the creation <b>at any time</b> of a neutral article about <i>the company</i>. I appreciate that whatever decision I reached this would likely end up on DRV, so I will explain my findings and how I reached this decision. First of all, I excluded alleged sockpuppets and weighted down one opinion for the reasons stated. I then checked the contribs of names I didn't recognise (which revealed no new cause for concern). I then looked at the numbers; deletion is the favoured outcome numerically but not by a landslide. Finally, I used my discretion in evaluating the arguments and who made them. AFD regulars favour deletion, whereas Australian contributors have argued that this is a reasonably notable company. My decision ultimately is that both sides have a case; the article shouldn't be allowed to stand as a POV fork, but that the company in question is not undeserving of an article. My summation of the debate is, therefore, that the article is not acceptable <i>as it stands</i> but an article on this company <i>could</i> be acceptable; the result of the debate is therefore delete without prejudice to a clean start. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a soapbox is most relevant here. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 10:38, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Ya know, an actual nomination would've been nice here, rather than just leaping into the whole "making a vote" thing. You know that bit where many experienced AfDers generally refrain from doing the bolded "delete", and explain in detail why they've nominated someone's hard work for deletion? Yeah, I know it's not as common as it should be, or once was.

<li>Not a lot of hard work as this is a rehash of what was in the Dean McVeigh article plus a large verbatim legal extract. I reiterate, the company is non notable, the liquidation is of mild interest due to the removal of McVeigh but there should be no confusion that this is simply an attempt to circumvent the toning down of the McVeigh POV in other articles by editors with a vested interest. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarglebutt_ee27.html" title="User:Garglebutt">Garglebutt</a> / <a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarglebutt_a0ca.html" title="User talk:Garglebutt">(talk)</a> 08:09, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This company may well meet WP:CORP given the statement by the Victorian Minister about practices and that there are other references to them.

<li><b>Comment</b> My tip is to read the cases involved, not something I have done yet in full. Understand them first before saying whether not notable. Watching Garglebutt's other edits, I see he is very vengeful person against Darren Ray. His views should be discounted for this personal view.

<li><b><s>Strong Keep</s></b> This is clearly an abuse of the article for deletion process and a very unfortunate act by its proposer. Notable company, notable liquidation, notable litigation about the liquidation. I would like to see those proposing its deletion actually state otherwise and participate in the discussion. These are <i>reported cases</i> from the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal etc. They are important cases which were the subject of several media reports as well at the time aside from being published in relevant law reports which clearly demonstrate their notability in legal terms. There are very, very few cases of a company administrator ever being removed, as anyone familiar with the area of insolvency law will tell you, the threshold is so high that it is nearly impossible to cross. If you have issues with the content, change it but don't abuse this Afd process to pursue some sort of sad vendetta.

<li><b>Agree with Achan</b>. On the face of it, the company seems reasonably notable (but I haven't looked into the issues). <i>However</i>, the use of this article to continue a vendetta against Dean McVeigh is <i>exceedingly</i> inappropriate and troubling, not to mention immature, as is Garglebutt's apparent crusade against Darren and Ben.

Secondly, the article on Dean McVeigh was redirected by AFD consensus; if this article is an attempt to recreate McVeigh material by the backdoor it most certainly <i>is</i> an issue for AFD. Finally, "apparently notable" doesn't give me much confidence that the editor actually checked. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 10:24, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Keep</s></b> Sorry I missed all the fun. But on a serious note, I would just like to say I thought this article would actually help resolve the issue about the missing information from Dean McVeigh's article after it was merged with <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_University_student_organisations_bf7b.html" title="Melbourne University student organisations">Melbourne University student organisations</a>. It wasn't appropriate to leave the information about Rugs Galore in there and I thought this was an ideal solution. If the article incorrectly states what happens in the Supreme Court cases, and I don't believe it does, why don't we have that discussion. Separating Dean McVeigh who was its Administrator and was central to what went wrong in its Administration does seem rather a strange objective. Anyway, see you at the Talk page and let's resolve it amicably. --<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2006BC_4eed.html" title="User:2006BC">2006BC</a> 07:28, 16 March 2006 (UTC) <b>I'm disregarding this contribution since the user is blocked indefinitely per <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarrenRay_Sockpuppets_d5a0.html" title="User:DarrenRay/Sockpuppets">User:DarrenRay/Sockpuppets</a>. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 10:24, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</b></li>
