<p>The result of the debate was a bit tricky, but I'll try closing this now. (Closing the first AFD debate was much easier, when there was a clear keep consensus.) On raw vote count there is not a real consensus for outright deletion, and the main objection has been that Wikipedia is not a memorial. I <i>believe</i> that the objection is to the list of names in the article. However, the article has a lead section which describes the recovery of bodies and treatment of the wounded, material which is not really covered by the "memorial" argument. I will therefore call this a <b>merge</b> of the lead section only to the "casualties" section of <a href="../../../7/_/j/7_July_2005_London_bombings_2280.html" title="7 July 2005 London bombings">7 July 2005 London bombings</a>, and redirect there. The list of names will be dropped, but I'll add the BBC News link to the main article as well. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:34, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It doesn't say anything about lists of casualties. It says "memorials". Whether lists of casualties are considered memorials depends mostly on their context, IMO. And I don't think in this case the context has anything to do with "honoring" anyone, thus I don't see this being a memorial. Of course as long as the policy is ambigiously worded, it will solely be a matter of opinion. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 00:42, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Right off the top of my head, when the article is written with an emphasis on the suffering and loss of the families, as if pandering to their grief, instead of dispassionately discussing all the facts of the incident. <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndomion_ea7e.html" title="User:Endomion">Ruby</a> 12:15, 26 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I basically agree. In the Kent State article the victims are mentioned within the text to help further explain the incident (that being said, I think the articles on the victims could be merged back in), while in this example it's just a list of names thrown together. Now there probably is some gray area between the two examples, bu tthis article just isn't in it. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 05:10, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

This looks to me lika an example of systemic bias: nobody is pressing for a list of Tsunami victims, after all. It is problematic, though, since the chances of a full list of casualties making it seem to increase as the number reduces, making it more likely that some minor incident will have a full list than would be the case for a major tragedy.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> I don't see any grieveing families here. The top of the article is almost certainly too long, and duplicates too much in other articles.

<li>"If the sister of one of these people becomes Prime Minister, we'll want this to link to. " Does that strike anyone else as a really bad reason to keep an article? We could use that logic on any high school student vanity page ("this person may someday be Prime Minister, we'll want this information then!"). If bombing victim Reginald Worthingham IV's sister becomes PM, we can link to the main article: "Prime Minister Victoria Worthingham's brother Reginald was killed in the <a href="../../../7/_/j/7_July_2005_London_bombings_2280.html" title="7 July 2005 London bombings">7 July 2005 London bombings</a>."

<li>I'm sorry but I must object to your statement. A list of the names of people who died in a notable event <i>is</i> more encyclopaedic than a list of names of people who did not die in a notable event. Is it encyclopedic enough to include in Wikipedia? Depends on the circumstances (see <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent_State_shootings_f7ad.html" title="Kent State shootings">Kent State shootings</a>). Such rediculous equivocations are not helpful to the debate. Obviously there <i>is</i> a difference between this list and a list of everyone who ever died of cancer. The question is: does the difference matter enough to make it worth including in Wikipedia? <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 22:52, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
