<p><b>Delete</b>. This is an article about a very obscure UFO incident. The sources cited are weak, and most (or all) of the ones I can find seem to point back to some Discovery channel "documentary" of dubious reliability.

<li><b>Comment</b>. How notable is it really? The sources all point to the Discovery documentary, and not one claims to have any original information or have any information "from the horse's mouth". The first Google page only has a couple results that are actually related to the UFO, with the others talking about fast walking people or such. Generally, popular or well-known conspiracy or UFO theories with such distinct names have the first pages of Google tied up. I also don't see any real discussion occuring over this anywhere to make it any more notable than the thousands of other UFO encounters that don't have their own articles. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 04:08, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As it's an extremely common phrase, I don't think the fact that there are unrelated links on the first page of search results is enough on its own to condemn the article. For a source other than the Discovery segment, see the one in my comment below, an article in Omni from 1994. It's on UFO sightings in the 1980's, and it spends a good chunk of time on the 1984 'fast walker'.
<ul>
<li>Arr, the other results on the first page that use "fast walker" aren't exactly popular webpages themselves. Anyways, with the Omni one we now have two sources. Not much. Any other sign of notability? As I said, there are hundreds of other UFO encounters out there with as much evidence and notability as this one. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 04:29, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Omni got to the point at one time where they would accept just about any story.

<li><b>Delete</b>; the single website cited does not even remotely meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, which leaves this one article in Omni, which cites one single "researcher" as pushing this theory. If this article is kept, it will basically need rewriting from the ground up to reflect the real facts, which are that (1) there is no evidence whatsoever that this event ever occurred (the "evidence" is a single supposedly leaked printout), and (2) if it did occur, as the Omni article points out, it is trivially explained as an SR-71 flight. Really, this might merit a paragraph in a general article on UFO conspiracy theories, but that's about the limit.<br />

<li>Forum-ish names? Names like Aplomado you mean? This isn't the internet or anything where anonymity is allowed. Has less than 70 unique Google hits? I didn't know that was wiki's standard for deleting things now.

<li><b>Delete</b>, but whilst I'm on the side of deletion for this, what makes this any more or less notable than any other modification in the community, considering it has had magazine coverage, interviews and working demonstrations to the public? Mods like No More Room in Hell and Black Mesa Source are certainly no more notable than Zombie Master is. --86.128.14.79 12:54, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Mesa_%28game_mod%29_f303.html" title="Black Mesa (game mod)">Black Mesa: Source</a> was kept (even over my objections), due to it actually nearing finished state and it was also picking up mentions from (dead-tree) game press and commendations from Valve, IIRC, which, in my book, certainly makes it a bit more notable than a mod that describes itself as "alpha". And it <i>was</i> actually deleted before on exact same grounds that this mod is being considered for deletion for... Does Zombie Master get this sort of press yet? --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 13:44, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, considering it has apparently made no or little progress since then, do you think that might be perhaps a lie on the behalf of those might want to keep it in Wikipedia? Secondly, <a href="../../../d/e/v/Development_stage.html#Alpha" title="Development stage">Alpha</a> fits the bill very nicely for how BMS was presenting itself to you guys. In addition, whilst Zombie Master hasn't been mentioned by Valve, I don't really think that's overly relevant, since that seems to be semi-linked to the amount of screenshots of rendered models a team can produce. A German magazine has picked up on Zombie Master and wrote a little piece on it with an accompanying screenshot. So er, what's the difference between the two? --86.128.14.79 13:49, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think having media mentions etc. is a be-all, end-all reason to keep; a mod that's released and gets media mentions is much better than a mod that's not. Media mentions would be a "mitigating circumstance". =) BM:S's vote ended with No Consensus. If someone renominated that thing, say, 6 months after the previous AfD, and stressed hard enough that there's not been much progress, you'd probably soon see a smouldering crater where an article used to be. At best, it'd be a case for merge. WP can be lenient what comes to promises, but not exactly lenient what comes to late promises. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 14:26, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hm, so ultimately this comes down to the owner of the thing they want to promote wanting or not wanting their article enough to buy themselves some more time? Interesting, but I think this is a pretty good sign of how WP has some weird beauracracy issues. Anyway, delete this, buy colour me not too happy that other, similarly worthy modifications are allowed to stay based on very little else other than some rather biased words. --86.128.14.79 15:42, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would just like to note that the 905 board is not only used by members of the immediate music scene in the Southern Ontario area. The board has garnered enough attention that it is frequented by music fans from places all over Canada such as Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal and Halifax. Additionally, users from the UK also make use of the forum.16:49, 18 June 2006 (UTC)Jeff K</li>

<li>The site and board have played an important part in the creation of many bands that are important to the post-punk music movement.

<li>I don't understand why it is you people think you are capable of deciding what is and is not notable? Are you some kind of masters of the various cultures and movements of the present day? There are millions of people that listen to the bands Silverstein, Alexisonfire and Boys Night Out. Thousands who idolozie them, latch onto the cultures of these bands and consider them a serious part of who they are. Surely as masters of culture you've all been to high schools lately? You've seen the way emo / punk is becoming the mainstream in todays youth? An entire generation is growing up on this new type of music, and a large majority of it is coming from Southern Ontario; specifically, the 905 music scene. But I wouldn't expect you guys to know anything about that. And I'm almost certain you don't.</li>

<li>this is not vanity or advertising. the 905 board has been(at least in part) the breading ground for some of Canada's largest underground, &amp; mainstream musical acts. To deny the 905 board community's entry into the history books would be an outrage. Besides, isn't the persuit to add point of reference where reference is lacking the whole goal of Wikipedia?

<li>Believe it or not, wikipedia is not just an American site. In Canada, where the 905 scene and board are located, 5 bands <i>is</i> a lot. we are a country of 30 million, and we consider Canadian success and success in the US very important to our (Canadian) music scene. All of these bands sell well in the US and tour regularly, and more are on the way. just because it's not top-40 spit out by the big record companies to sell pepsi doesn't mean it's not relevant to <i>anyone</i>. There are many people who use wikipedia outside of the people who frequent the "articles for deletion" section. If you want to help us use proper citations and wiki-conduct (or whatever you call it!) to improve the entry, please do.</li>

<li>Thanks for the actual helpful advice and comments beyond "delete, breaks infraction code 38240:ALPHA" or something equally insider. The simple answer to the newspaper question is that the board IS a source of information. People don't check newspapers to tell them to check the board...they just...<i>check the board</i>. Like many influential internet sites, it's beyond just one purpose. it's a community, a source of information and more. That said, there have been many articles that talk about bands forming due to the board, shows the board has put on, articles about me (Mark Johnston, the foudner), etc. these were all in local papers, that don't have internet articles, only the physical medium. since we are based in small(er) communities (rather than Toronto for example), we don't have many of those "underground" or subculture media sources. most of our users find us by word-of-mouth or smaller things like zines and band links. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnaX_b33e.html" title="User:SnaX">SnaX</a> 19:44, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Sheesh! This fails on sooo many levels wrt wiki standards. (Aside to Mr SnaX, your report of the death of Tim Berners-Lee is greatly exaggerated!). The article lacks verifiable sources, it fails to establish the notability of its subject other than the conflation in the mind of the article's author. The article also fails to establish the importance of its subject outside a very tight geographical area with a small population. Wikipedia may proclaim itself to be many things but it is not a billboard. <a href="../../../e/d/d/User%7EEddie.willers_4fa8.html" title="User:Eddie.willers">Eddie.willers</a> 21:31, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I was just hoping the mention of Berners-Lee would manage to scare off some egg-heads who thought they had easy pickings! The reason we lack verifiable sources is because there aren't any. This is a word-of-mouth and in-cd-booklets and in-a-zine-that-only-400-people-get kind of thing. It doesn't show up in the New York Times or on The Insider. Does that mean it's less important than the new J-Lo album? I'd argue no. So much of what become popular music is from scenes and communities <i>exactly</i> like this one. The relevance can be seen Canada-wide, as shown by this recent post by one of our members.

<li><b>KEEP</b>. When asked about the history of a succesful band like silverstein, one has but to point to the 905 board. This is evident in their DVD and CDs where they thank the 905 board for the formation of their band. Silverstein has had a high degree of success in the US and plays the WARPED TOURS regularly, a concert that goes on in the US every year. Silverstein is just one of many bands that has its history linked to the 905 board. Other bands include Finger 11, TFB, Jersey, etc. The 905 board is a community of people with similar interests. Just in the way that communities and groups have their own post on the wikipedia, does not the 905 board have a right to have a similar post? Our group of members is 3000 strong, a lot bigger than many other groups on this website. -- westpointfan.</li>

Why do people show up with a one-day-old account and feel that they know better than everyone else on wikipedia what kinds of articles it should accept? I just don't get the logic there. For what it's worth, some people in the thread do seem to have the right idea, that an article on the music scene the forum covers (rather than the forum itself) would be a far better idea. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 01:25, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just slightly curious as to what radio station BoojiBoy works for, because I worked for a radio station in Ottawa, ON, where they not only had a great collection of the indepedently released CDs from many 905 bands, many of the DJs were very familiar with the 905 Board and likened it to their equally influential punkottawa.com.
<ul>
<li>I never said I hadn't heard of it. But the fact I've heard of it doesn't mean that it passes <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoojiBoy_02a7.html" title="User:BoojiBoy">BoojiBoy</a> 01:26, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Boojiboy... what are your reasons for it not passing? you say its not noteworthy... yet you've heard of it. you've yet to address any of the arguments presented for keeping this article. i would be very interested to what your reasons are that it needs to be deleted.</p>
<p>oh and boojiboy if you had really worked with many of the bands that were mentioned, you would know about their strong roots formulated from the 905 board and would have a healthy respect for the community that they are a part of.</p>
<ul>
<li>I know about their roots. But let's review <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, shall we?
<ul>
<li><i>1. The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.</i> No internet message board can meet this due to the constantly-changing content inherent to a message board.</li>
<li><i>2. The website or content has won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation.</i> Nope.</li>
<li><i>3. The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.</i> Not that either.</li>

<li>To the person who stated it's nothing like the Seattle scene because they only posted 5 bands, I say this: Name more than 5 bands that were huge from Seattle in the early 90's. It was more the huge local scene, the coming together of people and the collaboration of different musical tastes that sparked the scene that eventually created a genre of music known as grunge. The few bands that made it big were just lucky enough to be known as the founders.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at this bit of history it’s apparent that the 905 board is reliving this exact situation. There are plenty of bands that have made international success thanks to the 905 board and the scene here is so tightly knit that new talent is constantly being brought together because of this board, it’s almost an exact repeat of the Seattle scene at the beginning stages. The 905 is the birthplace of the hardcore scene and will be put in history for that in the future and to remove this now is only temporarily silencing the inevitable. Keep this page, its integral to a small part of history. It’s not going to change lives but it’s defiantly made a lot of peoples better. Let the page stay. - --r0ssr0ss 04:22, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I am <i>blown away</i> by all the "vanity" comments made by wiki users with their own little wiki pages. All of you posting "vanity!!! delete!!!" with your little blue names make me laugh. I love wikipedia, and value your efforts to keep it current and <i>alive</i>, but to suggest that <i>you</i> deserve a wiki entry, when a community of 3000+ who have had an influential hand in guiding the southern Ontario (and Canadian as a whole) music scene makes me throw up my hands in frustration. It seems more like an stuffy old room you'd find hidden away at some university filled with graying academics past their prime, than a relevant new style of encyclopedia and experiment in democracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the calls of NOR, I find it hard to believe that just because a newspaper or magazine doesn't mention something, it is instantly cited as worthless. All kinds of people list us on their blogs, myspaces, band webpages, zines (that's an independent magazine made by a person or group of people).</p>
<p>This is part of a music subculture, not the mainstream media. Does that mean it's not influential? If you think that, you really are out of the loop. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnaX_b33e.html" title="User:SnaX">SnaX</a> 14:46, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>While the 905 board has spear headed musical movements, most importantly GRADE, these people jsut want proof before ppl site it. Grade DID start Screamo, thats the truth.That is the angle, but out of the 905 there are way more than 5 bands succeeding that use this board right now:</li>

<li>Finger Eleven ( gold record)</li>
<li>Idle Sons - EMI</li>

<li>The Video Dead - Stereo Dynamite /EMI/Stay Gold/Universal</li>
<li>The Creepshow - Stereo Dynamite/EMI</li>
<li>Jersey - EMI/Fueld By Ramen</li>
<li>The Fullblast - BBR/Universal</li>
<li>City and Colour (gold records)</li>
<li>Billy Talent</li>

<p>-In contribution to the argument that the 905 boards appearance on Wikipedia is 'vanity', I'd like to state that as someone who isn't a resident of Southern Ontario, nor Canada but London England that the board itself is nothing but a resource. Its appearance on Wikipedia doesn’t act as only a statement for those engaged in the Southern Ontario scene but countless others. I know a substantial number of fans of the aforementioned bands who have expressed need to know about the 905 scene and the board itself is vital to that knowledge. If the relevance of the bands who have come from this scene are being debated in terms of musical viability the commercial sales of a handful who have been birthed and aided by and from the 905 have surpassed 100,000 records. A number of the bands mentioned above have achieved success and acclaim worldwide and noting the relevance of the 905 board could be compared debating the chronicling and relevance of Malcolm McLarens SEX shop (birth place of the Sex Pistols etc) in terms of genre definition, for infact a genre was undeniable spurned from the area, and has affected the musical world and subsequent generations. In addition to this, as a member of the recording industry and the press, I happen to know several people in England who are also members of the recording industry and the press who have used the board for not only search of new artists, indications as to youth culture interest progressions. The inclusion of the history of the 905 board on Wikipedia can do nothing but aide work of these people, as it is futile to make use of knowledge gained from a subject without knowing its history. Only those who can argue otherwise can deny the fact that as Wikipedia is a resource for cultural and intellectual research the 905 boards appearance on it can afford to go amiss. -Zara</p>

<li>I didn't say that it was a quid pro quo. Just that he has verifiable info and an actual career rather than just a few fans.

<dd>Oh, the American Psychoanalytic Association is definitely highly notable. But these types of awards from notable professional organizations are pretty minor. If Porcerelli had given an APA keynote or something, I'd vote keep on that alone. And I quite agree that it's foolish to keep those articles that just amount to a small, cultish fanbase... I'm sure Procerelli is a perfectly fine therapist and teacher, who in the end has done more of significance than someone who made a few web pages. But still shy of the "above average contribution to his field" type test. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 07:36, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>comment</b> Wikipedia's article on the Google test states <i>the minimum number of matches you should see if a term is not made up</i> is <i>Perhaps a few hundred</i>, that <i>search result(s) from Google are highly biased towards popular culture</i> (so a subculture or radio friendly artist may not be reflected, but that does not neccessarily refute notability, does it?). Most importantly, <i>The Google test has always been and very likely always will remain an extremely inconsistent tool, which does not measure notability.</i> Since notability is the issue here per the nomination, your reasons for marking this article for deletion are still unclear. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> 15:39, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Nowhere does this article or sources mention "college bars."

<li>Your insistence that I am not "calm" or that I am personally attacking you does not make it more true. I am refuting your grounds for nomination and the ill logic you are using to justify deletion. Notwithstanding the fact that it is clear the site is under reconstruction (which many sites will be from time to time, whether from a notable corporation or totally non-notable entity... rendering this point useless as a sign of notability), I still have proven notability criteria in other areas.

<li><b>comment</b> Wikipedia's article on the Google test states <i>the minimum number of matches you should see if a term is not made up</i> is <i>Perhaps a few hundred</i>, that <i>search result(s) from Google are highly biased towards popular culture</i> (so a subculture or radio friendly artist may not be reflected, but that does not neccessarily refute notability, does it?). Most importantly, <i>The Google test has always been and very likely always will remain an extremely inconsistent tool, which does not measure notability.</i> Since notability is the issue here per the nomination, your reasons for marking this article for deletion are still unclear. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> 15:29, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I would ask that many of the first replies be considered null in the face of very heavy article revision. Also, it seems that a crusade against game mods have cropped up in the past few days. I think that, if these articles are not welcome on the basis of notability (Neotokyo, as noted by NitenMuratta, has been featured in magazines, and on many (if not all) mod-related websites) there should be a strict notice concerning game mods or other 'in the works' projects (including those who have released public works before). Applying that same concept outside of gaming would cut down on indie bands who have only released EPs and are not signed, obscure artists whose paintings have never been featured prominently at official institutions, and many other similar circumstances This does not make it noteable outside the field of "gamers", but, as comparison neither are many articles on wikipedia because many people all over the world have varying interests (reference <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowen_Bridge_2051.html" title="Bowen Bridge">Bowen Bridge</a>). There are literally thousands of articles like that which are important only to the people that are concerned with them. I have no interest in such things (bridges), and would consider them AfD worthy. However, a bridge enthusiast may think otherwise. It is out of respect for other people's interests that I find them to be an integral part of Wikipedia's character. The beauty I find in Wikipedia is that it has a little bit about everything...I'd like to think it would stay that way, even concerning the hobby of gaming and mods. <a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 12:39, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It would be folly to consider the first replies null. I, for one, stand by my vote. GassyGuy 03:30, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As do I. I try not to judge based on what the article is at the time, but whether the subject itself is notable. Thus, any content changes are not entirely relevant to my vote. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 03:32, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The "very heavy article revision" appears to be the addition of more mods "under development". As additional vaporware does not add to notability of the original vaporware, my recommendation remains the same. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 07:40, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would argue that an official wikipedia banner made especially for games in development would mean that games in development are acceptable material for wikipedia (view the banner below the AfD on the Neotokyo page as reference...or <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Steel_6c5a.html" title="Red Steel">Red Steel</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spore_%28video_game%29.html" title="Spore (video game)">Spore (video game)</a>, or <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_Nukem_Forever_0d65.html" title="Duke Nukem Forever">Duke Nukem Forever</a> a game that has been in development for almost 10 years. This post was made purely for informational purposes only. Advertisement is out of the question as the material is presented in an unbiased and unforceful manner. Any advertisement is done through a plethora of websites devoted to just that - mod news sites, and gaming magazines. Neotokyo has used both. <a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 22:51, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>About the first sentence: There's a difference between a brand-new game from a notable company that has been anticipated by the entire gaming community, like the three you linked to, and an unofficial mod by a bunch of friends who got together and decided to hype up and release a mod for a very moddable game. I'm not saying the latter is completely the case for this game, but it's somewhere. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a> 02:46, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - As per Xiliquiern's statements. Mod's are as much of games as commercial games. statements such as "There's a difference between a brand-new game from a notable company...and an unofficial mod by a bunch of friends who got together and decided to hype up and release a mod for a very moddable game" are unsupported. Just because a game is not produced by a large company provided with a large budget doesn't make it different from anything else. Mods are in line with open source software such as unix, and would you even consider unix to be unfit for wikipedia just becasue it is availible at no charge? And if you had any background, or even a smigion of knowledge on the status of current modification communities you would know that a bunch of friends in a garage died many years ago. to get any noteriety a modification must be built by either many skilled people, or one highly trained person. I give you black mesa and Minerva:metastasis as examples. Black mesa consists of a world wide team of skilled users. Metastasis consists of a single person with a talent for story writing and level design. Both have recived more praise and media then a fair amount of published games. Would you think of them as less then games you have to pay for? <s>M_Gargantua 21:23, 19 June 2006</s><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.183.255.222 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.183.255.222_0270.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.183.255.222">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>delete</b> the arguments above for keeping sounded good, but didn't hold water when I checked them out for myself. Just becuase the university she works for writes an article about her, doesn't make her notable. And if we had articles for all professors that wirte text books (many of mine did write at least a few, which is a great money making stunt (my book is required for my class) doesn't mean she is notable. <a href="../../../t/r/m/User%7ETrm3_4ee7.html" title="User:Trm3">Trm3</a> 11:11, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Do Not Delete.</b> It is a well-written article, and it does no harm. It is not a vanity article, since no superlatives are used and careful attention was given to detail and objectivity. The article was written in response to a growing number of visitors to the weblog. While it is true that it might only be one weblog on Blogger, it does seem to be a popular one. My question is this: will keeping the article (e.g. not deleting it per the requests of Alphachimp et al., somehow inhibit Wikipedia's servers? If not, then I see it as serving two purposes. On the one hand, it informs the Wikipedia populace of an example of a personal weblog. As well, it encourages support and participation in the sharing of information, which is the purpose of Wikipedia.</li>

<li>'Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse) and who are likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field' - that's Bonnie Bracey; she's quite active in Education/Technology/Digital Divide related issues and commands a lot of respect for what she has done, what she is doing, and what she will continue to do. Perhaps it's not demonstrated in the article well enough; that can be addressed. Oddly enough, by deleting her entry the Wikipedia would be working directly against what she is working <b>for</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Bonnie is a <i>former</i> high school teacher.

In the primary and secondary education communities, she's very well known. And based on my own research over the last decade or so, I would credit her with popularizing the term "digital divide" in education circles, going back more than 10 years ago. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcarvin_7b22.html" title="User:Acarvin">Acarvin</a> 18:10, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>But what about the seminal character by Keith Moon in which he not only played a character called Uncle Arthur but also wrote the lyrics for a song of that name? That deserves at least an appended part of Keith Moon's biography</p>
<p>The article up for deletion has nothing to do with Keith Moon. Try reading it, its about a Simpsons character, whom isn't even seen, and is mentioned only once, in one episode, very breifly. Sure, I suppose if someone was to re-write the entire article to include all "Uncle Arthur" references, it might be more encylopedic. ACE Spark 16:36, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In addition, the information in this article is already mentioned in the Simpsons extended family article. Therefore - its quite useless.ACE Spark 16:37, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>there are several simpsons articles for obscure family memeber mostly siblings or aunts and uncles of homer and marge. i think they should be agglomerated into one article. however if they are not this article should stand. since other uncles/aunts that have only been mentioned briefly once's articles are not being dleeted<a href="../../../q/r/c/User%7EQrc2006_905d.html" title="User:Qrc2006">Qrc2006</a> 04:24, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>No, the fact stands - this character wasn't even seen once, it was mentioned in one joke. If you want it to be like that, then every single joke mentioned on the simpsons gets an article. And if theres other articles - well, there shouldn't be. Other more notable simpsons characters are COMBINED into one article - why should a once mentioned-only-for a gag character have his own article?</p>
<p>The information is already mentioned at <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simpson_family.html#Extended_family" title="Simpson family">Simpson family#Extended_family</a>, so having an seperate article about it is just redundent to the extreme. ACE Spark 08:14, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Article is pure speculation. There is no official confirmation that "So Excited" will become a single or that it will be released. Until there is such confirmation, the article serves no purpose except to reflect speculation. A section about the single did appear on the producers website, but that information has been removed; that leads to debate about whether it was/is ever planned for release, about whether Virgin has taken down the info to conceal the release until nearer the time or whether it was just wrong information. Regardless, that debate is again, speculation. <a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimmers_934f.html" title="User:Rimmers">Rimmers</a> 14:45, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Khia's website did confirm that this will be a single... and alot of information has been released about this song (producer, music type, and has even been reviewed by SOHH). None of that would have happened for just an album cut. So what damage is it doing being on here?

<li><b>Comment</b> Can you show me where the article says that he is notable? It reads like a CV --- it merely highlights some of the notablish things this person has done. I've done many things that I like to think are notable, and I've put them in my CV. Does that mean I can make an article out of my CV&#160;? Johndarrington
<ul>
<li>Highlighting notablish things is an assertion of notability. Debatable claims come here. CSD deleters and reviewers aren't supposed to evaluate those claims, that is our job. There are enough published works mentioned that overturning the CSD was clearly the right decision. The below comment by <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> is the sort of sound research that we should be doing - looking at the claims and seeing if they are 1) true and 2) important enough to have an article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:04, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually it does - it says it's a real place. That's usually enough by WP's notability standards. Consider that many of the places with WP articles simply say something like "X is a village in Peru." - they meet the criteria of being real, verifiable places. That, coupled with the half-million plus google hits for Seaport Village should indicate some notability. If I lived nearer to it, no doubt I could add more, hence my comment that someone from SoCal would be better placed to add to it - but the fact that I've even heard about the place (I live in New Zealand) should indicate that it's notable enough for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 01:52, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I don't want to speedy delete it because I think that Tony the Tiger is implicitly questioning the speedy by recreating it (he probably just doesn't know the rules).

<li><b>Delete</b>. This guy has done this sort of thing on several websites, and it is nothing more than self-promotion. He is only a notable person in his own mind. He just really likes to talk about himself.</li>
<li><b>several websites?</b> I have a webpage and a myspace page both listed on the wikipedia page. The only prior page was a webpage at the University of Chicago, that no longer exists for obvious reasons. As per <i>self-promotion</i> I would love to post the resources I include on my webpage here. If I could put my myspace video here it would be great.</li>
<li><b>Several</b>. <i>adj.</i> Being of a number more than two or three but not many: several miles away. You conveniently left out your hundreds of self-promoting posts on the Motley Fool inlcuding the ones asking us to come here and support you in this endeavor. Give it up. You stated it best yourself when you said "Apparently, I am more unremarkable than I believe myself to be." You obviously get it, but just like trying to buck the system, like when you continue to get citations for using dangerous weapons in public places and then try to argue that they are not weapons, but farm implements. And don't even get me started on your vast knowledge of "unwritten international law."</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with Richardcavell. By recreating its importance is being asserted and it should be send through AfD rather than speedy delete - by my minimal understanding of your own policies. However I agree its non-notable and vanity and should be deleted. 'Beach personalities' aren't in encyclopedias unless they're particularly notable in some substantial way. But if you want to maintain the integrity of your own policies, so you can continue to enforce them, send it to AfD and not Speedy. Just my opinion.</li>
<li>I am looking up other minor celebrities and find it notable how high the wikipedia notoriety standards are. E.G., <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathy_Brock_f44a.html" title="Kathy Brock">Kathy Brock</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephanie_Abrams_0204.html" title="Stephanie Abrams">Stephanie Abrams</a>, are good examples. I will accept a decision either way but hope to be considered as long as Kathy Brock seems to have been.</li>

<p><b>Delete</b>, article on a small fraction of an Italian municipality.

<li><b>Keep</b>. There are plenty of other towns on Wikipedia with smaller populations than this.

<li>My default votes on towns, cities or villages is to keep as real places with communities of interest. However, there seems to be verifiabilty problems. I get 29 Google hits for this place with little verifiable information among the results. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Rosegaferro&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Rosegaferro&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. The top hits are Wikipedia and a mirror article on Answers.com and there is nothing else that verifies it. A search of various databases subscribed to my local public library came up with nothing. A search of Google Books does rather better but most of the hits are in Italian. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=Rosegaferro&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=Rosegaferro&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> It seems to be mentioned in the list of Italian postcodes. For now, I vote to keep and I hope someone who speaks Italian can translate some of the sources and use it to expand the article. <b>Keep</b> and hopefully expand. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 10:09, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I speak Italian and I looked the book sources you find: a pair are list of postcodes, all the other books mention Rosegaferro because Regiments of the Austrian-Hungarian Army moved there during the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austro-Sardinian_War_7522.html" title="Austro-Sardinian War">Austro-Sardinian War</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1859.html" title="1859">1859</a>.</dd>
<dd>I'm wondering if it's worth to keep a lot of minimal stub all of this kind: <i>X is a fraction of the municipality of Y. Inhabitants are Z (esteem)</i>. Most of them in my opinion have no chance to be expanded. These kind of articles are linked only by the main article on their municipality. What does this article tell us more that couldn't be write in the municipality article? An estimated number of inhabitants? It could be easily put in a box in the main article.--<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDani_7C3_7b1d.html" title="User:Dani 7C3">Dani 7C3</a> 11:38, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page is only hanging on by a thread. it's only justification for being in existance is for three songs, one which was at number forty nine on the Billboard Hot 100 music chart, and the other two were number ones in 1979 on the Hot Dance/Music Club Play Chart. This article is WAY too short. It is a waste of space. Normally I will look for alternatives, but this article has no external links, and two ambiguous wikipedia links. The article is rarely viewed, and has been edited minimal times. It should be deleted, in my opinion. <a href="../../../p/a/a/User%7EPaaerduag_7f72.html" title="User:Paaerduag">Paaerduag</a> 11:06, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

I question his motivation for nominating <a href="../../../v/o/y/Voyage_%28band%29.html" title="Voyage (band)">Voyage (band)</a> for deletion, as it is obvious he wants the search term "Voyage" to point directly to his chosen article, rather than to a disambiguation page.

<li>I am REALLY sorry about this misunderstanding everyone. I thought that if there were two articles sharing a common name and that one article was larger and the other was tiny, the major article popped up when the common name was typed into search, and then there was a link in italics to the smaller article. 'eo' seems to think this is wrong, and perhaps it is. anyway, that IS NOT my reason for nominating 'voyage (band)' for deletion. Voyage (band) is a stub, and it is only because of its name similarity to the article that I created, about the Voyage PC game, that i noticed that it is incredibly short and probably not a worthy article. it may have 3 songs, but honestly, is it worth keeping, seeming that it doesn't even have a meagre 5 lines? in my opinion, it is not worth keeping. I swear that this is not a vendetta against the article or its creators, but merely a justified AFD based on the article itself.

<li><b>Comment</b> It's paaerduag here, the person who started this AFD. I know that the article complies with WP:MUSIC, and people keep saying that the band is notable. why, then, is it's page so short? surely such a famous band deserves more than a few lines? that is why i question exactly how famous this band is. I, personally, have never heard it referenced in pop culture. now maybe that's because I don't get out enough, or maybe it's because it isn't that famous anymore. I understand the above comments, but is this article really serving a purpose? I mean, an article should provide a DECENT amount of information. this provides minimal. if it is truly a famous band, why not expand? but right now it seems remarkably unremarkable. --<a href="../../../p/a/a/User%7EPaaerduag_7f72.html" title="User:Paaerduag">Paaerduag</a> 09:39, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just becasue it's short doesn't mean it should be deleted. It can just be expanded when someone familiar with the subject comes along.

<dd>Agreed. The quality or length of the current article is not of the slightest relevance. And AfD addresses whether the topic itself is notable. I think I vaguely remember hearing of this band some years ago, personally, but whatever radio station Paaerduag or I happened to have tuned to doesn't matter if they had some decent chart showings, which they seem to have. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 17:31, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>DELETE</b> - How is this relevant? This is a page about a particular family in India. I don't think it is of any interest for 99.99% of wikipedia users.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> - Just because it doesnt interest you, doesnt mean that it wont interest others. Wikipedia's aim was to create a site that provides information that will unite people all across the world. Paliam is not only a family but it is a famous tharavaadu, just like Earls and Barons in England. 220.238.193.217 20:23, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> - Actually, it's pretty relevant. The Paliam family features prominently in Kerala history. This article has been linked to "List of Nair Tharavadus"; another Wikipedia article, which aims to provide information about different Nair tharavaadus.. A tharavadu is similar to a "house" in European countries and the Paliath Achan would be similar to a Baron or a Earl. I fail to see where you got your statistic about this being "uninteresting" for 99.99% of Wikipedia users. Wikipedia tries to provide information about many different things to different people and I don't see how this article is an exception; and I don't say it just because I happen to be from that family - I feel that it is an important part of Kerala history and that it is something that other people would like to know about. --<a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivin_8731.html" title="User:Vivin">Vivin Paliath (&lt;span style="color:green" lang="ml"&gt;വിവിന് പാലിയത്&lt;/span&gt;)</a> 15:23, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Why keep?</b> Where Vivin talks about keeping this article because it is an important part of Kerala History, there are many more important events, people, instances that are of far greater importance and probably include more people than just of one family in Kerala's history.

<li><b>Keep</b> As the designer of the article titled "List of Nair Tharavadus", my main aim was in accordance with the motive of wikipedia....to build a closer global community through greater knowledge. This is not a vanity page. This is not irrelevant material. Just because you may find it uninteresting doesnt mean that everyone else would. Many would find Quantum Physics boring, but does that mean that it should be deleted as well? Do we want wikipedia being a website with articles being present based on popularity? Many of the most unpopular things in life are the most important, and information and knowledge about the Paliam tharavadu (clan) can enhance our perception of Kerala history. Kshatriya Knight</li>

<dd>We have articles on family like the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medici.html" title="Medici">Medicis</a>, but primarily because the family created a bunch of individuals who were notable in their own right.

<dd>I did and noticed the occurrences. They still don't source the connection between Paliath and Paliam. The only links I found with both Paliath and Paliam are tourist websites that don't use them in the same paragraph. The one thing I can recommend is to rename the entry Paliath Acham, use the 300-odd Google hits to write an article on them, and mention in a paragraph that they're part of the Paliam family.

<p>Perhaps I'm entirely wrong, but I don't think that Bulgarian reggae is such a huge musical trend that it deserves an article of its own. (Google doesn't seem to think so, either.) I'm sure there are plenty of Bulgarians who enjoy and play reggae, but I don't think that's yet quite enough to merit an article on the subject. In any case, all the article contains is a link to Root Souljah. (I could've speedied this one under A3, I suppose, but I felt a little more comfortable going to AfD, just in case there's more to the topic than could be expected.

There are a lot of "repositories for images" on Wikipedia (like <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_e889.html" title="Flags of the U.S. states">Flags of the U.S. states</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seals_of_the_U.S._states_f4e6.html" title="Seals of the U.S. states">Seals of the U.S. states</a>, etc.) and these lists are certainly encyclopedic. Also, the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_of_links.2C_images.2C_or_media_files" title="WP:NOT">IS NOT</a> policy states that wiki is not a "Collections of photographs or media files with <i><b>no text to go with the articles</b></i>." (emphasis added) This article has as much text as the flag and seal articles (in fact it has more than the seal article). Sure, I would like to have each license explained (and I'll probably add that when I have time) but not having a thorough explanation is not a valid reason to delete. Now, the matter of copyright is an ENTIRELY different discussion and it should be handled elsewhere and on a per image basis. - <a href="../../../e/k/t/User%7EEktar_4af5.html" title="User:Ektar">Ektar</a> 17:13, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is a useful resource and not an "image Gallery". Has any attempt been made to identify if any of the states consider their plate designs as being PD, or is there an assumption being made because somebody just wants to see the page terminated?

I question the copyright issue: so long as the plate images are created by the uploader and dont come directly from the DMV's website - i.e. a photograph of a plate in situ etc. (admittedly most of these are not of plates in situ), surely they would be ok? With photos of issued plates the plate itself is going to be copyright, but is an image of it really a violation of that copyright? Is this picture I have included here in violation of copyright? The historical marker is was designed and made by the state, the text is surely copyright, but I took the picture of it and (if I hadnt donated it to this site) would claim full rights... <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickmaguire_79b7.html" title="User:Mickmaguire">Mickmaguire</a> 03:50, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>1.64 million. Let's put than number into some perpective. There are an estimated <a href="http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/research/projects/how-much-info-2003/execsum.htm" class="external text" title="http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/research/projects/how-much-info-2003/execsum.htm" rel="nofollow">sixty-two <i>billion</i></a> emails sent a day, so if people were using this on e-mail signatures that number would be %0.00258 of a single day's traffic. These google hits are from forum posts, which are of course a different kettle of fish. While I'm looking for a reference right now to back it up, I understand that the largest forums in japan recieves over two million posts a day. So if the fluffy bunny was a 19.2 hour fad on a single board... The point is that unless there is some <i>meat</i> to the google hit it's pretty useless. Find some sources, that's the challenge.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b> Religious Transhumanism is a significant movement that encompasses a number of distinct, futurist philosophies and viewpoints of what can be called a "religious" character, dealing with matters of ultimate significance in life. It has been in existence in some form for many years already, and is not simply a "vanity" creation of one person. As transhumanism itself develops we can expect further development in the religious sector, along with the need for further coverage. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikePerry_387d.html" title="User:MikePerry">User:MikePerry</a> 08:15, 4 June 2006</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Among the various futurist philosophies calling themselves transhumanist, the variant called Religious Transhumanism is a vaild one because it represents a distinct strain of thought, with more than a few adherents, that differs from the majority of secular transhumanists.

<p>In short: An MMORPG that nets a little over 200 relevant Google hits. That makes this one pretty much a poster boy for lack of notability. There's a lot of this stuff floating around Wikipedia right now, so I'm also nominating all of the other related little articles on locations in the game at the same go, and I'm just hoping I'm not missing any here. Anyway, here goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Age of Time Port Town</li>
<li>The Age of Time Woods</li>
<li>The Age of Time Wilderness</li>
<li>Age of Time Fort Bad</li>
<li>Red Crater</li>
<li>Treehouse Challenge</li>
<li>Log Challenge/ Gold Hook Chalange</li>
<li>Level 1</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> while I'm not in a position to know enough about SAM Learning to improve the article myself, I have attended a brief meeting in school about the site where I found many hundreds, if not thousands of schools across the UK are signed up to the site and a large number of LEAs have registered all their schools with the site. Things also seem to be growing. So hopefully we'll keep the article and someone will hopefully be able to improve the article to explain what the site is really about...something which can only really be done if you've properly used the site and I haven't really used it so far. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 21:34, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This listing has limited value.

There are an infinite number of mnemonics you could make so it is pointless to have a separate article for them.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Singles by notable artists tend to be notable, even if they've not yet been released. Note the creation dates of "<a href="../../../d/o/_/Do_I_Make_You_Proud_6eb9.html" title="Do I Make You Proud">Do I Make You Proud</a>" and "<a href="../../../a/i/n/Ain%27t_No_Other_Man_659c.html" title="Ain't No Other Man">Ain't No Other Man</a>." Also see the current article for "<a href="../../../c/a/l/Call_on_Me_%28Janet_Jackson_song%29_c722.html" title="Call on Me (Janet Jackson song)">Call on Me (Janet Jackson song)</a>." Also, there is a category:Upcoming singles which holds other examples of these sorts of articles. My vote is weak, however, as the existence of like articles is hardly a great justification for keeping one, but my gut says that there's no real reason to delete this one. GassyGuy 16:24, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Quite simply, there is no info here that isn't anywhere else. In fact, the main bulk of the article has been ripped straight out of <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberation_Transmission_cddb.html" title="Liberation Transmission">Liberation Transmission</a>! I don't think an article on a single should always exist; it should only be created if it is necessary. This article certainly isn't justified - get rid of it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.131.70.96 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.131.70.96_215f.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.131.70.96">contribs</a>).</small></li>

Further information on the single as its release progresses would be better placed on its own page than on <i><a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberation_Transmission_cddb.html" title="Liberation Transmission">Liberation Transmission</a></i>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: As has been noted, this is the third time someone tried to have it deleted, and both previous times the VfD failed. This is starting to look less and less like a serious request, and more like a "Star Trek doesn't belong in an encyclopedia" campaign.<br />
The article is not original research. People keep saying that it is nothing but fan stuff, hoping perhaps that people won't read the article itself to check? Because, in reality, the article cites no less that 49 different Star Trek episodes and 3 books. This article has more sources than roughly half the articles on Wikipedia -- if this gets deleted for being unverifiable, then so should most of Wikipedia.<br />
The article belongs on Wikipedia. "Star Trek" deserves more than a single page saying "TV series aired from 1966 to 2005, see MemoryAlpha for more details", which is what it will be reduced to if some people had their way. But more than that, this page provides useful and relevant information on the last Star Trek series, and how it fits (or doesn't fit) into the huge and rich Star Trek universe. It is necessary to understand the public reaction to Enterprise, which led to the first cancellation of a Star Trek series since TOS in 1969. Not exactly an event that will go down in History, I'll grant that, but then again, Wikipedia is not Britannica. There are less relevant articles allowed to stay on Wikipedia -- one need only think of <a href="../../../k/e/t/Ketchup_on_hot_dogs.html" title="Ketchup on hot dogs">Ketchup on hot dogs</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_neologisms_on_The_Simpsons_2683.html" title="List of neologisms on The Simpsons">List of neologisms on The Simpsons</a>, for example. -- <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 20:08, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>comment</b> If its okay with you two (Ritchy and David) I'm going to move the discussion stemming from Ritchy's point to the talk page where specific examples can be discussed and I'll leave this comment and put a note at the top mentioning that additional information can be found on the talk page? Just to keep it a little cleaner and more maneagable for people to vote. I'm not sure if there is policy against that, but I don't want to have some unwieldy discussion going on why people are trying to express their delete or keep opinions.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> It's OR. It's as simple as that. The nature of the article invites OR. There have been cleanup tags present for over six months and they haven't helped. This doesn't belong on Wikipedia, and for what it's worth it doesn't belong on Memory Alpha either because they don't endorse OR. It belongs on fan forums. I tried to clean this up months ago when I was fairly new to Wikipedia, but even my edit left opinions in (partially my own). This article can't exist without them, and verification of lines such as "many fans suspect..." cannot occur without linking to biased forum discussions. Star Trek should be on Wikipedia.

We already have a summary at <a href="../../../e/n/t/Star_Trek%7E_Enterprise_849e.html#Continuity" title="Star Trek: Enterprise">Star_Trek:_Enterprise#Continuity</a>, that might be able to use one paragraph (tops) about specific continuity issues. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 21:48, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No..its the nature of AFDs. When opened, they're left open for 5 days, but the AFD is so busy people often do not go back 3 or 4 days to see what was nominated then. After the first day or two the only people who generally see the AFD are people going to the article who may have a biased opinion and not represent wikipedia as a whole. Renominating the AFD, especially on a controversial subject ensures that you get a more general concensues of what wikipedians feel on the issue rather than it being lopsided. Not relisting the AFD leads to situations where you have fan groups muddle the process and hurt wikipedia because they're able to just show up in a force of a few and muddle the discussion. If admins closed properly and actually considered the arguments on both sides like they were supposed to instead of just tallying it up like a vote (which they'll claim its not) this wouldn't be a problem for many controversial issues. If you read the talk page you'll see that the artcle can't be edited. Its been tried and the nature of this article is that its opinion. There is no cleaning it up. Once you take out all the unsourced opinion, conclusions, etc. you don't really have anything worth being an article. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 23:04, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for your opinion and the informative lesson on AfD history and procedure. Incidentally, I see nothing particularly controversial about this article, nor do I think there is any potential to "hurt" wikipedia, whether it is kept or deleted. I don't think those type of scare tactics are necessary, nor do I think you score any points by attacking admins. The article has been here far longer than you have, and during that time wikimedia has gotten much stronger. I also think your logic is badly flawed concerning relisting, since if everyone relisted on a daily basis, following your lead, it would make a total mess of the process. You further claim you want participation in the discussion, but not from "fan groups" (whatever that means). People interested in a given topic, if that's what you mean by "fan groups", are responsible for contributing almost every article on the site. They should be allowed to speak. Their contribution shoulld not be belittled. In fact, you only want participation from people who agree with your opinion, and you feel entitled to argue with everyone who disagrees. Returning to the article, the talk page gave me no indication at all that this "can't be edited". If the topic is viable (and in this case "important"), the article can be edited. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:09, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article as it is and has been for the last year consists mainly of original research and unsourced opinion. That hurts wikipedia, which is why there is a policy against it. My logic isn't flawed. If the article is listed once and forgotten about, on the first day you may get a general idea of what wikipedians feel. I never said I didn't want input from the fan groups, I said that if you leave the AFD that is all you get and it becomes lopsided. Relisting helps balance the AFD and ensure a proper concensus on a controversial issue. It doesn't allow a fan group to stack the discussion by posting to their project page or any other method they may use to keep inappropriate articles on the site. They're free to speak, but this IS a discussion. Any point they make I'm free to counter as that is how a discussion works. To this point as myself and others have poitned out, there hasn't been a single comment made to counter the claim of original research and unsourced opinion. The bulk of the responses have been "keep it because its been worked on hard" or "I like it". These are not valid reasons to ignore <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. As to the talk page, not the talk page of the article, the talk page of this project page. I'm not the only one who has expressed the feeling that this article is beyond saving. There is lots of talk about cleaning it up when its nominated for AFD, but it hasn't been done. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 03:16, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There is no need to repeat your views on the "controversial" nature of the article, or how fan groups are distorting the process, or "hurting" wikipedia. Essentially, it looks to me like you are trying to engage in some type of vote stacking deal by flagging an article you nominated on a daily basis on the AfD page. It is unfortunate that noms feel they have to seek new ways to game the system. Other than that, regarding this article, your opinion has been quite clear. I thank you for restating it. I would encourage you now to continue the "discussion" with some of the delete "voters".--<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:36, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm free to continue the discussion with whoever I choose. If I have nothing to say about someone's opinion I won't and if I do, I will. When you are dealing with groups who can sometimes contain over zealous members, sometimes you have to be diligent to ensure a process is fair. For even mentioning that I felt the article wasn't encyclopedic I was attacked on the talk page. I'm also not gaming the system, I'm ensuring a balance to prevent gaming from the other side. I'm also not the only one who feels that fan groups will post in force to muddle debates. I might be gaming the system if I was out actively posting on people's talk pages and speaking with people outside wikipedia encouraging them to come here and vote against this article but I am not. I'm simply using the system laid out to ensure a proper concensus. Maybe you look down on that because with a proper concensus the article will be removed? If you think it has merit, I might suggest you go about editing the article to remove all of the original research, conclusions and unsourced opinion. However at that point the article would likely be too small to be an article on its own and would likely be required to be merged with the Enterprise article. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 03:46, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

To remove all of the opinion, conclusions and unsourced information you would end up with likely a very short list. Have a look at the TOC.

<dd>Surely, after spending a week telling us that referencing other Wikipedia articles is not relevant in this VfD, you will <b>not</b> ask us to consider a completely different website, will you? Is there no depth of hypocrisy and doublespeak you will not sink to in your quest to delete pages from Wikipedia? And before you retort "personal attack!", it's not. Personal attack is what you've been doing to every person who voted "keep" on this page.

<dd>My arguments and those of the others who have argued for deletion have stood on their own. And not one single person has managed to address the issue of unsourced opinion and original research in the article. Countering a person's irrelevant argument isn't a personal attack. That is called discussion. There hasn't been a single good reason to ignore the WP:OR and WP:V issues in this article. What happened at memory alpha only illustrates that this article isn't the important piece of information to the Trek community that some claim it is. Even though its completely irrelevant to the discussion if the people insisting on keep feel the need to bring it up, then something equally irrelevant can be brought up to counter that point. In 5 days all we've gotten from the keep side is "Just because" and "I like its" and "I worked really hard on it". These points thrown against WP:OR and WP:V are as relevant as saying "We should keep this article because I'm wearing blue shorts today". So if you want to continue to put forth irrelevant points and pretend they have some meaning in this context, well I don't think you get to have a monopoly on that. You were given an opportunity on the talk page to continue the discussion on the points of OR and V, and when the picture was drawn very clearly for you, you stopped talking. So I commend you for at least making the effort to actually try and defend the article and the point you tried to make, but no one has come up with a good reason for keep in the face of that, nor have they gone ahead and improved the article by removing that content even though a couple have claimed its salvageable. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 21:04, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The copyvio was only pertaining to the discussion on memory-alpha. He was just pointing out that they weren't interested in it even before it was discovered that it was a copy of the work from here, and considered a copyvio by them. The problem here is just the OR. If someone wanted to make a very basic and sourced list of the opposing items and include it as a section of the enterprise article (As it shouldn't be very long) that would be fine as long as it didn't turn into another bit of justifications and opinions, etc. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:59, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that is the way forward. So we would have: TOS Episode says A, notably Enterprise episode says B, without further comment. I do believe that this neutral approach can be more than a stub. As an example I will do a rewrite here of the Cloaking section:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Cloaking In the episode "Balance of Terror" (TOS) Spock states that such technology had been, until then, only a theoretical possibility: "Invisibility is theoretically possible, Captain — selectively bending light. But the power cost is enormous. They may have solved that. " Yet previous to this, the NX-01 encountered several races with cloaking technology, and even took possession of and used a cloaking pod from the Suliban. In the episode "Minefield" (ENT), the crew of the NX-01 encounters a Romulan ship with cloaking abilities as well as a cloaked Romulan mine field.</p>
<p>-Would we agree that there is no OR in the above passage? If so can we not do a similar job on the other sections? Thanks <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagic_Pickle_06a3.html" title="User:Magic Pickle">Magic Pickle</a> 18:30, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>clean up the usage of "several" its ambiguous it could be 3 it could be 10. The quote doesn't add anything to the paragraph it just serves to lengthen it, its already been stated what Spock said and it what episode. I'm also not sure I like the "Yet previous to this" transition. It gives the wrong tone to me. I'll think about that. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 19:32, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You probably do have that time. THere is currently a major backlog on the AFDs, and the relisting I did actually extends the AFD. It isn't scheduled to close for another 24 hours or so, but there is a 3 or 4 day backlog beyond that. We should also consider a new name for the article, because alleged is a loaded word, and like someone mentioned perhaps this could be made into a broader article to cite all Canon contradictions between all series.

<p>Weapon technology According to "Balance of Terror" (TOS), the Earth-Romulan War which took place around the time of ENT was fought using atomic weapons. However, the NX-01 is armed with futuristic 'phase cannons' and 'photonic torpedoes', and the Romulan ships seen in ENT have a similar armament.</p>

<dd>I might take out "According to" it makes it sound authoritative or correct. When writing try to make it so that you could transpose the two contradictions in the paragraph without changing how one might interpret it. Using "In" there or some derivative of that would be more appropriate. Its also unneccessary to put attention on phase cannons or photonic torpedos like that. Perhaps refer to them as energy-based weapons, everything about the series is futuristic. Something like this:</dd>

<p>Weapon Technology In "Balance of Terror" (TOS), reference is made to an Earth-Romulan War which took place around the time of ENT, it was reported to have been fought using atomic weapons. Through-out the series the NX-01 is armed with phase cannons and photonic torpedos both energy-based weapons. The romulan vessels are also similarly armed. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 20:27, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here is the link to the traffic rank. Looks like they cleared the information out but it is still listed. Now your reaction there is exactly the reason to have this article. The website was not anything like what the article claimed. Those lies were made up by Justin Berry to discredit the pair. This was a G rated website about being gay, nothing to do with pornography.

<dd>The Nashville Scene article does not assert that Casey and Dew had sex. It says that Greg Mitchel says that he was having sex with the boy. The closest it comes is "It was not always overtly sexual..." which is far too weasely. Kotepho 01:28, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per above. Merging the pages back makes no sense. The connection between L and R in English, or, more precisely, between L-vocalization and rhotic vs non-rhotic accents, is insignificant in practice and there is no reason to deal with both of them in the same article. It's like having both English and German history in an article on "History of <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Germanic_13e2.html" title="West Germanic">West Germanic</a> speaking nations". That said, a <i>real</i> <i>history</i> of the liquid phonemes, i.e. a <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diachronic.html" title="Diachronic">diachronic</a> overview of their development and significance mostly in Old English and Middle English, could make a meaningful article.

You say that the movie has "voice work from major Hollywood actors" but the fact that these so-called major Hollywood actors had to get voice over work in a Norwegian animated film should tell you just how "major" they are NOT.

<li><b>Strongest possible keep</b>. Is this a joke? Is a film not notable if YOU haven't heard of it? Perhaps you haven't heard of this film because <i>you don't live in Norway</i>. It is notable not just for getting a lot of press in that country, but for being Norway's first computer-animated film. Please, don't nominate any more articles for deletion until you are QUITE SURE that they are not notable. Remember that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a> - it is far better for them to have an article about a film like this than to not have it.

<li><b>Further comment</b>: I've just read all of the replies here, and I must say that KernelPanic does not come off well. Being bitter is one thing, but lying about your motivations and accusing us all of sockpuppetry is no way to get respect from others (unless you know how to do it well, which doesn't seem to be the case here). It seems pretty clear to me that this was a bad faith nomination, and your attempts to explain this amazing coincidence away were less than convincing. I suspect that the only thing you have accomplished is to draw attention to yourself as a potential troublemaker - expect your edit history to be closely watched over the next while, if not by me then surely by someone else. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 07:17, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Such discussion, if it exists, might well push the subject to notability. But provide specific URLs, not a vague assertion that such sites <i>might exist</i>. Obviously, many Cubans (and other hispanics) are perfectly notable, and have Wikipedia articles; as are people of many nationalities whose primary notability is outside the USA (there is a definite focus problem where English-language topics get more coverage; but I've never seen a genuinely notable biography of a non-English speaker get deleted... I presume Ms. Anderson is an English speaker, as well as Spanish, in any case. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 21:12, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That is not the case. It has been there from the very beginning; the initial version of the "things you can do" section was imported wholesale from the German wikipedia (not by me, BTW). But what matters to me is this: I've repeatedly asked people to review that list, and there has been no response to that whatsoever. As a result, Esata has been on that list for quite a while. If the language is indeed non-notable, then it should be all means be deleted, but it's not very elegant towards the person who wrote the article (who, for the record, is not a single-issue wikipedia and doesn't seem to be the author of the language). —<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>Uszkiełtu?</i></sub></font></a> 20:42, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>As a <b>serious question</b> (<a href="../../../e/s/a/Esata.html" title="Esata">Esata</a> was my first new article): most of the conlang articles on Wikipedia do not <i>seem to me</i> to fall under the catagory of being <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notable</a>. Also, the conlang community itself is very <i><b>small</b></i>, but as Wikipedia has shown, it is very <i><b>active</b></i> (example: see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Portal%7EConstructed_languages_dc7f.html" title="Portal:Constructed languages">Portal:Constructed languages</a>). Is there something I'm missing? What should be done with the other conlang articles (especially those edited entirely by only 1-2 people)? (E.g. <a href="../../../t/e/o/Teonaht.html" title="Teonaht">Teonaht</a>, <a href="../../../k/%C4%93/l/K%C4%93len.html" title="Kēlen">Kēlen</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanova.html" title="Romanova">Romanova</a>, Daïanuvukф, <a href="../../../z/o/i/Zoinx.html" title="Zoinx">Zoinx</a>) Does Esata's creator Pafu get minus points because he hasn't been as active in the conlang community as these other more "notable" folks? Also, would this have happened if I had written a good, full article using a template, etc. to begin with rather than just starting a stub? - <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoubleg_79f4.html" title="User:Doubleg">Doubleg</a> 02:18, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've slightly edited the layout of your comments as to keep this discussion from becoming a mess; I hope you don't mind.</dd>
<dd>The number of people who work on an article should not be taken as a measure for the notability of the subject. Although, many people do consider it at least an indication. Look at the edit history of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> for that! But constructed languages are a subject that many people consider "obscure", so you'll often see only a small number of people working on those articles. I doesn't matter at all whether the creator of the language is a Wikipedia himself! What does matter is that people don't write articles about themselves or their own creations - it is considered bad taste and usually is condemned as <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">vanity</a>. The philosophy: if your language is significant enough, somebody else will write about it.</dd>
<dd>Don't confuse the "conlang community" with those who work on the conlang section in Wikipedia. The former are hundres, maybe thousands of people who meet in several mailing lists, bulletin boards, fora, etc. The latter are just a few active wikipedians who share an interest in the subject (not all of them active conlangers themselves).</dd>
<dd>Sadly, I don't think it would have made much of a difference if your article had been longer. In most cases, AfD discussions about conlangs boil down to the question whether the language is notable/encyclopedic enough for inclusion. They rarely delve into the merits of the article itself. Of course, if it is a decent article that gives at least some indication about the significance of the subject, that will definitely help. —<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>Uszkiełtu?</i></sub></font></a> 10:44, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Reason 2 only justifies the removal of individual images from the page, not the whole page. Reason 3 was already dealt with on the previous AfD, and would necessitate the deletion of the whole genre of "Gallery of" pages on wikipedia. Of course it's not an article in of itself.

<p>I de-prodded this; original prod said "Not notable, Not verified, speculative." I think that's open to opinion in this case, so I'm bringing it here. This person has a (somewhat pedestrian) claim to fame, and there IS a reference, it's just not online. I say <b>delete,</b> because I don't think the claim to fame is something worth having in an encyclopedia; it's trivia. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:36, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I had several reasons for posting this... however, I must say, I think the article has a neutral point of view, is verifiable through the references provided, is not original research, and does not violate any copyright... how does this article meet the criteria for deletion? I did not see a criterion that said `trivia' could be deleted, and if `trivia' is a criterion, 99.9% of Wikipedia and all encyclopedias could be tossed out... things one is uninterested in usually appear to be trivia... back to Ms. Birnbaum... her tragedy is poignant because it illustrates the tenacity with which she pursued suicide. I don't care one whit about a `claim to fame,' that is not why I posted it... I posted it as hard data that our society's power to intervene and understand can be very limited. I don't think space is much of a limitation at Wikipedia, so I'm puzzled by a desire to delete even though I can see the viewpoint that this is trivia. I also feel that Piedmont, California is a pressure cooker for young people, and this example is important feedback for Piedmont to back off a little. I thought the main criteria was *verifiability*, and that is why there are references to 3 newspaper articles... should I scan them and post them in the article? Finally, this topic is topical, due to the recent film <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bridge_%28documentary_film%29_b33d.html" title="The Bridge (documentary film)">The Bridge (documentary film)</a>.... OK, I read the guideline on `notability,' and I must say I disagree with it... when petabytes of space are available, I think one can be liberal about what is given an article, particularly when the information is verified, neutral, not original research, and does not violate a copyright.<a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnugspout_c970.html" title="User:Snugspout">Snugspout</a> 23:07, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, the LA Times article is online, LA Times just wants $3.95 for it (added a link) ... but a brief abstract of the article is free. Or, if you have access through a library to Proquest, the full text is available. I read the `Importance' debate, I'm in the Wikipedia is not paper camp, and I agree that obscurity is actually a virtue... there are a gazillion web pages on `Important' topics.

<li>LA Times is actually not a newspaper local to the SF Bay Area, where the jumps occurred.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- what's wrong with having trivia? Wikipedia is not paper. It's NPOV, verifiable, references, what's the problem? Jumping off the Golden Gate bridge, like, say, going over Niagra Falls in a barrel, is just one of those things that strikes a chord in society.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Someone who goes over the falls and lives is encyclopedic, someone who goes over and dies is rarely so. And if such an individual was encyclopedic their content would be better relegated to a page about going over the falls (which exists) or committing suicide from the bridge (which exists) and not for themselves. To put it another way: No one will ever search for this individual. They are not notable. The event might be notable and might be searched for. As such, the event deserves an article (potentially), but not the individual. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKershner_cf22.html" title="User:Kershner">Kershner</a> 21:37, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Ms. Birnbaum actually jumped from the bridge and lived... one of, I think, 26 documented cases... and then came back and jumped again (probably)... the only documented (alhtough imperfectly documented) such case. I searched for Ms. Birnbaum in the LA Times archive and the paper index to the SF Examiner to develop this article; I would estimate that a few people a year would search for her: a small number, but not zero. <a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnugspout_c970.html" title="User:Snugspout">snug</a> 13:49, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

(I admit I am not very familiar with the policies, despite using wikipedia frequently as a reference.) It does seem a little odd for wikipedia to have articles on nearly all of the software with which Silo is commonly associated, and not on Silo or Nevercenter, so I was happy to see somebody make the effort to start one up.

<li><b>Comment</b> This isn't sock puppetry, the people coming here are coming from a forum post saying that Silo was being considered for deletion because it wasn't considered to be notable software, and there are many professionals who disagree and happy to say so. I have no problem with the post being changed to be less ad-like, I didn't make the article and I'm happy for the price info to be removed or other changes, but it was suggested for deletion because it was supposedly not "notable" and that is flatly untrue, and I don't know any other way to prove that than to have people who know about it say so or to state in the article that it is used by many major video game companies. If you're going to change your vote based on getting offended at this, that seems very unprofessional to me. Silo should be held to the same standard as the entries for Zbursh or Modo or other comparable software, so take a look at them and then change Silo's entry to match that. Seriously, I'm not trying to pull anything, please don't attack people who are new to this. Wiklipedia recommendation: don't attack newbies!

<li><b>Comment</b> I might not exist as a registered user, but as my IP states, I do exist in cyberspace. I am surprised with the negative attitude some people are feeling towards this addition to the Wikipedia. I have contributed on occasion to broadening the information in the wikipedia, without so much ado, and as such I feel somewhat let down that I am considered as nonexistent. Returning to the subject at hand, I sincerely believe that this is no publicity stunt on nevercenter's part. They are too busy to pull something like that. Or by anybody else for that matter. There is in fact a community effort on silo's official forum in order to provide unbiased, solid, neutral, objective information to the Silo entry in the wikipedia.

<li><strike><b>Delete</b>, article is more an advert than legitimate information on what may be an adequate entry-level 3d modeling tool, but in its current form the article appears to be more like ad copy. Mention of the price and comparing it to other higher end products seems irrelevant unless the author's intent is to actively promote this product. The first two links referenced lead to the same corporate website which further damages the impartiality of this article.</strike> <b>Neutral</b> <a href="../../../m/d/o/User%7EMDonfield_fe81.html" title="User:MDonfield">MDonfield</a> 23:27, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Some of my objections to the initial article's wording have been addressed. I also wonder whether the mention of companies using the software really belong in the opening paragraph, and whether saying version 2.0 "is soon to be released" is actually relevant for an introductory article. In Addition, the listing on the disambiguation page refers to the product as "powerful", which again gives the feel of a press release. <a href="../../../m/d/o/User%7EMDonfield_fe81.html" title="User:MDonfield">MDonfield</a> 10:08, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> To those who are familiar with Wikipedia and balloting against this page being up, please look at the article in its current state and, given the facts of respectable magazines having written articles on Silo (Macworld, 3DWorld, etc), plus Nevercenter's site being first on the list when you type Silo in Google, plus Silo being used by major studios, why the page shouldn't be up considering the pages that are up for competing products such as Modo and Zbrush. Feel free to change the page to remove any advertisements. We're all learning about wikipedia, not trying to pull anything, and apologize for any confusion. Please refrain from name calling. Thank you! Tplewe</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think the discussion here should center less on accusations (wholly unsubstantiated as far as an observer can tell) of sockpuppetry and such and return to Wikipedia's true interests -- providing factual and impartial info for significant portions of readers. CGSociety (cgsociety.org) regards Silo highly enough to sponsor a forum where its members can specifically discuss Silo, a forum comfortably ensconced between the Luxology Modo forum and the Pixologic ZBrush forum, both of which have entries here, and rightly so since they are of interest to many readers. Surely we must agree that if the foremost internet gathering of computer graphics professionals considers Silo of equally significant importance to their industry then Wikipedia can with confidence take a cue from them. Beginning entry writers and editors, in my opinion, should be given encouragement and specific suggestions for improvement of their entries (ala MDonfield) and never anything resembling scathing, uninformed put-downs.

<li><b>Keep</b> If at one time the Silo article was in violation of policy, it no longer appears to be. A well-intentioned effort has been made to correct the situation. This is as it should be. As such, I am confused by the intent to ‘punish’ Silo’s representation in the Wikipedia due to someone’s post that may well have been guilty only of an ignorance of policy. Where do we stop with this odd effort to remove the current page? Shall we dig up all the info on all those who wish to keep and delete the article and poll the web of connections in pursuit of some private agenda to either ‘character assassinate’ Silo or ‘evangelize’ it? Absurd. As has been stated, Silo is real software in the real world used by real people, and it continues to evolve and therefore is marching into the future with the rest of us (well, most of us, anyway). I fail to see why this article should be stricken from the body of Wikipedia based on issues that no longer hold any water. Further, I believe it would be contrary to the purpose of the Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> First of all, I was adressing the user above me, who claimed that the article should be kept simply because it is "real".

<li><b>Comment</b> Having waded through the arguments for and against deleting non-notable articles I do think Wikipedia should come to some reasonable sort of resolution to this debate. Not to do so will clearly, in my mind, lead to very many other disenchanted possible future contributors to this resource besides myself. If Tree Biting Conspiracy and others have decided that all CG related software other than perhaps a smallish handful as well as the contents of reputable print and online resources that clarify them for the CG community are non-notable, verification pretty much becomes a farce. And the judgement of the few on-the-scene experienced Wikipedians has thus potentially been enabled to run riot over contributors, especially first time contributors, without actually saying much about anything relevant. Nobody likes a biased encyclopedia -- and limiting bias requires standards clearly stated. Sarsi 07:43, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well since all external factors - glowing review in Macworld, as well as all other important CG publications, users at many top video game and special effects companies, and inclusion on the top cg internet forums - point to Silo being perfectly equivalent to Modo and Zbrush in every respect, I can't respect your comments until you go to their pages and suggest deletion also. You continue to give no response as to why this should be deleted if those aren't, given the logical obviousness of their equivalence. I am growing soured by my first wikipedia experience and can see why news outlets are starting to report its problems. All I'm asking for is a rational response to my question. How long does this need to keep going on before someone reasonable can make a final decision anyway?Tplewe 21:18, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> unless by the end of the AfD period some references are provided. Given the attention that local newspapers give to all kinds of trends and slang, if this is indeed notable there WILL be published information on this. If the author can't find any such published info, that means it isn't yet notable. The absence of published sources might not indicate non-notability in context where a language is seldom used for writing (Native American languages) or in areas with very low literacy rates. Neither of these conditions apply to English or the UK. I hope the author finds some citations (and changes the POV) since this sounds interesting, but as yet, it isn't Wiki-worthy. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 23:04, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The links to audio/visual sites such as Youtube or Bolt were there so users could hear examples of the work, with the out of time and out of tune acapellas that you had told me were my POV. The links to various pages within Mixstreet were to show the geographical locations of the DJs, which you had said need Citation, and also to show the software used by them, and their use of the logo as described in the article. The link to 'DJ Rankin's personal Bebo site was to show the large number of fans he has, another fact I gave that you said needed citation. I also linked to a couple of pages within 'DJ-Rankin.net', a site created by US based internet user who was struck by DJ Rankin's strange popularity considering the poor quality of his music. His site contains many accurate details and an FAQ regarding Chav DJ culture, which is why I linked to it. I hope now you will understand that although maybe not as reliable a source as you'd have liked, the information contained within these sites is proof enough of the facts I have stated in the article. <b>I am going to be away for a week, so would appreciate it if the article remained in place at least until my return when I will clear up any further claimed discrepancies.</b> <a href="../../../2/0/4/User%7E204080.html" title="User:204080">204080</a> 18:56, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, it is not a notable climate model, if it exists at all. I suspect that it was intended to ridicule Gore because of this statement "...taking specific temperature or ice melt data over a short time frame and extrapolating that data to the future" and this statement "Mainly used in the Gore Scientific Method...". I think it is implied in the first statement that predictions extrapolated from data over a short time interval will be inaccurate.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems notable to me with coverage in a number of different state and national newspapers. However, there needs to be more NPOV, both in the writing (there are only a few NPOV mentions) and in the references (I think only indymedia right now is a dissenting voice). Just FYI, I am opposed to the politics described in Protest Warrior but don't think that is any reason for me to vote to delete it (not that I'm implying that its nomination was motivated by political reasons). <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 00:02, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, while it may get some news mentions in current times, it is not notable enough for an encyclopedia that will hopefully be around for decades or centuries. A previous AfD nomination resulting in "keep" is one of the greatest obstacles to future deletion, so make sure that your nomination is accurate, thorough and persausive. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 00:31, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Is this in reference to my comment? I don't think that they are notable enough for an article now, either. Perhaps the confusion is my saying "news mentions". I don't think that groups that get news mentions are necessarily notable enough for an article, now or in the future. News mentions are part of some guidelines (like <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>), but the guidelines also say that there is disagreement about the guidelines themselves and that meeting one or more of the criteria does not necessarily mean that the article should be kept.

<li><b>Keep</b> notable organization. Use of Alexa is misguided in this case.

Rather, the group is known for its organization of counterdemonstrations in real life, as discussed in the sources cited in the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> for reasons mentioned above. It is a global organization which receives moderate media attention and is active in many protests. Also, as a side note, Ben Burch seems to think that media attention is necessary for a Wikipedia organization article, although a Google News Search returns 1 result for "White Rose Society", and it has a page on Wikipedia, and also WhiteRoseSociety.org 's Alexa traffic report is <i>hardly</i> better than ProtestWarrior.com.

<li><b>Delete</b> Protest Warrior consists of very few people whatsoever. It claims to be global but offers no proof. Furthermore, it has videos on display with CLEARLY illustrate that it can mount counter-protests no larger than two dozen people. It is not global and it might have a few hundred people in it AT BEST. The forums are also incredibly small, with only a half dozen users on at any given time. It is NOT comparable to Free Republic or Democratic Underground forums. It's not worthy of anything, half the people ranting "keep" apparently are members and want attention. For God's sake, they managed to round up less than 30 people for a counter-protest at the Sept 24 March on Washington. How is it even an organization? My local PTA could put them to shame in comparable numbers. The attention mongers don't really deserve an article.--Grebrook 06:14, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

Plus an organized right wing protest group is notable because of its rarity and the fact that it hasn't managed to achieve large scale support. It tells us a lot about the political culture in the USA at this time that there are "left wing" protest organization that can get hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets, but the "right wing" cannot.

<p>DELETE-- No recent PW activity of note. No counter protests to May 1 protests nor the last Anti War protests. "Chapters' such as the Los Angeles PW Chapter have more cancelled 'operations' than successful ones. There are college republican groups with members numbering in the thousands in L.A, and PW is shunned by them for their extremist Neonazi views and tactics. Counter protest activity in most chapters is dormant.

<p>A. What constitutes "vandalization?"</p>
<p>B. Do you have any substantive, confirmatory evidence that would suggest PWers are "vandalizing" this entry, or that they have created more mischief than those who are antagonistic towards PW?</p>
<p>72.68.163.158 06:34, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, the assertion that this entry is biased in favor of Protest Warrior is demonstrably false, as anyone who gave even a cursory glance to the links section would realize.</p>
<p>There is the direct link to protestwarrior.com-as is customary with these entries-an article/interview from a mainstream cable news network, a balanced piece by a well-known, reputable conservative newspaper, followed by three extremely tendentious, critical opinion pieces, from various leftist sources.</p>

If an article with marginal notability remains in the encyclopedia, what is the harm? Surely the damage done by keeping an article that is arguably non-notable is much less than the damage done by deleting an article that is arguably notable. Setting a high bar for inclusion invites this sort of bad faith nomination, especially for articles on politically-charged topics. Keep this article, keep the article on the White Rose Society, keep the article on Ben Burch, and keep political debates where they belong... i.e. <i>not here</i>. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 08:08, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>72.68.187.222 15:10, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, let it be noted that Ben Burch has voted himself to "delete" on the WRS afd.</p>
<p>He has also said that he did not believe he deserved his own Wikipedia entry.</p>
<p>No one from Protest Warrior-except for NCB and Grebok, who are not actual PWers-has voted to delete this entry.</p>
<p>Plus, many who are not from PW-in fact, many who are very liberal-have voted to "keep" this article.</p>

<p>Toicap lies again.</p>
<p>James Bond has not been involved in any "vandalism," nor has he invoked any "sock puppets," however you choose to define that very subjective term.</p>
<p>He merely alerted CU and PW users-as is his right-to the bad faith afd nomination of perpetual partisan hit-man Ben Burch.</p>
<p>You have no evidence whatsoever to demonstrate that sock puppets-which you have yet to define-are being used to skew the results of this discussion, or that multiple Protest Warriors have "vandalized" this page, not that you have defined that term either.</p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. There probably is more history that can be added than is in the article right now. I'm not sure what it adds to the article, though.

<li>The organization has been in existence <i>in its current legal form</i> for only three years; it goes back further under prior name/structure. History is a worthy addition to the page.

<li><b>Keep</b> State forensic leagues are not mere chapters. They have hundreds of events each year, thousands of participants and are the main way in which NFL members gain experience. It is like saying we should not have a New York Mets page, since we have one for Major League Baseball. In addition, state leagues sponsor different events than the NFL does. These would be lost if there were not state level pages. In addition, there is more to this page already than there is for most of the High School pages in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know if one or two people (Wikistar) saying there should be state league articles counts as there being "active encouragement" for these pages. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 13:18, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The encouragement is recent, therefore, active. Since there are not exactly a high number of editors working on article or the broader movemnet, I believe it is significant. --<a href="../../../c/t/s/User%7ECTSWyneken_8c3b.html" title="User:CTSWyneken">CTSWyneken</a> 13:24, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The information on this page is the same type of information that is found on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Catholic_Forensic_League_b242.html" title="National Catholic Forensic League">NCFL</a> page. Both articles have an extremely brief history, a description of events offered, and information about the tournaments offered. This article, however, goes so far as to describe the league officers, the individual districts in the league, the qualification criteria, and the champions in each event, all of which are not included on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Catholic_Forensic_League_b242.html" title="National Catholic Forensic League">NCFL</a> page. This seems to indicate that this article is, in fact, <i>more</i> comprehensive than national forensics articles. --<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckaroo54_51ae.html" title="User:Buckaroo54">Buckaroo54</a> 17:17, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Several remarks have been made regarding the lists of winners found on this page. If that is the main problem with the article, then can we not <i>move</i> that content to a page similar to NCFL Grand National 2006 (or delete it, if it is necessary) instead of deleting this entire page?--<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckaroo54_51ae.html" title="User:Buckaroo54">Buckaroo54</a> 17:17, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think this is a simple case of: if your own newspaper carried it, you regard it as notable; if it didn't, you've probably never heard of it. Apparently the strip has been continuing—the website has strips from 2006—but I (and <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoelmills_0f99.html" title="User:Joelmills">Joelmills</a>) didn't realize that, because my paper, and presumably theirs, hasn't carried it for years. I actually thought he had stopped drawing it. Marlette is an editorial cartoonist for <i>Newsday</i> and won a Pulitzer prize for his editorial cartoons... which I see our skimpy article on <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Marlette_9638.html" title="Doug Marlette">Doug Marlette</a> mentions.</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b> one keep vote was contingent on sources being found, no one was confident that this was verifiable. It's a bit irregular for a closer to do this, but I did a quick check and found nothing off-Wikipedia about this guy, even with a broad search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Allahdad+Bohyo+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Allahdad+Bohyo+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> is not optional regardless of a vote, so I think the decision here is clear.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think it makes more sense just to have a {{citationneeded}} tag placed here. The information seems credible: there are no exaggerated claims. The author has made a sincere attempt to present (mostly) NPOV and has also given references in the form of names of books. There seems to be no good reason to doubt the veracity of the material. It's true that more citations would be a good idea. However, there's a problem with finding Internet references to material more than a decade old especially when it comes from languages less commonly studied or countries that are poorer. Since I'm committed to the <i><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">WikiProject Countering Systemic Bias</a></i>: <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">WP:CSB</a>, I'm afraid that a delete would discourage contributions by those who are writing about such languages or cultures. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 03:58, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with Interlingua on this. Although I haven't heard of this individual and were he a man of notability, I would most likely know him and so, on the outset, I am inclined not to be favourable towards the article's worthiness to existence...however, as was rightly pointed out, there is a great difficulty in citing references for lesser known scholars and languages and if indeed he has published 5 books (which I have no reason to doubt), then that is a veritable claim to notability. That said, Sindhi is not really such an obscure language and I am aware of several scholars on the subject who all already have their own wikipedia articles and I don't think Dr. Bohyo is really of a similar stature. Nevertheless, I think that all this debate and discussion merely warrants a citation tag and little else. I think it would not be beneficial for the article to be deleted. <b>KEEP, but also keep the citation tag</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I havent heard of this man before, but that doesnt mean he doesnt exist. I will surf the web for this person's existance and if he does, I will cite some sources. If nothing comes up, then the article goes. <a href="../../../a/f/g/User%7EAfghan_Historian_d035.html" title="User:Afghan Historian">Afghan Historian</a> 05:42, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Even if sources were found to back up the claims made, the claims themselves aren't notable enough for Wikipedia, even taking systematic bias into account. The level of notability is similar to that given in a newspaper obituary of a locally well-respected but not especially distinguished or well-known minor scholar - there are many of these obits, in the West as well as the East, and they are generally not notable enough for Wikipedia <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 05:54, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep IF</b> the publication of those books can be verified in the next 5 days. (otehrwise, <b>delete</b>.)

<li><b>Delete</b>: I tried to search suitable referecnes, but drew a blank. The contents do not indicate notability as per our requirements.
