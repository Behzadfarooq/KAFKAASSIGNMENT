<dd><i>So, in case you genuinely don't understand, and not just playing dumb</i> I've noticed that bad writers often try to shift the blame for the confusion, ambiguity, and mystery they cause by insulting their readers. But you wouldn't know about that, would you?</dd>
<dd><i>Do you understand how this is can be interpreted as malice?</i> Sure -- if you <i>start off</i> assuming malice.</dd>
<dd>Quitting in disgust and coming back is proof of what? Well, that he got over it. If this is suspicious behaviour, I'll work up a (long) list for you of shady characters for you to watch, including <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">User:Ta bu shi da yu</a></dd>
<dd>I like the reasoning, though: he's nominating this for deletion for a <s>third</s> fourth time because he has a vendetta. The proof he has a vendetta? The fact that he's nominating it for a third time. Why is he nominating it for a <s>third</s> fourth time? Because he has a vendetta. Rinse, lather, repeat.</dd>
<dd>And the fact that he nominated this and not others proves what, exactly? It's a slight variation of the bogus rationale offered by hundreds of voters in past AfDs: namely, the whine "if the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a>/one-horse town/trivial-in-my-opinion-subject article stays, so should mine": the appropriateness of this nomination has bugger all to do with other lack of nominations. If this (in your view) double standard upsets you, give me a list of other candidate articles, those running on the No-Hope Party ticket in the Riding of BFN that, gosh darn it, Spinboy <i>should</i> have nominated for deletion and I'll do the job myself: I've got some time to kill right and I can get right on it. Though be quick, I'm leaving in half-an-hour.</dd>
<dd>Maybe Spinboy has nominated this article for deletion because he thinks Neufeld doesn't rate an encyclopedia article? Yes, standards in an encyclopedia -- that's just crazy talk! As far as I'm concerned, if Mr. Neufeld wants free publicity for himself, he ought to check out MySpace or Geocities.</dd>

<li>I don't want to drag this on, I think we both made our points, but I just want to clarify something. I just realized where you got the circular "Rinse, lather, repeat" argument from. The five points above are not five individual arguments, that is, point 1 is not by itself a complete argument. They are a chronological list of events that ended in this afd, that is to say, one argument leading to the conclusion. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 11:31, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note</b>: Just a point of clarification - this article wasn't posted as an "electoral candidate" article (although I have been one). The reasons given for 'notability' were my roles as president of the Green Party of Alberta, and founder of the Revolutionary Knitting Circle (laugh if you want, but we've got chapters on two continents and have had mainstream media coverage on three - I'm most proud of my interviews in <i>Interweave Knits</i> and <i>Vogue Knitting</i>&#160;:-). --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrantNeufeld_99cc.html" title="User:GrantNeufeld">GrantNeufeld</a> 05:11, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's obvious that I disagree with that view. I think that folks with direct knowledge of a subject should be contributing to the articles here. I'd see a serious problem if they were the only ones working on the articles, but the presence of "many eyes" on Wikipedia balances off any POV issues that such contributors may create. I've contributed to a lot of articles on Wikipedia where I'm not "at arms length" (such as the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Party_of_Alberta_41f1.html" title="Green Party of Alberta">Green Party of Alberta</a>), and provided detailed references when questions have been raised (such as <a href="../../../g/r/a/Talk%7EGrant_Neufeld_d6b9.html#Documenting_References_-_Not_Original_Research" title="Talk:Grant Neufeld">on the article</a> being debated here). In any case, the previous two votes on this article have not found my auto-biographical contributions to be sufficient cause for deletion. As to the imposibility of auto-biographical NPOV, I encourage you to review the comments from Earl Andrew, Kevintoronto and gord on <a href="../../../g/r/a/Talk%7EGrant_Neufeld_d6b9.html" title="Talk:Grant Neufeld">the article's talk page</a> as counterpoints to that view. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrantNeufeld_99cc.html" title="User:GrantNeufeld">GrantNeufeld</a> 07:04, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>It's obvious that I disagree with that view.</i> Whether you disagree with it is utterly immaterial, since this isn't your website, and your blatant self-interest/vanity/self-promotion/whichever doesn't trump long-standing policy. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:08, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I wasn't aware that a formal policy against any auto-biographical contributions had been established. I know there's a general discouragement against it - but I have not heard of a prohibition being adopted. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrantNeufeld_99cc.html" title="User:GrantNeufeld">GrantNeufeld</a> 07:18, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> That is because there is no such policy. In fact during the recent debacle regarding Mr. Seigenthaler many people were critical of him because he did not simply change the innaccuracy himself and instead made a big deal out of it. It seems people desire to have it both ways on the autobiographical issue.

Refraining from autobiographical editing is therefore important in maintaining Wikipedia's neutral stance and in avoiding the appearance of POV pushing.</i> --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:31, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So what is it with the Canadian election? Suddenly it seems every no-hoper-party candidate for every one-horse riding in Canada thinks they deserve an article on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:08, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Sounds too much like vanity to me. As per anon user above, this is more appropriate material for a user page. <b>Comment</b> Regarding the repeated nominations, in the absence of a policy or guideline I think <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinboy_5d8c.html" title="User:Spinboy">Spinboy</a> is within his rights to nominate this again, although it does seem to be abuse of a loophole. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 07:33, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Grant is the president of an active provincial party and an <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta_Centennial_Medal_ee92.html" title="Alberta Centennial Medal">Alberta Centennial Medal</a> recipient. Reviewing the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_parties_in_Canada_e3c5.html#Alberta" title="List of political parties in Canada">articles for other political parties in Alberta</a> shows that most of the leaders (elected or not) have articles as well.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Absolutely. And note to GrantNeufeld, usually when coming up for a vote, instead of attacking your opponents, you might want to try to prove why people should vote for you.

<li>I'm sorry that you perceive my responses to other comments here and points of information to be "attacking". I'm not interested in flaming anyone (even though there are some significant disagreements here - disagreement does not have to mean disrespect). Please review my comments above again—I believe on close examination they can be seen to be talking specifically to the issues, and are not 'attacks' on any of the participants in this discussion. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrantNeufeld_99cc.html" title="User:GrantNeufeld">GrantNeufeld</a> 16:03, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, <i>President of Alberta Greens, candidate in Alberta general election, 2004) and founder (in 2000) of the first Revolutionary Knitting Circle (now an international activist movement).</i> are claims which make this individual notable in my view. People are allowed to edit articles about themselves as long as they remain neutral and while starting your own article is frowned upon, there's nothing forbidding you to do so. Anyway, neither of these are reason to delete an article. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:41, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. That this has survived earlier discussion is astonishing: execrable self-promoting vanity page of an insignificant that heavily exaggerates asserted notbaility. The organisation which the subject has founded, <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutionary_Knitting_Circle_04d7.html" title="Revolutionary Knitting Circle">Revolutionary Knitting Circle</a> should also be brought to AfD as inherently unnotable as well. Perhaps other Canadians here can chime in on having heard of it or not, but so far my running tally is 0. I find maclean's suggestion that this is a bad faith nomination hard to fathom. A badly self-authored page that is nothing more than a funnel for an out-of-control ego should not be on WP; bringing it up for nomination is a perfectly good thing to do. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 12:49, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Jim Harris isn't the president of the party either. Perhaps you misunderstand Canadian political party structures. "President" is a position within the political party's <i>internal</i> structure, who's responsible for running the organization. It's rarely, if ever, the same person as the party's candidate for Prime Minister (who gets termed "leader", but is <i>not</i> actually the top authority <i>in</i> the party structure.) <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 05:58, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Nothing has changed since the previous nominations. Grant Neufeld's edits since APril 2005 have been to add a picture and categories. Nothin POV or vanity going on here. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 14:50, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep'</b> I don't see it as POV (although it is a bit heavy on the vanity front). I also think that the repeated nominations for deletion will eventually cause it to be deleted, if only because the ones seeking to have it deleted will keep coming back, but the people voting keep will eventually move on assuming that once the vote was settled, it was settled. I don't see how an article can be nominated for deletion after passing an AfD vote and the article not changing significantly.

<ul>
<li>I have revised the article to remove the vanity aspect and make it more encyclopedic. In previous communications that I have had with Grant Neufeld, he has indicated that he understands and accepts that other editors will revise the article. This is no longer a "vanity article". As far as future attempts to delete this, if this attempt fails, it will be clear that future attempts will be bad faith nominations. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 16:33, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Mildly notable politician. The last AFD was a keep, and the precident stands. The only time a keep should be overturned, is if it was based on information that turned out to be false and/or unverifiable; or else if there was some kind of failure in process. The nominator shouldn't just keep redoing AFD's till they get what they want. Far to many articles and AFDs go without attention, because AFDs are clogged with these unfounded nominations. Note: if this article hadn't survived a prior AFD, it would have been entirely justified to nominate as this is a "week keep" level person. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 16:17, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
