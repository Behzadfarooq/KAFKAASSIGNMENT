<p>I originally tagged this as db-bio, but that tag was quickly removed and numerous contributions were made to the article by several other accounts and IP addresses (though both IPs and registered accounts have only contributed to this article on one article related to it). I still fail to see how this article fits <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>; the musical release cited appears to have been self-published (no entries on Amazon or AllMusic.com).

<li>"Why Does God Bring People into Our Lives" is an important body of music, even though it is comprised of cover songs. It is well known thoughout various musical communities I participate in. The album is commonly described as a brilliant compilation that is clearly genre defying and highly creative. Furthermore, the "Democratic Fascist" website is often cited in political discussion and is the cause for great debate on both sides of the political spectrum. Michael Haddad is undenaibly a highly progressive thinker whose talents span and push the boundaries of music, politics and popular culture. Removing this article would go against the very principal of Wikipedia and serves absoltuely no purpose. Detractors would be much better off spending their time contributing to society and culture the way Mr. Haddad has opposed to wasting energy on this battle. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.43.175.11 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.43.175.11_d397.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.43.175.11">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Michael Haddad's article should certainly remain part of the Wikipedia database in light of the cult notoriety of his music. The album "Why Does God Bring People into Our Lives" was often referenced by Prof. Daniel Eldridge in the class [Computers in Music] at [Virginia Commonwealth University] for its innovative and groundbreaking use of MIDI technology.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 138.88.152.41 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_138.88.152.41_4b2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/138.88.152.41">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>The concept of a non-notable biography in a world which clearly functions according to the law of cause and effect must be rejected. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.42.126.241 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.42.126.241_c38f.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.42.126.241">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>In support of including Mr. Haddad's biography on Wikipeida, I should note that his Hannity website is referenced in Amherest College's class Pop Culture and the Blogosphere--undeniable proof of his intellectual excellence.

All of you naysayers fail to recognize what it is really at work with this Michael Haddad. What we are dealing with is the birth of a Renaissance Man. Just like those before him, who were ridiculed for thier thought-provoking ideas that pushed the boundries of the human intellect, Mr. Haddad's work will probably not be truly appreciated until he is dead.</p>
<p>Also, I strongly agree with the assertion above as to the nature of this debate on the grounds of cause and effect. Did Hume teach us nothing? The whole notion of causality is made upon metaphysicaly grounds that are shakey at best. Unless you want to get into the dualistic metaphysics of Kant (well leave the epistemic or ontological debate alone), you simply cannot make such a claim. -johnny j. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.42.115.97 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.42.115.97_ea05.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.42.115.97">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The point of Wikipedia is not to find the next "Renaissance Man." All of these (mostly) unsigned arguments on the entry's behalf fail to adequately address the criteria outlined in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> "I've heard multiple people talking about him/his album" is not a verifiable claim to notability. Many of these anon supporters have his website as a reason for inclusion. The <a href="http://www.geocities.com/democraticfascist/" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/democraticfascist/" rel="nofollow">website</a> reffered to has a low (2/10) Google page rank and doesn't register on Alexa, thus failing <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Regarding the two points about the website being mentioned in a college class; I've taught classes at a large public university, and I certainly don't think that anything I've mentioned in a class automatically becomes "culturally important." Most importantly, Wikipedia is not intended to be a promotional tool for "up-and-coming" people, bands, or websites. <a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie">Jasmol</a> 16:07, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The decision for an afd without an obvious consensus should be handled by an administrator. Total number of votes is not the only consideration. In this case, nearly all of the 'keep' votes have been written by anonymous users who have not contributed to any other Wikipedia articles or discussions; draw your own conclusions from that.

<p>I'm not sure <i>what</i> conclusion to draw. All of the up votes are coming from different IP addresses.

<p>I must take issue with Wikipedia's rejection of the democratic ideal. There will be no <a href="../../../v/o/t/Vote.html" title="Vote">vote</a>? What sort of message does this send our troops currently in the midst of a bloody fight for <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_%28political%29.html" title="Freedom (political)">freedom</a> in Iraq? If Wikipedia ultimately "elects" to muzzle this debate on the advice of an unelected <a href="../../../f/e/w/Few.html" title="Few">few</a>, I will be forced to take my article to a competing open source encyclopedia that values such abstruse concepts as <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majority_rule.html" title="Majority rule">majority rule</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia has never been based on a democratic ideal. It is closer to a meritocracy, where the value of somebody's contributions often determines their amount of impact in a given discussion. Admins are given a higher level of authority as determined by their value (as percieved other project members). As far as Iraq goes, you might find it interesting to note that this is not an american encyclopedia, it is an english speaker's encyclopedia, so we likely have some Sunni/Baathist editors who are currently fighting in a bloody fight for freedom *against* the americans in Iraq. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 05:38, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
