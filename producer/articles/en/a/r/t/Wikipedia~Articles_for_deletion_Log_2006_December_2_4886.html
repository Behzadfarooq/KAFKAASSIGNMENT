<p>In view my article "Deprolarization radiation force theory" does not meet the wikipedia.org's policy, I ask my article to be deleted promptly. The author jxzj. 2006-12-04.</p>
<p><br />
This article's claims (esp. claims, since deleted, in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitation.html" title="Gravitation">Gravitation</a>) are so outlandish that I thought it necessary to follow them up. The creator's name, User:Jxzj, matches the initials of the first author of the cited papers, so it's likely she's the same person. That's why I called it a vanity edit. The cited papers do exist on cite-base<a href="http://www.citebase.org/search?submit=1&amp;author=Zheng-Johansson%2C+J.+X" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.citebase.org/search?submit=1&amp;author=Zheng-Johansson%2C+J.+X" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, but their only citations seem to be among themselves. The authors have also published several books, through <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova_Science_Publishers_af49.html" title="Nova Science Publishers">Nova Science Publishers</a>. The books are listed by numerous booksellers and a few (gullible) university libraries, but have not otherwise been cited or reviewed, as far as I can find.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: There is no legitimate reason to delete this comany profile. The original request reveals the biased reason for requesting deletion, namely that the person does not like the pricing of the products that are offered.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Mentions in publications that Nordost advertises in are trivial in my opinion, besides, both cater to the high-end vanity-stereo clique, which makes using them as examples similar to a webcomic using mentions in a 'zine about webcomics to establish notability. Neither mention is particularly pertinent to establishing notability in the wire and cable industry, either.

<li>Stereophile Magazine is not a trivial source. It is probably the most important high-end audio magazine in the United States, if not the world. It even has a wikipedia page <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereophile.html" title="Stereophile">stereophile</a>. If you feel that this magazine is trivial, then I suggest you nominate their page for deletion as well. In regards to the Tubezone comments on advertising, if you want to insinuate that the publications are publishing biased editorial based on their advertisers, then I would say that the burden of proof is on you. These are highly respected publications.Apblake 23:34, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I think it's fair to say that nearly every company that advertises in Stereophile extensively, sooner or later gets an editorial mention or article, if for no other reason than because their readers buy the magazine to read about stereo components. In <i>this context</i> I do not think that Stereophile mentions are useful for establishing notability in the electronics or wire and cable industry.

<p>This article could develop in one of two ways but in either case I do not believe it suitable for Wikipedia:</p>
<ol>
<li>It could become a list of <i>all</i> publications in law. Its scope appears to be all legal writing in all countries at all points of time. Such a project is so vast as to be beyond a lifetime's work. In any event, this would seem to breach <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> as it would simply be vast list of sub-divided publications.</li>
<li>Alternatively it might list only <i>important</i> publications in law. This raises an intrinsic POV element in determining what qualifies as an <i>important</i> publication.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a legal publication is notable, an article about it should be created. A list of those <b>notable</b> publications and their articles would then seem an appropriate way to present this information.</p>
<p>In of itself, this list will either end up being a directory or a very subjective list of which publications that it occurs to users to include as being important. Given the underdeveloped nature of legal coverage on Wiki this would be far from encyclopedic. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe">WJBscribe</a> 03:13, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I should have addressed the fact the page offers some guidance as to inclusion. I don't think this helps with the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> problem above as the criteria are very subjective- especially <i>Influence</i> and <i>Latest and greatest</i>. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe">WJBscribe</a> 03:17, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, as it is a clean list that, although it may need work, seems to be going well so far. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7ESharkface217_f705.html" title="User:Sharkface217">Sharkface217</a> 03:38, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. These lists, while somewhat subjective, are good to have. Eventually the goal should be to include publications that already have articles on Wikipedia, or publications which should have articles here. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 05:32, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete or Categorify</b> There are just far too many items that could be included on this list - consider the number of titles in your average law school library. I've always believed that lists which are necessarily going to be wildly under-inclusive should instead be deleted. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 06:22, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The term is <i>important</i>, not <i>notable</i>, as adopted in the science articles and successfully defended here quite a few times. There are many items that should be included in an article that do not merit their own article, and this is the place to put them. Many discussions here have ended with a consunsus or merge, and this is the sort of place they are intended to be merged to. We have argued this before, and I find it peculiar that we must reargue it every time. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 02:30, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yeah, when I nominated this article, there were weren't a lot of references in the article, so I thought it was just part of <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncient_Land_of_Bosoni_5d1f.html" title="User:Ancient Land of Bosoni">User:Ancient Land of Bosoni</a>'s soapboxing, but now I think it should <b>not be deleted</b>. Four other articles created by him were nominated and subsequently deleted (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Gojko_Jankovi%C4%87" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Gojko_Jankovi%C4%87" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Janko_Janji%C4%87" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Janko_Janji%C4%87" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Nikica_Janji%C4%87" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Nikica_Janji%C4%87" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Ranko_%C4%86esi%C4%87" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Ranko_%C4%86esi%C4%87" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>) so I just thought this article was just like those four.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Thats the whole point! The originator of the article sat down and watched the movie and dashed out an article on "The Organisation".

<dd>One of my readers, asked me to add my article to the GeekBrief.tv Wikipedia entry. I can see from the discussion here that printed copies apparently help lend some credibility. While it seems odd for Wikipedia to take that stance, and most likely it is me incorrectly reading a discussion list that is going to get me in trouble, I hope that is not the case. My syndicated column appears in a local Chicago area paper that reaches 200K readers. I added a link to the column's web home, and indicated that it is one of the most popular archived articles. Wikipedia has been mentioned in my column a few times, [<a href="http://www.dkworldwide.com/techlife/archives/2005/08/01/easy-as-1-2-3-right/trackback/" class="external text" title="http://www.dkworldwide.com/techlife/archives/2005/08/01/easy-as-1-2-3-right/trackback/" rel="nofollow">here</a>] and [<a href="http://www.dkworldwide.com/techlife/archives/2006/07/01/in-concert-or-in-studio-how-pmwiki-writely-wikicalc-and-google-spreadsheets-aid-in-collaboration/trackback/" class="external text" title="http://www.dkworldwide.com/techlife/archives/2006/07/01/in-concert-or-in-studio-how-pmwiki-writely-wikicalc-and-google-spreadsheets-aid-in-collaboration/trackback/" rel="nofollow">here</a>], both of which also appeared in print too.--24.15.79.244 17:14, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To be honest, I had hoped for a situation where generic street name pages would be established, with specifc named streets getting space in alphabetical order. Thus, there would be one <b>Benson Street</b>, with sections for all of the individual Bensons Streets, instead of one for each community. Obviously, I lost out on that one, and had to make due with with what was available. -</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> We should and have articles on notable streets such as Broadway, Manhattan; Fleet Street, London; or Canal Street, New Orleans. There is no point is creating articles about every street in the world, if they are not otherwise notable. The author has at least cited sources: a 1978 big book of streets, and has apparently checked that the street has not been renamed via Google maps and satellite views. But such efforts should be reserved for streets which are not of trivial importance and which have been written about. What is the approximate number of streets in the world?

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't really see a reason to delete this.

<li>I lean toward <b>delete</b>. As has been exhaustively pointed out in every school-related AfD, there is no policy in place for such things other than the usual notability and verifiability. Plus, users have a right to their "I see no harm in keeping this" opinions, but that is explicitly not a criteria for keeping an article.

I personally don't consider the Miami Dolphins all that important and I certainly don't care at all for country music radio shows or certain musicians, especially ones I have never heard of before.

<li><b>Delete</b> The fact that we have "tons of useless articles" is not justification for keeping yet another useless article. My fundamental criterion for keeping an article is that multiple separate people, independent of the subject, have written and published works of their own about them, demonstrating that they find the subject notable enough that they have gone to the effort of creating and publishing works of their own about it. This subject fails on that account. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green"><small><sup>talk</sup></small></font></a> 19:03, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> is not an inclusion (or exclusion) criterion—but it is an essay I think you should read.

But they have charted albums and singles on two continents. Obviously a topic of interest to more than just one local community! And it needed a complete rewrite, which I provided, not because "I like it" (for all I know, I'd hate them), but because it was a topic of obvious <i>international</i> interest. Your local fire department, I'm afraid, is <i>not</i> a topic of international interest. Speaking as a fellow Californian, I don't think it's of statewide interest.

<li>I live in Southern California, and there is nothing notable about this fire department, believe me. As for the list of articles that Epolk thinks are non-notable, I'm sure it's just a coincidence that the first few are articles I've recently worked on.

<p>I know that according the rules, re-creations can be speedied immediately.

<li><b>Comment</b> First of all you should be aware that Wikipedia policies are not laws. It is not the exact wording of the policy that counts but the overall meaning of what is written. As mentioned above we are being asked to take a tough stand against any kind of <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>. What that means in Wiki language is that we should interpret the policy in such a way that any content potentially representing <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> should be deleted. The fact that this has been speedied once before means that an admin has already determined that this to be considered spam. If you believe there were any errors in how the article was being treated you should take the matter to deletion review. We only determine if the article fulfills our policies, deletion review determines if there were errors in the procedure. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 10:27, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am well aware that it is about the overall meaning, but we seem to disagree what the overall meaning is. You're right that Brad Patrick said that we should take a tough stand. His opinion is worth taking into account as he works full time on Wikipedia, but in the end it's just his opinion. Except for legal matters, he does not decide our policies, nor how they are interpreted; that's up to the wider community. I think that "any content potentially representing <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> should be deleted" is not currently supported by our policies, neither in letter nor in spirit.<br />
I came across the article yesterday. What was I to do? I couldn't delete it because I think it does not satisfy <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>. I concede I could have taken it to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>, but I chose to bring it here, mainly because AfD is a more light-weight process. If it is decided here that the article should be deleted (as seems very likely) then that's it. But I'll take it to DRV next time, especially since I'm getting curious how wide G11 is currently interpreted. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 02:16, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, I have an axe to grind - against poorly written, unsourced articles on non-notable subjects. Call it a character flaw. Simply saying "this band is notable" does not actually establish its notability, it simply asserts your opinion. Can you back up your claim with a verifiable source?

<li><i><b>Comment</b></i> Simply saying that the band's "notability is marginal (at best)" does not establish that the band isn't notable, it simply asserts your opinion, which in this case happens to be wrong.

<li><i><b>Keep</b></i> - Though, I agree that the article needs improvement and may not be written in a perfect way, this is a notable band! They have been featured in major television shows quite regularly and they were in a few major Hollywood movie. In addition to this, their following isn't regional, they have followings all throughout the country. In addition to this, if you google this band you find that every bit of this information is in some sort of verifiable source. There seems to be some contention between the Doc Tropics guy and this article, because if he really wanted to simply make the articles better he could easily do this himself since he is obviously aware of how to source the articles. I did read all of this information in some form or fasion in other sources before I tried to find them on Wikipedia. Do a google, they are nationwide notable and are consistently involved at least minimally in major projects that give them a following. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Spanish angel987 (<a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpanish_angel987_d4f8.html" title="User talk:Spanish angel987">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Spanish_angel987_d293.html" title="Special:Contributions/Spanish angel987">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— Spanish angel987 (<a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpanish_angel987_d4f8.html" title="User talk:Spanish angel987">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Spanish_angel987_d293.html" title="Special:Contributions/Spanish angel987">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li>The article refers to an aspect featured in the <a href="../../../n/o/o/Noon_Universe_fff7.html" title="Noon Universe">Noon Universe</a> series of novels, most of which were not translated into English. Those that were have long since gone out of print, and thus hard to track down. The authors of this article had no recourse but to rely on the original Russian texts in order to create this article. The existance of the said texts can be verified through Arkady Strugasky's official homepage. As for claims of being non-notable, it may not be not notable in English-speaking countries, but in Russia, the work of Strugasky brothers remains fairly popular, which, in my eyes, is enough to warrent an inclusion. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrannik_71a2.html" title="User:Strannik">Strannik</a> 20:13, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>Speedy Delete</b>. I have no doubt that I'm asking for an ass-kicking here, but this entire article reeks of self-promotional material if it actually exists, or a <a href="../../../h/o/a/WP%7EHOAX_ea37.html" title="WP:HOAX">hoax</a> if it doesn't (which... makes a lot of sense). There's absolutely no reason to let this farce of an AfD continue; a handful of people (possibly even one) are the ones campaigning for its continued existence, and the strongest piece of evidence (the scanned newspaper article) is one of the most heavily photoshopped images I've ever seen. Between suspect sockpuppets, a dubious level of notability, and an unreliable primary source, I don't feel that this article should be on Wikipedia. If this <i>is</i> a real religion (seems to be a bit of a debate about that, but that's neither here nor there), an article can be written at a later date at such a time as the movement is actually <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">notable</a>.

<p>Janicism is a factual article. All things start off small, and Janicism wont expand suddenly overnight. The fact is, Janicism is a real religion. There are people who follow it, and therefore I maintain they have a right to have it documented on Wikipedia, which is why I wrote the article (which has since been expanded by a fellow practicing Janicist, showing it is not false.) I strongly believe that this article should be upheld in the public view.<a href="../../../m/l/c/User%7EMlc409_7c7e.html" title="User:Mlc409">Mlc409</a> 10:19, 2 December 2006 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../m/l/c/User%7EMlc409_7c7e.html" title="User:Mlc409">Mlc409</a> (<a href="../../../m/l/c/User_talk%7EMlc409_0a12.html" title="User talk:Mlc409">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mlc409_0b97.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mlc409">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<p>Janicism is a real religion, but these things cannot simply turn up overnight. We have slowly been expanding our religion over many months, and have decided to write an article to try to reach out to more people. Janicism is definitely not made up, as some of its views are documented in books - see "Mort" by Terry Pratchett, as seen in the article. Do not delete. <a href="../../../i/c/h/User%7EIchbinbored_7e0f.html" title="User:Ichbinbored">Ichbinbored</a> 10:23, 2 December 2006 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../i/c/h/User%7EIchbinbored_7e0f.html" title="User:Ichbinbored">Ichbinbored</a> (<a href="../../../i/c/h/User_talk%7EIchbinbored_29d7.html" title="User talk:Ichbinbored">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ichbinbored_b255.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ichbinbored">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<dd>Actually, the article doesn't state that "Mort" documents this religion. When refering to books being written about people after their deaths: <i>This is documented in the book "Mort", by Terry Pratchett, however the fundamental beliefs surrounding this are different to those of Janicists (who follow the Parable of Reed).</i> All that means is that "Mort" mentioned the idea of people having books written about their life activities, it doesn't mean that "Mort" in any way referenced "Janicism". <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 10:36, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In what way must it help? In order to show notability, you'll need reliable independent sources. Currently, the two sources cited are a blog with some funny entry timestamps and a website which says (as WJBscribe so aptly puts it), "I'm going to write an article about X and put it on Wikipedia". Leaving aside the blog, in what way is the website independent of the religion? That's the crux of the matter for me at the moment - when independent and reliable sources start talking about this religion, it becomes notable. It doesn't turn up here in order for independent and reliable sources to start talking about it. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:58, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can I ask what you would consider to be proof? Every source we find you manage to establish a way of making it illegitimate. Even if it's not. Annoying. If we didn't feel so strongly about our beliefs then we would probably give up as we feel very much ganged up against. The fact is this: <b>JANICISM EXISTS. Regardless of how many people follow it. We follow it. We believe in it. Therefore it should be documented on Wikipedia.

<ul>
<li>With respect, that's a false argument. Islam and Christianity (and a myriad of other religions, denominations, sects and cults) have attracted newspaper and/or scholarly coverage. Therefore, not only do we know that they exist, they're eminently notable. Janicism, on the other hand, has a dicey-looking blog, a website which says nothing more than "we exist", an apparently photoshopped newspaper article and an alleged YouTube video. The best that collection proves is that there is a relatively coherent group of people who call what they do by that name (and even then I have my doubts). There's no notability there, and there's precious little verifiability. If that were all we could find on an established world religion, I'd have no hesitation in deleting the article. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:07, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And also I thought there were no votes. It says at the top that the editors decide <i>not</i> through counting heads. So why are you saying that they have been changed if they don't mean anything? A religion doesn't have to be internationally recognised to exist. <a href="../../../i/c/h/User%7EIchbinbored_7e0f.html" title="User:Ichbinbored"><font color="red"><b>Ichbinbored</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/c/h/User_talk%7EIchbinbored_29d7.html" title="User talk:Ichbinbored"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 10:08, 3 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As far as the international recognition point goes, that's true enough. However, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia rather than a website about everything which exists. To use the hoary old chestnut, <i>I</i> exist (and in a nicely verifiable manner), but I don't get an article just because of winning the genetic lottery. If I want an article, I need to do something significant first. Likewise, were I to found a Satanic cult (an example plucked at random, although there are a lot of AfDs on these), said cult would also exist but remain obstinately non-notable until it had burned a church or two down or done something equally newsworthy. I'm willing to assume good faith and say that the religion exists, but it hasn't achieved noteworthiness yet. In terms of the "changing votes" thing, what was being referred to then was that certain accounts had actually altered what other people had said - changing a phrase such as "Delete this page, it is as noteworthy as the religion I've founded" to read "Keep this page, it is related to the religion I've founded" and so on. Pretending that people have said things that they hadn't is very bad form. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:23, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I, for one, would like there to be at least two newspaper articles to start with - regardless of the size of the festivals they're talking about.

<dd>I was informing you of Wikipedia policy, which is something you ignore when your article has one source, which is a poor quality scan of a newspaper article.

It is not clear to me the concept is as unnotable as claimed, although the burden is and should be on the editors writing the article. For example, the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_attempts_to_revive_the_Sanhedrin_5f9f.html" title="Modern attempts to revive the Sanhedrin">Modern attempts to revive the Sanhedrin</a> article notes that the current Sanhedrin-revival-attempt has claimed expansive powers for itself including a claim that historically only a Sanhedrin had power to declare war in a Jewish state and that it and not the Israeli civil government is the sole legitimate successor to those powers. It has issued a series of "rulings" on contemporary circumstances, developing a variety of interpretations of the Jewish law of war, including an attempt to develop an interplay between classical Jewish law and modern concepts such as international treaties. In doing so, it has opined extensively on the concept of milchemet mitzvah, for which it has developed a particularly expansionist interpretation. Here are just a couple of examples from a large and emerging body of recent work. It states in its "Declaration Concerning the Disengagement from Gaza" that "The commandment to 'inherit and dwell' (Deut. 12:29) in the Land of Israel is obligatory upon every Israeli government. In this regard Israel is commanded by G-d to conquer the entire expanse of the Land of Israel within its Biblical boundaries, including the Gaza strip."

<p>This page still doesn't really assert any notability. Its full of 'sources' but these are all blogs, newsletters, search engines or broken links. I believe that, unless some of the claims are substantiated, it fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.</p>

At least two of the voters in the Kafenio discussion had both contributed to the ezine and were together on the same Greek island when 'voting'.

<p>I have been annoyed before by your soap-boxing antics in AfDs, but linking a user‘s talk page, that evidently has been blanked by mutual consent of both writer and receiver really takes the biscuit around here.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>But let‘s not talk about rude manners and rather about your scientific way to establish notability. Let‘s take your favorite, ALEXA statistic‘s. If you had bothered checking the methodology, you would have discovered that these statistics are based on users who use the ALEXA Toolbar. And investigating the history of that bar makes it evident that it did not exist before 2003 in a notable fashion. Kafenio did not exist anymore at that time so there cannot be a useful ALEXA statistic. In fact, having a million downloads (which does not imply a million users) of the aforesaid toolbar still means that only a fraction of a percent of all Internet users surfing habits are recorded, whose statistical relevance is questionable at best. Besides that, on many sites there are instructions on how to write a simple Basic program to improve the ALEXA statistics on a site. That may be the explanation of why obscure publications, that never get quoted and never are noted by anyone, rank so high on ALEXA statistics.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The only way to establish notability in this case is solid library work and in doing that you might learn a thing or two about notability.</p>

<p>Notability is at best borderline. The sentence of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> which concerns authors reads: <i>Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work</i>. The page certailny proves that she is published, but the only two reviews it refers to are for <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lonely_Planet_3095.html" title="Lonely Planet">Lonely Planet</a> books to which she was one contributor. Thus, for now, I think she fails the guidelines.</p>
<p>The other reason for relisting is due to some of the problems with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Roberta_Beach_Jacobson_0587.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Roberta Beach Jacobson">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Roberta Beach Jacobson</a>, the first nomination.

Though there's no reason to claim that this was a deliberate attempt to subvert the system, it certainly calls into question the validity of a the debate as a whole. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 11:29, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> she's contributed to a lot of stuff, and many of them have independent reviews.

<li><b>Delete</b> I've reviewed Ms. Jacobson's bio and Wiki's standards for inclusion and I still don't see this article's merit. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> suggests that a person should have "made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field." In addition, an author should have, "received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work." How does Jacobson stack up against these standards? She edited her husband's failed ezine, Kafenio, for a couple of years before it went under. This publication was never ranked in <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=Kafeniocom.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=Kafeniocom.com" rel="nofollow">Alexa's top 100,000 sites</a> and its notability is also disputed. She also contributed short articles to Lonely Planet and <i>Chicken Soup for the Dieter's Soul.</i> (For her discussion of this experience see <a href="http://youtrue.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://youtrue.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">YouTrue's Blog</a>). All this put together does not merit notability. As far as <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH's</a> comments above about keeping marginal cases, if this lower standard is applied broadly then Wikipedia becomes a phonebook for this human race.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Speaking as the author, I neither wrote this wiki not moved it from Comixpedia to Wikipedia. I would be slightly sad if it were deleted, but I'm very annoyed that someone deleted my deletion notice - it makes me look pathetic. I'd just as soon you axe the thing so I can stop thinking about it. Seriously, I think my web comic is fabulous (of course I do), but it had about 500 readers when I was updating it regularly. I haven't even read the deletion guidelines, but it notability is at issue, I don't think I have it.--User:MisterWolf</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I was the user who copied over the content from Comixpedia. Original motivation was noticing a red link to it somewhere (can't find any notable ones any more). Heck, if this was going on my opinion of the comic there wouldn't be a question here, but yeah it currently fails the notability guidelines. I'll be sorry to see it go, but can't currently see any good enough reasons for it to be kept here. I'll copy over all the recent changes back to Comixpedia so we've at least gained a few improvements over there for future reference if it achieves the notability guidelines at a later date. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalfrey_558d.html" title="User:Palfrey">Palfrey</a> 19:04, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am not quite sure what is required here -- I can verify that there are at least half a dozen Swedish-language, nontrivial sources for this artist's existence and several different exhibitions she's had over the last few years. <a href="http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/kultur/did_11974843.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/kultur/did_11974843.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/kultur/did_11974843.asp</a> (one of the major Swedish daily papers) is an interview with her about an exhibition, <a href="http://www.karlskrona.se/templates/Page____30133.aspx" class="external free" title="http://www.karlskrona.se/templates/Page____30133.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.karlskrona.se/templates/Page____30133.aspx</a> is information about another exhibition, from the official site of the city of Karlskrona, <a href="http://www.vidamuseum.com/konstnarer-lidstromer.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.vidamuseum.com/konstnarer-lidstromer.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.vidamuseum.com/konstnarer-lidstromer.htm</a> is a page from a pretty important art museum, about her upcoming exhibition there.

<li><b>Keep</b> no i am not writing an autobigraphy, I am just thoroughly interested in art and architechture + technical innivations and I have chosen to complete what is written about Swedish artists, architects and inventors so far, and I will proceed with more entries ASAP - I haven't saved these yet since I'd like present a more complete picture directly. I hope we can reach concensus as soon as possible. Regarding L. Lidströmer she is absolutely a well known artist name, and I think any Swedish speaking user can confirm that after having seen net links in Swedish and paper articles. The artist's museum in the Old town is a little institution. I can add a list of articles to this talk.</li>

<li>Both those references point to the same document - the organization's constitution. This does not demonstrate notability. Our local PTA has a constitution, too. As far as Ripley is concerned, should we then include articles on every organization to which he belonged or attempted to join? Is that Wikipedia's standard for notability? Oh, and the Ripley claim is found only on their website, so it isn't verifiable (yes, I know its mentioned in an recent article, but the language is clearly copied from the website). <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 19:46, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Will your PTA's constitution end up in major research libraries on the other side of the country 125 years from now? The fact the this Society's did does indicate notability. Also, the website was written by the clerk-treasurer of the society, Robert Hanson, who is also the unofficial town historian and author and editor of a number of books about Dedham, including "Dedham 1635-1890: Examples of Things Past." The man who literally wrote the book about Dedham history during the time the Society was founded has credibility. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriancua_f765.html" title="User:Briancua">Briancua</a> 20:13, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Research libraries are crammed with hundred year old documents of things gone by - and most of them are not especially notable. The fact that most of the article's information comes from a single source, the self-appointed town historian, does nothing to add to the article's credibility. Indeed one might construe this as POV pushing since this subject certainly hasn't gained the attention of historians elsewhere. Wikipedia is not the place for the obscure or arcane. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 23:55, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Rklawton, as I pointed out on your comment on the talk page, there *is* a source provided for these claims other than simply the Society's website. It was written by Sarah MacDonald and published in the Daily News Transcript on on Wednesday, December 3, 2003. You can find a link to the story <a href="http://www.dailynewstranscript.com/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=18299" class="external text" title="http://www.dailynewstranscript.com/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=18299" rel="nofollow">here</a>, on the talk page, or, most importantly, in note #3 in the article itself. I might also add that on the <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights_of_Columbus_0773.html" title="Knights of Columbus">Knights of Columbus</a> article, which is featured, the claim that John F. Kennedy is a member comes from that Order's commissioned history. The is *no* evidence at all provided for the claim that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_Freemasons_840e.html#U.S._Presidents" title="List of famous Freemasons">17 US presidents</a> were freemasons or that any of the kings, dukes, presidents and prime ministers listed <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotary_club.html#Famous_Rotarians" title="Rotary club">are members of the Rotary Club</a>. This Society isn't nearly as well know, to be sure, but it provides two different sources. As to my "lack of commitment to creating an article meriting inclusion in an encyclopedia" you may wish to take a look at <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriancua_sandbox_cd04.html" title="User:Briancua/sandbox">my sandbox</a>, where I am compiling a history of Dedham and already have nearly 50 distinct sources. I'm having fun with Wikipedia, but I am certainly taking it seriously.
<ul>
<li>I'm not familiar with the KoC, but I do know that considerable evidence exists from presidential biographies and autobiographies, etc, regarding presidential Masonic membership. Unlike the organization you describe, many different and verifiable sources exist for each claim. And unlike the organization you describe, members can't simply pay $10 and make some famous person a member without their knowledge or participation. Your claims to the contrary notwithstanding. There is simply no comparison, hence this nomination. The one source you cite is simply a local newspaper relying on the organization's own website and membership as its source. Though this may demonstrate that the organization exists in some form or another, it does nothing to demonstrate the organization's notability or suitability for inclusion here. Lastly, you made quite clear the lack of seriousness you give to your efforts here when you repeatedly attempted to insert the creation date of this non-notable organization into the events section of the associated date article amidst the great and oft world-changing events in history: example #1<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=June_4&amp;diff=91314183&amp;oldid=90893871" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=June_4&amp;diff=91314183&amp;oldid=90893871" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>, example #2<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=June_4&amp;diff=91543830&amp;oldid=91356903" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=June_4&amp;diff=91543830&amp;oldid=91356903" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>. You did this claiming in your edit summary that its membership was notable (presidents and popes) - yet knowing that all members had to do was pay $10 to elect any famous person into its membership roles. Not only does this make the organization not notable, it makes it dead common. Heck, any garage band could do as much if it chose. Your assertion that this "membership" made them notable robbed you of your credibility in this matter. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 04:25, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Any society for apprehending horse thieves that exists in the year 2006 is notable, especially if it has been at least decades since any horses were kept in town. In addition, getting "more than 200 proud members... [making] a virtual who's who of political and business life" to shell out $60 to attend a meeting makes the society notable. I might also add that there are plenty of articles on Wikipedia that do far less to establish any sort of notability, to wit: <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights_of_the_Golden_Eagle_535b.html" title="Knights of the Golden Eagle">Knights of the Golden Eagle</a> or <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights_of_Da_Gama_d826.html" title="Knights of Da Gama">Knights of Da Gama</a>.

<li>The DNG format (which is distinct from the converter) has been the subject of articles in the photo magazines. It is billed as a single format that photographers can use in place of raw formats from various manufacturers (each has its own format, and some have several varieties) so that in the future software companies like Adobe won't have to support so many formats. What makes DNG Converter important is that it gives photographers the significant capability to convert files that are in the manufacturers' raw formats to Adobe DNG. Also, it's free. Free products are important even if not core products of the company. I don't know how to judge whether it's a "core" product of the company, but like the free Acrobat Reader, it's free software that Adobe issues in order to sell other software, such as Photoshop. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 04:18, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>(1) Just because there's an ongoing general discussion about what to do about station inclusion/exclusion, that's no reason we can't continue to consider individual articles. (For example articles on schools are deleted sometimes these days, even as discussion continues at WP:SCHOOL and WP:SCHOOL3.) At this AFD, please address this article and its subject. (2) You say I "don't feel restricted by precedent." This is a strange thing to say, given that Wikipedia has no policy or even guideline on the need to follow precedent. At the very top of <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDP_6910.html" title="WP:AFDP">WP:AFDP</a>, which you linked to, it says in bold, "This page is not policy." (3) Per what I just said, your argument to keep the article because of precedent is not grounded in policy. For this reason I urge you again to consider the merits of this article and its subject, and make an argument based on how our policies and guidelines apply to this article. (Hey, when you do that you might even come to a conclusion the article should be deleted!) (4) Every delete argument here, by contrast, <i>is</i> based on policy (viz. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> which is a guideline based on the policies of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>), so I have a hard time seeing how you can allege a violation of <a href="../../../d/i/s/WP%7EDISRUPT_3700.html" title="WP:DISRUPT">WP:DISRUPT</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> At least at one time keeping all rail and subway stations <i>was</i> consensus, otherwise there wouldn't be <i>policy</i> that they all be kept. As it is, I think the best way to deal with this, due to the number of possible deletions involved, is to settle the issues of subway and train station notability by policy discussion (as they did with road naming conventions) so a single clear standard can be applied to the stations' retention or deletion. Trying to solve the issue of station notability, which involves thousands of articles, by nominating stations one by one, or even in groups, would be excessively lengthy to say the least and excruciating to wade through and difficult to comment or vote on by interested parties. It'd also be a bloody mess. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 09:30, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>(1) "[There is] <i>policy</i> that [articles about rail stations] all be kept." -- Pardon, what <i>policy</i> are you talking about? <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDP_6910.html" title="WP:AFDP">WP:AFDP</a> says explicitly, in bold, at the very top, that it is <i>not</i> policy. (2) As to your the rest of your comment about "trying to solve the issue of station notability" -- No one here has proposed doing that via AfD as you imply. Oakshade has pointed out that there is a general discussion on station notability at <a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangoe_Wikipedia_is_not_a_timetable_0b2f.html" title="User talk:Mangoe/Wikipedia is not a timetable">User talk:Mangoe/Wikipedia is not a timetable</a>. But <i>this</i> AfD is about <i>this</i> station. As I said to Oakshade, even as discussion continues at WP:SCHOOL/3, school articles are nominated every day; some get deleted, some kept. The nominator and others here have raised perfectly valid concerns about <i>this</i> article, and I wish you and others would address those concerns instead of appealing to precedent, which is neither binding per WP:AFDP, nor convincing. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 13:06, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> To <i>you</i> precedent is neither binding nor convincing, but your arguments seem to be more about <i>breaking precedent</i>, not about this station... I presume you can't read Korean any better than I , how would you or I know whether it's notable or not? It looks like this station nom was pulled out of a hat, not by any familiarity with Seoul that would lead someone to believe this is a trival station not worth mentioning, fact is, I haven't seen any discussion in this AfD about the station or its neighborhood, or what might or might not make it notable. You say the precedent isn't policy, I say it's <i>de facto</i> policy, and likely there for a reason, and by general consensus, for the same reason all towns and state highways are automatic keepers whether they're sensibly notable or not: It avoids endless and innumerable AfD debates (and there's way too many AfD's, over 100 per day) over the notability of highways and towns. I'd like to see similarly clearcut policies on lists and schools, too, there's way too much time spent debating AfD's on them. The nominator's user page makes this comment: <i>"I think policies should be clearly worded so that anyone reading them should be able to understand the policy and be able to apply it."</i> Amen. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 06:27, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> (1) "your arguments seem to be more about <i>breaking precedent</i>, not about this station" -- Not so. Please read my delete comment above. I looked in Google and Lexis-Nexis and found no non-trivial sources (and was not surprised by this -- why should there be non-trivial sources about a subway station?). My argument to delete is based on <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, which is a guideline based on the policies of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. I keep having to talk about precedent only because folks keep bringing it up as a reason to keep (whereas it is not in fact a reason to keep anything, as I have been explaining ad nauseum). (2) Your mention of our lack of knowledge of Korean and Seoul is irrelevant, because notability is not a default presumption -- why should we <i>assume</i> that sources exist just because we lack the skills to look for Korean sources? Should we likewise assume that a telephone booth in Seoul is entitled to a presumption of notability until we can show otherwise? (3) As for "breaking precedent" -- the burden is not on me to show why precedent <i>can</i> be broken, it's on you to say why precedent is a good argument for keeping something. This is because precedent is not policy as <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDP_6910.html" title="WP:AFDP">WP:AFDP</a> explicitly says. And your characterization of precedent as "de facto policy" is demonstrably invalid: witness <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2006_November_28_Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America_89b5.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2006 November 28/Gay Nigger Association of America">Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_November_28/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America</a>, or the handful of non-notable school articles that have been <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchoolwatch_8fee.html" title="Wikipedia:Schoolwatch">deleted</a> in the past couple of months. (4) No one here has proposed or remotely suggested having the "endless and innumerable AfD debates" that you seem to fear will happen. Again, school articles are nominated for deletion every day -- some get deleted, some kept -- even as the status of WP:SCHOOL/3 remain unresolved. (5) As to your comments on clear policy: we don't have to wait for a WP:STATION guideline to emerge; we already have a clear guideline, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, which suggests deleting this article because of lack of sources. Of course, WP:N is not policy, but it is based on WP:V and WP:NOT, which are policies; and, whatever consensus emerges from the ongoing general discussion about station articles, it will certainly, like WP:N, <i>not</i> be a policy. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 14:20, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, precedent shows that railway and subway stations are notable. Just becuase this station's article is a stub does not make it any more or any less notable than any of the other stations of this or any other system. The nomination gives no reasons <i>why</i> the nominator believes the stations on this network are less notable than stations on any other network - "This station does not has not yet had anything interesting written about it on Wikipedia, therefore all stations on this network must not be notable, therefore this article should not exist" is not sufficient reasoning. If you beleive that stations are non-notable then the place to discuss this is the discussion that is happening about this very topic. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 18:36, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: There are several things which can be said. The station opened on XX-XX-XXXX; On an average day XX,XXX passengers (dis)embark at the station; Pictures of the platform/entrance/underground lobby; The station is near the Seoul municipal gov't building... etc. Some of these lend themselves nicely to a tabular format (open date), but not all of them. If the data for each station is shoved into an article about the line as a whole, it ends up as a cluttered mess. By having the stub, it also encourages others to add information about the station (someone who lives in the area may be inclined to take pictures, etc). Having a single row in a table would not encourage the same type of information collation. As for the factoids, I can't read Hangul, so, the SMRT website is not that useful to me, and I have no idea when the station opened, or what newspapers covered the event; or how many passengers use the station.

<li>My guess is that lots of valuable information is available in Korean. Just because I (or someone) doesn't know Korean isn't an indicator that no information is available. The concept of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">eventualism</a> encourages the creation of stubs with the knowledge that eventually someone with the knowledge (perhaps a person living or working in the area) will add details like the structure of the station, the date it opened, major housing neighborhoods or businesses it serves, the impact of the subway opening on the economy of the district, and other valuable information. Those are some examples of information that make an article on a subway station encyclopedic, and eventuality is the reason for keeping a stub. As the article on eventualism says, "There is no deadline." That's why I voted to keep it and let it grow. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 21:58, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>But you provide no evidence that it can grow with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> -- i.e. <i>published</i> -- information. I know lots about the grocery store I go to -- when it opened, its structure, the neighborhoods it serves, its finances -- but all of this is either not published in reliable sources, or published in routine government reports. Why would you think that there is "lots of valuable information ... available in Korean" that shows notability? This is, after all, a subway station, and I gather most subway stations in the English-speaking world, like this Korean station, don't attract much media coverage that we could use to write a good article. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 22:46, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"In the English speaking world" unnecessarily restricts your search. Whenever a station opens (at least in my part of Japan), there is a series of newspaper articles, TV news stories, etc. Whenever stations celebrate anniversaries (100th, 75th, etc) there are more articles. In Japan, there are multiple books and magazines dedicated to rail travel in general, and out-of-the-way stations are a common feature. Books which are essentially a compendium of all stations in a region, on a particular line, or of a particular company are not uncommon. Some of those books have information that even I would consider arcane (like, the fact that the eel <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bento.html" title="Bento">bento</a> is particularly tasty at one station). Some of that trivial info is already in articles on the ja: wikipedia. I would hazard a guess that Korea treats their rail infrastructure in much the same way, so the same sources would be there. In the case of Japan, Fg2, I, NihonJoe and others are fortunate enough to be able to search out some of the sources; but, until someone comes along with knowledge of Hangul, this article will likely remain a stub. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 23:17, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>You're <i>speculating</i> that there's non-trivial coverage out there. That's fine. But to show notability, someone actually has to <i>show</i> that there's non-trivial coverage out there. (I would dispute the non-triviality of some of the coverage that you say might exist (e.g. 100-anniversary celebrations), but before we even talk about that, we have to have the actual sources to talk about.) <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 23:38, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Actually, articles about subway stations are quite OK in my book. There are subway websites on some systems which have pretty good coverage on individual stations and people interested in transportation may enjoy such articles. Historically on AFD, there is a clear past precedent that they are notable enough. (As opposed to bus stops which are not.) But I do think that subway station articles need to be <i>articles</i>, and this page is simply empty: "Yeouinaru Station (여의나루역) is a station on the Seoul Subway Line 5" is not useful and fools the readers with a bluelink, making them think we have an article on the station when we don't.

<p>This article should not be penalized because I am a newbie &amp; learning how to code the site &amp; am very slow at the learning process to get info on this artist up here.</p>
<p>This is not a personal advert. I and other clients of Mr. Huszar's recognize his talent is known in Romania but is just now becoming known through out Europe &amp; the USA. His work is important &amp; he is 1 of a very very few humans who does this traditional Icon work. His stylized fashion is brilliant, he uses only those very expensive traditional media, like tempera and 23 Kt. gold leaf gold, platinum and palladium leaf Gilding. He has the works blessed, authenticated by several institutions in Romania.</p>
<p>George Cristian Huszar is a Romanian Living Cultural National Treasure. This is a great honour of few persons in history in any nation.</p>
<p>There are many pages for artists, both dead &amp; contemporary; Famous &amp; not so famous. George Cristian Huszar is a noteworthy artist &amp; it would be silly to delete this.</p>
<p>I find this article contains the ONLY picture of the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Reverse_Painting_on_Glass_04fa.html" title="Reverse Painting on Glass">Reverse Painting on Glass</a> process. It is also 1 of the few contemporary Icon pictures on Wikipedia. His work is important to the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_icons.html" title="Romanian icons">Romanian icons</a> genre and has been recognized as such the the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_Orthodox_Church_3851.html" title="Romanian Orthodox Church">Romanian Orthodox Church</a>.</p>
<p>Art &amp; articles of interest are subjective. This article is educational, informative &amp; I don't understand what would make someone go out of their way to want to delete this.</p>

I don't want to incorrectly add anything that isn't true. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/d/e/User%7EGDeCourcy_9162.html" title="User:GDeCourcy">GDeCourcy</a> (<a href="../../../g/d/e/User_talk%7EGDeCourcy_b27c.html" title="User talk:GDeCourcy">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GDeCourcy_6117.html" title="Special:Contributions/GDeCourcy">contribs</a>).</small> <small>Author of the article under discussion.</small></p>

<p>If anyone knows how to make the title of the actual article page "George Cristian Huszar" &amp; then have a redirect from "George Huszar" that would greatly be appreciated. Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> His awards and the places where he has exhibited add up, I think, to a certain level of notability. They're not <i>sourced</i> and that is a problem, but the solution is to find sources, not delete the article (which also need to be edited for tone). The examples shown of his works are quite good, which of course doesn't matter, except that artists who are <i>good</i> are more likely to have notability and increase it over time. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 16:08, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Where or how do I add source info, is that a template, a code, another page that links to this one etc.. my sources were mentioned are the newspaper articles, the Church, the seals of recognition from the backs of his works, his honors etc.. but I don't know how else to list that than how I put then in the article.</p>
<p>Mr. Huszar is possibly having an article about his rare works done in the Washington Post. We do not yet have a publishing date. You never know what reporters will use. He is also in the USA doing some work for large corporations that want his works in thier offices.<a href="../../../g/d/e/User%7EGDeCourcy_9162.html" title="User:GDeCourcy">GDeCourcy</a> 15:01, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not implying overt bias, but we often tend to favor our own nation, culture, language, etc. Checking here, we see 14 British supercentenarian articles, but only 12 French:</p>

<p>Yet statistics show that France has had more supercentenarians than the UK (currently 87 vs 66).</p>
<p>Also, "Overseas French possesions" includes the entire French overseas empire...French Guiana, Polynesia, Reunion, New Caledonia, Guadeloupe, Martinique, etc. When you scratch the surface, that's quite a bit more substantial than a high school in Miami or a fake TV show town.→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 18:36, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Question</b> - so the question at hand appears to be whether or not it is appropriate to separate out French possessions from France when considering age-related records. Or, if they fly the French flag, should they not be considered French? Or is there some sort of French bias against its citizens not actually living in France? How about creating a category for U.S. territories and protectorates, too? They fly the U.S. flag with all the rights of an American citizen, but hey, they really aren't part of the <i>United</i> States... <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 19:08, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yes, but when's the last time Guam's oldest resident lived to 111? As for Puerto Rico, we do have TWO supercentenarians from Puerto Rico listed, but both of them lived to be "world's oldest person" or "world's oldest man," so this is not comparable.131.96.70.158</p>

<li>Is it a <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notable</a> award? Based on their website (<a href="http://www.studentradio.org.uk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.studentradio.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">[52]</a>) it looks like only about half a dozen school radio stations were represented, and just about every school nominated got an award in one category.

<li>The awards were hosted by some of Britains top Radio DJ's including Chris Moyles. If that's not notable I don't know what is. And as for the show itself, it exists, it is broadcasing right now.

<p>This article appears to be a hoax. I cannot find any reference to the names or places mentioned; I've searched in nearly every academic database to which I have access. Google, google books, and google scholar similarly return zero results. I've never seen <i>zero</i> results returned on even the most obscure topics. The single reference provided in the article appears to be a children's book, but I cannot be sure given that no information is provided aside from the title. (Also note that there is no 2005 edition of this book.) Furthermore, an asteroid numbered 2351 was discovered in the 1960s according to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_asteroids_%282001-3000%29.html" title="List of asteroids (2001-3000)">List of asteroids (2001-3000)</a>.

<dd>Is it your opinion that members of a notable band are not inherently notable themselves, or is it policy somewhere?--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 05:39, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>See <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Nothing there says that a member of a notable band is inherently notable! My opinion is that <i>most</i> members of notable bands <i>would be</i> notable themselves for having participated in a band's notable accomplishments. That goes beyond what the guideline actually says, but I think it's a reasonable interpretation, and a good compromise between deletionist and inclusionist stances. However, in <i>this</i> case, we have a musician who, according to the band, did <i>not</i> participate in any of their albums or singles. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 20:27, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Except that the articles aren't about <i>him</i>; they're about the <i>lawsuit</i>, which is notable because it involves a notable band. Suing a famous person does not magically confer notability. (Especially not in the lawsuit-happy land of the USA.) Now, if he <i>wins</i> the suit, then he may become notable as someone who had to sue to get properly credited on a successful album. But if he loses, then I think that will constitute strong evidence that he never actually did <i>anything</i> notable! <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 23:00, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Exactly, this is coverage about <i>him</i> and <i>his lawsuit.</i> Clearly non-trivial coverage (not directory or listing of performance dates, etc).

<li>And yet I don't think breaking up with a band is reason enough to have an article about him. Also the comment that 'Brent is ...forming a band ... with his brother' is cited... but when i look at the citation i don't see one word about this potential band.

<dd>Google Scholar gives 15 hits for the term as well but none of them gives reference to Ruhselman. How about the above reference. I think the explanation as it is now is totally uncredible.

<li>I'm neutral on this right now; will search for Ruhselman later today, hopefully before the article is deleted. I expect the 3 other folks who have weighed in here are correct in that this neo- is a generalized term. It is probably not a good precedent to have WP articles for neo-this-that-and-the-other-thing unless they are really well established terms, which this clearly is not at this time. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 12:10, 5 December 2006 (UTC) / After a bit of a search for Bedri Ruhselman, and not having found anything in several academic databases, I need to update my vote to <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 10:03, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The festival is an important one in Ireland and deserves its place. There is need for cleaning up of the article but it is informative and relatively unbiased. I would keep it.

<li>I have cleaned up the article somewhat. I would say it should stay as it is a bona fida recognised festival in Ireland even though you probably havent heard of it in the USA.

<li><b>Keep</b>, we cannot apply the same measure to establish notability with a church leader as with a pop star. Church leaders are mostly noted within their congregations. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 13:19, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, though on the basis of his books, and definitely NOT on the basis of the spurious reasoning advanced by <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a>. Notability is determined in precisely the same way for everyone: by their actions. These actions may be more widely discerned for a pop star than for a priest, but the question is always the same: has this person actively chosen to make, and successfully made, a contribution to his field of human endeavour or understanding that others in that field might reasonably be expected to want to know about? For a pop star this may mean singing a hit, or never having a hit but laying the groundwork for a new pop genre; for a priest it may mean setting an example of human charity notable _beyond_ his immediate congregation, or preaching sermons that have a higher success rate in converting "pagans", or, as in this case, by writing books that in some small way advance human understanding of the divine. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a></li>

<dd><b>Delete or merge</b>. There's been a lot of code-named research subjects in history, but I don't want to see an article on every single one.

<dd>Keith Sager's feminist viewpoints are absolutely key for A level students up and down the country. Admittedly part of his biography is slightly irrelevant- his whereabouts now may not be considered relevant for some wikipedia users, however WJEC, Edexcel, OCR and AQA all stipulate that critics have suitable background infomation provided. Those searching for infomation will be able to use Sager's article as a reference point for their studies before deciding how to use him. Deleting him from this site would be unwise for it is not offensive to those who do not know who he is, but useful to those needing more info on him.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Obviously I'm biased in this discussion since I am Tony Pierce, and maybe nowadays running a blog is no big deal, but in August 2001 when I started the busblog there weren't 54 million blogs going. Anyways, I was on G4TV not for my blog, but for the "blook" that I wrote called "How To Blog" which won an award at SXSW. I've also been interviewed in the New York Times for being addicted to the web (<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/blog_sociology/78243.html" class="external free" title="http://community.livejournal.com/blog_sociology/78243.html" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/blog_sociology/78243.html</a>), written about in the Washington Post (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A47633-2004Oct20.html" class="external free" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A47633-2004Oct20.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A47633-2004Oct20.html</a>), and named in the LA Times (<a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/press/LAwideweb.html" class="external free" title="http://www.craigslist.org/about/press/LAwideweb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.craigslist.org/about/press/LAwideweb.html</a>) as the most entertaining blog in LA. True my personal blog busblog.com (<a href="http://busblog.com" class="external free" title="http://busblog.com" rel="nofollow">http://busblog.com</a>) lately isn't what it used to be, but that's because I now blog for a living as Editor of LAist (<a href="http://www.laist.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.laist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.laist.com/</a>), but everyone has made a career and a living out of blogging these days, right? In 2002 I coined the word blook (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blook" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blook" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blook</a>) which is turning parts of your blog into a book, a word that is dorky, true, but was up for Word of the Year this year by the Oxford Dictionary (<a href="http://blog.tomevslin.com/2006/10/blook_is_a_runn.html" class="external free" title="http://blog.tomevslin.com/2006/10/blook_is_a_runn.html" rel="nofollow">http://blog.tomevslin.com/2006/10/blook_is_a_runn.html</a>). Again, achievements I'm sure you've all reached. I'd have cleaned up this wikipedia entry on myself but as you can see from this note I'm not so skilled with your interface. I guess that's why I still use Blogger.com, speaking of which I was sitting next to Ev the night he announced that Google had just bought Blogger (<a href="http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2003/02/only-guy-who-had-better-day-than-me.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2003/02/only-guy-who-had-better-day-than-me.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2003/02/only-guy-who-had-better-day-than-me.htm</a>) just like Amanduhh's mom? She looked alot like Xeni Jardin. And I was one of just 20 bloggers given free trips to Amsterdam by the Dutch government this year and put up in 5 star hotels to blog about the city (<a href="http://www.bloggersinamsterdam.com/blog/" class="external free" title="http://www.bloggersinamsterdam.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bloggersinamsterdam.com/blog/</a>), and and and... but blogging is irrelevant to you guys so whatevs. And yeah I realize I don't get the amount of hits of some of the bloggers in the Technorati Top 100 but personal sites that state right up front that "nothing in here is true" dont really stand a chance of popularity unless youre a whorish hot chick or a political partisan and yet still somehow I am in the Technorati Top 500 (currently i'm #428) (<a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/www.tonypierce.com" class="external free" title="http://www.technorati.com/search/www.tonypierce.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.technorati.com/search/www.tonypierce.com</a>). I agree lots of bloggers can claim that they "belong" here, but how many have achieved these things while being more popular than 99.999% of the rest? Maybe the kids just liked my photo essays (<a href="http://www.tonypierce.com/photoessays.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.tonypierce.com/photoessays.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tonypierce.com/photoessays.htm</a>)? Regardless of what you choose to do, there's no doubt that I was one of the early leaders of blogging, and definitely one of the more influential ones, and now a professional one. Therefore I believe that my entry should stay. But if it goes, that's ok. I did well without Wikipedia, I will live without it. Plus people know where to find me since Google has me listed right below the Tony Awards and Tony Hawk when you simply type "tony" into Google (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=tony" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=tony" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=tony</a>). Thankfully they're not blog-haters&#160;:) Now that I read some of your snarks, it seems like the problem here is in the entry not being very good, not the subject. However, if I had written this entry then you would have tried to bust me for self-promotion. So there's the rub. TP 23:23, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - This campaign against blogs reminds me a LOT of when rap music first became popular back in the 80s. Many people campaigned against the very notion of calling rap “music.” They hated seeing rap embraced and legitimized as a new form of “music” within popular culture. Of course, against millions of rap listeners, their efforts were futile…much like this frustrated effort against blogs is. With numerous blogs having hundreds of thousands of daily readers, the blog is—like it or not—a common and accepted media format. - Barneyg 21:49, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> - care to explain that sentiment in detail? Wikipedia is full of extensive pages on all kinds of obscure historical and contemporary figures, who's notability exists solely within their professional field. I'm concerned that this "War on Blogs" campaign is not effectively targeting vanity pages. I'm familiar with Tony from his activities with Laist, and he appears to have had a role of significance in the larger blogging community. I'll admit I'm just shy of a weak keep on this one, but IMHO, he's not necessarily worthy of a speedy delete. I'd rather see an intelligent effort at a more Wikipedia-ish reduction and re-write and evaluate the worthiness of the article from there. It doesn't appear to me that there was any serious effort to bring this article in line before becoming an AFD - why not? <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlowimperial_dfe0.html" title="User:Glowimperial">Glowimperial</a> 16:48, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

He's paid by Gothamist for his blogging - that qualifies him as a published writer, and given that his field of work is based upon the self publishing of media, I'd be inclined to include his self published works - considering them along the same line as an independent musician publishing their works.

He is a very prolific blogger (whether one agrees with blogging as notable or not, Tony's contributions to the medium are not insignificant) and has held high-profile jobs in online communities like Buzznet and LAist.

It continues, "This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles..." etc. Pierce meets that criterion. A quick search of the Dow Jones/Reuters Factiva service shows Pierce has been the subject of articles from the <i>New York Times</i> (27 May 2004) (followed by an echo to the <i>Times</i>-owned <i>Int'l Herald Tribune</i> on 29 May); Reuters (10 July 2004); <i>Straits Times</i> (Singapore) (5 March 2006); <i>Reforma</i> (Mexico City) (2 April 2006); <i>EL PAIS</i> (Madrid) (20 April 2006); <i>Los Angeles Times</i> (16 October 2003, 27 Feb 2003, 12 July 2004, others); <i>Le Monde</i> (25 June 2005); and others. The search string was (Tony Pierce AND blog), and the variety of citation shows that some regard "just blogging" to be sufficient for notability, if one is widely enough known for it (just as one could become widely known for such synonyms "writing a diary", "writing a journal", "writing essays", etc.).

<li><b>Delete</b>. Worthless, non-notable. He has a blog and nothing else- the content of this article is 100% redundant with his personal site.

Wikipedia isn't a directory of people who have ever had their name mentioned in the newspaper.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Blogging is quickly becoming more and more accepted in terms of mainstream media, and if he is considered by the media to be one of the "forefathers" to modern blogging, and has been quoted, cited, interviewed, or otherwise been exposed by modern media as such, that's verification for me. Wikipedia isn't a directory of people who have ever had their name mentioned in the newspaper - true, but he's had his mentioned in places other than the newspaper, multiple times.<a href="../../../t/o/0/User%7ETo0n_3f13.html" title="User:To0n">To0n</a> 02:47, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Based on the Board of Editors this is a major international journal, but I cannot tell what the article did or didn't say--I do wish people would not make hasty decisions based on their lack of knowledge of unfamiliar fields. If it was a list of the journal's data from its own page this is fair use, and not a copyvio, and more than a thumbnail of its cover would be.</dd>

<dd>I ask the more experienced WP people who have removed it what is the best course for me to take--simply add it back again, I suppose, and then defend it. I at least know enough to explain in the article why it is important. And what are the other articles that form the walled-off area?

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - I'm no expert on porn, but I do remember that most of the people I knew in the 90s who were into internet/BBS porn had pictures of her in their collection, so she must have been notable enough back then (otherwise I wouldn't even have remembered who she was). Not sure if she still is today. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> 14:20, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I was wondering whether someone would finally try writing about this person. The problem with Anna Marek is that there is <i>exactly one</i> published source of biographical information about her in the whole world, an "Anna Marek FAQ" that has been pseudonymously posted and re-posted in Usenet newsgroups for about 10 years. It's the FAQ that has been copied onto the one web page that the article cites, and re-hashed on the other web page that the article cites. It possibly originates from the people who sell the movies. (Note that the web site onto which it has been copied also sells the movies.) There's no way to know who the author of the FAQ is, and for all that the world knows, all of the biographical information in the FAQ could be complete fiction. It wouldn't be the first time that a purported biography of a porn actress was utter fiction. (Indeed, fictional names and fictional biographies are common practice in the world of pornography.)
<p>The <i>only</i> verifiable things that can be said about this person that come from sources with a name and a known reputation is that she appears in four porn movies and that a Usenet newsgroup was named after one of her pseudonyms. <i>Nothing else</i> — her nationality, the fanciful story about her background, her sexual orientation, her weight, her height, and even her age and name (It is interesting to note that one editor's edit summary is "In Polish there is no name like 'Anuschka'".) — is verifiable from good sources that have checked their facts, that can be trusted, and that are independent of the subject and of people trying to sell the subject's movies. That's not enough to satisfy the WP:BIO criteria.</p>
<p>Anna Marek is a good example of the distinction between fame and notability, and a rare example of someone who is famous but not notable.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I feel I should clarify. I have no objection to Anna Marek's profession and my vote is in my view objective. The article's references show that her movies are widely sold and heavily promoted. But it gives no external evidence that there is anything notable about Ms Marek as a porn star. Examples of this might be- best selling, longest career, first to perform a certain act, having a won a particular award, etc. Wikipedia cannot become an directory of all pornstars. Therefore, it must be necessary in establish that a pornstar is notable to show how he/she stands out from other pornstars... <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe">WJBscribe</a> 00:23, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - A lack of information on a notable topic is not a reason for deletion.

<li>This person is <i>not</i> notable. She is famous (inasmuch as people recognize her picture and her name). There's a difference. She doesn't satisfy our WP:BIO criteria. If she were not<i>able</i>, she would have been not<i>ed</i>. But she hasn't been. There are no non-trivial published works from independent sources about her.

<p>On the contrary, a lack of information <i>is</i> a reason for deletion, per our <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> which states that perpetual stubs with no possibility for expansion should be deleted. Because this person does not satisfy the WP:BIO criteria, in particular because she doesn't satisfy the primary criterion, there's no possibility for this article to be expanded beyond a stub. Note that editors have <i>already</i> had to add unverifiable content, such as her height and weight, and original research, such as the list of aliases, to the article, and have had to rely upon an unreliable source, just to get it as far as it is now.</p>
<p>Put another way: You state that little is known about this person. In fact, pretty much nothing is known. Were you to ask the people who <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Grant_20d2.html" title="User:Mark Grant">Mark Grant</a> knew what they actually know about Anna Marek, they would report that they don't actually know anything about her at all, apart from the fact that that's the name on a set of pictures. Since an encyclopaedia is a compendium of knowledge, and there is no knowledge to be had, there can obviously be no encyclopaedia article.

<dd>Disagree with your points. The very notion that she (whoever she was) was famous in her role as a porn star makes her notable enough for me. You may point to WP:BIO all you like - if there is a majority consensus amongst those people who do care enough to argue about it that she is notable - then she is. That is what Wikipedia, in the end, is about. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMaxDog_2e4c.html" title="User:MadMaxDog">MadMaxDog</a> 12:05, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This also harkens back to the old inclusionist or exclusionist debate. Your thrust (beyond arguments about possibly fake info - which can easily be deleted or qualified as untrustworthy in the article) is that having an article listing a porn star about whom not much beyond her pornstardom is known is cheapening, worsening - whatever you would call it - Wikipedia. That is wrong. Wikipedia is not paper. Nobody will stumble over this article unless searching for it specifically or being random-linked to it. There is no harm to having it here. But then, that is what you'd argue. Oh well, sorry to all for veering off from the main topic. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMaxDog_2e4c.html" title="User:MadMaxDog">MadMaxDog</a> 12:09, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> This article could benefit from more information, but the historical significance of Anna Marek is undeniable. Moreover, the importance of the adult entertainment industry in terms of cultural enlightenment and economic advancement and the evolution of sexual morality can hardly be overstated: humans are sexual creatures perhaps unique in their ability to appreciate vicariously the sexuality of others, and similarly unique in their (arguably unethical) efforts to regulate human sexuality between consenting parties.</p>
<p>Prudishness has neither any rightful nor any desirable place among the qualities of an encyclopaedia: those opposing the presentation of reference material related to (especially mainstream) pornography ultimately undermine the scholarly discussion and fair representation of topics arising from (or substantially connected with) human sexuality and the greater portion of the human experience. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.222.127.35_4988.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.222.127.35">68.222.127.35</a> (talk)</small></p>

<dd>Sorry Mr. anonymous user but no one arguing against this article is being prudish. The question is simply whether the movies/pictures themselves and comments by those who promote them are sufficient for notability. I think those arguing against would have been satisfied by impartial external confirmation that "the historical significance of Anna Marek is undeniable" (as you put it) i.e. from sources other than those selling her work. No one to my knowledge has opposed the presentation of reference material relating to pornography, merely the quality of those references in this instance. -<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 18:11, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Notability is not fame nor importance? Mind you, this is porn we're talking about.</li>
<li>Verifiability of biographical data is not the issue. One could almost say A.M. is <a href="../../../d/2E/b/D.B._Cooper_888d.html" title="D.B. Cooper">D.B. Cooper</a> of porn. We know next to nothing about D.B. Cooper as a person (what is his real name, when was he born, etc.), but we know he existed, and we know what he did. Same for A.M. (No, I'm not saying this makes them equally notable; I'm just trying to provide a different angle here.) <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorB_c220.html" title="User:GregorB">GregorB</a> 21:44, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article could definitely use some sources, but I don't see anything particularly offensive here- in fact, if you add some references and make it a little less list-y, it's a pretty good article.

<li><b>Keep</b> – Disclosure: I'm one of the editors who have worked on the article in the past.<br />
I definitely agree that the article needs referencing (I've just added a references tag myself after reading this AFD proposal), and it could be less listy, but overall I think it can become a good article with work, and should not be deleted, at least at this time. I'm going to put some effort into it over the next few days to improve it.<br />
The google search statistics are misleading. Fox.com is only going to mention American Idol, and certainly not anything about other Idol series shows. The overall google hits number could be low because the phrase is reletively new, although 63,000 hist isn't bad, really.<br />
I would also like to say that maybe the AFD process should be one of the last steps in trying to get a Wikipedia full of good articles, instead of the first, but I suppose that gets to the inclusionist/mergist/deletionist controversy, so forget I said anything. -- <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArglebargleIV_fb51.html" title="User:ArglebargleIV">ArglebargleIV</a> 14:52, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and rename</b> Couldn't this be transformed to become List of famous nicknames, or something like that? Then we would just have to verify that the nicknames are used publicly, and that the person is in some way notable. Regarding nom - it seems to me that the current claims could be verified if a news organization ever did a survey (my local news outlets often do surveys to 'prove' how bad our education system is!)... or is that a cop out? I agree with pruning some of the obvious 'Bobby'-type names. <a href="../../../9/9/o/User%7E99of9.html" title="User:99of9">99of9</a> 07:08, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The name's slightly off - I'd prefer something that suggests these people are more commonly known by these shorter names, even if their full names are known to some extent (example: Gaius Julius Caesar). Even so, this list is as useful as the other list of names here - I learned a couple things reading it myself. Re: Notability - anyone who isn't notable should not be on the list. Verification: the ratio between 11,100 g-hits for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Thomas+Sean+Connery%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Thomas+Sean+Connery%22" rel="nofollow">Thomas Sean Connery</a> and 2,430,000 g-hits for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Sean+Connery%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Sean+Connery%22" rel="nofollow">Sean Connery</a> makes it clear which name he is more commonly known by. (Applying those standards, some of the entries on the current list are questionable, but the list itself is valid.) <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 09:49, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I wasn't suggesting that we add g-hits to the article text, just that we use it as a tool when assessing it. Right now, we can use g-hits to assess notability, without having to explicitly add "Joe Bloggs is notable because he has 50,000 g-hits" to an article. If the tool is accepted for use there, then it can also be used for other purposes.</dd>

<dd>I understand that we have to be careful to avoid <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, but there must be some point where consensus can be used to say that if someone is referred to as "Sean Connery" in published sources 220 more times than he is referred to as "Thomas Sean Connery", then his common name is, in fact, "Sean Connery". I'd suggest that such reasoning is already used implicitly on Wikipedia when dealing with abbreviated and stage names. "L. Ron Hubbard" gets 1,130,000 g-hits, versus 21,800 for "Lafayette Ronald Hubbard". And there are plenty of references in the <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._Ron_Hubbard_3ec8.html" title="L. Ron Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a> article which <i>use</i> this shorter name. But there is no reference there saying <i>why</i> that is used as his common name. Such a reference is unnecessary, and trying to guess why one name is preferred over another would be OR. All we are doing is stating what the most common name is. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 14:22, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> per nom.</s> <b>Rename</b> As the examples above illustrate, almost anyone could be on this list. L. Ron Hubbard, Sean Connery, etc. - what about John F. Kennedy, since most people include only his middle initial rather than full middle name? George W. Bush? Mel Gibson? (To my view, the only names that could <i>not</i> conceivably be on this list would be Lee Harvey Oswald and John Wilkes Booth.) When a list is that ill-defined, I think it should be deleted under WP:OR (because choosing the names for a list that could conceivably include anyone inherently involves original research and decision-making). If it's possible to re-define this list, great - but I don't see a way to do that, so I think it should be deleted. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 16:55, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think you'll find none of the extra names you've mentioned above are on the list. I agree that listing names like those would be ridiculous, so you're right - the list does need to be redefined. What about changing the name to List of people whose first names are not commonly used? In fact, the intro paragraph already states that, but it could be clearer, so I've had a go at reworking it. How does the new version look to you? <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 00:11, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I definitely think that's better, and have amended my "vote" - there are examples (e.g. Alfonse Capone) on the list that don't meet that, but that can be cleaned up. I still worry that it <i>could</i> be an unmanageably long list - but think it's worth keeping and renaming to see if it can be managed (if not, then we can reconsider it). You didn't raise this, but I don't share the concerns of the nominator about verifying common usage of these names (with a few exceptions). I think that's do-able - my only worry is definability of the list. (I also think it might be worth considering whether to include both real and fictional people - but that doesn't weigh directly on this debate.) --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 00:45, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some ideas on verification, using both published works and community consensus, were already mentioned above. If you're worried about the title saying "commonly known", we could always change it to "commonly used", which is easier to verify. How do users find this list, you asked? If someone wants a list of names for whatever reason, I'm guessing they'd start at the "list of names" category and work from there. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 00:08, 6 December 2006 (UTC) 00:06, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

A user wanting to read about <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yogi_Berra_6200.html" title="Yogi Berra">Yogi Berra</a> will simply type his name into the search box, and be taken there directly. Even if the user knows that Yogi Berra's first name isn't actually "Yogi" he's not going to try to find this page: he'll simply type <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berra.html" title="Berra">Berra</a>, then click the 'Search' button, and Yogi is second on the list. It's a mildly interesting list, but virtually impossible to maintain over time - very few article creators would be likely to know of its existence, so plenty of people would be missing from this list as biographies are added, and I can't imagine someone dedicated enough to watch and read every new biographical entry just to maintain this.

But notability is clearly asserted: "market leader in security processors" and "first company to offer a processor with integrated encryption and compression".

I feel the article needs a heavy re-write, but I believe that if this can be done it should stay: it's of marginal interest, but we're not paper. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:16, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. The problem I have is that I can't see what's notable about this group. Simply being run by a cult/religion isn't enough for me - there are lots of such groups. What makes this group notable&#160;? Not the Congressional Record entry - plenty of non-notable people and groups have been mentioned there. We need more.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> I was the one who tagged for speedy. I didn't know that G4 didn't apply due to that clause. Mod is not released, and not noteworthy or notable.
