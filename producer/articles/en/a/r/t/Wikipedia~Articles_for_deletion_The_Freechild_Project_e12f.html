<dd><b>Keep</b>. Meets <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>. According to that guideline, <i>A primary test of notability is whether people independent of the subject itself (or of its manufacturer, creator, or vendor) have actually considered the company, corporation, product or service notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works that focus upon it.</i> All current citations on this article meet this criterion. The article cites a plethora of sources as to the notability of Freechild, and about the advertising aspect, I have no idea of how to fix it. User:Puget doesn't cite any particular violations of WP, and I think this is really just a case of <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a>. - <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreechild_f239.html" title="User:Freechild">Freechild</a> 23:43, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Delete</b>. This article is just self-promotion for a non-notable non-profit org, and it may even qualify as a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_page.html" title="Vanity page">vanity page</a>. Many of the references are just vapor sources that don't support what the author(s) claim they do. For example, in support of the claim that the Freechild Project is "internationally recognized," the author(s) cite an article in the <i>Australasian Journal of American Studies</i>. Even if being mentioned in an obscure social-science journal published outside of America qualified as "international recognition" (IMHO, it doesn't), if you actually look at the source, the Freechild Project <i>isn't even mentioned in the body of the article</i>. Instead, a review of <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todd_Gitlin_2612.html" title="Todd Gitlin">Todd Gitlin</a>'s book that the journal article's author found on the Freechild Project website is listed in the bibliography. In addition, the article lists as "accolades" several awards of questionable importance, such as a "cool site" award. Most of the Google hits for the site are for automated rip-off sites like Answers.com, or links from sites within the special-interest community that the Freechild Project is part of. Wikipedia is not meant to be an exhaustive guide to everything in existence, and this organization does not merit a WP article. - <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkaraoke_ad01.html" title="User:Skaraoke">Skaraoke</a> 07:32, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another example of <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a>. Its ironic that <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkaraoke_ad01.html" title="User:Skaraoke">Skaraoke</a> asks for notability, then complains when the google hits, citations, and "special interest community that the Freechild Project is part of" does not meet his liking. I'm also not sure that any of the <b>17</b> citations on the article are so-called "vapor citations"; that much said, <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> does not mention "vapor citations", and no other page on WP mentions "vapor citations". "Vapor citation" actually comes up 3 times on google. There are no exceptional claims in the article, particularly regarding The Freechild Project's international relevance (with multiple citations); neither is there original research or unsourced comments. As the article illustrates, this program is notable and merits a WP article. - <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreechild_f239.html" title="User:Freechild">Freechild</a> 16:59, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The term "vapor source" refers to a citation that "evaporates" once you examine it more closely (<i>i.e.</i> it doesn't actually say what the author was citing it to support, or it doesn't exist at all). Regardless of how many other people use this term, it is an accurate description of the citations that I mentioned above. Citations that can be described that way don't belong on WP, and articles that rely on citations like that don't belong on WP. - <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkaraoke_ad01.html" title="User:Skaraoke">Skaraoke</a> 18:42, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Saying this article <i>relies</i> on "vapor sources" implies that is all there is in the article and that the merit of the article is reliant upon those sources. You explained one specific citation of concern; since then point I have added several other citations that strengthen the claim made in the article. There are <b>16</b> other citations in the article; you have yet to mention any other. At best this article requires <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitecheck_535c.html" title="Template:Citecheck">Template:Citecheck</a>; this AfD is out of order according to that argument. - <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreechild_f239.html" title="User:Freechild">Freechild</a> 19:24, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b>. The article states:</p>

<p>As the article states before this quote, "cultural critic Henry Giroux" is on the Freechild Project's advisory board. Of course he's going to say the FP is "especially relevant." C'mon, who do you think you're fooling with this one? - 171.66.185.219 01:11, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No foolin' on that one. Of course, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Giroux_0175.html" title="Henry Giroux">Henry Giroux</a> is a world-renowned theorist who has published more than 30 books, with this quote coming from one of them. That alone justifies the quote; his perspective and attendance to the program probably justifies the article, too.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>-As someone who is not involved in Freechild but is also not biased against the Youth Movement, I have to urge a keep for this article. When i look at the arguements of the opposition, I am baffled. Skaraoke says it should be deleted because in his humble opinion Freechild isn't internationally recognized despites its mention in <i>Australasian Journal of American Studies</i> which he derides as an "obscure" source. The <i>Australasian Journal of American Studies</i> isn't an obscure source as it is so asserted. It is a multi-continental social science journal that specialises in the study of American soceity. I fail to see how it is somehow a not noteable that Freechild was picked up on in this Social Study journal. It seems to me that if an international social science journal feels this organization warrants mention, then that organization must have some merit and some recognition,</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>With all due respect, this misconception is a <i>perfect</i> example of why I objected to this source. I will say it again, with some extra punctuation just to make it a little more noticeable: The Freechild Project <i><b>IS NOT MENTIONED IN THE BODY OF THE ARTICLE</b></i>. The article's bibliography cites a book review of <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todd_Gitlin_2612.html" title="Todd Gitlin">Todd Gitlin</a>'s book that the author of the journal article accessed from the Freechild Projects website. This could have been found through a search engine, and it does not give rigorous support for the Freechild Project's "international recognition." Aren't you at least a little bothered by having been manipulated and deceived like this? - <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkaraoke_ad01.html" title="User:Skaraoke">Skaraoke</a> 21:40, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Moreover, the opposition is so weak that they have realied solely on question whether the accolades are good enough to count.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But this really is a valid issue. The significance of having received an "accolade" is very much a function of how importance the accolade is. Getting the <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Peace_Prize_60fc.html" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> is an "accolade." So is having your dog get a Blue Ribbon at a dog show. Which one do think is going to get the book deal? Obviously, an extreme example, but hopefully you get the point. - <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkaraoke_ad01.html" title="User:Skaraoke">Skaraoke</a> 21:40, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Then, they resort to google hits as a back-up, even though if i recollect correctly, google hits aren't supposed to be used in article merit arguements. I apologize in advance if i'm wrong about that. And while i'm sure Skaraoke did go through all 44,000 google hits, its seems to me that a organization would be considered notable if it is held in high regard and mentioned alot within the community and niche it is in....</p>
<p>Then, once changes have been made to make the article even more acceptable, people argue for its deletion because they quote a person who liked the org so much it joined its advisory board as a show of support? I don't understand that arguement at all. If the Secretary of State said a threat was relevant, would you discount that because she is in the State Department?</p>
<p>I think deletion of this article is not based upon evidence but instead upon biases inherent within its detractors. If solid evidence was produced, I would be fine with deletion, but the only leg they stand on is flimsy conjecture and opinion. A deletion would be wrong and bad for WP <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheowannabe_4929.html" title="User:Theowannabe">Theowannabe</a> 06:27, 30 March 2007 (UTC)Chip</p>
