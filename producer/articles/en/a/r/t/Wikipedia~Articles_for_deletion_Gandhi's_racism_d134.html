<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> Sumarize, bring <i>some</i> of the verifiable material into an article that can provide context and counterpoints. If, ultimately, it's necessary to create a separate article about Gandhi's views on race, then spin it off into a more appropriately titled article such as "Gandhi's views on race." Be sure the context includes when and under what circumstances the statements were made, whether Gandhi's views changed through his life, and digest whatever published analysis and interpretation may exist, rather than providing bare context-free quotes selected to support a view of Gandhi as a racist. This <i>can</i> be improved.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 09:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC) P.S., the comment on "integrity" above is inappropriate. It's fair to assume we all have integrity, but there is a disagreement on whether this article meets Wikipedia policy and guidelines.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 09:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
The statements are not context free. Gandhi's views - if they changed later- must only be known to him because he did not publicly distance himself from his views. Every date has been given along with a proper citation from The Collected Works of Gandhi. The only reason this is becoming an issue is because Gandhi is the world's holy cow... so much for objectivity and balance.</p>
<p>That said I am open to this article being redirected to "Gandhi's views on Race". <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeabing-Leigh_3d57.html" title="User:Teabing-Leigh">Teabing-Leigh</a> 09:31, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Also... on second thought .... the more I read such pages where certain ethnic and national groups gang up to cover up facts of history, I begin to question whether Wikipedia is all I thought it was... instead of being a bastion of all points of view coming together to create objective truth... it is more like George Orwell's "1984" with its newspeak and editing and rewriting and ofcourse DELETING ... no wonder racists and casteists become egalitarian mahatmas only 60 years after their death... <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeabing-Leigh_3d57.html" title="User:Teabing-Leigh">Teabing-Leigh</a> 09:41, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

A much smarter move would have been to talk to people on Ghandhis article to find the best way to integrate a <i>balanced</i> and <i>neutral</i> version of is views on race. It is also worth noting that essentially the same article has been created by Teabing <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandhi%27s_views_on_race.html" title="Gandhi's views on race">here</a>, also of note is that this is not the first time this user has posted articles identical to this, which were, naturally, deleted, which is why I suggest salting.

<li><b>Delete</b> undue weight. Theoretically we should probably smerge and preserve the history, but this really is not one I would be happy leaving around as edit history. The claim of racism is minor, and to a certain extent founded on work by a very few individuals who have some kind of agenda. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 09:55, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>How is the claim of racism minor when it is directly from Gandhi's own collected works? <a href="../../../2/0/2/User%7E202.163.67.241.html" title="User:202.163.67.241">202.163.67.241</a> 13:41, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I was going to argue for a re-write and title change but even with the sources this is, in its current form, a clear cut violation of both <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a>. The changes needed to fix the article's issues would result in a total rewrite and since the title needs to be changed anyway and there being no material here worth moving in whole, deletion is the obvious answer. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 12:43, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>So the allegedly racist views of a global icon is not "worth" preserving or discussing? I am afraid it is NOT a violation of WP:NPOV .... the article merely highlights Gandhi's allegedly racist views and quotes Gandhi's own works WITHOUT giving one's own opinion. Why is it that this is being deleted and not a thousand other articles which are more blatantly one sided and agenda driven? <a href="../../../2/0/2/User%7E202.163.67.241.html" title="User:202.163.67.241">202.163.67.241</a> 13:41, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are pushing POV through exclusion of certain contextual facts. For example, 'Kaffir' was not the offensive term it is now in Ghandis time, which changes the context in which you claim he used the word. If your article was properly researched and sourced, this would have been readily apparant. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 14:01, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That is just not true. First of all the word <b>Kaffir is NOT the issue here,</b> his view that black people were savages and subhuman that is the issue. If you feel that "Kaffir" was not an offensive term then please provide evidence. However the issue here is NOT about the term kaffir which in any case in the modern terminology means non-Muslim and nothing else and is not applicable to the usage of the word Kaffir then. Are you saying that believing black people were subhuman was not offensive then? You may argue that and then in that case produce evidence for it. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeabing-Leigh_3d57.html" title="User:Teabing-Leigh">Teabing-Leigh</a> 14:08, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Kinslayer: What PART of the word KAFFIR not being the issue did you not understand. <b>The issue is Gandhi's alleged estimate of blackpeople as subhuman.</b> As for consensus... there was a time when world over there was a consensus on Earth being flat... so what is your point? You think you can change the facts with consensus? In any event, I have made the clarification regarding the term "Kaffir" which is a non-issue anyway. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeabing-Leigh_3d57.html" title="User:Teabing-Leigh">Teabing-Leigh</a> 14:16, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Basically what this article has done is string together a bunch of Gandhi's quotes in an attempt to prove a point. The one reference of the Guardian is the closest thing that comes to actually <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attributing</a> this article, but a single example of one group claiming Gandhi was a racist does not adequately source the article as a whole. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:01, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually I just looked it over before I made the previous comment. The comment still stands. You have 1 reliable secondary source of someone calling Gandhi a racist and then go into a discussion of things he said that were racist. Break that down into points and you get "This group said Gandhi was racist, look at all the things he said that were racist, ergo, here is Gandhi's racism for you to see". We <i>cannot</i> make that kind of leap of logic on Wikipedia articles. It is STILL original research. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:08, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> Gandhi's views on race are surely notable; the Guardian is a highly respected newspaper; the book cited is published by Prometheus Books which seems to be a respected publisher (doesn't mean the book is "right" but it's not a vanity publisher); I'm not sure if a speech in the House of Representatives is considered inherently notable but could be considered so. The fact that this criticism of Gandhi exists is notable and should be included in the article on Gandhi. The existing Gandhi article has a strong POV the other way:) Hobson 21:46, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
