<p>Thank you. Sorry for the confusion.</p>
<p>Here are the possible reasons for keeping this article as is: (1-3) the quotations by Crichton, Josephson, and Paltridge in the "History and Background" section; (4-5) the Lindzen and Lomborg examples in the "Resistance to Contradiction" (??!!) section; and (6) the widespread use of the phrase, as attested by the fact that Google turns up a large number of hits when you type in "'consensus science'". Reasons 1-5 are dealt with by Dicksonlaprade (me) on this article's discussion page. All that's left of these reasons are the quotations by Crichton and Paltridge. Not enough to save the article by themselves, in my view.</p>
<p>As for the Google thing, a perusal of the first twenty search results for the phrase "'consensus science'" shows that the vast majority of them fall into one of the following categories: the Wikipedia entry which I am discussing and the related entry at Answers.com; references to Michael Crichton's speech; things which have nothing to do with "consensus science" at all (e.g., the book title <i>Forged Consensus: Science, Technology</i>, etc.); or blog entries (for, e.g., fare.livejournal.com and blogcritics.org). Conspicuously lacking are references by scientists or by historians or philosophers of science to the concept.</p>
<p>I also did a search for articles and reviews in the science and history/philosophy of science journals in the database JSTOR. The only references to the phrase "'consensus science'" which I turned up were to the aforementioned book title. Considering that JSTOR indexes articles from such prestigious journals as <i>Science</i>, <i>Evolution</i>, and <i>Philosophy of Science</i>, this absence is especially damning.</p>
<p>As per the "Verifiability" policy, it would appear that the best resource for this concept is Michael Crichton of <i>Jurassic Park</i> fame--hardly a philosopher or historian of science--and his epigones. This being the case, I see no reason for this article not to become a subdivision of "scientific consensus." Giving this dubious concept its own entry makes it appear that some reliable professionals give it credence--an appearance for which I can find no evidence.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> A lot of hot air blown about nothing significant. There is often consensus in science. Sometimes it is proven incorrect. Kind of like anything else that people try to figure out.

<dd>Insofar as this article's primary purpose is to "describe potential pitfalls of scientific consensus," it seems that the material in this article would be better placed on the "scientific consensus" page. Insofar as "consensus science" is a distinct concept/term with relatively wide usage in scientific circles, it would deserve its own article--but I see no evidence for this. By way of comparison, Ann Coulter's recent book <i>Godless</i> uses the term "flatulent raccoon theory" to describe the theory of evolution because, in her mind, it is such a ridiculous theory. There are many Wikipedia articles where this fact about her could be mentioned, but since the term itself comes only from Ann Coulter and her epigones, there is no need to give it its own entry. The same applies here: without Michael Crichton and those who quote him approvingly (<i>outside</i> of the scientific community), there is no "consensus science." <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicksonlaprade_3bc8.html" title="User:Dicksonlaprade">Dicksonlaprade</a> 16:11, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Restricting the Google search to 20 items seems a little restrictive, but you somehow missed Nature's "Consensus science, or consensus politics?".

<dd>Good searching. HOWEVER: the article "Climate Consensus and the End of Science" is written by Terence Corcoran of the "Financial Post"--not exactly the best source in terms of <i>Verifiability</i>. Item #3 on your list refers to the term "consensus science" only in a Michael Crichton quotation. Item #4's only citation to the phrase "consensus science" is a link to one of the 7 articles in <i>Nature</i>, the one by Pielke (Pielke is also the author of #4).</dd>

<dd>I checked and it turns out that JSTOR, the database which I used, does not include <i>Nature</i>,which explains the absence of these articles which you mention. HOWEVER: the first of the 7 entries in <i>Nature</i> makes no reference to "consensus science" except in the title, while the second is by Pielke (referenced by entry #4 in your own list). Out of all the journals catalogued by JSTOR <i>plus</i> the journal <i>Nature</i>, there are thus only half a dozen actual <i>uses</i> to the term. The case for KEEP is stronger than first appears, but 6-7 clear references in dozens of journals (JSTOR catalogues 62 journals in "Biological Sciences" alone) and in over 20 Google search results is still not a very strong case from the standpoint of Verifiability. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicksonlaprade_3bc8.html" title="User:Dicksonlaprade">Dicksonlaprade</a> 21:28, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It has? News to me (and to Guettarda and JoshuaZ and FeloniousMonk, as well). Out of over 20 Google search results and over 60 journals, the best resource for this concept is a half-dozen references in a single journal and TV and novel writer Michael Crichton. Thomas Kuhn doesn't use the concept and neither (to my knowledge) do Karl Popper, Daniel Dennett, Paul Feyerabend, or any respected zoologists, botanists, physicists, epidemiologists, astronomers. . . .</dd>

<dd>Actually, Crichton is a scientist as well. Why isn't he a valid source for the usage? And if he isn't good enough, why isn't Nature a good enough source? --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 08:47, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Crichton is not a scientist. He is a TV and novel writer who went to medical school and (according to his Wikipedia entry) taught anthropology at Cambridge for a while. <i>Nature</i> is a good source, but the problem is that it is the <i>only</i> good source which uses the concept of "consensus science." When several dozen peer-reviewed journals fail to turn up more than six uses of a concept, this says that the concept does not deserve its own entry. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicksonlaprade_3bc8.html" title="User:Dicksonlaprade">Dicksonlaprade</a> 12:54, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
