<p>This category is deeply irksome - since pretty much <i>every</i> article has unsourced statements, pretty much <i>every</i> article could be in this category (except maybe some featured articles, although I would guess that even many of these contain unsourced statements). Also, coming across this category on the main article page seems unnecessarily negative to me - it singles out articles in this category as "bad articles" to readers, when in fact they're just articles where someone bothered to put a category up. I think categories that are not legitimately part of the article itself, but notes designed to get editors to work on them, should generally go on the talk page. But that's obviously not general practice. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 19:09, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's true that pretty much every article contains unsourced statement. But that's like saying everything is pointless. Which is, of course, true if you think long enough about it. But it's ridiculous to put a bullet in your brains because of it. Just like it is pointless to put every existing Wikipedia article in here because all of them contain unsourced statements. This category should contain every article which contains one or more <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitation_needed_0ed6.html" title="Template:Citation needed">citation needed</a> ({{citation needed}}, <b>old</b>) or <a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a> ({{fact}}) tags. That's it. (Is there a <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOTS_070f.html" title="WP:BOTS">wikibot</a> on it? Would be handy.)

<dd>The size of this category proves that too many people are too trigger happy with this kind of thing. People seem to go around reading articles and adding 'citation needed' to everything they're not sure about. What's the point? For one thing, if you <i>did</i> cite all the things that everyone wants cited, the references sections in some of these articles would be so long they'd take ten minutes to load on a 4Mb broadband connection. You can't source every statement, but it doesn't make them untrue. I miss the days when I could look at articles on Wikipedia and not see a massive template at the top of every page telling me why the article is rubbish. I don't think the problem is that there are too many unsourced statements on Wikipedia, I think the problem is that there are too many people who have to put "<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>" at the end of every sentence they, personally, don't believe. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevefarrell_5f66.html" title="User:Stevefarrell">Stevefarrell</a> 11:27, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I really like <a href="../../../b/s/d/User%7EBsd987_52d2.html" title="User:Bsd987">Bsd987</a>'s suggestion.

<dd>i agree, people are extremely trigger happy in adding this tag. like one person said above, spending an hour ever day adding this tag to articles! we need to have a way more stringent requirement to adding this tag, such as an article without ANY sources at all. now that would be a very handy tag to have. hmm.. maybe it exists already? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 03:51, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The deletion review page quite clearly does not cover categories, and therefore the decision that was taken to restore it there is clearly invalid and meaningless. People who understand categories won't have seen the discussion, so the outcome was determined by people who don't appreciate the damage that there were doing because categories are not their focus. This category really needs to be deleted as it does nothing except to get in the way of easy use of the category system. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrammen_d965.html" title="User:Brammen">Brammen</a> 10:56, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Deletion review is mandated to examine all forms of deletion. Most disputes are about articles, but there is nothing "invalid" about it reviewing CFD decisions. I will say however that if CFD and DRV can reach very different conclusions about the same category then it is likely indicative that one of these two communities is acting in a way that is out of touch with the desires of the Wikipedia community as a whole. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 15:09, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I like this category because, having a half hour or so to spare, I can pull up a story, search for "Citation needed," hunt for one or two or more source or sources and, having found it or them, add it or them quickly to the article. Of course, sometimes it takes a LOT searching on Google or elsewhere, but upon doing so, I am always struck with how omnipresent the poorly sourced WikiP articles are in the Internet. And so those unsourced sentences and statements just multiply like bunnies.</p>
<p>I have no compunction about removing them either, hoping that they will soon vanish from the 'Net.</p>

<p>This category certainly has its uses, but at present we lack the infrastructure to control its abuse, and I <i><b>suspect</b></i> it <i><b>may</b></i> do more harm than good as a result. I invite comment (naturally, that's what talk pages are for).</p>
<p>I've just removed a {{cite needed}} tag from an otherwise excellent article on the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_Penguin_159d.html" title="Emperor Penguin">Emperor Penguin</a>, see <a href="../../../e/m/p/Talk%7EEmperor_Penguin_a8cf.html#Removed_cite_needed" title="Talk:Emperor Penguin">Talk:Emperor Penguin#Removed cite needed</a>. It's a good example of one of several ways in which this category is regularly abused. The factoid in question is not particularly contentious, and is supported by one of the references already provided in the <i>Further reading</i> section. The reference sections of this article are short, not like the overly comprehensive bibliographies of some articles, so the information was and is easily <i>verifiable</i>.</p>
<p>There are several problems here. One is that the tag didn't add anything to the article. The detailed citation that was presumably requested by it would be a different style to the existing (excellent) article, which would contravene the MOS, see <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a>. Another is <i>why</i> it was added. I'd guess it was added by someone looking for information. The way to do that is to use the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7EReference_desk_45b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Reference desk">reference desk</a>, or the talk page, not to edit the article with an implicit question. At the very least, the person adding the tag should put their question explicitly into the talk page.</p>
<p>Or, worse, it may have been added in order to <i>challenge</i> the information. I'd guess not in this case, but that's a common ploy in more controversial articles. And again, it adds nothing to the articles in question.</p>
<p>Food for thought? I'm <b>not</b> saying delete this category. I am saying that if we keep it, we need to put some effort into the infrastructure to support its use. Some guidelines need to be written, publicised <i><b>and agreed</b></i> (that's the hard part). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 03:57, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is there any way of finding out just how many articles are currently in the category? The category has a <i>backlog</i> note, and there are about 1,000 articles starting with <i>Aa-Am</i>, so I guess that means there are about 2,000 starting with <i>A</i>. That's a lot of articles. I wonder how many of these tags are useful? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 06:21, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What's the problem? If a statement is marked Citation Needed, just hunt around until you find one. If you can't find one, delete the statement. Seems simple to me. Sincerely, <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeLouis_ac0a.html" title="User:GeorgeLouis">GeorgeLouis</a> 11:18, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is, many of the statements marked <i>Citation Needed</i> are nothing of the sort. Sorry if I didn't make that clear before.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As a result, many (possibly most) of the articles currently in this category don't belong here, and the lack of effective guidelines makes this likely to continue. So we're left with an enormous number of articles with a notice on them that is both inaccurate and discouraging to the contributors who have taken the trouble to write some excellent articles... such as the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_Penguin_159d.html" title="Emperor Penguin">Emperor Penguin</a> article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 13:04, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well, about that <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_Penguin_159d.html" title="Emperor Penguin">Emperor Penguin</a> article: I don't see any sources anywhere in it. Of course, there are some links below the main text, but there is nothing within the body of the piece that gives sources for the statements, all of which may be true and all of which may be false, for all we know. I think there is a BIG discrepancy in what you and I, Andrewa, feel an article should look like: Unfortunately for ease of reading, the operative principle for WikiP, so far as I know, is to give sources for all the material. (And I am not flogging Andrewa nor anybody else here, please let me make that clear.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I personally don't mind looking up the sources and citing them when I find them. Others who have problems doing that (it can be boring and a bit precious) could put their talents to use elsewhere in WikiP, and I would not blame them.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When you say you <i>don't see any sources in it</i>, I assume you mean that there are no footnote style references. There are good sections on <i>Further reading</i>, <i>References</i> and <i>External links</i>. These are all <i>sources</i>. To flag each individual paragraph or statement with a footnote explicitly identifying its specific source is certainly <i>permitted</i> by the MOS, but it's not <i>required</i>.</dd>

<p>Back in July 2006, [[Category:Articles lacking sources]] and [[Category:Articles with unsourced statements]] were both deleted in two separate AfD nominations. In August 2006, a review of deletion was conducted for [[Category:Articles lacking sources]] and it was reinstated. Then, in September, <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">User:Dragons flight</a> appears to have reinstated <i>this</i> category (Articles with unsourced statements, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category_talk:Articles_with_unsourced_statements&amp;diff=74737319&amp;oldid=72967248" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category_talk:Articles_with_unsourced_statements&amp;diff=74737319&amp;oldid=72967248" rel="nofollow">here</a>) based on the review of deletion for the other more basic category [[Category:Articles lacking sources]]. It appears the Dragons flight may have confused (or otherwise conflated) the two cats in August, when he applied the review of deletion to [[Category:Articles with unsourced statements]]. AFAICS, only one review appears ever to have been actually discussed, which was for [[Category:Articles lacking sources]] (those with an “unreferenced” template).

<dd>Another note: this is sick stuff, folks. What we appear to have here is a monthly cataloguing within a maintenance category within another maintenance category, within yet another category of aticles requiring maintenance. In other words, under the original agenda of cataloguing articles that have templates identifying them as not being in keeping with <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and/or <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a>, we also have the additional category of articles with one or more little "fact" tamplates, applied to some individual clause or sentence, which has become a separate category with well over 20,000 articles (not counting, of course, the hundreds of thousands of articles in need of fact templates on one or more of the statements within). And on top of this, the review of the previously successful CfD appears to have managed to drag along the more complex and debatable subcategory which attempts to catalog all articles on the wiki that have one-or-more "fact" requests. As if that's not enough of an arbitrary and virtually useless headache, now there's a <i><b>monthly category within a category containing tens of thousands of articles that changes with every little "fact" template placed on a clause somewhere, within a category within a category</b></i> .

<dd>This category is closely related only insofar as it deals with sourcing. A "fact" request in an article is on a completely different level of operation than an "unreferenced" template for a whole article. In other words, it's a separate category, and one which evidently is widely misunderstood, and is arguably a misleading title that is too easily confused with "Articles lacking sources". This is in addition to the question of what is the value of having a category with nearly 25,000 articles, a category that changes every time someone makes a "fact" request for some little clause. And in addition to that, now we have a bot (SmackBot) that has labeled virtually every fact request on the wiki as "February 2007", a practice that accomplishes nothing more than to have notified everyone that the <i>bot</i> was active in February 2007. ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 17:08, 18 February 2007 (UTC) Moreover, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive130_2e94.html#CFD_vs._DRV:_action_review_requested" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive130">the ANI discussion</a> involved significant doubts and questions by several admins about this unilateral action to reinstate a "related" category without separate review. This category was deleted, unilaterally reinstated, and has gotten wildly out of control with tens of thousands of articles that change every time someone adds a fact template somewhere on the wiki. It's unsustainable and useless, and the unsustainability will never end as the demand for better sourcing continues to grow; indeed it's foreseeable that this category will ultimately consist of virtually every article on the wiki. But for now, it's been deleted, reinstated without review or clear consensus at ANI, and should immediately be deleted in accordance with the clear consensus for deletion in July 2006. ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 18:04, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The substantive issue was already decided in the CfD for this category. The essentially unilateral reinstatement of it on the basis that it's a related category is a procedural error that went "under the radar" here. Plainly it would not be sustainable WP "policy" to allow resurrection of deleted subcategories based on DRVs for larger, more important categories (in this case the cat containing articles with "unreferenced" templates). The most expedient course would be to merely delete per the original decision which was never DRV'd in the first place. ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 18:43, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. The restoration of the cat is akin to the sneaky little riders on bills that end up funding rain-forest research in Arizona.

<dd>You would create a DRV. It is "deletion review" and covers both things that are deleted and undeleted where there is a dispute about the outcome.

<dd>Thank you for pointing out the additional action in September. I notice that the "speedy keep" mentioned by Dragons flight was applied quite quickly, after a mere two days of being available for comment and with the outcome still being very much debated. Something is very, very wrong with this picture as it relates to "community actions". I will take a bit of extra time to review the broader implications of all this as it relates to WP community and administrative process, along with the substantive issues pertaining to this category.

<dd>OK, wait. CFD already reached a consensus to 'delete'. Why 1) does it still exist 2) and considering the previous CFD result why does DRV needs to followed to complete the deletion the community endorsed? It's clear looking this over that this category exists because due to process and the community's input being short-circuited. Considering the existance of the CFD result, I'm inclined to delete this category per the previous CFD and existing process and convention. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 20:19, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is plain, after at least a preliminary study of the situation here, that the "speedy keep" was arbitrarily implemented without proper feedback from the community. It's a confusing situation, in significant part because of the easy confusion of the two categories as to what each refers to ([[Category:Articles lacking sources]] (unreferenced) and [[Category:Articles with unsourced statements]]("fact")).</dd>
<dd>
<p>It is quite clear the last review of this category in September was never allowed to be brought to a proper completion, being short-circuited with a "speedy keep" after two days. I'm not an admin of course, but I already stated my position, and I'd certainly support an administrative action as FeloniousMonk mentions to go back to the last valid community action (a successful CfD), allowing anyone to initiate a new DRV if they feel compelled to do so. If such a DRV occurs, I would hope that the various admins would allow discussion of the issues to go the expected full course and be brought to a proper completion (is it 7 days minimum?). ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 20:44, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I find this category VERY useful. It serves to hold the articles by month subcategories in a clear, concise way. Makes it much easier to deal with by date. BTW, how are empty subcats dealt with? Feb 2005 and Jan 2006 are both empty and could probably be deleted. <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovenantD_b5a4.html" title="User:CovenantD">CovenantD</a> 08:11, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regarding CovenantD's recent edits to the article on <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a>, please see <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7Epoint_5ee0.html" title="WP:point">WP:point</a>. As demonstrated by his edits, there was only one purpose, which was to remove statements which had older fact tags attached. As also demonstrated by the edits, this user had no familiarity whatever with the subject involved (constructivist epistemology), removing a sentence that actually involved several issues that were a continuation of previous statements in the article which those involved in the article had decided to leave a "citation-needed" with the implicit understanding that it could wait until whenever someone got around to it, being the rather obscure subject that it is (i.e., constructivism and constructionism generally, social constructivism, radical constructionism/consctructivism, epistemological and hermeneutic constructivism, with confusion about which means precisely what even among scholars who write about it). The removed sentence in the article on <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> was actually integral to the section as a whole. This is not entirely atypical of the kind of event that can happen (with good intentions of course) when users endeavor to scramble around the wiki trying to fix one thing, in this case old fact templates placed into a monthly category, while failing to take into consideration the wide variety of issues that editors of individual articles have encountered. And some of us have day jobs too-- it's not as if we have every minute of every day to do the tough work of researching every little thing in every damn article. But oftentimes, editors know the statements to be verifiable and probably correct based on their previous research, but don't happen to have the old textbooks right at their fingertips, buried as they are beneath a pile of stuff in storage and such.</dd>
<dd>What I'm attempting to say here is that this issue of fact tags is not anywhere nearly as simple as some appear to believe. If there's going to be a policy on fact tags, it should properly be brought into the discussion in the wider community in such places as <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_sources_20af.html" title="WP:Reliable sources">WP:Reliable sources</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html" title="WP:BOT">WP:BOT</a>, and other such relevant fora. ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 22:20, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You call it disruptive; I call it cleanup. First of all, it is the responsibility of the person adding a statement to an article to cite that statement. From vandalism patrol, I've learned that a large number of old uncited statements are tagged that way incorrectly,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Silk&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113016882" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Silk&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113016882" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kapap&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113016312" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kapap&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113016312" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_Evolution&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113013808" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anime_Evolution&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113013808" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> because they are POV, unprovable or yes, vandalism mascarading as "citation needed."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fred_T._Goldberg%2C_Jr.&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113034557" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fred_T._Goldberg%2C_Jr.&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=113034557" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Rather than leave them in place indefinitely with a tag that implies <i>a citation just hasn't been found yet,</i> I remove them.

<dd>No, I didn't call it disruptive, though WP:point does. So my apology is hereby rendered for that part of what I was attempting to say, which is that it is action in pursuit of a single objective.</dd>
<dd>
<p>I should also say, however, that what I'm reading above reflects a serious misapprehension of how articles are written. Who the heck is <i>finding</i> these sources? And who the heck is finding sources for the tens of millions of <i>actual</i> unsourced statements that've been sitting around forever that don't happen to have "fact" tags attached? Many of these statements are <i>verifiable</i> per <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a>, quite within policy and agreed by the editors of a given article to be thusly in keeping with WP policy. No, it is not cleanup when one has absolutely no familiarity with the subject or the history of the article, and merely has an agenda to remove statements that someone else at some point in time decided to attach a "fact" tag to for whatever reason,. WP policy allows these tags to sit there forever by consensus of the editors who actually are involved in the writing of the article, if those editors want it to. I'm sorry, but this is not cleanup; it's cruising with a single-minded mission to clean up old fact tags without taking into consideration the other factors involved. The statements initially removed by CovenantD in this instance were incorrectly and inappropriately removed. Which brings me back to that the central problem is this category and automatic dating, with a single minded policy by a few WP users on a mission that was never dicussed by the wider community as to what would be its various side effects and as to whether the WP community as a whole wished to implement a de-facto policy to remove statements that happen to have fact tags attached to them, without requiring that the user removing the statements with older fact tags become familiar with the subject matter and article history and actually participate in the article in some meaningful way related to its content. ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 23:50, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>(random unindent) Apology accepted - I understand how these pages can change when you're not looking. However, I think we have a difference of opinion as to the interpretation of <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a>. From the "in a nutshell" box:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editors adding new material should cite a reliable source, or it may be challenged or removed by any editor.</li>
<li>The obligation to provide a reliable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not with those seeking to remove it.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, I am perfectly content to leave the relevant material in place on <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a>, with the appropriately dated tags, knowing that editors are aware and working on it. Of all the articles I dealt with in this round, only this one has been contested - that's a pretty good record. If there is consensus on the talk page that the tag is inappropriate, then remove it. At the very least, my actions have brought highlighted attention to a bit of the article that needs work.</p>
<p>Too many &lt;citation needed&gt; tags just get forgotten or can <u>never</u> be cited - it's those that I'm trying to clean up. Others may get caught up in that, but if their removal is contested I'm not going to fight it too much. It's all about building a better encyclopedia. <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovenantD_b5a4.html" title="User:CovenantD">CovenantD</a> 00:32, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
