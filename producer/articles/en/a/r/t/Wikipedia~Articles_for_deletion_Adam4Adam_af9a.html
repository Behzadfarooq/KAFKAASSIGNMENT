<li>This is somewhat misleading. For example, some of the references deal with the New York crime that involved the website. Of course these articles do not have the website as their <i>main</i> topic. An article that is about crystal meth use that refers numerous times to the website is still <i>about</i> crystal meth, not adam4adam, but nonetheless it is a valid source. The WP:WEB criteria are meant to help establish the notability of a site in lieu of other, obvious criteria. The fact that this site has been verifiably involved in several off-line news stories and that there is a steady accretion of relatively minor mentions of it seems to me to counterbalance the fact that we can't point to a single newspaper article that's <i>about</i> the site. -<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 05:13, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm using the main notability guideline, which states "A topic is <b>notable</b> if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Wikipedia%7EIndependent_sources_664e.html" title="Wikipedia:Independent sources">independent of the subject itself</a> and each other." The <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guidelines didn't seem as appropriate as they state "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself", and most of the sources make little reference to the content. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 05:21, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I have yet to see a reference to this site which was actually <i>about</i> this site.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I had no idea Adam4Adam was the #2 gay site (as your figures above indicate). I added material from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Advocate_6682.html" title="The Advocate">The Advocate</a></i> after seeing your mention. When I was done, I took a look at the article. Now I sort of <i>hope</i> the article gets deleted. Because it's free, Adam4Adam is used by many people without much money, and its also used by lots of non-White people. It has no cultural prestige and it seems to only get mentioned as part of blaming it for some ill or horrendous incident. <b><a href="../../../k/a/t/Katie_Couric_f7e1.html" title="Katie Couric">Katie Fucking Couric</a></b> isn't going to do a cute human interest story about how two boys met on Adam4Adam and are now dating steady. The owner(s) of Adam4Adam won't appear on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_View_4421.html" title="The View">The View</a></i>. Right now the article looks like a litany of crime, disease and other troubles. People use it for dating as well as sex. Using it is not a character flaw.

<p><b>Comment</b> The <i>content</i> of this site isn't too different than that of its competitors (I assume). The content <i>isn't</i> what's notable. Per <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP%7EWP_9509.html" title="WP:WP">WP:WP</a>:</p>

<p>It then says, "This page gives some rough guidelines which most Wikipedia editors use..." It doesn't demand that sources focus on the content.

<li>I am confident that <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatyrTN_0a7c.html" title="User:SatyrTN">SatyrTN</a> didn't realize that the <a href="../../../a/b/o/About.com.html" title="About.com">About.com</a> review was mostly lifted from the site (I think all this means is that the reviewer is lazy and agress with what the site reports itself to be, but nevertheless...). While the fact that <a href="../../../a/b/o/About.com.html" title="About.com">About.com</a> has a review about Adam4Adam at all all seems to add notability, I excluded that review on this basis. I have, however, been bothered by <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a>'s unexplained testimony that the FlavaMen review "is questionable". One rarely sees a review so <i>neutral</i> -- it praises and damns Adam4Adam almost in the same breath. <a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 16:45, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am also confident <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatyrTN_0a7c.html" title="User:SatyrTN">SatyrTN</a> made the comment in good faith, however I was noting the content of the review for the benefit of any further contributors. In my opinion the FlavaMen review is questionable because of the lack of in-depth review. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> classes trivial coverage as "a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site", and in my opinion the review is borderline trivial, hence my questionable comment.

<li>Thank you for clarifying the basis of your opinion.

<li><b>Question</b> - <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiable</a> sources list Adam4Adam as the #2 gay dating site in the world (or at least the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English-speaking_world.html" title="English-speaking world">English-speaking world</a>) in Sept 2005 and as the #3 such site in December 2006. Is there no guideline anywhere that suggests a website, book, company, toy, device, whatever that appears on published lists as one of the most-used in the world has <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>?--<a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 01:02, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Answer</b> - I got impatient and found an answer to my own query. A website is also a business and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28organizations_and_companies%29_2788.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies)">Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies)</a> says the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An organization is automatically notable if it meets <i>any</i> of the following criteria: (1) The commercial organization is listed on ranking indices of important companies produced by well-known and independent publications...The broader or the more specialized the index, the less notability it establishes for the company.</p>
</blockquote>
These guidelines explicitly allow for indices more specialized than mega-lists like the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortune_500.html" title="Fortune 500">Fortune 500</a>. Adam4Adam appears as one of the top ten dating sites (gay, straight or otherwise) in the United States (although not in the world as I stated previously). On Wikipedia we do not distinguish between a company and its services (look at <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonald%27s_700d.html" title="McDonald's">McDonald's</a>, <a href="../../../h/%26/r/H%26R_Block_8c85.html" title="H&amp;R Block">H&amp;R Block</a> or anything you can think of). Therefore, per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28organizations_and_companies%29_2788.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies)">Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies)</a>, Adam4Adam is <b>"automatically notable"</b> and it would be so even if we didn't have over a dozen newspapers references. --<a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 11:25, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> A list of "top 10 dating sites" is hardly a "company ranking index", by any stretch of the imagination. Furthermore the "broader or the more specialized" comment <i>specifically</i> refers to stock market indices, not lists of dating sites. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 11:48, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - A list of "top five online florists" is a ranking index. A list of "top twenty pizzerias in New York" is a ranking index. <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_market_index.html" title="Stock market index">Stock market index</a> is a narrowly defined term. "Company ranking index" is not. As was predicted above, we're Wikilawyering. The way this article looks now, it doesn't need me to say any more. --<a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouseOfScandal_3f74.html" title="User:HouseOfScandal">House of Scandal</a> 12:35, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Since this site and the controversial aspects of its usage have become newsworthy, I believe it should stay. The article is not a mere advertisement for the site and serves to highlight a particular group of crimes perpetrated against gay men through manipulation of the sites services. Since my own interest in LGBT studies is in the area of crimes against LGBT people, crimes perpetrated by LGBT people and cultural reactions to both, I will attempt to improve this article and maintain it's quality.<a href="../../../l/i/s/User%7ELisapollison_fe0d.html" title="User:Lisapollison">Lisapollison</a> 00:44, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
