While not exactly a vanity press, <a href="http://www.immanion-press.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.immanion-press.com/" rel="nofollow">Immanion</a> is a small, print-on-demand house, which employs Ellwood. As he is in charge of buying projects for the imprint his books appear under, it is very close to the same situation as a vanity press or self-publishing. The "press" store is on CafePress, which may also be who prints their books. Also, article was started by <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosencomet_99ef.html" title="User:Rosencomet">Rosencomet</a> who is now under investigation for spamming Wikipedia with non-notable articles.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unless he's done something more substantial than what is already in the article, I can't really see keeping it. My understanding of Immanion: it was originally a vehicle to keep a particular SF/Fantasy author's books in print (Her name escapes me at the moment.) They've branched out to other authors and subjects but as a print-on-demand house, I'd say they are not much above a vanity press or even web publication. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Pigman_7e6d.html" title="User:Paul Pigman"><b>Pigman</b></a> (<a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Pigman_813e.html" title="User talk:Paul Pigman">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Pigman_6033.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Pigman">contribs</a>) 02:29, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>reply</b> interesting. Helpful, but still doesn't point to notability. If no one has reviewed his work, however, then he still isn't notable.

If we can produce such coverage, I would change my vote.

<li><b>reply</b>: Anyone who pays for a UPC code and ISBN registration can sell their books through Amazon.com and Barnes and Noble online. They now carry many self-published books due to this.

<li>You mean: "Founded in 1959 by Thomas D. Clareson, Extrapolation was published at the College of Wooster until 1979 when it moved to the Kent State University Press. A decade later, Clareson stepped down as editor and was succeeded by Donald M. Hassler of the KSU English Department. In 2002 it moved to the University of Texas at Brownsville in Brownsville, Texas. At that time Donald M. Hassler became executive editor, and the position of editor was filled by Javier A. Martinez of UTB's English Department. The journal was the first to publish academic work on science fiction and fantasy and continues to be a leader in that specialized genre in the literature of popular culture." "Extrapolation is published quarterly by University of Texas, Brownsville. Subscription Rates: $18 one year, $34 two years individual; $28 one year, $54 two years institutional" What is your point??

<dd>Future notability is <b>never</b> a reason for inclusion. Any one of us might end up notable tomorrow, but we don't go around writing articles that say, "Aaron might be famous in the future, but for now he's just another college student." Arguing notability because you've heard of the author is also fallacious -- plenty of things exist that are verifiable, and thus can be mentioned to someone else, but that dosen't make them notable. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 00:04, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That Ellwood's books are available <i>online</i> through Barnes and Noble is nowhere near as noteworthy as having them available on a shelf somewhere. Given <a href="../../../c/u/i/User%7ECuivienen_fddf.html" title="User:Cuivienen">Cuivi</a>'s commentary, the only shelves this book is on are in Ellwood's house. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 00:04, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Taylor Ellwood contacted me today and requested that I disclose that a group I am part of declined his offer to publish one of our projects on Immanion. Though I thought I made it clear to him in our brief exchange that the reason for our declining his offer was the details I give above (plus other shortcomings of the press I did not detail) he seems to believe this is a personal issue. He says he and I know each other. However, AFAIK, our contact was limited to two e-mails, IIRC, where he laid out details of the offer, my colleagues and I asked him questions about the press, and after research and discussion among ourselves, we decided to decline. Mr. Ellwood and I do know a few people in common, as is common in the small pond of the Pagan community, but we have never met and I really know very little about him beyond those brief e-mails. You can see our recent exchange <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html#Taylor_Ellwood_AfD" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">here</a> on my talk page. --<a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna">Kathryn NicDhàna</a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a>♦<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a> 22:10, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As another note of disclosure, I was part of the group (eight co-authors) Kathryn mentioned above that declined Taylor (as editor) and Immanion's offer to publish our project. I had no interchange with Taylor except for reading a couple of e-mails that were forwarded to the whole group. I did much of the research into Immanion which informed our group's decision to decline Taylor's offer. The information I found at that time is why I'm not inclined to view it as a significant press. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Pigman_7e6d.html" title="User:Paul Pigman"><b>Pigman</b></a> (<a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Pigman_813e.html" title="User talk:Paul Pigman">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Pigman_6033.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Pigman">contribs</a>) 22:33, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
