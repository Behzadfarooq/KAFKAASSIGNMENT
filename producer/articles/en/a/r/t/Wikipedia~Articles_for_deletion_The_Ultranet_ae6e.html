<li>That's ridiculous. Of the articles you think should be deleted, half don't exist on this encyclopaedia (they're red links).

<li><b>Comment</b> Тhis has gone beyond being serious. It's become a joke. Wiki as a concept sucumbs to its own openess due to the will of a handful of people who make judgments on whether articles are qualified for entry into an encyclopaedia, yet none of the handful involved has any qualifications to do so whatsover, other than being here long enough. That makes Wiki an utterly silly thing. There are thousands after thousands of entries of anonimous people, but the handful of puberty (or God knows what other problems) striken guys is after the IQ related ones most likely in order to prove to themselves that "these horrible, undiscovered creatures of misterious aptitude can be overcomed afterall". Well, you know what, Wiki is not all that important as you would like it to be. Stevan Damjanovic</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> And you know, the joke is on Wikipedia and the admins. As you can see from Byrgenwulf's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=20060721074248&amp;target=Byrgenwulf" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=20060721074248&amp;target=Byrgenwulf" rel="nofollow">contribution history</a>, his very first edit to Wikipedia was on July 2, 2006. He made a few innocuous edits (and waited a week, patient boy) before beginning his onslaught against the CTMU article (and everything else related to Chris Langan). In light of this and the other specific deceptive tactics outlined by Tim Smith on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_July_20" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_July_20" rel="nofollow">AfD review page</a>, this user should be permanently banned. <a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 14:28, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>This seems to have become a massive campaign now to thoroughly discredit me: if any passing admins could do something about it, I would be grateful. "Singlemindedness", DrL? Compare your editing history and mine...see how many different articles I have worked on, look at the article I am busy with in my sandbox etc. Drl, on the other hand has only edited articles to do with Langan, as has been pointed out by many over the past few days (not that that isn't her right, of course). And as for "deceptiveness"...Tim Smith never said I was being deceptive, he actually expressed willingness to work with me because I seemed the most co-operative among the editors who wished the CTMU to go. I think "deceptive", DrL, might however be used to describe linking to an out of date editing history, as you have done above. I am not making mayhem, but trying to make Wikipedia a <i>legitimately</i> better encyclopaedia, not by filling it with vanispamcruftisement, but by cleaning up articles that need help, writing new ones on neglected topics, and so on. And I actually <i>apologised</i> to DrL (see her talk page) for if what I have done has caused upset, because I strongly believe DrL is personally involved in many of these articles (I could be wrong, but an apology is not out of place, even then). Please stop this nonsense now, DrL. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 15:13, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> User CH/Hillman evidently fails to understand what a "shill" is. Strangely, the definition is right there on the Wikipedia page to which he links. Here's how "shill" is defined on that page: "A shill is an associate of a person selling goods or services who pretends no association to the seller and assumes the air of an enthusiastic customer."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The author of this article is not selling goods or services; the Ultranet is a project of the Mega Foundation, a nonprofit (charitable purpose) entity obliged to spend everything it takes in on its own maintenance. Nor is the author playing the role of seller or customer. Thus, the "shilling" allegation is just an abuse of the deletion process.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Wikipedia page continues: "In some cases, the members of an organization or the employees of a company may monitor and/or participate in public discussions and groups. Such people are not shills, since they don't attempt to mislead others." Anyone accusing anyone else of "shilling" would therefore need to present evidence that misleading information has been included in the article. If that were going to happen, it would already have happened.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia's anti-shilling guidelines are intended to prevent hucksters from using Wikipedia to fatten their bank accounts and enhance their personal prospects and the value of their personal interests. But that clearly isn't the case here. So please desist with the abusive and unsubstantiated allegations. <a href="../../../a/s/m/User%7EAsmodeus_3d16.html" title="User:Asmodeus">Asmodeus</a> 19:56, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Asmodeus, if you had read further in that article, you would find <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shill.html#Shills_on_message_boards" title="Shill">here</a> the following sentence: "In online discussion media, such as message boards, discussion forums, and newsgroups, shills may pose as independent experts, satisfied consumers, or “innocent” parties with specific opinions in order to further the interests of an organization in which they have an interest, such as a commercial vendor or special-interest group." Now, whatever the articles of incorporation of the Mega foundation might be, and even taking into account that Wikipedia is not a message board or a "blog" (despite how some people choose to use it), the MF surely counts as a "special interest group". Therefore, someone who is affiliated to that group, particularly in an official capacity, and acts in a forum such as Wikipedia in manner promoting the interests of that group (like demanding that it have an article about it when it hardly merits it), <i>without declaring their interests</i>, is shilling. By definition. Moreover, DrL was caught posting links in the "Chicken or the Egg" article, posting links to the Mega Foundation website <b>which ask for money to view</b> (proof: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_chicken_or_the_egg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55761260" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_chicken_or_the_egg&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55761260" rel="nofollow">here</a> is her edit; <a href="http://www.megafoundation.org/MegaPress/Titles/aokpreview.html" class="external text" title="http://www.megafoundation.org/MegaPress/Titles/aokpreview.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> is the link she posted). Now, I'm not sure where that money goes to, whether it is the Mega Foundation's coffers or Langan's own pocket, and nor do I care. But I do think that this action constitutes a gross abuse of Wikipedia for monetary gain. And, once again, shilling, as well as "link spam", <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanispamcruftisement_fe39.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanispamcruftisement">Vanispamcruftisement</a> and countless other offences. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 20:03, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Of course, if the link I posted above suddenly goes dead or changes in nature (like by not soliciting money anymore), we'll all know what's happened...but that's fine, because I have captured a copy of it.

<li><b>Comment</b> That would have been my preference, but the TOC was a pdf page that did not identify the book. So I linked to the page that talked about the book, and also linked to the TOC. True, there was a link to purchase the book. But I couldn't find a better link and wanted to add a citation.

<dd>That's a feeble explanation, I think. The link in question wasn't just some obscure little button on the corner of the page, the sole purpose of that page is to sell copies of Langan's book: right in the middle is a big $10 price tag, with Paypal information, etc. etc. Right at the bottom is a <i>tiny</i> little link to the ToC, which is clearly an ancillary purpose of that page. And I find it very difficult to assume good faith, DrL, in light of the amount of "good faith" you have assumed about me and <i>my</i> intentions. Nonetheless, I merely have merely stated facts: other users may interpret them however they wish. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 20:31, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Participants in this AfD should be aware that its initiator is engaging in vendetta. User Byrgenwulf registered at Wikipedia on July 2, 2006, three weeks ago, and launched an all-out editing/AfD attack on Christopher Langan, his notable and widely-publicized theory the CTMU (which Byrgenwulf irrationally disputes, but was quickly shown not to comprehend), the Mega Foundation, the Ultranet, and so on <i>ad nauseam</i>. Byrgenwulf even hurled himself into an AfD against an IQ society to which Langan once belonged, within minutes of its inception through the offices of a prior confederate. To illicitly gain support for his personal blitzkrieg against the CTMU, Byrgenwulf transparently misled and recruited people sympathetic to his viewpoint from areas of the Wikipedia web complex not directly related to the topic of that article, tarring it in the process. This is called "abuse of the deletion process", and it violates Wikipedia policy.</dd>

<dd>User Byrgenwulf is in the deceptive habit of demanding verification for everything he disputes - that is, everything he can dispute - until he manages to identify a verificative link which he can paint as violating some aspect of Wikipedia policy (all nonprofit entities solicit donations; they need to do so in order to survive, and nobody is allowed to personally profit from this). This gives him a pretext for expanding his attack, preferably with accompaniment by an unwitting chorus which he has actively misled and recruited from inappropriate sectors of the Wikipedia community. Regarding Byrgenwulf's spurious "shilling" allegations, people who post articles on Wikipedia are virtually all interested in the topics of those articles, and therefore belong to "special interest groups" associated with those topics. Ordinarily, they do not post a detailed confession regarding the exact nature of their interest; it is sufficient that they maintain neutrality, verify their edits, and maintain relevance to the topic at hand. User Byrgenwulf is simply attempting, once again, to twist and misrepresent standard practice at Wikipedia in order to gain a dishonest advantage over his victims.</dd>
