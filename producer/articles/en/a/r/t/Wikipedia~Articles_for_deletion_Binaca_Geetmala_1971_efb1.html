<p><b>Delete</b> - Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information? nonsense? cruft? There is a whole series of these articles, but I am following guidance at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> to list one article here first before bundling. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G_856f.html" title="User:Brian G">Brian G</a> 04:01, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Neutral</b> for now. Frankly, I think that this has no business on Wikipedia. But I am worried about systemic bias: do we really think that this would get the axe if this was an american radio show's list? I see a lot of lists concerning Bilboard hits and no one is putting these into question.

<li><b>Comment</b> This isn't really comparable to Billboard. Billboard is the major national chart of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. If this were a <i>national</i> Indian chart, I would vote to keep it. This is more like a chart issued by a local US radio station, though. To be completely fair, however, I will disclose this information: I recently voted to delete a comparable American radio chart summary at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_KROQ_Top_106.7_Countdowns_75b7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/KROQ Top 106.7 Countdowns">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/KROQ Top 106.7 Countdowns</a> for similar reasons, but that one ended up kept, so if you're looking at thisprecedent alone, it'd be a weak keep.

<dd>To be strictly accurate, the result on KROQ was No Consensus, not Keep, partially based on some "Keep because we kept it the last time" votes.

<p><b>COMMENT</b>: Gassy Guy let me correct you. Binaca geetmala is NOT a chart issued by a local radio station - rather it is an old program that used to play in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and the middle east through radio stations in Sri Lanka and then India. The program played every week from 1952 till mid 1994. The annual charts were a summation of the weekly charts. It was the ONLY countdown show of Hindi film songs in South Asia and the Middle East during its times with many millions of listeners every week - in other words it was definitely comparable to the Billboard charts. The historical significance of everything that I (and others) put up in these pages are immense for the many South Asian heritage readers that you have and will have. And yes, history whether it be musical history as represented here, or movie history or political history or military history is always encyclopaedic and deserve a place on Wikipedia - irrespective of whether we are talking of US history or the history of some other nation. And by the way - it is NOT an indiscriminate collection of nonsense as observed by one very wise (?) commentator here - For everyone's information, the cultural history of some country other than the US does not make it indiscriminate nonsense&#160;!!!--Ghoshi 17:45, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Can you at least add some explanation into these articles? Imagine an ignorant Westerner (me, for example) stumbling onto this article. What is it about? No way to tell. All I see is what looks like a list of foreign words or names. Nothing says it's a list of songs. Nothing tells me what the entries mean. Is "Zindagi Ek Safar" a song title or an artist? What about "Andaaz"? "Shankar-Jaikishan"? It's like some of the articles we see about an episode of a television program that forget to mention what the program is. The article needs to provide context. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 18:25, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Maybe we can put this group of articles under some suitable Hindi Film Music or Bollywood film music topic - I will search for something like that - I'm sure it exists on Wikipedia. It will take a while for me (and others) to put in all the information and explanations - so please be patient - I promise at the end of our project everything will be well explained. Please do not delete the group of articles - i will keep adding info, and find a suitable topic under which we can place it . Thanks --Ghoshi 18:57, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> While I'm still iffy on whether the lists themselves have a place here, I do believe that the songs themselves deserve mention as popular songs. Is there any way to incorporate them into the years in music articles (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1970_in_music.html" title="1970 in music">1970 in music</a> et al)? I just read the 1970 one and it has a horrible lack of material about non-Western music. Anyone have any thoughts into possible integration of the songs into articles of that sort? GassyGuy 23:32, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> boy... I can't believe I'm actually fighting to keep this article... I understand the argument that just because we made a mistake on the KROQ list does not force us to make the same mistake here but I will say this again: <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">some people</a> put a lot of effort in trying to develop the non-north-american content to Wikipedia and I think that we should think twice about holding different standards for other cultures. Of course, who's going to notice this article being deleted? One or two people if we're lucky. In contrast there will be a few dozens of KROQ listeners ready to step up and defend the "I know this radio station so this should be kept" line. What's the rush here? at least one editor seems to know what these lists are. Let's give it a few months to expand, explain the context and so on. If we conclude that the whole thing is still unverifiable cruft, then I'll be happy to delete. In the meantime I think this deserves a bit of a chance. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 01:43, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Respectfully, I don't think that there is an issue will all the "poor people" that you are concerned with. It appears that the article was a simple copy/paste job and has no edit history to speak of. Of course, more work may have gone into it, but I don't see any evidence of that.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The Binaca Geetmala used to air on <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Ceylon_b707.html" title="Radio Ceylon">Radio Ceylon</a>. Somewhat like the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Home_Service_4c21.html" title="BBC Home Service">BBC Home Service</a> at the time, <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_India_Radio_7053.html" title="All India Radio">All India Radio</a> would play a very limited amount of popular music. Radio Ceylon was the sole outlet for much popular music, and the Binaca Geetmala its primary countdown show. Top ten lists from the Binaca Geetmala, the programme itself, and its legendary presenter Ameen Sayani are all encyclopaedic articles. At least, they are if Billboard is. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 05:26, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Changing my vote to definite keep</b> as I think there is now sufficient indication that this is waaaaaaay more notable than the KROQ countdown! Of course, there should be an expand-tag added to the whole bunch of articles but they deserve their spot. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 05:54, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> First, let me say that I was never in doubt that the Binaca Geetmala itself was notable. Second, based on my understanding of this, this is a year-end chart of a popular music radio show. I'm starting to feel more that we should err on the side of caution and not delete this one, but first I would like to ask - was this a daily countdown? Weekly? Monthly? Currently, we have year-end charts from this show. If this chart is analogous to Billboard, is it possible to format it similar to the Billboard lists? For example, rather than a year-end chart, could there be a chart from each year showing the song that headed Binaca Geetmala's countdown week by week? GassyGuy 08:01, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Comment</b> - While I did do some searching before I entered this nomination, reading more at WP:CSB and WP:OSTRICH have convinced me that perhaps I did not do enough. I'm still not happy with the lists as they are and hope that they would be cleaned up, and I do feel that this generated some good collaborative discussion about that improvement that likely would never have happened if I had simply posted a question to the talk page. At the same time, I must acknowledge that deleting this article is probably not the way to go and am <b>leaning towards withdrawal</b> of this Afd. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G_856f.html" title="User:Brian G">Brian G</a> 13:22, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
