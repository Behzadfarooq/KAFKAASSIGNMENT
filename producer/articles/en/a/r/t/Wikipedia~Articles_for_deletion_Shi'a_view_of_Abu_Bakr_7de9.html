<li><b>Merge and delete.</b> The contrast between Sunni and Shi'a views on <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Bakr_b9a5.html" title="Abu Bakr">Abu Bakr</a> properly belongs within the Abu Bakr main article, similarly to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary%2C_the_mother_of_Jesus_3bac.html#Religious_attitudes_towards_Mary" title="Mary, the mother of Jesus">this section in the article on Mary the mother of Jesus</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. As I've tried to explain elsewhere in the present sudden eruption of nominations for deletion of articles generically titled "(Muslim denomination)'s view of X", this is not anymore POV than for example <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_view_of_Jesus_e834.html" title="Jewish view of Jesus">Jewish view of Jesus</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_views_of_Jesus_2f92.html" title="Christian views of Jesus">Christian views of Jesus</a>, but instead legitimate article spinout (see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html#Article_spinouts_-_.22Summary_style.22_articles" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking#Article spinouts - "Summary style" articles</a>). Note, by the way, that "Jewish" is meant here in the religious sense of "Judaism"; in fact, the page redirects to <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism%27s_view_of_Jesus_f709.html" title="Judaism's view of Jesus">Judaism's view of Jesus</a>. Supposing that there was such a thing as Judaism's view of Hitler, and assuming it was notable (unlike – in my opinion – Christian views of Hanukkah) and verifiable, yes, then Wikipedia should report on it. And if that view implies that Hitler was wicked, let it be so reported. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:06, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> - IN the abscence of a Sunni view of Abu Bakr, and the small size of the <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Bakr_b9a5.html" title="Abu Bakr">Abu Bakr</a> page itself - there is no real reason not to merge it as one, for now at least. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 14:54, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Remark</b>. For this article I get a word count of 1003 words (not counting boilerplate, ToC and [edit] buttons). For the main article <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Bakr_b9a5.html" title="Abu Bakr">Abu Bakr</a> <i>without</i> the Shi'a view section I find likewise 1340 words. That means that after the proposed merge this one section will constitute about 43% of the article (1003/(1340+1003) × 100%), which is clearly out of balance. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 16:18, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, that's always a problem with AfD discussions that result in <b>merge</b>. Who is supposed to actually perform the merge? The closing admin? In general it requires some expertise on the topic to do this right. In the present case there is a very simple implementation of a possible merge outcome, and if I was the closing admin I'd take the easy way out and let the normal Wikipedia collective process take care of hopefully restoring the balance.

<li><b>Strong Delete/Merge</b> fork article, despite what is said about these types of "Shia view" articles they didn't "become to large in the main article" and grew naturally with a consensus to make a subpage.

<dd>There are other cases of this in the page history, ultimately Striver sees that he can not get his way in the article and creates this page. And the users in the main article don't really care because at least it gets Striver off of adding material in the main article.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 18:04, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I recommend reading the talk page, in particular Archive 1, where you can see that Striver may be awkward as an editor but is not particularly uncooperative and very definitely willing to argue with (whether you agree or not) mostly reasonable arguments for a Wikipedia editor. You can also see a recurring confusion between Striver's desire to include a report on what the Shi'a view is (which in and by itself is or should be a neutral issue) and the desire of some others to report "what actually happened" (which almost certainly leads to POV texts, one way or another). In light of the present discussion this contribution in the Archive – a perfect example of the confusion referred to – is interesting: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Abu_Bakr&amp;oldid=41314361#For_brevity.2C_simply_present_both_perspectives" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Abu_Bakr&amp;oldid=41314361#For_brevity.2C_simply_present_both_perspectives" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 19:24, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I apologize if anything can be considered an "attack" on my edit, all I am trying to do is show how these articles are not articles that started in the main articles and became to large to the point where a new page was created but rather because the user did not get his way in the original article he created these pages to avoid reverts to his edits which is the very definition of a fork article. I also find it remarkable how Lambiam stating I am on a "crusade" everywhere I go is not considered an attack. Furthermore, to Lambian, no he is not "reasonable" if you actually see the page history you see that he continues to revert regardless of the fact that the clear consensus is against the content that he puts in the article.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 02:01, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> as Lambiam pointed out, i participiated at lenght in the disccusion in the main page, and it all boiled down that having the Shi'a view fully represented in detail would give it undue weight, in short, all informatinon does not fitt there. The problem is not <i>what happened</i>, but what <i>Shi'a view</i> what happened. And that aspekt does not fitt in the articles main page.

<dd>As for Zora's comment regarding that this article was not developed in the Abu Bakr article, and then broken out of it, it is not a valid arguement for deleting this article as is now, a articles history is never grounds for deleting, what matters is how it is now. And as it is now, it is to much information to include in the main article whitout un-balancing it.
