<p>Online browser game launched last year. No indication of notability or a large number of players. Doesn't seem to adhere to <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. 1680 google hits.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Given that Shartak, a web-based "browser" game isn't technically software, it shouldn't be expected to meet these guidelines. Also, how is Alexa's demonstrably flawed site ranking valid or relevant? The game has maintained over 1000 "active" players for several months, despite only launching publicly since Jan '06.--<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackel_6f4f.html" title="User:Jackel">-Jackel</a> 21:44, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Google hits and Alexa ranking (Or amount of players) Should have no bearing on whether or not an article for it should exist. Wikipedia is an <i>encyclopedia</i> and should have as much information on all subjects as possible.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: No, Wikipedia has an official policy on what it is not, including "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information". See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. --<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 17:48, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you should rethink your definition of an "indiscriminate collection of information". The article in question does NOT fall under that category. (As a side note, I'd like to mention that you seem to be against keeping both this and another browser based game, Nexus War. It appears that you have a distaste for browser based games, and this would be in conflict with many of wikipedia's policies.)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: My reference to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> was to your claim that "wikipedia should have as much information on all subjects as possible". Also, please refrain from making personal attacks, they do not help your "cause". Especially when they are unfounded (I did not nominate the other article for deletion) and if you're making them anonymously (smells like socks). --<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 17:11, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was only simply stating that you seem to have dislike these games. Not once did I say that you *did* dislike them, just that it looks that way. It is by no means a personal attack, and I most certainly did NOT say it anonymously. Infact, I'm displaying more personal information than you, as all I see is your profile name and a link to it, and my IP address is displayed under the history. Thats far more than anonymous. I'd also like to note that we are getting off topic. Let's focus on the task at hand, shall we?</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I don't even like this game and have never actually played it, but I think you're getting a bit over-enthusiastic with the deletion proposals here. By your "criteria" that aren't even policy, by the way, we'd end up with no articles on webgames at all. --<a href="../../../k/e/o/User%7EKeolah_f37e.html" title="User:Keolah">Keolah</a> 00:07, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: I like Shartak I find it relaxing, and as several people have pointed out <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> are guidelines not policy and if you check the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> page, you will find no refernces to deleting things for failing <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. --<a href="../../../m/e/i/User%7EMeirleach_4434.html" title="User:Meirleach">Meirleach</a> 00:16, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: None of you have still haven't made any good points as to why a webgame with barely 1000 players is notable enough to be included on wikipedia.--<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 00:59, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Notability is not an acceptable guideline for deletion. It isn't a vanity page, nor obvious patent nonsense, and it isn't spam nor copyright infringement. You haven't given good reason why it should be deleted. Alexa and Google are also not acceptable sole reasons for deletion (In fact, one could argue that Alexa is non-notable in and of itself.&#160;:P) --<a href="../../../k/e/o/User%7EKeolah_f37e.html" title="User:Keolah">Keolah</a> 01:11, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The google and alexa information wasn't included as an argument for deletion but to indicate how trivial the subject is. Lack of notability IS an acceptable reason for deletion. Articles are being deleted constantly for not being notable.--<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 01:20, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> doesn't apply because the article is primarily about a game, not the code that runs it (hence <a href="../../../b/r/o/Category%7EBrowser-based_games_e093.html" title="Category:Browser-based games">Category:Browser-based games</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Category%7EMassively_multiplayer_online_games_1192.html" title="Category:Massively multiplayer online games">Category:Massively multiplayer online games</a>). Besides, WP:SOFTWARE is only about "software applications" (see <a href="../../../a/p/p/Application_software.html" title="Application software">Application software</a>). Furthermore, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> pertains to "web-specific content" such as "webcomics, podcasts, blogs, Internet forums, online magazines and other media, web portals and web hosts". While web-specific content is not limited to those categories, it doesn't seem like Shartak, which is first and foremost a <i>game</i>, is the sort of thing that's being discussed. And finally, regarding <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, I think it's essential to read the entire section for an idea of what its heading means. (The section consists mainly of a list of kinds of articles that should not be included in Wikipedia according to consensus.) Interestingly enough, <i>none</i> of the eleven items in that list concern this article, so I'm curious as to how a summary like "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information" can be an argument for deletion when its explanation is clearly not. — <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElembis_b8b1.html" title="User:Elembis">Elembis</a> 04:38, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I think we may have a disagreement as to where the burden of proof lies. To my knowledge there are no policies and guidelines that make statements like "articles about games are always okay" (<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> is just an essay), but there are plenty of policies and guidelines about what <i>isn't</i> okay (like <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a>). Doesn't that strongly suggest that any article is acceptable unless it violates a policy or guideline? Doesn't the very act of <i>proposing</i> an article for deletion imply that the person making the proposal has a case to make? — <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElembis_b8b1.html" title="User:Elembis">Elembis</a> 04:38, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
