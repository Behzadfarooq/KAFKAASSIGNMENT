<p>I see no copyright violation and wonder what is gained by deleting the Hogan articles from wikipedia. Hogan´s writings offer a unique perspective from an intellectual who also has extensively experiencesd life and culture in Latin America. All of us will be diminished if the choice is made to delete.</p>

<p>No copyright violation. This material is in the public domain. Also, Hogan's books (with the exception of Mexican Mornings) were all published buy university presses and small presses, not vanity presses. He's as notable as Jimmy Santyiago Baca and has won most of the same literary prizes including the NEA. In addition, his credit as historian appears on the Berenger movie and his book is a best seller in Mexico.

<dd>How can it be public domain when that Web site has a prominent: "© 2000 Michael Hogan" on it? You can't have it both ways.

<p>Seems like the copyright notice on the author's page is to protect the images. The other information, date and place of birth, books published, etc. is clearly in the public domain: birth records, books in print, Directory of American Poets, etc. I am not the author but it seems to me that this entry should stay whether it was submitted by him or his wife or daughter, or just some fan. He is a well-recognized writer and certainly appears as author of many books on amazon.com, has several articles in monthly review, alterinfos, and seems to be pretty famous in Latin America.,etc. We wouldn't turn down a page on Clinton just because Chelsea submited it. 200.52.124.151 20:26, 26 September 2006 (UTC)Melissa When I google Michael Hogan+Mexico I find about a hundred entries mostly referring to the author's articles on Latin Amnerica, his books on history and poetry. Fairly notable in Latin America, I would say. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 201.116.194.50 (<a href="../../../2/0/1/User_talk%7E201.116.194.50.html" title="User talk:201.116.194.50">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_201.116.194.50_68cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/201.116.194.50">contribs</a>).</small> I feel a little responsible for this thread. In my work as a professor at the University of Guadalajara I was browsing through Wikipedia to see how discriminating my students might be in their online research (on various subjects), when I came upon the site listing all the "Michael Hogans". Noting that the "American poet" was listed but there was no biographical info, which seemed both a necessary and an easy blank to fill in, and being short on time but wanting the info to be as accurate as possible, I simply emailed the poet himself and suggested he provide the data -- never imagining that questions would arise as to his "importance". I think the copyright issue has been thoroughly addressed, so will just briefly concentrate on why an entry on this writer is of value. I and my colleagues, in the U.S., Mexico and other countries, have all had students of various ages who very much wanted to research both the work and life of Michael Hogan, poet (and historian, essayist...) He has been a working, regularly-published writer since the 1970's (the majority of his publications by respected U.S. presses, and the few seeming "self-publications" having been sponsored by well-known Latin American educational institutions -- choices of presses having been made in response to requests by educators on both sides of the border, and in other countries, for more immediately-available texts.) He has worked with many other poets who are inarguably part of any "canon" of poetry in English (Baca, Bukowski, Ginsberg, Piercy, Stafford, etc. etc.) and is well-known as a valiant and gifted director of successful programs aimed toward both advanced and under-served communities of writing students. He also maintains strong links with other writers and scholars throughout the U.S. and Mexico, in Ireland, Italy and Germany, etc. -- another reason that his presence on the "world-wide" web makes particular sense. And, if breadth of readership were a criterion, the fact that his work currently appears in important English literature anthologies (by the most established U.S./international publishers) and thus reaches hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of students, would be motive enough to have his background data available to them. If actual authorship of this wikipedia entry is of concern, there are various of Hogan's colleagues throughout the world who'd compose another version -- as I noted at the beginning, my concern was for accuracy in the entry, and that has been achieved.Lmayo 01:07, 27 September 2006 (UTC)Prof. L.
