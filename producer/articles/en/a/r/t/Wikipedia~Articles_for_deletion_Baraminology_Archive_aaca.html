<p>This is an article on a field of study that has no actual studies - at best a few popular books and such. While the main term is not ridiculously uncommon on google (~11,000 ghits), the article actually spends its time on four subterms: Holobaramin (788 ghits), Monobaramin (659 ghits), Apobaramin (422 ghits), and polybaramin (284 ghits) - given the number of Wikipedia mirrors out there, this is ridiculously low. I think we should delete it, or possibly redirect (given the dubiousness of its content, a merge seems inappropriate) to the more notable (if somewhat problematic regarding Undue Weight) <a href="../../../c/r/e/Created_kind.html" title="Created kind">Created kind</a>. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 04:49, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> No strong opinion yet, need time to think about it. However, the term is used by both creationists and their critics and the term itself has 13,000 hits on google. Also, I really would like to keep it for one reason - correct Hebrew(I think) would not be "baramin" but "min baru" and so it seems the people who coined the phrase were native English speakers and didn't know much hebrew. Now, that's currently OR but if we can find a citation for it I'd love to have that detail there. It is just so funny. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:04, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A fair point in theory, but I don't trust any of the actual content. I suppose we could do radical surgery on it, but it might not leave us with a viable article left. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 05:12, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Fairly notable term. Most religions don't have any studies. --<a href="../../../i/n/e/User%7EIneffable3000_f9fb.html" title="User:Ineffable3000">Ineffable3000</a> 05:37, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>...Well, I'm not quite sure this counts as research - the papers seem to be made as difficult to read as possible, but it looks like what they're mainly doing is showing that small branches of the evolutionary tree are true - hence we can ignore lower levels of the tree. But anyway, surely the notable term is "baramin" not "baraminology"? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 06:15, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Comment</b> The evidence for "no studies" seems to be a link to a medical index which gives just two hits for "universal common descent". Try <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Baraminology" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Baraminology" rel="nofollow">Google scholar</a> for a few more hits - it may all be nonsense but it seems to be there. And if you were to merge it, <a href="../../../c/r/e/Created_kind.html" title="Created kind">created kind</a> seems more logical. --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 09:22, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</s>
<ul>
<li><s>I'd be inclined to say that none of those cites on Google Scholar actually says anything that would count as research in academia, and almost none of them actually even claim to describe research in baraminology themselves. The best paper - I can find - the one linked from the page fails to actually do any research, instead applying a mathematical model not developed by them to data not acquired by them, and claiming it somehow (they don't explain how) models their claim of created kinds. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 14:19, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</s></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b>. This "field" is fairly well known in the creation-evolution debate. It merits its own topic fork irrespective of its lack of credibility from a scientific standpoint. No objection to merging with or redirecting to <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_biology.html" title="Creation biology">Creation biology</a> if the interested editors choose this avenue. But it would not be appropriate to delete entirely. ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 16:28, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</s></li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b>. or merge. This is pseudoscience at best, if there was published research, that would be one thing, but this is just drek.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 17:58, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</s></li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b> - The fact that it's pseudoscience is all the more reason to have an article on it. Many people believe this is a legitimate field of biology. This article should dispel this belief. Also the history of this "field" is also something interesting. For those two reasons I believe this article should be kept. Why is everyone wanting to get rid of all creationist belief articles by tagging them as pseudoscience or claiming they give undue weight? These articles are your chance to clarify to those that believe that these beliefs are exactly that beliefs...nothing more. <a href="../../../p/b/a/User%7EPbarnes_435a.html" title="User:Pbarnes">Pbarnes</a> 20:09, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</s>
<ul>
<li><s>I oposse this one because, although the term is somewhat well-known, there doesn't seem to be more than a few sentences in the article that deal with verifiable facts about it. Indeed, it opens up with a confusing naming of a lot of terms which do not show up in any significance on Google. In short, there doesn't seem to be an ability to talk about it in a verifiable way that reflects the "field" accurately. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 20:27, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</s></li>

<li><s>It's a weird field, and I don't oppose merging with "created kinds" or something of the sort, but I am opposed to deletion, so <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 22:09, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</s></li>
