<p>Equidistant Letter Sequence (ELS)is a method by which purportedly meaningful messages have been extracted from written text. To obtain an ELS from a text, choose a starting point (in principle, any letter) and a skip number, also freely and possibly negative. Then, beginning at the starting point, select letters from the text at equal spacing as given by the skip number. For example, the bold letters in <b>t</b>his <b>s</b>ent<b>e</b>nce <b>f</b>orm <b>a</b>n EL<b>S</b> form the word SAFEST. (The skip is -4. Spaces and punctuation are ignored.)</p>
<p>Often more than one ELS related to some topic can be displayed simultaneously in an ELS letter array. This is produced by writing out the text in a regular grid, with exactly the same number of letters in each line, then cutting out a rectangle.</p>

<p>The Blight Way: A Sheriff Bo Tully Mystery is a slight change of pace for fans of humorist Patrick F. McManus. The setting (Blight County, Idaho) will be familiar to readers of Pat's humorous memoirs of his mis-spent childhood, but the cast of characters is different (although astute fans may pick up hints of cross-over here and there)as is the trajectory of story, for this is indeed a mystery, albeit full of the gentle humor one expects from a McManus book.</p>

Inside this amazing book, you follow the adventures of Minette and Fabio, two unhappy children who think they are being sent to two miserable places. They are both sent out in a car and on a train with an aunt from the agency Unusual Aunts. Little do they know that these aunts are about to ‘kidnap’ them and take them to the island of the aunts.

<p>Lloyd was born in a quaint little town in the far east of britain where he obtained his interest for somestic pets</p>
<p>from an early age Lloyd was obsessed with owning a pet, after visiting friends houses and seeing the loved cats and dogs he was furious and would throw houehold ite,s and have tantrums to a frightening extent. these tantrums quickly ceased after he was given his beloved cat toy "Borris"</p>
<p>Borris not only helped his hard working other out by quieting him down but it was the perfect way around the landlords "no pets policy" a policy little Lloyd just couldnt understand. 10 years later Borris had grown to be the only thing in Lloyds life, sleeping and eating and even going to the bathroom with him. at 18 borris and Lloyd killed their first domestic pet after college students mocked the fact that lloyd carried around a "toy" all day.</p>
<p>this event spurred what has been noted as one of the largest and most brutal pet killing spree of all time, Lloyd found and slaughtered 113 dogs 67 cats 4 budgies 12 hamsters 7 lizards and 2 axalottlels.</p>
<p>his rampage was ended when he was caught in the towns police station writing "Borris lives!" in bird blood across the foyer wall.</p>
<p>borris was locked up as evidence and Lloyd was sent to a remote town in New Zealand where he was sentanced to 4 years working at Mcdonalds.</p>

<p>Rick Rickert is a former star of the University of Minnesota. He was drafted in 2003 as the 55th pick overall in the draft. Considering his other competition in the draft, such as LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, T.J. Ford, Dwayne Wade, and Boris Diaw, Rickert was still told by his agent that he would recieve a first-round pick, granting him a guaranteed contract from his team. However, this was not the case. The Minnesota Timberwolves drafted him as a "mercy pick" at number 55. Rick Rickert was born on February 11, 1983, in Duluth, Minnesota. He was the star of the Duluth East basketball team, and was recruited by The University of Minnesota. He played there for two seasons, winning the Freshmen of the Year award, and Big Ten Player of the Year, and after his sophmore season declared for the 2003 NBA Draft. He was drafted number 26 in the 2nd round, or 55th overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves, but later in the off-season, didn't make the team. Rickert decided to play for the European league, and has made an attempt at least once a summer to come back and play for the Timberwolves, but has yet to make the team. A claim to fame for Rickert could be his supposed heated rivalry with Kevin Garnett, which sparked at a pick-up game at the gym, in which Garnett punched Rickert in the face, leading to stitches, although Rickert returned the next day for another pick-up game.</p>

<p>Jay is from Ocean City, Maryland and is the first-ever pro bodyboarder from the east coast. He was born in 1964, and learned to ride waves on inflateable rafts in his early teen years, switching to a bodyboard when his brother Mitch loaned his to Jay one day. He hasn't looked back since. Jay began bodyboarding full-time in 1980 at the age of 16, and entered the local contest scene right away in between working at mom and dad's bakery and playing drums and singing in a rock band. He won the fourth event he ever entered, and dominated amateur bodyboarding on the east coast until moving to California in 1987. During that time, he amassed 4 ESA Championship titles, 1 Mid-Atlantic Regional Title, was an ESA All-Star, and winner of the ESA's Marsh Scholarship which he used to get his bachelor's degree in Earth Science/Secondary Education in 1986. Jay was U.S. Amateur Champ in 1986, and took out the Morey Nationals in 1984 and 1986. Jay is recognized as the first-ever "champion" in the sport of bodyboarding by virtue of winning the first series of events that accumulated points toward crowning a champion when he won the 1982 Eastern Surfing Championships Bodyboarding division.</p>
<p>His travels began just after finishing high school when Reale went to Hawaii for the first Morey World Championships at Pipe in 1982. He competed in that event 17 years in a row! After college, Jay relocated to San Clemente, California to join the fledgling U.S. Pro Tour, and enjoyed success over the course of the next several years ending up as high as 4th in the year-end ratings. During that time, Reale started a whirlwind of travels that took him to 5 continents, over 20 countries, and hundreds of beaches around the world. Promos, contests, and photo shoots were Jay's life, and he gained a reputation as an ambassador for bodyboarding. He also wrote articles for a dozen magazines worldwide, and acted as beach announcer for several contests as well as television commentator for ESPN and Fox Sports broadcasts of bodyboarding events. Jay loaned his announcing talents to several bodyboarding videos as well participating in 5 different How-To videos and even provided the voice for Mike Stewart's Pro Bodyboarding video game.</p>
<p>With the advent of the GOB World Tour (now the IBA Tour) in the mid-90's, Jay began focussing his competitive efforts on not only that Tour where he ended his best year-1997- ranked 5th, but also on the Australian Tour, the U.S. Tour, and the BIA Tour. He managed Top 16 finishes on all four up until 1998. In 1998, his last full year on Tour, Jay ended the all-new GOB Dropknee Tour rated 6th in the world.</p>
<p>In 2002, Jay regained his amateur status and competed in several events in the 30-and-over division becoming the 2002 U.S. Champion and runner up in both the ESA and BIA Championships as well as the FlowRider World Bodyboarding Championships, and was elected to the ESA All-Star Team for the first time since he was last an amateur in 1986. He came back in 2003 and defended his title as U.S. Senior Bodyboarding Champ once again. Also in 2003, he was honored by being recognized as one of the top ten wave-riding competitors ever to come out of the Eastern Surfing Association, ranking as the lone bodyboarder amongst that group.</p>
<p>His career has been long and illustrious nabbing 15 magazine cover shots worldwide, countless posters, profiles, and other articles and photos. Jay has appeared many times on MTV, the Discovery Channel, Nickelodeon, The Learning Channel, and too many local television shows to mention. He's hosted programs in Japan, the U.S. and Australia, as well as commercials for Morey, and radio ads in the U.S., Australia, and Europe.</p>
<p>Jay resides in San Clemente with Vicki after their wedding in January of '99, and their daughter Saige who was born in September of 2003, and he is busy concentrating on keeping eBodyboarding.com on top as the Internet's Bodyboarding Superstore. He spends his spare time bodyboarding and surfing, snowboarding, playing tennis, watching lots of TV, surfing the internet, looking for opportunities to further his singing talents, and trying out for various trivia-question game shows. To date, Jay has appeared on "The Dating Game", "Don't Forget Your Toothbrush", "The Weakest Link", "Whammy", "Pet Star" (with his dog Kea), and "On The Cover", but his goal is making it on Jeopardy. He also starred in an ensemble cast in the San Clemente Community Theater musical "Christmas In San Clemente" in December, 2004. Most recently, Jay has been training extensively in the sport of triathlon, his new passion.</p>

<p>This is according to me, an anonymous traveler who had the misfortune of meeting this guy.</p>
<p>In the beginning of February I was in Trat, Thailand, where I met a Singaporean guy named Mikailo Jefferson. He said that he had gotten his bag with money and credit cards stolen in Cambodia, and after spending about 4 days with him I thought he was a decent guy, so I offered to loan him money to get back home, since he said he couldn't get his credit cards because they were sent to his home address. Nor had he any friends or relatives to help him out. He claimed the embassy couldn't help either. I agreed to borrow him 15 000 Baht, which is about 375 USD for him to buy a plane ticket and his camera back which he had sold.</p>
<p>He flew back, but on the 7th of March, he claimed he had been robbed while in a hospital in Phnom Phen, Cambodia. He asked me for more money, but I would not lend him more.</p>
<p>He said he was hitchiking back to Singapore, and the last email I got from him was on March 29th. Since then I have not heard from him. I photographed his passport and he gave me his home address in Singapore as well, but I visited that yesterday and it was a false address, there was another family living there.</p>
<p>Under Singaporean law, the address of the citizens are not to be disclosed unless there is a criminal offence. This even though I photographed his passport, and his passport number is S6934164J.</p>
<p>My wish is that this may warn others of this xxxxxxx xxxxxx.</p>

It has been rumored that Paris Hilton has been the one feeding Perez all of the filthy gossip that he posts on his website. Either way, it seems perezhilton.com publishing celebrity gossip more quickly than the tabloids or television.</p>

<p>Agnolim was formed in Ankara - Turkey in 2001 by some dedicated amateur musicians of whom most of were tango dancers. The band plays classical Argentine Tango tunes as well as the modern day tango songs. The band members are friends among the first tango dancers of Ankara.</p>
<p>The group made several live performances in Istanbul and Ankara. They did not release an official studio album. However, some of their studio and live recordings have reached many audiences.</p>
<p>When Agnolim was in search for a name, the group members came up with different ideas all including the word "tango". They looked for a simple, easy to pronounce and remember name that would always be kept in mind of the audiences. So, eventually "Agnolim" was chosen. The origin of the name comes from the word "milonga", which is a sub-style of tango music.</p>
<p>Agnolim's repertoire include tangos, valses and milongas.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-15_5bb6.html" title="Edit section: Irving L. Horowitz">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Irving L. Horowitz</span></h2>
<p>Horowitz was born in New York City on September 25, 1929, to Louis and Esther Tepper Horowitz and educated at the College of the City of New York (now city College of the City University of New York, or CUNY), B.S.S., 1951; Columbia University, New York City, M.A., 1952; and the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, Ph.D., 1957. In 1950, he married Ruth Narowlansky; they were divorced in 1963. He married Mary Ellen Curtis in 1979 with whom he has two children, Carl and David. From the beginning of his career as an assistant professor of social theory at the University of Buenos Aires, 1956-1958, Horowitz spent the next forty-plus years at various academic institutions nationwide and abroad in India, Tokyo, Mexico, and Canada. In addition to his teaching positions, he was an advisory staff member of the Latin American Research Center, 1964-1970; consultant to the International Education Division, Ford Foundation, 1959-1960; a member of the advisory board of the Institute for Scientific Information, From 1962 to 1969, Horowitz was professor of sociology at Washington University in St. Louis. He has also been a visiting professor at Stanford University, the University of Wisconsin, Queen’s University in Canada, and the University of California, and a Fulbright Lecturer in Argentina, Israel, and India; a member of the advisory board of the Institute for Scientific Information, 1969-1973; consulting editor for Oxford University Press, 1974-1969, and for Aldine-Atherton Publishers, 1969-1972; the founding president of Transaction Society; an external board member of the Radio Marti and Television Marti Programs of the U.S. Information Agency, beginning in 1985; chair of the board of the Hubert Humphrey Center, Ben Gurion University, Israel, 1990-1992; and has served as an external board member of the methodology section of the research division, U.S. General Accounting Office. As the author of more than twenty-five books and editor of numerous other titles, Horowitz has analyzed such diverse topics as the influence of Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church on American politics, the future of book publishing, and politics in Cuba. In 1990, he published his autobiography, rather a brief "sociological biography" than one that is intellectual of intimate. This was Daydreams and Nightmares: Reflections on a Harlem Childhood (London: Jackson Publ., 1990, 104 p.), for which he received the National Jewish Book Award. It is an unromanticized look at growing up as the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants in the streets of predominantly black Harlem, New York City, in the 1930s. Throughout his academic career, Horowitz received many awards, including a special citation from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1957, for Idea of War and Peace in Contemporary Philosophy;; recognition by Time as the Man of the Year in Behavioral Science, 1970; the Centennial medallion from St. Peters College, Jersey City, New Jersey, 1971, for outstanding contribution to a humanistic social science; and a presidential outstanding achievement award, 1985, from Rutgers University. He is a member of the Carnegie Council, American Association of Publishers, American Political Science Association, American Association for the Advancement of Science, and past president (1961-1962) of the New York State Sociological Society. Horowitz latest academic post was Hannah Arendt University Professor Emeritus of Sociology and Political Science at Rutgers University, since 1992. Over the past several decades Horowitz has worked to develop a political sociology that can measure the extent of a society's personal freedom and State-sanctioned violence. As a result of his work, a standard for the quality of life in any particular nation or social system has been constructed based on the number of people arbitrarily killed, maimed, injured, incarcerated, or deprived of basic civil liberties. Horowitz has tried to build a bridge between his current analysis of state power and authority and his earlier studies of comparative international stratification and development. He is recognized as the individual who introduced the phrase "Third World" into the lexicon of social research. Horowitz is the founder of Studies in Comparative International Development—now in its 40th year. He is also chairman of Transaction-Aldine Publishers. From 1962 to 1969, Horowitz was professor of sociology at Washington University in St. Louis. He has also been a visiting professor at Stanford University, the University of Wisconsin, Queen’s University in Canada, and the University of California, and a Fulbright Lecturer in Argentina, Israel, and India. He is a prolific author. Among his most recent books are Tributes: An Informal History of Social Science in the Twentieth Century; Behemoth: The History and Theory of Political Sociology. Horowitz was not only an engaged joung fellow of the as brilliant as creative left-wing sociologist C. Wright Mills, a guy from Texas who died of his broken heart in his exile in Chicago (“White Collar” 1951; “Power Elite” 1956, “Sociological Imagination” 1959), but also the congenious editor of two posthoumus books encluding essays of Charles Wright Mills on culture like The Cultural Apparatus etc.(1) Horowitz himself published most relevant pieces on genocide like Genocide: State Power &amp; Mass Murder (Transcation Books, 1976); Taking Lives: Genocide &amp; State Power (Transaction Books, 1980); Genocide and the Reconstruction of Social Theory: Observations on the Exclusivity of Collective Death (in: Armenian Review, vol. 37 [1984] 1, 1-21); Horowitz last scholarly pieces on genocide were his preface to Rudolph J. Rummels Death by Government (Transaction Books, 1994),and his essay on state-sponsored terror under the title: Counting Bodies. The Dismal Science of Authorized Terror (in: Patterns of Prejudice, vol. 23 [1999] 1, 4-15). In Summer 1994 a volume of essays in honour of I.L.Horowitz was published by Transaction Publishers (“The Democratic Imagination: Dialogues on the Work of Irving Louis Horowitz”, ed. Ray C. Rist). A list of scholarly publications including more two hundred pieces of the author is to be found at the beta-version of google scholar.</p>

<p>Service to humanity is the main agenda of most political aspirants and the promise of many a great men and women. Despite this, the need for help is continually increasing. This justifies the existence of UP SIBOL.</p>
<p><br />
UP SIBOL is a socio-civic organization at the University of the Philippines Los Baños. It caters to the upliftment of the marginalized sector of the society. This student organization fulfills its objectives through its activities which are oftentimes community-based.</p>
<p><br />
UP SIBOL’s existence as a student organization is rooted from the stimulating history of campus politics. It was a political party in 2001 for the UPLB College of Development Communication (CDC)’s student council elections. Only two from the party, however, made it.</p>
<p><br />
Contrary to the popular belief that political parties die upon losing in an election, UP SIBOL has proven that its ideals won’t pass away after losing the feat. Its 18 members (the same persons who ran for the election) continued to discuss plans on how they can carry on their passion to serve and to inspire people. History has it. On August 22, 2001, these 18 great minds met again and transformed their political party into a socio-civic organization. And because of its defined vision and unique identity, UP SIBOL was named as a bona fide socio-civic organization by the UPLB Office of Student Affairs on the second semester 2001-2002. That is, with membership not only from CDC but also to the whole university.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Going strong</b></p>
<p>UP SIBOL, since then, metamorphosized into an established socio-civic organization. Anchored on deep sense of purpose plus support from its alumni and dedication of its members, UP SIBOL has gotten all that it takes to prevail.</p>

<p>Dartman, Created by the Mind of Joe Fuller has become more than a small fad amongst young people in the town of Eastbourne. In Fact, it would be fair to say that Dartman has become a colt hit, and captured the imagination for Teens all across the South-East area, in particular the small Town of Eastbourne.</p>
<p>The short Trailer was first created in the summer of 2004. Written, directed and produced by the incredibly talented Joe Fuller, the short trailer has already stirred up much anticipation in the hearts of people across the world. Sadly however for the these anxious fans, the Dartman film is not planned for the too close future. However, there will be a special 'Making of' realeased for its loyal and anxious fans.</p>

<p>The Ruchir is a rare breed of dog found only in the most remote parts of the amazon. If you see a Ruchir, chances are you are going to be eaten. What you should do is stay very still, as he has bad hearing, as his flab covers his ears. The Ruchir can live up to 16 years of age, after which he dies of morbid obesity. It is not yet known how many Ruchir attacks there have been worldwide.</p>

<p>The Ruchir is a rare breed of dog found only in the most remote parts of the Andes. The Ruchir can become very angry if kept away from food, and attacks are common. The Ruchir's diet is mostly anything, except Salad. It is not yet known how many Ruchir attacks there have been, but it is a problem that needs to be tackled soon, or we may ALL BE EATEN.</p>

<p>The Seneca Nation of Indians is prepared to open its third casino in Western New York State. After opeining the Seneca Niagara Casino in Niagara Falls, NY and Seneca Allegany Casino in Salamanca, NY, the Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino is going to open in downtown Buffalo.</p>
<p>Spanning nine acres along the Cobblestone District waterfront, downtown, the $125 million project is part of the downtown revitilization program, to bring more people and money into the city's core.</p>
<p>The construction of the casino is expected to be complete in 2007. However, it did not come without disputes and fights over the current site of the casino, notably from preservationists. Buffalo, once one of the world's largest ports and manufacturers, has since seen many abandoned grain elevators and factories in that part of the city. Knocking down the historic HO Hoats grain elevator caused an uproar by those who would like to see the elevators preserved.</p>
<p>The casino design will feature a small park and creek that cuts through the casino's lobby. The 100,000 square foot casino will employ 1,000 people and will have a $38 million payroll, helping to pump money back into the economy. The following are architectural renderings of the casino, once complete in December of 2007.</p>

<p>Cpl. Joshua Belile,USMC is the author and singer of the parody song Hadji Girl! The term "Durka Durka Mohammad Jihad" used throughout the song is taken from the movie Team America World Police. This song was performed in Iraq, but was not meant for anyone outside of the room. However a person in the room videotaped the song and it eventually was published on the Internet at the YOUTUBE.com web site and is now a popular video and also is strongly condemned by CAIR. The USMC leaders have begun a investigation of the song denouncing it as inappropriate material for a Marine to publish.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-15_5bb6.html" title="Edit section: Leather Man">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Leather Man</span></h2>
<p>The Leather Man legend, as researched by Alex Gallrdo. The Leather Man was something of a mystery. He was a singular and curious character that roamed about westchester and Connecticut for some 30 years. People said that if you saw him from a distance, that he looked like a bear walking on its hind legs. As he got closer, you could see that it was a man covered in lether from head to foot. He wore a leather hat, a hand swen leather suit, that weighed some 20 pounds. For more than 30 years, from 1858 to 1889, the Leather Man regularlly traveled a 300 mile clockwise circut from Brewster, in Putman county, to as far east as Saybrook, Connecticut. He averaged some 9 miles a day on his trek, and usually covered the entire route in a little over a month. He rarely varied from his chosen path,and people used to say that they knew the day of the month when the Leather Man appeared. From the first the Leather Man was considered an enigma, because he rarely spoke more that one or two syllabic words. He communicated by using hand signals or by gruntin. If questioned directly, he would tilt his head in an odd way, and roll his eyes, so that the white shown. Yet, his eyes would brighted if he was addressed in French, but he still would not make a responce. Some thought that he was Frech-Canadian, but this was not the case. The Leather Man was well built, weighing about 180 pounds, and was 5' 8 <i>inches tall. He was strong enough to carry several railroad ties for miles, up hill. Yet, he was known to be completely harmless,he never hurt anyone, nor stole. Women, on his route, would prepare food for him, and children would share their snacks with him. The Leather Man seemed to care for horses, as he would often be seen reparing holes in the country roads that he traveled. In this way, the horses would not step into the holes, and injure themselve.</i> Because he wore an Angus Dei, with a small crucifix, and carried a French prayer book, dated 1844, he was presumed to be Catholic. Over the years, stories began to develop about him. Piecing these stories together, from interviews of people that knew him, the following tale evolved. The Leather Man was born Jules Bourglay, in Lyon, France, in 1830. Although he was the son of a woodcutter, he managed to get a liberal education. When he finished his studies in Paris, he met and fell in love with Lillian Larone. Her father was a wealthy leather merchant, who objected to Jules because of his humble backgroun. Jules, however, was able to convinve him to allow Lillian ahd he to become engaged. The father agreed,but on the condition that Jules enter the family business. If after a year he was successful in the business, then he could marry Lillian. If he failed the engagement was off, and he would never see her again. Jules was eager to be successful,prove himself, and not wait a year. He invested much of Larone's funds in purchasing large quantities of hides and raw leather to be processed and resold. Jules was certain that the price of leather would go up. Instead the revese occurred; the price of leather fell 40%. Many leather businesses failed. Larone went bankrupt, and Jules was disgraced. He was forced to leave Paris, and Lillian forever, in 1856. The shock of causing the loss of the Larone family fortune, as well as losing Lillian was too much him to bear. A short time after, Jules was found wandering about the countryside in a dazed and incoherent condition. He was committed to an insane asylum, and he was there for two years before he escpaed. Some sympathetic neighbors helped him to get to the cost, and they payed his passage to America. He arrived in New York in 1858. His friends had hoped that by going to America, and getting a fresh start, that his mental condition would improve. That he would get over his obession with leather, and the past. It was a vain hope. Thus, the saga of the Leather Man began. He lived by doing odd jobs, usually acception only food, or scraps of leather for payment. Sometimes he would accept coins, and buy goods from a general store, by pointing things out.If he did not need any supplies, he would refuse the money for work done, or leave it on the doorstep of whoever had given it to him. Yet, at times he would accept pennies from children, probably because hedid not want to hurt their feelings. The Lather Man's all leather outfit was made of scraps of leather that he had sewn together, with laces cut from the same material. His knee-length coast was large, and hung loosely about him. His trousers were more like fishermen boots, as they extended to his armpits. He wore a large leather hat, with a big crown, and carried an oversize leather bag. In this bage, he carried pieces of leather, food, tobacco, some tools,and a bowl from lwhich he ate and drank. The coat had sizable pockets, where other supplies were kept. These included a smoking pipe, with a tin bowl, that he had made himsself. When he walked, he made the kind of creaking sound that one would associate with horses in harness. A Connecticut tanner once oiled his complete attire for him, and this made him happy. He always tried to get soft leather, the type used in the high tops of boots. In winter, he wore a woolen knit shirt under his clothing. His shoes had two-inch soles, and were made of layers of wood and leather. They were held together with hobnails, and wire, and weighed about ten pounds. His entire leather covering weighed about 90 pounds, not counting his leather bag, tools, and supplies. The Leather Man wore a short beard that he would clip with a pair of heavy scissors. This gave him a shaggy, unkept appearance. He was known to bathe by immersing simself in a stream or pond, leather garments and all. Once, when a farmer's wife offered him a basin of water to wash with before eating, he became insulted. He never returned to that farm again. In winter he would forego bathing altogether. He generally slept in natural caves,orin huts of his own making,occasionally he would spend the night in a barn. He always refused an offer to sleep in a house, or a bed. In the caves and huts, the Leather Man would keep a supply of firewood, and made a neat bed of leavves and branches, held together with stakes and side rails. The floors of these huts and caves were swept clean. Tin cans that were used for cooking would be washed clean, and put bottom up on stakes to dry. In his own way, he was clean and tidy. A Mr. Beach, of Forestville, Connecticut, said that the Leather Man visited his farm for dinner every 34 days for ten years. Another family, the Colts, stated that he visited them regularly for 27 years. While the Leather Man traveled a great deal across country, he also walked on dirt roads. He always carried a big stick with him to protect himself from vicious dogs, or cruel boys, that occasionally woould bother him. When this happened he was know to change his route a bit. In New York he travled from White Plains to Ossining,then northeast to Brewster, then to Connecticut. At Foreestville, he would head south to Saybrook, and then west to Greenwich. The last part was a fairly straight route, except for a detour to New Canaan. This itinerary covered some 200 miles in Connecticut, and 100 miles in New York. He would spend 22 days in Connecticut, and 12 in New York. There appeared to be no rhythm or reason for following this route, other than people were friendly, and they seemed to be caves available for housing. As the Leather Man grew older, his movements slowed, and his visits became irregular. He stopped more often, and stayed in one place longer. He replaced his heavy leather bag with a carpetbag. Some memebers of the Connecticut Humane Society noted the Leather Man's weakened condition, and had him arrested in December, 1888. He was taken to Hartford Hospital, and given the choice of staying in the hospital or returning to France. He declined both options, and the hospital authrities had to release him, because he had committed no crime. Consequently he continued his wanderings. While the Leather Man survived the winter of '88,'the end was not far off. He developed cancer of the mouth, and a year later, one Henry Miller found the Leather Man in a cave in Ossining. He was dead. They buried him in Sparta Cememtery, near Ossining in pauper's row. Some people alleged that robbers, who thought he had a hidden fortune in his cave, had murdered him. But this was a false rumor. In 1953 representatives from various historical societies from Connecticut and New York, place a bronze plaque on the heretofore unmarked grave of the Leather Man. At the unveiling of the marker,both the French and American flags were flown, and some people dressed in 19th century coustumes. The national anthems of both countries were played and sung. Thus, 64 years after his death, the Leather Man had finally found a home. Photgraphs of the Leather Man can be seen in some local historical societies. Except for his all leather outfit, he appears not unlike the many unfortunate, homeless peole found today in big cities. One photofraph shows him with large, vacant, staring eyes, giving no clue as to what kind of painful thoughts lay behind them. The Leather Man never conversed with anyone, so it is impossible to know what his thoughts were in the 30 odd years of his wanderings. Did he torturously relive, over and over again, his disater in the leather business, and his loss of Lillian? Perhaps he llived a lovely fantasy world in which Lillian and he were happily married, and living blissfully together? One would hope it was the latter, and that just as in death, the Leather Man finally found peace, and one may imagine that somehow he also found his loss love, Lillian.</p>

<p>The LM13700 in an operational transconductance amplifier, or OTA for short, that is almost identical to the LM13600 (the darlington output buffer is the only difference). The LM13700 is like a standar OP amp, but it is voltage in and current out and is programmable via the IABC pin. This chip is very useful in audio electronics especially in analog synthesizer circuits like voltage controlled oscillators, filters, and amplifiers!! (VCO, VCF, VCA)</p>

<p>BMO: Field Research</p>
<p>This guy actually found a cure for cancer. I wish I was joking but I?m not. He will make a presentation the week of Augest 15th to a group of doctors to demonstrate the cure he has found for a certain type of breast Cancer. What the fcuk did anyone else do this summer that was worth while compared to BMO? Nothing!!! He is the brain and inspiration in the NTACs. His knowledge of science comes in handy way more often than you would think. And he is always doing extra research for the NTACs. That?s right&#160;? vegetarians DO taste like KIWI.</p>
<p>DC:Operations Management</p>
<p>Captain Clipboard Connolly is the undisputed organizer and event planner of the NTACs. If it weren?t for his keen ability to turn absolutely anything into a party, we probably wouldn?t get out at all. Whether it?s a big club night, a killer road trip, or just beers at the Connolly?s, DC in on top of it! He makes all the right phone calls to ensure the party never stops.</p>
<p><br />
Nads: Negotiator</p>
<p>There isn?t much people won?t do to get this one to SHUT UP! She seems to have a nack for talking her way into things. The line up at a club is never a problem when you?ve got Nadia. She has even been known to return damaged, used goods to stores for full sticker-price refunds. Now that is talent.</p>
<p>Dutch: Security</p>
<p>If you don?t think the NTACs rule the world, then why don?t you take it up with our attorney Big Dutch. As an all-star athlete he is able to just hang out and look tough, and nobody ever gives us a problem. God only knows how many fights Dave has picked that were over before they even started once someone got a look at our own chiseled Greek God that we call Burke. What a stud. Ladies, he?s ours&#160;? no touchy!</p>
<p>Fell: Ambassador</p>
<p>What can we say&#160;? moms LOVE this guy. Whenever we are in a situation that requires a pretty face, great personality, and knowledge of utensil placement we send in Fell. He makes great first impressions, and always has a bottle opener on his keychain. He is the NTAC poster boy for his class, and of course his desire to party at any time.</p>
<p>Wood: Wildcard</p>
<p>Wood can be one of the most useless members of the NTACs. His is generally immature, rude, and obnoxious. However, as this website well proves, he can bring his A-game!!!!! Every now and then he does something so smart or thoughtful that people fall over backwards in disbelief. You never really know what is coming next from Mr. Saturday Night, but you can bet it?s gonna make you laugh.</p>
<p>Jenny: The Savior</p>
<p>She is the protector of all things sacred. This classy catholic prays for the souls of her fellow NTACs Sunday after Sunday. The redemption and entry into the Kingdom of Heavan rests souly on her shoulders. Without Jenny, we would all have been struct down by a jagged bolt of lightning by now.</p>
<p>Joey Love: Straight Shooter</p>
<p>If you are an idiot, Joey is going to make sure you know it. He hates to see a moron go through life without ever knowing he is a moron. Joey is the NTAC who keeps all other NTACs in line. He also has an appreciation for fine wine, big titties, and rock n roll. A wise woman once said,&#160;?a man needs a maid, but Joey needs two?. Nobody really knows what that means, but goddammit if it isn?t oh so true!!!</p>
<p>Hunt: Observationist</p>
<p>Hunt is very concerned with the concept of inertia. He is an object not in motion and he tends to stay out of motion. He likes to let the action come to him! And ladies, the action does come to him!!! Name one NTAC breezie who hasn?t made a pass at Hunt. THERE AREN?T ANY!!!! His calm cool I-don?t-want-a-job-attitude has the ladies swarming by the truckload. He also plays hockey by the way.</p>
<p>Lyons: Creative Direction</p>
<p>When you need someone to put a retarded amount of effort into something dumb like an NTAC film, NTAC webpage, or something really really stupid like trying to become a rock star, Neil will probably give it a hook. He loves long shots, gambling, and playing with colors and sounds. If you can convince him that a bad idea is good, he'll go all the way with it, and that is why he'll most likely be living in another NTACs basement ten years from now.</p>
<p>T-Mac: Forest Ranger</p>
<p>Maguire is the camping specialist. He knows where and how to do it right, and he isn?t afraid to fill the interior of his car up with firewood. He has also been known to go deep into the bush where no other campers are even willing to consider going. Get out your goggles and weed-whacker cause he?s going in!!!</p>
<p>Dirte: Anchorwoman</p>
<p>She probably calls make out sessions play by play. Guys is that cool or just weird?? This young broadcaster has more stats than Dr. Lu and has the sex appeal of Veronica Corningstone. She?s sure to make network anchor on talent and charm alone, but just in case that fails&#160;? she also has the moves of a jungle cat!!! You?ve all seen her at Cowboys on a Thursday night&#160;? dynamite!</p>
<p>Chels: The Rookie</p>
<p>The newest NTAC first got mixed up with us clowns when she trapped Lyons into dating her with a flat tire in the parking lot of his work, and a low cut shirt. She has proven herself to be a talentless clown by boozing hard, roadtripping, and generally displaying a lack of taent. Welcome to the NTACs.</p>
<p>Kay: Party Soldior</p>
<p>She?s not just a popular search engine, she?s also the only person who can go shot for shot with DC and come out of it alive. Trained at Queens School of Pounding Beers, she has the stomach of a concentration camp executioner, and the liver of a wombat. Do NOT try to drink with her, she is insane. She is a welcomed addition to the NTACs, with her unwavering ability to party, and her great team spirit. But careful girls, lay a finger on her man and she?ll come out swinging. And she packs the punch ofa stiff tequila.</p>
<p>CA: Poket Rocket</p>
<p>This girl is like an ace up our sleeve. When we need to inject a party with the kind of craziness that only a fiery red head can provide, she is our go-to woman. She's red hot, drinks red whine, has a red vibrater named "Eager Beaver" (okay so it's blue). She's always up for a road trip to anywhere, and loves naked women almost as much as Hunt! She is a true NTAC gem. Ruby you could say.</p>
<p>Becks: Spokesperson</p>
<p>If you haven?t joined the revolution against high beer prices, you obviously haven?t watched TV in the past year. Everywhere you turn, she is in you face trying to use her dancers body and sassy smile to sell you Mountain Crest. (insert link to commercial, or at least the mountain crest site). The NTACs own little starlet Becks is a performing arts hurricane. She can be spotted all over the place doing everything from TV appearances, to musicals, to dance productions, to something as simple as faking and orgasm for Joe (not that he cares as long as he?s finished).</p>
<p>Michelle: The Machine</p>
<p>This machine runs on three things: alcohol, boys, and boys. Without these essential elements she is rendered utterly useless. However, when she?s ready to party (or chase sausage) look out! Cause she can go all-in, and go all night!!!</p>
<p>Martinson: The Dream</p>
<p>Marty is our only chance to have an NTAC make it to the Olympic Games. He swims like a dolphin, and is currently on a full ride to the University of Nevada in LAS VEGAS!!!! The ladies love him because of his great body, and his willingness to go where only one other NTAC (BMO) has gone before. A priceless asset to the NTACS!</p>

<p>Gerald Yung is a teacher who currently teaches at the Charles S. Pierce Middle School and has been for over 10 years. He has gotten mixed reviews from his students on whether or not he is a competent teacher. Out of one hundred randomly asked students, 78 said he was incompetent, while 22 others said he was a good teacher. His teaching methods are different from the usual teachers. He prefers to put questions or terms on the board and lets the students do the research about them rather than teach the children himself. He feels that this way there is nobody to blame but them if they fail on a test or quiz. Some students believe this is unfair because he was hired as a teacher and ought to be expected to teach.</p>

<p>The Oil Cleansing Method is a system for cleaning your face using oils. Beginners often start out with mixture of half Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) and half Castor Oil (CO). Once experience is gained, the mixture can be tweaked based on skin type and personal preference. Other oils that are commonly used are Jojoba oil and Coconut Oil.</p>
<p>The oil is rubbed into skin for approx. 2 min. Next, a warm, damp washcloth is drapped over face until it cools. The cooled washcloth is then used to wipe off excess oil. Continue wipeing until the oil is gone. If face feels tight, one or two drops of EVOO or another oil of your choice may be used to moisturize.</p>
<p>Many users have experienced fewer blackheads, softer skin, and less acne.</p>
<p>Stephanie Strauss has written an excellent article on the subject that can be found <a href="http://www.thebeautybottle.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=2" class="external text" title="http://www.thebeautybottle.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=2" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>There was a conference in Binghamton, NY in April 2006 with the same theme: engineering, social justice and peace. It was a gathering of engineering professors, university administrators, activists and students alike. It provided a basis for establishing a community for further discussion around these issues. To participate in this discussion in an on-line form, please click on the discussion tab at the top of this page.</p>
<p>A 'zine is in publication following from the gathering in Binghamton, and an excerpt from it is insightful:</p>
<p>"Many feel we are in a better position today with reduction of child labour, pollution etc. and yet I believe we see far more 'mind-forg'd manacles' today than ever before - dressed up in progress. I believe our movement and many others working towards social justice can actually ask the questions which necessitate us all to locate the source of our greed and complacency. We are not in a position to feel good about ourselves when so many people are still living in terror and woe with conditions no better than those in Blake's London. As he reminds us in his piece 'Human Abstract':</p>
<p>Pity would be no more</p>
<p>If we did not make somebody Poor</p>
<p>And Mercy no more could be</p>
<p>If all were as happy as we</p>
<p>After working for two years to bring together such wonderful people in our recent symposium I took away a real belief in our movement - that 'we' – a community of friends are moving forwards towards an ideal which we believe in and hope to attract others to join us along the way. I therefore give my definitions of the terms Social justice is… the movement towards a time when all people lead a fulfilled life - where everyone is 'as happy as we' and Peace is… the space in which the above may happen." - Caroline Baillie</p>

<p>If you go to the opera or a movie and sit next to a person determined to sneeze or <a href="../../../c/o/u/Cough.html" title="Cough">cough</a> as loudly as possible, you could be sitting next to a steruphiliac. Steruphilia is the love of sneezing or coughing. The term originated when people had limited means to determine if an inert human body was alive or dead. If it sneezed or coughed - a welcome sound to bereaving relatives - it was detemined to be alive. The waiting relatives in this case were said to be in a state of steruphilia.</p>

<p>2-(4'-(iodoacetamido)anilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid</p>
<p>An environment-sensitive fluorescent probe commonly used in biophysical studies of proteins. IAANS can be attached to proteins via naturally occuring or engineered amino acid Cystine. The fluorescence intensity and the emission wavelength of the probe is very sensitive to substrate binding, folding and unfolding of the protein, as well as changes in ionic strength of the environment and association of the labeled protein with other biomolecules.</p>
