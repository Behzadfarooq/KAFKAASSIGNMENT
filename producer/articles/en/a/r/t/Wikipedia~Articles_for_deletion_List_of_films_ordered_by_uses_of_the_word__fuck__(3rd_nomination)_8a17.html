<li><b>Merge</b>- Wikipedia should have a list of films with the most expletives in. Although this would be less accurate it is a more interesting statistic.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - This is the third time this has been nominated over the years, and the article still has the same problems. It isn't <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> <i>per se</i>, but it is <i>unmaintainable</i>. Any verification of (or addition to) the article requires sitting through a each movie and counting how many times the word "fuck" is used. The accuracy of the article is currently disputed, and there is no way to refute this without spending 5.6 days in front of a TV screen. -<a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVastango_b1c3.html" title="User:Vastango">Vastango</a> 23:59, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well okay, but I don't see why getting into this level of movie trivia is doing something better than other Almanacs. Added to that why limit to this word? I imagine there are plenty of words more shocking to hear in films today. Maybe we could have List of films ordered by uses of the word "cunt" or List of films ordered by uses of the word "kyke". If rarity matters maybe List of films ordered by uses of the word "quincunx". All of these could be verified in similar ways, checking scripts etc, but that doesn't mean any of them would be definitively correct as there are many scripts that get filmed out there. Especially when you include non-US English language films.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 17:58, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Comment:</i> I really don't think this is original research after a thorough reading of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, and I doubt the editors of the article have actually counted the words themselves - several sources other than the films themselves are cited at the bottom. All this talk about it being unmaintainable: one tends to notice 5 FPM(!) in a film, and there is usually a media uproar. I also think information like this is what makes WIkipedia wonderful and I don't think these lists need to be utterly complete to be interesting and informative. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 09:01, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Not extremely difficult to verify, though I suppose it borders on original research. I verified the count for Glenngarry Glen Ross (film) by a) downloading a copy of the script; b) opening the text in Microsoft Word; c) running search-and-replace for "fuck" d) reading the dialog box at the end, which told me how many times it replaced the word.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The list is not original research. It is not original research to check how many times a movie says 'fuck'. It is interaction with a primary source document. Something that is encouraged in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Just because the primary source document is a movie doesn't make it any less valid. The list is verifiable; it is better sourced than a lot of articles (largely because people keep trying to delete it).

<li><b>Comment</b> From WP:NOR "Original research that creates primary sources is not allowed. However, research that consists of <b>collecting and organizing information</b> from existing primary and/or secondary sources is strongly encouraged. In fact, all articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research," it is "source-based research," and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia." - All this list does is collect and organize the information in a primary source document,<a href="../../../h/d/s/User%7EHdstubbs_1dfa.html" title="User:Hdstubbs">Hdstubbs</a> 16:06, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think that it's that easy.
