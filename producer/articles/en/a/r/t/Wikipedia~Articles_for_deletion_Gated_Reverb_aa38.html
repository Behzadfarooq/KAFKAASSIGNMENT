<li><b>Keep.</b> I have no idea about sound editing, but this appears to be a bona fide notable technique (see the 21,700 Google hits). Needs cleanup and sourcing, though. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 04:44, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> (But I would say that wouldn't I!) I added this because there was a poorly written paragraph on the Genesis page referring to "reverse Noise Gate" which I changed to the correct term "Gated Reverb" wikified &amp; then found out there wasn't a page for it. Created the page because it's one of <b>the</b> all time classic drum recording techniques, added a couple of categories, wandered off rationalising the categories on a number of other webpages related to sound recording techniques &amp; when I returned to Gated Reverb I found it was marked for deletion. Well, 10/10 for speed, 0/10 for actually GOOGLING, finding out it IS a legit technique &amp; then helping me by making some changes so it <b>does</b> meet quality standards. I've added a few links to other internet articles on the subject hopefully to pacify the "original research" nazi. I agree with Sandstein that it needs a cleanup but it's a really trivial matter to verify that this is not original research so let's untag it. In future, DanielRocks123, there's this way cool website called <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=Gated+Reverb&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=Gated+Reverb&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Google</a> that can stop you looking stupid&#160;;) <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanic_15ef.html" title="User:Megamanic">Megamanic</a> 04:58, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>When I first marked this page for deletion I had done a google search that produced a lot of hits that seemed to be advertisements. If this technique is actually a legitimate technique then I stand corrected, although I would suggest citing some sources. In addition, please refrain from calling people Nazis as somebody could get quite offended.

<dd>Point taken, no offense intended. Didn't see any advertisments myself on Google. Lots of references to things like "I am trying to create the gated reverb effect - used on many productions like Genesis and ..." The first article listed is to a reputable recording magazine (Sound On Sound) with the following Quote:- <i>Probably the simplest form of change you can add to reverb is to call up a gated setting. This has no natural counterpart, so the abrupt cessation of reverb at the end of the gate period attracts attention. Getting a <b>gated reverb</b> sound is usually just a matter of calling up a suitable preset or creating your own patch using the editing parameters in your effects, but it can help to keep in mind how the effect was originally engineered.</i></dd>

<dd><i>The gated effect was first applied to drums, and involved putting up ambience mics in a very live room to capture the reverb sound. These mics were then fed through a conventional stereo gate, which was externally keyed from the close mics on the drum kit. Setting a hold time of half a second or so, followed by a fast release time, causes the gate to allow only the first half second of reverb to pass though after each drum hit, before closing again. Figure 1 shows how gated drums can be created using the traditional method. A compressor was often used to maintain the level of the reverb, and this is shown in the illustration. The result is the gated drum sound that has become something of a cliché, though the effect doesn't have to become stale if you use it sparingly.</i></dd>

<dd>Which is pretty much what I put in the article. My point is that you went off half cocked. I'm happy to admit the article needs work, I'm a computer programmer/Musician not a copywriter Jim. I contributed it with the intention of seeing it evolve &amp; hopefully improve with the contributions of others. I'm delighted to accept the suggested name change to lose the Camel Caps (and I note this for any articles I may add in the future) but I want <b>you</b> to be a little more discerning when it comes to tagging articles for deletion - especially in areas that you aren't knowledgable. The fact that it was tagged within 2 minutes of creation puts an absolute limit on how long you could have spent researching before making the decision... <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanic_15ef.html" title="User:Megamanic">Megamanic</a> 09:28, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

I've "Moved" Gated Reverb to Gated reverb as that's the concensus of just about everybody &amp; it makes sense. I've done a little bit more cleanup but I'm not best qualified to do this so it's over to the community.

<li><b>Keep</b>. <i>Contra</i> the nominator, this is a bona fide audio production technique which, as the article suggests, has been used extensively in a variety of formats. That said, the article could use sourcing and more information.

<dd>This isn't the place for the discussion but although Flanging is an exemplary article it would be very hard to do the same thing with Gated reverb as it's what I would call a "derived" effect (the result of chaining two effects one after the other) whereas Flanging is a particular type of delay effect. If you examine anything you're going to do to a sound it drops into one of two camps - alteration (probably not the right term) or delay. A distortion pedal basically hard clips the signal which is an easy example of altering the timbre whereas a 1 second digital delay is a clear example of the latter. Flanging is the result of a very short delay and the way I remember from my copy of "The Digital Delay Handbook" it goes 1-3ms = Phasing, 4-10ms = Flanging, then in through Chorusing &amp; ADT to slapback echo so maybe we need an article on the theory of signal processing that brings all of these primary &amp; secondary effects together &amp; more importantly is linked to by all of these articles. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanic_15ef.html" title="User:Megamanic">Megamanic</a> 08:10, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
