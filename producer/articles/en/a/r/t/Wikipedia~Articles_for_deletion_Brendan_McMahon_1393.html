<p>I created this article and claim authorship. The article was prodded by <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> with the text: This article does not establish encyclopedic notability; being convicted of doing nasty things to animals, with a one-year prison sentence is not in and of itself sufficient grounds for an encyclopedia article; neither is ownership of an obscure finance firm. There is no evidence given for his single crime being a particular cause célèbre of the time, or having any effect on contemporary law, culture or criminology.</p>
<p>I didn't notice that it was prodded before it was deleted. I have restored and would like to contest the prod by bringing it here. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardcavell_48b5.html" title="User:Richardcavell">Richardcavell</a> 01:13, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Mere compliance with the letter of verifiability &amp;c shows that something <i>is able</i> to be included; it does not, and cannot, automatically show that it <i>has to be</i> be included. It's a crime, and it's a nasty crime, but it's not important, it's not significant, there is nothing which makes it worth including <i>in an encyclopedia</i>.

<li><b>Delete</b>: It is a borderline case. It's a horrible story, no doubt, and shocking, and I'm sure there was considerable infamy (which means notability, in a case like this), but the question is whether the subject has become a by-word for animal cruelty or an emblem of what is wrong with the world. It is not really a prod, so the nominator has done the right thing. (By the way, that last sentence is pretty irrelevant, as the man's marijuana and speed use is unimportant, unless there is a causal connection the article does not explain.) Perhaps the best thing would be to <b>merge</b> the information as part of an "Infamous incidents" section of <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_cruelty.html" title="Animal cruelty">animal cruelty</a>, with a redirect. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:16, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Regarding the news articles in the non-Australian and non-New Zealand press (the subject was NZ-born) - all these articles appear to be reprints or rewrites of international newswire articles and NOT original journalism by foreign journalists. The CNN article is sourced to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a>. The Manila Times article is sourced to <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agence_France_Presse_1cfa.html" title="Agence France Presse">Agence France Presse</a>. The South Africa article seems very much like a cut-down version of the AFP story. The Washington Times link appears to be broken, but its likely that its a wire story too. Newswire stories (which by the nature of their platform, carry many more minor stories than newspaper) are simply lifted from a online computer feed and required minimal effort by a newspaper editor. If it was a really substantial story, international journalists would not just be doing copying wire stores. (oh and the Anchorage article is a brief paragraph in a just-for-fun "News of the Weird" column). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:01, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>; significant news coverage in Australia and internationally, in any case it passes the J14B notability test. --</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Not encyclopedically notable as a criminal ("drug-crazed person kills animals" is not particularly unique or remarkable). There are many, many stories that get coverage in multiple places in international news media but which are not encyclopedically notable (this one is a "news of the weird" article which has shock value for journalists, and seems to have disseminated internationally through newswires, not original foreign journalism). (And incidentally, the current article content has various inaccuracies. (The sentence was 16 months, up for parole in 12. The single bestiality charge was dropped for lack of evidence. The article also fails to mention the subject's psychosis from a heavy drug habit)). Okay as a brief mention in the infamous incidents section of animal cruelty article. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:04, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
