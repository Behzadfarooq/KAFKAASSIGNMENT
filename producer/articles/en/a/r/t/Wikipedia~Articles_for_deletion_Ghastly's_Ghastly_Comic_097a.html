<li>'The article does contain a lot of duplicated material that can easily be found on the comic's page itself. Considering that Ghastly writes several other comics, this page would probably be of better service amalgamated into an article relating to Ghastly's comic conglomerate, Tentacled Epics, to also include information about his other series, Apophenia 357 and his forthcoming works.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Along with Sexy Losers, Ghastly's Ghastly Comic is representative of adult webcomics.

<li><b>Keep</b> There are tons of webcomic entries on wikipedia that nobody's ever heard of. The only reason this particular article is up for deletion is because it actually has gotten attention. Ghastly's Ghastly comic is popular and noteworthy compared to a lot of comic articles. Amongst all of them, it makes the cut just because there are so many less noteworthy here than it.209.86.72.159 09:14, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Users with low edit counts are often unfamiliar with our <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a>, and so unaware of what counts when it comes to encyclopaedia articles. Your argument is a case in point. You make the fallacious "If article X them article Y." argument, and you make a bare asserting that the subject is popular and noteworthy, expecting that we will take you at your word. We don't work on the basis of accepting personal testimony of Wikipedia editors.

<li>The comic is notable to me, but according to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> it seems that anything that spreads by word of mouth or personal recommendation fails the notability criteria (guides?). If notability is transitive, I came across Ghastly's comic through Sexy Losers through Stile Project. <b>Reluctant delete</b>, since we're going by the rules. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGargoyleMT_d768.html" title="User:GargoyleMT">GargoyleMT</a> 13:19, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#PAPER</a> would suggest that there's no real point in getting rid of it, since it's not advertising or spamming, and it's a fairly well-written, informative, concise piece. There's no value given to wiki by getting rid of it, besides making the lists of wiki articles a bit smaller and neater, I suppose. I am liking the idea of a central Tentacle Epics article, however, since all of them together would be enough to pass the notability criteria, I would think. Can we reach an agreement that instead of deletion, it should be merged with the other works of Ghastly into a Tentacled Epics article? 209.86.74.146 15:34, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - the green tentacle thing has become an often-posted humorous image on <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fark.com.html" title="Fark.com">Fark.com</a> discussions (<a href="http://michel.burte.free.fr/divpict/tentacoowape.jpg" class="external text" title="http://michel.burte.free.fr/divpict/tentacoowape.jpg" rel="nofollow">image</a>), so it is in effect a kind of meme nowadays. I didn't know that the image was based on a comic until now but, to quote another user on another deletion discussion, "I find it a vital service for Wikipedia to bring me information on life's obscure topics". <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 02:11, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b> per WP:WEB, as above (but only weak per Esn's comment - if there's more to say about this, I could be convinced to change)</s> . Please note that there was apparently an entreaty on another website to readers of this comic to come over and "vote," which may explain the new users here (please see Link's link above for more details). Also a person claiming to be the author of the comic seems to have participated in the discussion over there, which brings up concerns about WP:AUTO (assuming he is who he says he is, of course). So that should be kept in mind - those new user comments certainly "count" (to the extent anyone's counting), but may not be as unbiased as your average comment. However, I'd also like to add that if you've just come to wikipedia for the first time to vote, we're glad you're here and encourage you to stay and explore and see how you can contribute. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 02:33, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
