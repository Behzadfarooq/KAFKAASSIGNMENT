This was done (and it's the section presently found in the Puerto Rico article) but since so many facts had been accumulated an article was created to list them all. Everyone of these facts is verifiable since the majority come from existing Wikipedia articles. The problem with merging would be that the section would get unmaneagable and long and would detract from other useful information.

<li><b>Move</b> to templatespace. Set it up the way the main DYK is... the template contains the current tidbits and the template talk has an archive of all the previously displayed tidbits. A few trivia facts at a time are nice but the whole list may not be necessary in articlespace. (note, the DYK at the portal and the one in the main article should be driven by the same template and work from the same list of facts, IMHO, rather than being separate (and different in appearance) as they are now) If that's not acceptable, then <b>keep</b> it the way it is.

<dd>Yes. That template's talk page is empty though, unlike the main DYK template which has the stash of previously used and not yet used factlets. (or trivions, if you prefer, it's a <a href="../../../u/o/m/UOM_bb89.html" title="UOM">UOM</a> thing I guess)... Move these facts there, and then use the template in the portal in the main article too.

<dd>Also, I do not support a merge into any article, as long as that merge will be in the form of new "trivia" sections. Please, if there is going to be a merge, please do it so that it flows nicely within the text. I prefer "Although it is a misconception that in his time, Napoleon Bonaparte was a man of short stature, he was 5'6.5", a perfectly acceptable height for Frenchmen of his time," in the appropriate section, over "Did you know Napoleon Bonaparte was actually 5'6.5"?" <a href="../../../a/d/n/User%7EAdniel_37e6.html" title="User:Adniel">Adniel</a> 02:40, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Lar. They should be driven by the the same information. The original idea was a template with the template talk pertaining the unused facts (as the wiki DYK) but it was changed for simplicity for users. The portal is a work in progress so please bear with me on the &lt;div&gt;. Also if it is to be kept it should be in the style of the wiki main page since it's an accepted style and it was the form from which it was conceived. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoelr31_1d76.html" title="User:Joelr31">Joelito</a> 03:00, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Every one of these facts <b>already IS</b> in the encyclopedia though, and the links in the DYK tidbits show you where, this DYK is just a different way to get connected. As a surfer (I hit random articles for fun, for the discovery of what I might find...), I like to find interesting things that I didn't know were connected. Moving the facts to the specific articles reduces the serendipity effect by burying them where they're harder to find. They're all relevant to Puerto Rico, after all. Unless you're saying you think the DYK concept as a whole is flawed? I admit a POV there, I'm 6 for 6 on articles I initially created that were nominated for DYK being selected for the main page so I obviously like DYK. <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 03:19, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>No</b>, we shouldn't create similar articles for <b>every</b> main article. That sort of feels like a strawdog to me... Please review my input to consensus (I hate calling it a "vote") above... I said <i>move it to templatespace</i> and make it be one unified template that is used both on the portal and the main article, with keep as a second choice. But I'd say that any subject big enough to have a portal may well be deserving of a DYK if the portal editors want to make one. They're adding valuable content and links. (your flag example would be fine in my book, as a template, if WP ever gets large enough to have a portal for American flags... (maybe it already does? I didn't go check!)

Now that the article has been moved (portalfy-ed) maybe this AfD is now moot? Dunno.

<li><b>Keep</b> I do not understand why the article is on this list in first place. Articles of the same category but for other different countries should be made as well. WP is not a random collection of information, but it is made to inform people about topics. That's wikipedia's essential function. Well, actually, if you think about it, wikipedia sort of is a random collection of information actually, since we cover everything from disasters to Miss Universe, from Religion and art to boxing, from Medicine to poverty....<i><a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntonioMartin_6aa4.html" title="User:AntonioMartin">Antonio Hyperactive Child Martin</a></i> 09:25, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Although this article is quite different from most of wikipedia I belive it's to long to merge with <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and also consider that it contains to much valuable information as to simply delete it. A possible solution maybe changing the style of the article from 'trivia' to prose.<a href="../../../n/n/f/User%7ENnfolz_1d11.html" title="User:Nnfolz">Nnfolz</a> 05:07, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>This article is definitely too long to merge with <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, but the information is too varied to turn to prose. I think that it's fine the way it is. And for those who claim that the article is "different" from wikipedia, why don't you check wikipedia's own <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecent_additions_2250.html" title="Wikipedia:Recent additions">Did you know archive</a>? This is what this page was modeled after. If it needs to go in a portal that's fine, but we already have precedent for a page like this. --<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStux_2586.html" title="User:Stux">Stux</a> 17:18, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
