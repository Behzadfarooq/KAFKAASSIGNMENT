<dd>IMO, a reference which is a catalog listing cannot vouch for 'notability', as the criteria for inclusion are unclear. Much better would be articles mentioning the institution (not necessarily in a complimentary fashion). All that's needed is notability (or notoriety as the case may be), IOW 'claim to fame' mentioned by a reliable neutral publication - i.e. why is it special. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 15:37, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But the newspaper article would be reliable and near the bottom it says "It has since grown to become one of the largest Orthodox synagogues in North America", that is its claim to fame
<ul>
<li>That was my point, but the catalog reference is not useful and the article as of now still reads like an ad. The first sentence should probably say "...one of the largest Orthodox synagogues in North America...", and there should be reliable neutral references backing it up. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 16:30, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Two or three days ago <a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN">User:PZFUN</a> was nominating some Judaism-related articles for deletion during stub-cleaning. Together with mostly summer camps he inexplicably managed to list a number of rather notable Hasidic rebbes. Predictably this led to some nasty finger pointing and name-calling on the administators' noteboard and on AfD itself.</p>
<p>The full helping of bile is <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html#Nomination_by_PZFUN.2C_and_Speedy_keep_of_several_articles_by_Slimvirgin" title="WP:AN/I">here</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html#Featured_Article_Editor_being_attacked_for_cleaning_out_a_stub_category" title="WP:AN/I">here</a>.</p>
<p>I am re-listing the articles (minus the rebbes of couse) here in the hope to restore civility. Intentionally no rationale is given why any article might be delete-worthy. Please read the articles and make your statement on the worth of the article itself. Rude remarks and blanket statements are discouraged, those are never helpful. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 02:11, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I consider it highly impolite at best to remove with a keystroke all the efforts of many, who commented and voted on many of these AfD's. I think the vast majority of the comments were very civil and objective. To start from scratch, tossing away many hours of work by many caring people because there was <i>suspicion</i> of POV or GF on the part of the nominator (which I believe proved to be a false alarm) is simply wrong. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 02:46, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree. I think all the previous noms should be closed as either no consensus, or reopened where they were. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:54, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The votes at the various VfD for the articles were going along fine until the Dr. came along. There was absolutely NO acrimony on the voting pages themselves, everything was very civil. The results would have been either "no consensus" or "keep" because enough "keep" votes had already come in. Almost ALL those who voted "keep" gave far more detailed and researched reasons than those who voted "delete". It is puzzling, to say the least, why this new very unusual listing is now needed. Those who have voted on those VfD pages should be informed that this move was taking place. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 03:08, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree about the civility, though not necessarily about the potential outcome. Personally I think there should be consistent WP policies about all clubs and organizations and their grouping, if any. But leaving that aside, I totally agree that this re-listing is most improper. The work product invested by people by researching each case and voting, and the ensuing <i>civil</i> discussions, cannot just be tossed aside on someone's whim. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 03:16, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is all silly, wikipedia is big enough for all of these jewish summer camps. Camps for Jews are an important part of both european and american jewish history. 24.60.163.16 05:21, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is all <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and never should have happened. PZFUN deserves to be blocked. But now we're here it may be useful to review these cases, as summer camps have intrinsic notability and WP:V problems. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 07:21, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It is time to stop the crusade against perfectly non-obtrusive and non-offensive articles about legitimate topics. What is the problem with keeping them? That Wikipedia will be more complete??

<li>Is there any reason why these shouldn't be merged into ... oooh, lets say Jewish summer camps and local organizations. A paragraph mentioning what they generally have in common (constituency, activities, staffing), and then a list with locations and any <i>truly</i> important distinctions noted there. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>
<ul>
<li>GWO: It's simple, because there are too many of them, they are very diverse, and they have different histories and facts surrounding them. Basically all the information about them would not fit into a normal page. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 10:08, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Some of them are unique, but a lot are basically the same. <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Galil_1437.html" title="Camp Galil">Camp Galil</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Gesher_8ba0.html" title="Camp Gesher">Camp Gesher</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Miriam_5003.html" title="Camp Miriam">Camp Miriam</a> -- are these <i>really</i> more different than they are similar? Their differences could easily be summarised in a list / table at Habonim Dror summer camps. Much of the additional information is completely superfluous. I mean, do we really need to know where <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Gesher_8ba0.html" title="Camp Gesher">Camp Geshers</a> flagpole is, or how many baseball diamonds each camp has? -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>
<ul>
<li>GWO: Obviously we are not focusing on the "flagpoles", the point is not just what you and I may think of these camps, it's obvious that there are plenty of other readers who are delighted to get this information and anything else that can be added to it in the years to come. In the USA going to summer camp is almost a way of life for many Jewish kids, it's part of their fun connection to Judaism in many ways, and it cannot be minimized and should not be trivialized and certainly should not be deleted. Wikipedia's servers can handle it. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 11:45, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry. I was under the impression this was an encyclopedia, not a holiday brochure. Playing softball is a way of life for lots of Americans: are we to allow every softball team a page. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>
<ul>
<li>Oh come on GWO: Have you honsetly read <i>all</i> 1,200,000+ articles on Wikipedia? When all the articles about <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porn_star.html" title="Porn star">Porn stars</a> and <a href="../../../n/u/d/Nudity.html" title="Nudity">Nudity</a> will go then I can start comparing things here to the Britanicca, but for now, <i>all</i> decent information is more than welcome as far as most people are concerned. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 12:27, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm all for including notable pornstars, notable summer camps and notable nudity. But the criteria for inclusion is notability, not usefulness to kids planning their vacations. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></li>
<li>So what it boils down to then is what values to go by, those that value porn stars and nudists (what's notable about filth? -- it's like measuring garbage) or those that value Jewish children (who are inherently precious) and the notable institutions that serve them. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 15:01, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Our apologies; we missed the part on the Wikipedia Main Page where Wikipedia's adherence to some interpretation of Judeo-Christian "moral values" was cited. Until it does appear, however, I'm afraid the standards for inclusion for this (or, likely, for any other) encyclopedia will revolve around verifiability and notability before it does any utterly POV-ridden concept such as "values." <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 20:40, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> This is an excellent example of what is wrong with AfD right now. It appears most if not all of these were nominated with no attempt to discuss the problems with these articles on the individual talk pages. Granted, what we have here are a number of summer camps and clubs, which in my opinion fall well short of current inclusion guidelines and the vast majority of them should likely be deleted if you look at them on their merits, independent of the issues surrounding the nominations. Still, if a reasonable effort had been made to discuss these articles individually this whole mess could have possibly been avoided; or at least some civility could have been retained during the AfD process.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:38, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wonder if there is any good way to announce mass nominations of articles. One can discuss the merits of an individual article on a talk page, sure, but what would one do when one goes spring-cleaning with, say, ten summer camps, or student societies or porno starlets? <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 17:54, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No there really isn't a good way... which is why mass noms are not the best idea. I understand the concept if it being easier to look at a bunch of similar articles together... but really, best practice is to individually nominate and discuss each article on its merits. Mass nominations just always end up being acrimonious.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:34, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There are a lot of articles on American Jewish summer camps appearing on wikipedia, many of do not appear to be very notable: <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Modin_17b7.html" title="Camp Modin">Camp Modin</a>, for one. If these articles are to stay on wikipedia then I would suggest that new articles be made, perhaps one for each US state, in which information about the camps in those areas can be placed, rather than having this huge number pages on camps, most of them not exceeding about 250 words in size. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Martinp23</a> 18:48, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree. Camp Modin is one of the oldest Jewish camps in the US and was the inspiration for a recent feature film. We need many more articles like this, not less. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 20:56, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The fact is that many of these articles are onyl a few hundred words long, and should either be expanded or amalgamated. With all the camps from a state in one article, it will be easier for the reader too compare the camps, and look and Judaism in these areas. The more notable camps shoudl have their articles extended. <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Agawam_94db.html" title="Camp Agawam">Camp Agawam</a> is really a tiny article which should be combined with others into a new article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">Martinp23</a> 21:09, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Please expand them then if you think they need more information. However, I would be happy to see stubs on every camp in the US, even the non-Jewish ones. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 21:12, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Grouping by state is a poor taxonomy, as I see no reason that geographic location (certainly on a scale smaller then "regional") would significantly differentiate them. If anything, group them by ideology/mission. Better yet, have a single article. --<a href="../../../n/m/a/User%7ENmagedman_ad26.html" title="User:Nmagedman">Nmagedman</a> 23:31, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> As per <a href="../../../b/r/e/WP%7EBREAK_aee2.html" title="WP:BREAK">WP:BREAK</a>, a Best Current Practice for page development is to start with a single page, to create sections as needed, and to fork those sections off into their own articles as the parent article matures. Here, however, we find a large number of stub articles with little indication of their <i>individual</i> importance. Repeatedly, the argument was made below that the camps are notable because they have been around for many years and have had an impact on many peoples' lives. I accept that argument for the camps as a whole, but see no justification for articles on each individual camp. I therefore propose that the camp articles be merged into e.g. Jewish-American camp movement discussing the <i>significance of these camps (as a whole) on the Jewish-American experience/culture</i>, with sub-sections for each camp indicating how it <i>substantively</i> contributed to or differentiated itself from the rest of the movement. --<a href="../../../n/m/a/User%7ENmagedman_ad26.html" title="User:Nmagedman">Nmagedman</a> 23:31, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I fully agree with this - just because they have affected lots of people doesn't make them notable.

<li>Jewish summer camps do not merely "impact peoples' lives" in the secular sense of "having fun" or whatever. These camps are an integral part of the Jewish cultural experience. They are not just about playing baseball or swimming in the lake. Those things might happen, but the main purpose is to provide a place where Jewish children and youth can affirm their Jewishness in an accepting, positive environment. As such, they are more akin to feminist retreats or GLBT retreats or some other cultural minority that does not always feel accepted or able to be "out" in the greater society. Those of you who did not grow up Jewish in America (or Canada, in the case of some camps) cannot truly understand the experience, anymore that a heterosexual can truly understand what it feels like to be gay in a homophobic society. If these were gay or feminist camps, would we even be having this conversation? Because the pattern of these delete nominations -- and not just camps, there have been others! -- has been to target Jews or Jewish institutions that might not be known in the general public, but are nevertheless as important in the Jewish experience as a lot of other things I've never even heard of that are still here on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERooster613_e82f.html" title="User:Rooster613">Rooster613</a> 01:44, 24 May 2006 (UTC)Rooster613</li>

<li>"Going Down The Pub" is an integral part of the "British cultural experience". Doesn't mean my local pub deserves an article. One can write about the importance of Jewish Summer Camps as a social construct without detailing each individual camp. I'd love to see such an article. Of course, writing such an article is <i>hard</i>, and requires research. Merely enumerating and describing each camp is easy, and pointless.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> [note: I voted Merge above. Since the thread has grown from there, I'm adding this rather than striking what I have above.] There are at least a couple hundred articles on various summer camps on Wikipedia, not to mention high schools and everybody's pet organization. Personally, I think they are <i>all</i> NN rubbish and have no place in an encyclopedia. However, it is a waste of energy to repeat the "Are summer camps encyclopedic?" debate on <i>each and every</i> camp article on WP. Hash out the debate in a guideline discussion. Once a standard is agreed upon, then sweep through all the camp articles, applying the standard equally. In the meantime, I would not be averse to flagging these (and all) camp articles with {{importance}}. --<a href="../../../n/m/a/User%7ENmagedman_ad26.html" title="User:Nmagedman">Nmagedman</a> 08:20, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Notability is Relative</b>: By any rule of logic, reason, and fairness, one should not short-circuit the system by nominating articles for deletion, when what certain articles may need is improvement and sources, and one needs to step back from one's own mind-set and think of entire groups of articles that may be important in other contexts. I did NOT write the articles on this page up for VfDs but nevertheless if enough people feel that these topics (about Jewish Summer Camps) are important enough to write them up, it must mean that many young parents or campers or people out there WANT to read about them, so that in itself makes these articles worthy of being defended. <b>A lot of the shouting about "notable" is bogus because notability is a relative concept</b>, and as I have stated, when the day comes that Wikipedia will do away with articles about porn stars and nudity I will know that it has become a "real" encyclopedia. <b>Why are Jewish Summer camps "not notable"?</b> They play a major and very significant role in the lives of hundreds of thousands of Jewish kids growing up in North America for two months out of every year. Jewish kids love their camp experiences more than they like school. Camp fees for two months are often the equivalent of an entire year's yeshiva or day school tuition, so summer camps are important features of <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_education.html" title="Jewish education">Jewish education</a> and life! In fact it's surprising that there are so few of these articles, there will surely be more by new editors unaware of this fuss who will just write new articles in the future. Sure, the articles are wishy-washy and are obviously often written by people who want to get attention, but how is that different to other areas? Sure, in the Jews and Judaism sections we have articles that need work, is that not true everywhere on Wikipedia? There are editors who have spent hundreds of hours devoted to improving the articles, but they are few in number and it will take time, maybe even years. It is not wise to ignore the broader picture and to not take the long-term view, and "delete on sight". <b>There is now a new self-justifying rationale that one can just skip the "needs improvement" requests on article pages and just put "VfD" on them with the excuse that they just are doing it to "get the attention" of other editors -- "The New Deletionism"</b>. To expect action and solutions within days is not realistic. It will take months and years to improve things. <b>Writing and editing takes time, not to mention all the man-hours spent on debates and discussions on talk pages on Wikipedia.</b> Wikipedia has come a long way, and there is a long way to go yet, but we should not let deletionists to throw the baby out with the bathwater with articles in the name of making Wikipedia more "encyclopedic" when in fact, notability is relative, and more caution and care is called for. Wikipedia is not a "finished product", it is definitely a "work of art in progress" and no works of art are produced overnight. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 16:27, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Holy living shit. You really believe that wikipedia will be improved if it discards everything that does not fit your moral code. That's a scary, scary, scary idea. Thank God you're in a minority of one. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>
<ul>
<li>GWO: Who the heck said anything about a "moral code"??? I was citing examples to make a point, that while some people think that porn stars are notable, others do not, and by the same token while some people think that summer camps are important and notable others do not. That's it in a nutshell. If I was truly worried about "moral codes" I would spend my time someplace else other than Wikipedia. I am not detached from reality, so please don't make it sound like that. Not everyone sees things the same way. There all kinds of "encyclopedias" out there, depending on one's <i>interests</i>. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 17:23, 24 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>while some people think that porn stars are notable, others do not</i> -- and you're telling me that your railing against porn and nudity (nudity&#160;?!?) isn't based on morals but ... what, exactly? Incidentally, if you think wikipedia's going to become cleanopedia, I suggest you investigate how <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomis.html" title="Bomis">Bomis</a> makes its money. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>
<ul>
<li>GWO: So you think that Bomis's X-rated history should guide the fate of Wikipedia? Anyhow, it's a poor argument to believe that because Bomis is what it is that therefore Wikipedia is the same. People are free to be <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morality.html" title="Morality">moral</a>, <b>im</b>moral, or <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amorality.html" title="Amorality"><b>a</b>moral</a>, but that is also not the point of my argument which you insist on twisting. My point is that "notability" does not have the same meaning or definition in all situations and is not the same for all people, something which should be very obvious but which is often ignored. One could just as clearly say that while some people may think that different species of rare insects may be "notable", for those who couldn't care less about bugs, "bug xyz" crawling in the Mojave Desert is simply <i>not</i> notable -- whereas something that does interest them, like the things that revolve around the education and development of children, such as Summer camps, <i>is</i> extremely notable. My only argument here is that the notion of <b>notability is relative</b>. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 18:04, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>My point is that "notability" does not have the same meaning or definition in all situations and is not the same for all people, something which should be very obvious but which is often ignored.</i> -- No. Your point is further than that. Your point is that notability is relative, but <i>your</i> concept of it is the one that should apply to wikipedia. i.e. remove the famous, notorious, filthy, obscene, unpleasant-but-widely-known pornstars whom you find so distasteful, but keep the non-famous-but-thoroughly-wholesome summer camps because they're so super-important (at least to the middle-class Jewish boys from the midwest to whom they cater). My point (if I still have one) is that that's hilarious. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></li>
<li>GWO: What may be "hilarious" to you is pathetic to someone else. No need to make fun of "middle-class Jewish boys from the midwest" which I would say could be construed as a very offensive statement or worse, don't you think? Oh my, why do you put words into my mouth. I have never proposed <i>any</i> of the things that you attribute to me. I was pointing to examples of differences of perspective that prove that there can <i>never</i> be a universal standard to guide notability. Not everyone watches or has an interest in porn stars, nor should they, but the only thing that I have maintained is that no-one on Wikipedia or anywhere can decide upon universal rules for notability, nothing more and nothing less, and please do not attribute words to me that I have not stated specifically. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 19:23, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>GWO: <i>No need to make fun of "middle-class Jewish boys from the midwest"</i> -- I didn't make fun of them, or even say anything derogatory about them, except to say that an individual camp that caters exclusively to them might not be particularly notable. So take your faux-outrage and implications of anti-semitism and go and write a good article about the cultural importance of Jewish Summer Camps, and fewer descriptions off their individual amenities. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: First of all, a term is only considered a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> if it has only recently created. The term "Kiddush club" has been around for a considerably long time, and more significantly, it has been accepted into the lexicon of contemporary Orthodox Judaism. Secondly, it is certainly encyclopedic, being an <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">important</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notable</a> cultural phenomenon among synagogue-going American Jews. --<a href="../../../d/l/a/User%7EDLand_35ee.html" title="User:DLand">DLand</a><a href="../../../d/l/a/User_talk%7EDLand_38e8.html" title="User talk:DLand"><font color="green"><sup><small>TALK</small></sup></font></a> 03:53, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>"Kiddush clubs" are simply a <i>shtick</i> used by some people to leave the synagogue earlier, eat earlier, consume liquor, and socialize with friends. This term has not even spread to all or most communities. It is hard for me to appreciate what cultural significance this might have, though I understand why this practice was criticized by the OU. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 16:45, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Saberwyn: Why don't you put those questions on the article's talk page and contact those who care about it and jog them along. There is no point in demanding "instant information" like pouring oneself a fresh cup of instant coffee for instant gratification. Gathering more information takes time and writing takes time. Articles need time to develop, and they need to have the basics in place, put there by previous editors that will take things to the next stage. This article is a respectable beginning. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 12:36, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Goodness Saberwyn, there is no offence here whatsoever. Kindly note that I did <i>not</i> write these articles nor would I, as they are not in my real area of interest, but when I see that others have bothered to write up these kind of things and post them I therefore conclude that they are important and deserve further patience and scrutinity, and that they do not deserve to be "evicted" just because they are about children. You will find that articles dealing with children's topics will often sound and come across as somewhat "childish" or "simplistic" but that is no reason to get rid of them. They are important and it is NOT realistic to expect that these articles should conform to the standards of a sophisticated child psycholoogy magazine. Wikipedia is for everyone, it is not an encyclopedia for super-specialists who will doubtless look elsewhere for their information in any case. When ordinary people log on, they want to read ordinary articles about ordinary subjects, and the more sophisticated editors on Wikipedia should not lose sight of that reality. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 15:14, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Uniqueness is generally not particularly sufficient. I see that it has been around 50 years which is pretty good, but I'm sure that a lot of ethnic/religious youth groups have also been around that length of time and are not regarded as being notable. I agree that the sources are reliable, but I'm also sure that many regional religous/ethnic group magazines will make a noticeboard section about their youth programs so to speak. What is the size of this camp, for instance. Did it win awards for its social work? At the moment the articel is long but seems to have been inflated by large amounts of material which seems like a camp programme/manual/calendar/schedule.`<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> - <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Blnguyen_21c3.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Blnguyen">review me</a> 07:26, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, I did create my account only yesterday; long time user of this site, first time member. I use Wikipedia as a reference, including looking at the page <i>Camp Massad</i>, an organization I do have some familiarity with. When I saw that Camp Massad was up for deletion, I created this account in order to give some credence to my arguments as to why this article should be kept. I can understand how that can be misconstrued as sock-puppetry, but I assure you it was only done to speak up against efforts to remove this article. --Darknightonight 21:24, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The camp is known through most of North America, though it is a Canadian camp a lot of Americans have attended and are attending.

A camp like <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Massad_68d5.html" title="Camp Massad">Camp Massad</a> is unique in its programming and location, therefore the article should be kept so that other people that might hear about it can look at the article and know what the camp is all about.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Without repeating all the previous information, I agree that camp massad is an important aspect of the Jewish community of Manitoba and Canada. It is a great place for children to connect to their Judaism to help teach about their own religion. It is very important this article stays posted since it discusses the programs and everything that occurs and is very informative on it. This is the most positive information I have seen on one camp in a long time. It is very informative without being too personal. Please consider this for the camp's benefit before you take it down.

When you speak of something as wideranging as wikipedia, who's to say that one article is more significant than another. This page and this camp are obviously important enough in the lives and history of the many people who have passed through it's gates in the many years this camp has been around.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not about to vote delete yet, but I can't agree with some of the rationales being offered in support of keeping the article. <i>One of three camps supported by the Cohen foundation</i>: why is this notable? I don't think we have an article about the Cohen Foundation. <i>Site of famous 1998 fire</i>: the fire occurred off-season, was confined to only one building and, fortunately, caused no injuries. <a href="http://www.eagletribune.com/news/stories/19980312/FP_001.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eagletribune.com/news/stories/19980312/FP_001.htm" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> This is not the stuff of <a href="../../../f/i/r/Category%7EFires_845d.html" title="Category:Fires">Category:Fires</a>, and I doubt the camp would consider the fact that they had a fire 8 years ago as a justification for listing them in an encyclopedia. In fact, I can find no Internet references to this fire other than three articles in the local newspaper (the one I just mentioned and <a href="http://www.eagletribune.com/news/stories/19980314/HA_004.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eagletribune.com/news/stories/19980314/HA_004.htm" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, <a href="http://www.eagletribune.com/news/stories/19980714/HA_005.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eagletribune.com/news/stories/19980714/HA_005.htm" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>). Again, that's the local newspaper. I can't find any references to the camp at all in the New York Times or Washington Post archives. <i>Pulitzer Prize winning Eagle-Tribune</i>: Yes, the Eagle-Tribune has won two Pulitzer Prizes, but they had nothing to do with this camp or the fire. I don't think a Pulitzer Prize conveys encyclopedicity to everything a newspaper ever has or will report on. ... I don't know enough about this camp to say it's non-notable, but I don't think the keep voters should exaggerate the importance of the camp and significance of this article. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 03:31, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>According to <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_02d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity">Wikipedia:Vanity</a>; "Most often, vanity edits are edits about the editors themselves, their close relatives or their personal associates". You have thus far failed to convince me, and may fail to convince others, that this article does not fall within the bounds of that particular guideline. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 22:44, 25 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What part of "the person who wrote it has no personal association of any type with Audra Williams" are you finding difficult to understand? The person who wrote it is not Audra, or a friend of Audra's, or a relative of Audra's, or a personal associate of Audra's. The person who wrote it meets <i>no</i> criterion that would make this a vanity article per <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_02d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity">Wikipedia:Vanity</a>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 22:48, 25 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Serves pretty much the same purpose (and I'm not convinced the principal authors are not connected with Audra, even if only in a virtual way ie exchanges with each other on the same chat boards, emails etc,) For instance, this article was discussed on the babble strike board, Audra expressed her desire not to see it deleted and has posted to that effect on the talk page. When someone campaigns not to have an article on themselves deleted that tells me the article serves the same purpose as a vanity page.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> First of all, I have no idea how this is being AfD'd. This guy would only be non-notable if it was a hoax, which it's not. Carroll was already mentioned in the Michelle Kwan article before his own article was even created. He's listed on the official figure skating sites given by Liface above.

<dd>It is a lot easier to judge whether someone is say "a christian" or "an anarchist" because they would refer to themselves as being members of these groups or ideoligies.

<dd>Those are ideologies. Criticising the 9/11 Commision report is not an ideology. i.e. Anarchists and Christians share a set of world views and philosophies on life.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Do we really want Category:Piracy computer and video games? Because I think that would open up another layer of needless caretaking in the CVG space. It paves the way for categorising games by theme, and not by genre and so we could have Category:Ninja computer and video games and a whole plethora of others. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 11:45, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't agree with any of the reasons cited here to delete. The list is useful as a record of pirate-themed video games. A category is not useful unless one has already found one of the articles. Indiscriminate collection of information? How so? The list discriminates based on the titles being about pirates. How is that not discriminate? <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 13:19, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. A list can be useful for discovering games, films, etc. which do not have an article.

<li><b>Delete</b> for now. It's premature to have an encyclopedia article on this particular topic. There isn't enough independent material yet on which to base this prospective article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Looks very interesting, I hope the project goes well, but it's not quite <i>notable</i> yet. (~Kylu) <a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.145.133.34.html" title="User:207.145.133.34">207.145.133.34</a> 21:36, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm a bit confused and a bit "angry" that this kind of information was deleted. Why? There has been given at least three references to media coverage (although only one/two in English). And then the main reason for deleting it is Notability. My understandig of that concept is weird since I think Majestic-12_Distributed_Search_Engine was notable. I looked up this project when I first read about it in the news (Norwegian Digi.no article). Hoping for some neutral information and different viewpoints (typically for Wikipedia in areas with diverging viewpoints). Now its just deleted by far as I can see some far fetched concepts about notability and not working project (it is in full operation with search possibilities last time I checked the site).

<li>I wrote this article on this local artist and he does alot of work with children and his music is wonderful. Just because he is not widely known doesn't mean that he cannot be part of this community. It is not self promoting as he has nothing to do with it. I mentioned the links because it is work that he has done and his websites are on it as well. I am not the best writer in any way, so all help would be greatly appreciated, don't delete article because lack of knowing the person, it is not fair to the rest who do. (Diane Gagnon)</li>

<li>That's the governing body, but if people are looking for an article about these camps, they are much more likely to look under Camp Ramah than National Ramah Commission. Under <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a> it would seem that <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Ramah_7209.html" title="Camp Ramah">Camp Ramah</a> is the more appropriate name, and even if someone moved the article to another name it would still be necessary to leave a redirect at <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Ramah_7209.html" title="Camp Ramah">Camp Ramah</a>.

<li><b>Strong keep and expand</b>. Ramah camps are one of the best-known, most influential, and best-documented educational programs associated with Conservative Judaism. A <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22camp+ramah%22" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22camp+ramah%22" rel="nofollow">large number of academic books and papers</a> document the Ramah educational vision, and its influence on North American Jewry. You could make a pretty strong argument for the case that Ramah, as an institution, has had more influence than many of the Conservative rabbis listed in Wikipedia. That said, the existing article makes it sound as though Ramah is nothing more than an administrative office in New York, overseeing activities at a dozen or so camps around the world, and that these camps are places where kids have a lot of fun. The article would benefit greatly from describing the history of Ramah camps, the role of Hebrew and Zionism in camp life, the influence that camp had on the evolution of egalitarianism within Conservative Judaism, the very large number of Conservative Movement leaders who have been campers and staff members at Ramah, and educational theories and practices that were devised as a part of camp, among other things. The article needs to be expanded quite a bit -- but the skeletal quality of the existing article shouldn't fool you into thinking that Ramah is unimportant or undeserving of a Wikipedia article.

<li><b>Keep</b> but rename or merge. As is, this is not an article. It needs to be pulled together under a stronger common theme with a different name, or perhaps merged to another page. Maybe one of the people/reports referenced on this page might qualify. But at the same time it doesn't seem to be OR, and the material covered does seem to be encyclopedic. There are plenty of other wikipedia pages that do deal with allegations - so long as the allegations are serious enough and at least potentially true, that's OK. POV is reason to cleanup, not reason to delete an article. Finally, I remind people that AFD is not a vote. It may be 'obvious' to you that the article is/is not worth keeping, but that is not a useful comment in our attempt to reach consensus.

<li><b>Keep</b> Is there anything in the article that is actually untrue? I don't think so. Certain questions have been raised by certain people and these people are senior whistle blowers. A suicide is involved. Certainly more work is required, but such is the nature of the Wikipedian beast. Yes the article is problematic but these issues have yet a long way to go before a clear view can be had. Deleting the article will only frustrate future researchers. The references are all quite valuable. The article can be utilized in building a clearer picture of this history. Deleting it amounts to suppression of information. --<a href="../../../w/m/_/User%7EWm_3eec.html" title="User:Wm">Wm</a> 12:28, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I've been reluctant to reach a final conclusion on this because although it has been a POV problem in the past, and probably still is, it does cover some stuff that should be covered (Lance Collins, for example, who was widely covered in the media, is currently covered nowhere else on WP but here). I think in the end however that it would be better to start again from the ground up and not have to work off the legacy of this article. Some users have volunteered to help with working on this, I'd like to add my name to the list but invite them to start from scratch rather than trying to fix this article. As per the old <a href="../../../a/w/n/WP%7EAWNB_94e7.html" title="WP:AWNB">AWNB</a> discussion, it would be more appropriate at somewhere like foreign relations of Australia with East Timor, to tie in with the main article <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_Australia_a509.html" title="Foreign relations of Australia">foreign relations of Australia</a>. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 13:11, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem with the article is not that the writer has a POV (that's generally a given and <i>not</i> grounds to delete). The problem is that the article is more about the people who have made accusations, than about the accusations. It's more of a list than an article. Assuming that all these allegations are to do with <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Timorese_Declaration_of_Independence_1fb8.html" title="East Timorese Declaration of Independence">East Timorese Declaration of Independence</a> (currently a redirect to <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Timor_c0fb.html" title="East Timor">East Timor</a>) perhaps that article should be resurrected and expanded and these allegations be dealt with there. Alternately, they could be dealt with in the East Timor article itself, but that wouldn't feel right to me - just a little off topic. As I said above, this material may be uncomfortable for some people, but that is not a reason to delete it. Yes, it's POV and soapboxing and yes, it should be cleaned up so it deals with the issues (independance/genocide/cover up) and mentions the accusers, rather than the other way around, but none of that is not an excuse to delete it either.

<li><b>Delete</b> I say delete as well. As I said before someone reverted it back, haivng a wikipedia page is pointless anyways, the demographic trying to be reached will not find pspa through this anwyays. Also for the record, pspa just released issues 3/4 like seconds ago. And that 3-5k downloads is an average per issue. The biggest sites downloads came from pspupdates.com and pspmagazines.com both of which have amassed over a thousand each for the past issues. And BTW Josh Edgar is a former team member on the PSPA staff who left the project abruptly, because of dispute between which forum to use.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am relatively new to this but had read in one of the articles that if the subject was well known within a community (as ERICS is) then it could be considered notable. I have since read elsewhere that there are further conditions which are not fully met by this article. It is a shame that there was such a rude response in this AfD. Some of you perhaps should be more civil and polite when talking to newcomers. <a href="../../../d/j/b/User%7EDjb1985_5b01.html" title="User:Djb1985">Djb1985</a> 19:48, 24 May 2006 (UTC) - Adjusted 23:40, 25 May 2006</li>

<li>I think it would be a real shame to delete it as there are few societies of its kind in the world. I think that Wikipedia requires some origionality and lightness and I think that ERICS offers that. The spread of such a consept- of a society of icecream- would be facilitated by Wikipedia. The society clearly has an inclusive policy, shown by its inclusion of members of other coleges to the detriment of its name (as it is 'Emmanuel real ice cream society'). I feel that such inclusion would be very beneficial to those starting at any university. I am aware that ERICS sees a great deal of interest at th fresher's fair, a great increase in members each year and a great deal of new friendships blossoming. Friendships and such light fun clearly cut suicide rates... so I say SAVE A LIFE TODAY... VOTE TO SAVE ERICS on Wikipedia. *_hannah_* 20.13, 24 May 2006 (BST)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>P.S. I further feel that the ERICS article should be elongated to include details about the posts of 'Honorary snowman' and 'Chief Stirrer'.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Quote: "Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Cambridge" "It has been requested that this category be populated." So what do you want guys? More articles about Cambridge University Societies or fewer? ERICS has a niche role within Emmanuel community, just as the Pembroke Winnie-the-Pooh Society with Pembroke College. Emmanuel is well-known for being the 'friendly college' in its advertizing (with ducks, snowmen) - ERICS is part of that. Steve (Hon. Snowman 2003-4) x</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - First-time contributions for the last two editors. That being said, I commend to you folks <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which explains in some detail Wikipedia's policy as to for what it is and is not. Generally speaking, the needs and desires of the community of a single university (presuming, which we do not do on faith, that Cambridge University does indeed consider ERICS a significant and integral part of the campus) is not among them. The ways that a university club can be deemed notable enough for inclusion involve being a national organization with chapters spread across many universities or in having notable members amongst its ranks (such as <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_and_Bones_93ca.html" title="Skull and Bones">Skull and Bones</a>).

<p>I stumbled across this whilst clearing out old copyvio images. I tried and tried to find a reason to speedy this, but couldn't. It's a hoax, and a rather cruel one.

<p><b>Daughters of the Bible</b> is a novel written by <b>Izl Maller</b> that has appeared throughout college campuses and several online literary communities. The book has received <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_legend.html" title="Urban legend">urban legend</a> status due to some reports of <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible_code.html" title="Bible code">Bible code</a>. Some of the Equidistant Letter Sequence (ELS) or Bible code claims, are the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_c3f4.html" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a> found on the book’s 17th chapter entitled Ourobouros; specifically page 168. Others claim the book foretold the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a> and the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capture_of_Saddam_Hussein_4e32.html" title="Capture of Saddam Hussein">Capture of Saddam Hussein</a>. But perhaps the most noticeable claim is <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>. Bible code enthusiast have found that on page 79 of chapter 10, the book foretold the devastation of the hurricane and more ironically on that page the story talks of a storm that came in the night. <b>"The sea, it turned against us. With it the wind and sky, it swallowed everyone. A storm brought in the shores in the middle of the night destroying the entire village. All our resources were washed away, and blown away. The sky glowed green as enormous flashes of lightning burst throughout the ordeal. It was this that took from us our food, shelter and last your people.”</b> It is highly unlikely for ELS to be discovered in literature that correlates with its predictive topic. Yet recent blogs further fuel the books ability.</p>
<p>Despite being self-published, the book has acquired international status. Translations have surfaced in Arabic and French websites. The story takes place completely in China though Mandarin translations have been squashed due to its strong Religious Judeo-Christian views.</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. If this one is deleted, there's a long list of AP class articles that also need to be deleted.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>.

<li>From my random sampling, I am inclined to agree with Nick Y. However, instead of deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I was not aware of the previous nomination. It seemed to come closer to no concensus than keep IMO and that was <b>after</b> the article was completely rewritten from scratch. I still stand by my nomination but not because I want to disagree with those that voted keep last time. The AP Psycology is a good article but under the wrong name IMHO. This article could be made similar to AP psycology exam and would be acceptable to me but this stub I still vote delete. Make a new article AP Macroeconomics exam However all of the content here is worthless.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 23:09, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think this article should be <b>redirected</b> to <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Placement_Program_866e.html" title="Advanced Placement Program">Advanced Placement Program</a>. If someone wants to take the time to make it more like <a href="../../../a/p/_/AP_Psychology_a60e.html" title="AP Psychology">AP Psychology</a> or some of the other more fully expanded pages about <i>exams</i> then they can remove the redirect and put in the content in the future... The content that's there now about the specific incarnation of the course is nn. (I don't think that the title of the article would need to be changed to AP Macroeconomics exam though. By that logic the current article should be renamed to AP Macroeconomics course. People are much more likely to search on the simple phrase <a href="../../../a/p/_/AP_Macroeconomics_3fbb.html" title="AP Macroeconomics">AP Macroeconomics</a> than anything else, imho.) —<a href="../../../j/n/k/User%7EJnk_f429.html" title="User:Jnk">Jnk</a><small><sup>[<a href="../../../j/n/k/User_talk%7EJnk_e930.html" title="User talk:Jnk">talk</a>]</sup></small> 01:37, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Current state:"This course is for students interested in college-level work in economics. Study begins with fundamental economic concepts such as scarcity, opportunity costs, production possibilities, specialization, comparative advantage, demand, supply, and price determination. Major topics include measurement of economic performance, national income and price determination, and international economics and growth."</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>&#160;: It's not about the 'cultural difference' in chinese or english wiki, but only how you see this incident. Some see it as a joke or a graffe, some realize it's a big move of internet culture, and from now on, no report about hong kong internet culture can show full picture without mentioning 'uncle bus'. Btw, the vote for deletion in Chinese Wiki is proposed by Kevinhksouth, but unfortunately at this moment, the result is 8 vs 8. &#160;:P --<a href="../../../y/a/u/User%7EYau_8224.html" title="User:Yau">Yau</a> 15:20, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> It's definitely of popular culture significance - this phenomenon has some similarity to "All your base are belong to us" with the popularity of the modified music video clip. Some claims this does not belongs to encyclopedia, yet AYBAB2U shouldn't be here either based on the same line of reasoning - worse as it is just a made up music video based on a game opening and a catchy Engrish tagline, vs this is a real incident. For AYBAB2U it has absolutely no educational value, nor unencyclopedic as some may say, yet it's a keeper because of its popularity. Uncle Bus should be a keeper as it is more than just the popularity - it reveals some current social issues in HK. --Erniebb 18:54, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don’t see any problems with this article on the above 3 main criterias. I also looked at some of the examples listed in “problem articles with alternatives to deletion,” no major problems there either.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The main issues people brought up are:</dd>
<dd>1. Not encyclopedic and not notable. For example, “meaningless, nonsense, ridiculous, no long term impact, etc. etc. etc. Per Wikipedia itself, "the reason, "unencyclopedic" is not an argument at all but just another way of saying should be deleted.”’</dd>
<dd>2. Remove the Chinese/foreign language.</dd>
<dd>3. Delete per nom.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Not encyclopedic, not notable, nonsense, and meaningless</b>. These are all very subjective comments. My guess is that there are far more people who think the article and incident is notable, meaningful, encyclopedic, etc. This incident has stirred debate among almost everybody in Hong Kong. There is not anyone in Hong Kong (adult at least) that does not know something about the incident and have an opinion about this. There also has been "intellectual/intelligent" dicussions about this whole affair. I guess the people who says the incident and article are nonsense are the same people who says that the masses are fools.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Remove the Chinese</b>. It’s great there’s some Chinese translations, phrases. Why? For me, it’s research purposes. I don’t know Chinese well, but having some Chinese here allows me to search further for OTHER, non USA resources (whether it be websites, blogs, news sites, etc.). If everything was in English, it would limit my ability to search for the other 50% of non English sites.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Delete per nom. This argument has no facts to support why article should be deleted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Conclusion.</b> I am not convinced the article should be removed. No clear and convincing argument to remove the entry other than OPINIONS. There are no clear and convincing violations of neutral point of view, verifiability, no original research, copyright issues.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the incident may become insignificant to some and maybe in time, but for now it is not. Yes it may not be encyclopedic for some, but at the same time, we have to ask ourselves is Wikipedia really just an encyclopedia in the traditional Britanica sense? What is “encyclopedic”? My feeling is what makes Wikipedia so powerful is the collaborative efforts AND the ability to obtain any INFORMATION about anything, anywhere, etc. badbatzmaru 20:21, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Let's not forget that the first language of many HK residents is English, so this is their Wikipedia, and this is where they come to get well-researched background on current cultural phenomena. Uncle Bus is clearly a current cultural phenomenon in HK, and our article provides well-researched background. There is no reason to delete; in fact if the article didn't exist it should be created. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 21:02, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> It would be a travesty and a disservice to information seekers everywhere if this article is removed. I believe Wikipedia is an international source of information, not just an American one. Granted, not many Americans care about the Bus Uncle, but this is one of the most talked about news event in Hong Kong this year, one that has even penetrated Western media. --<a href="../../../u/c/l/User%7EUCLARodent_889d.html" title="User:UCLARodent">UCLARodent</a> 22:38, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Wiki has a number of Internet Meme articles. Keep it. Language is not an issue; most people in Hong Kong are bilingual. -- overgrownbat 05:30, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. First, it's no harm. Second, users have the right to know more about this "news". Third, Wikipedia should be always welcoming the true things that happened in the world. Forth, it MAY not be interested by many people does not implies it is worth to be deleted. e.g. Some of the schools or colleges in Hong Kong have their own article in Wiki, but EVEN the students of the school MAY NOT be interested in the article. You can imagine how few people is going to read those articles. However, by using the same logic, is it worth to be deleted? Hong Kong user: Dk4ofjoshuayhyu</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> it got reported in international news. Quite frankly, I'd've probably said "keep it" even if it hadn't, but this counts as notable by anyone's standards. LupusCanis 14:49, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. While I'm rarely persuaded by the arguments of something being a "notable internet meme", this one clearly seems to be—Huge ammounts of media coverage, and great popularity in Chinese internet communities, but it has spread beyond that and became a general cultural phenom, and indeed, an international one. While I wouldn't go so far as to say that it has reached the state of being as influential and notable as <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goatse.html" title="Goatse">Goatse</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base belong to us">All your base belong to us</a>, it is fairly close.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In addition, I think many of those expressing the opinion that this article should be deleted are losing sight of the article itself and instead focusing on the non-logged in users and brand new users, many of whom may indeed only be here to contribute to this discussion, and perhaps they do not express their opinion or argue their position in the best way; this is however irrelevant. Looking at the article, and just the article, I see a notable subject, with several references, and overall a good encyclopedia article. Granted, this is a problem of AFD and indeed, discussions on Wikipedia in general, but I feel its necessary to bring it up here. The closer of this debate should take this into account.

<li><b>comment</b> It seems that she may be notable for writing about other notable authors and books. I understand that is the nature of literary criticism however being a literary critic that adresses famous books and authors does not necessarily make one notable. Appearing on the catholic TV network for interviews, writing for a catholic religous magazine, or appearing at religious conferences doesn't necessarily make someone notable either. I am a published author and speaker on <b>important subjects</b> myself but I'm not notable, just published. I'm not voting delete because I am not qualified to judge. It just seems questionable. Are these books notable??? Widely published and read??? I don't know. Certainly other than the books the other work is definitely not notable.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 21:42, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Search for her on Amazon. Anyone with that many books published (by real publishers, not vanity) makes the grade IMO. Even if they're not best sellers, they're still in print.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm tempted to switch to weak keep, however I'm still not sure that an author who seems to be a puppet for a religion writing a catholic-pop novel with the name of the most popular book on the planet in the title and therefore significant distribution doesn't mean that the author is notable. There are many many non-notable authors out there, she just semms to do a good job of hopping on the latest trend to sell books and push religous ideology. In the larger scheme of things it will be a non-notable book. I understand the notability of anti-davinci code books in general, but a page for each of the authors of such books??--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 22:11, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm sensing an agenda here in the <i>"puppet for a religion"</i> reference, and the assumption that she's "hopping on the latest trend." It's one of the many books debating the claims in the novel. I don't believe her faith automatically labels her as a puppet. The fact is that she was an established writer long before this. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 22:18, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm Catholic. No agenda here. It just seems that there are many more notable books refuting the da vinci code from a catholic perspective and many more notable contributors to special interest periodicals that don't have wikipedia pages and her other books seem to be similar such as the lord of the rings book she wrote back when that was the craze. Etc. The only reason I am uncertain about my vote is that it is possible she is notable as an academic literary critic. I do not know. I am certain her da vinci code book is not notable relative to others and that there are many more notable religous writers both popular religous writers and academic religous writers. Just thinking it through seriously. Maybe I have too high expectations for notablity?--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 22:38, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

I think within the genre, as the definitive analyst of two great authors, she's notable. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 23:14, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Cleaning out church stubs or whatever is an excellent thing, certainly, but people should <i>try</i> and follow the links in the article to see whether notability has been established. Stanley Baldwin was thrice PM in the 30s, for heaven's sake! And a Burne-Jones window would make anywhere notable.

<li><b>Very strong keep</b>. The article gives a nice overview of this old church. That alone would equal obvious keep for me.

<p>i put the exact same list on ":de:Fanny Hensel", and the germans have no complaints. i don't know why some americans are so anal about capitalization. for someone who is as important as fanny hensel, it is very important to get her name right. in her own home country, she is called fanny (mendelssohn) hensel. in the US library of congress subject headings, she is listed under H for hensel. feminist musicologists call her fanny (mendelssohn) hensel. therefore, i don't understand why some people on wikipedia are so insistent on perpetuating old-fashioned nomenclature. 68.40.58.252 23:55, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>oops! i forgot to sign-in... i'm requesting deletion, because i was the one who originally contributed the lists, and i regret making the contributions. i suppose that, if someone really wanted to, they could make the argument that i'm violating renate hellwig-unruh's copyright. in which case, wikipedia will have no choice but to delete the lists immediately. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethchen_6d4e.html" title="User:Bethchen">Beth</a> 00:06, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The list is probably not a copyvio because copyright protects creative expression and no matter how much effort may have gone into compiling and verifiying the list, it's not creative expression.

<dd>It is difficult to understand <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethchen_6d4e.html" title="User:Bethchen">Beth</a>'s protests. The protocol on English/American Wikipedia is that we write with standard spelling and capitalisation conventions. If <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethchen_6d4e.html" title="User:Bethchen">Beth</a> objects so strongly to these conventions, to which all other contributors subscribe,let her not contribute to English Wikipedia. Maybe German Wikipedia has different conventions which suit her better. For 'someone as important as fanny hensel' (or <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanny_Mendelssohn_5a54.html" title="Fanny Mendelssohn">Fanny Mendelssohn</a> as, after, extensive debate, it was decided she should be named in Wikipedia) , it would seem only respectful to give her and her works the encyclopaedic, and grammatic, treatment they deserve. That is, by <b>merging</b> and tidying up the existing pair of lists. --<a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmerus_1e2d.html" title="User:Smerus">Smerus</a> 08:49, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> this is one of the few webcomics that have enough fan support that the artist can live entirely on the comic-related income.

<li><b>Delete</b> useless unnotable fan articles. The only thing that makes it look notable is the loooooong list of main, minor, and less-than-minor characters, not to mention places, items, and other unimportant tiny bits of information. For goodness' sake, it's not even well written - seems it was mostly written only by fans or anons. And, as Dragonfiend says, the only thing that makes this article and/or webcomic look notable is the video game currently being prodced by "members of the Wotch forums."

I think she meets the criteria although we will be on the cutting edge. I think this is the exception to where the other bands say "but we're about to be big." She is about to be big.

<li><font color="#FF0000"><b>Comment</b> WELL IF YOU WOULD ACTUALLY STOP AND LISTEN, as I have stated before, you do not live in Bakersfield. Hence, YOU would not know. If someone were to just "flog Wikipedia down" once the band was created, that would have been done when they were first formed in 2003. However, this article was not created until AFTER they made a name for themselves in their town. Which is a term of notability in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, being the most prominent member of a musical movement in their home town.

None of them merit anything other than one or two lines, unless one is going to copy whole pages from whitehouse's website, which interestingly seem to be written for kindergarten kids. All the information about a pet could also be merged as a single sentence to the corresponding president. For example, in case of the subject of this AfD, a line can be added to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>'s page saying he had this cat, named after this player, while he was in white house. Other than that, a separate article devoted to a presidential pet which is only notable in the context of the presidency, is ridiculous. We don't devote a whole page to the animals not notable by their own right. If the info about the animal is interesting, that's only so in the context of the owner. True, there are animals like Jumbo the elephant, or Coco the chimp which are notable by themselves, but certainly, presidential pets are not so.
