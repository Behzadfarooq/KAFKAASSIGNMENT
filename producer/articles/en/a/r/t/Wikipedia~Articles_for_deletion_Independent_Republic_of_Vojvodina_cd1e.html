<p>The article is entirely hypothetical.

So much about "independence" and "verifiability". <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 21:46, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Nenad ÄŒanak was thinking about this. It can be read in the External Link, but unfortunatly it is in Hungarian. I have writen that no party supports the idea officaly. But there were parties which used to support the independece.</li>

<p>I've found some more links in English, just for you all: <a href="http://www.ce-review.org/01/15/pozun15.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ce-review.org/01/15/pozun15.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/trae/archive/data/200103/10314-009-trae-ath.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/trae/archive/data/200103/10314-009-trae-ath.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.b92.net/intervju/eng/2000/1201.phtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.b92.net/intervju/eng/2000/1201.phtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<dd>What I see in your link is that Vuk DraÅ¡koviÄ‡ (who is an centralist) accused Vojvodinian autonomists that they supoort independence. It is well known that pro-centralist politicians accuse autonomist politicians for separatism simply to derogate their popularity. But did you ever heard any autonomist politician including Nenad ÄŒanak to support independence? I certainly did not heard. The web site of the LSV political party (led by Nenad ÄŒanak) claim that autonomous republic of Vojvodina that they propagate would make Serbia stronger. So, yes, there are people who support "Republic of Vojvodina", but certainly not "Independent Republic of Vojvodina". The only possible way to have this article verified (the verification policy of Wikipedia - remember), is to rename it to "Republic of Vojvodina" and then it will present political program of LSV party about federalized Serbia. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 17:16, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep, if expanded, otherwise merge into Vojvodina</b>. In my opinion, the question is not how much support it has but whether one can write a long enough article about it as a proposed formation with references. Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, of course, but it's not about the future but about a presently existing idea. Just look at the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Category%7ENational_liberation_movements_fd33.html" title="Category:National liberation movements">National liberation movements</a> and the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Category%7ESecessionist_organizations_1d4f.html" title="Category:Secessionist organizations">Secessionist organizations</a> caterories: they contain hundreds of articles. The proposed states may be hypothetical but the ideas are real (and, after all, everything that exists on Earth was created from plans). Beyond doubt, it is a viable topic in Wikipedia as in any other encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">Adam78</a> 17:04, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It have nothing with "liberation movements". It is only dream of few local Hungarian and Croatian irredentists who still dream Greater Hungary and Greater Croatia. These irredentists are not even accepted among their own ethnic communities. JÃ³zsef Kasza for example did not had very good opinion about "64 counties movement", and even they do not support independent Vojvodina openly. And the second problem is that idea is simply not openly or publicly supported by anybody relevant, instead by few local drunkards in the cafe. Should we create a Wikipedia article about every idea of every street drunkard? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 17:12, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Panonian, I'm afraid you're lost on this page. We are voting about a page called "<b>Independent</b> Republic of Vojvodina". How do you think a (proposed) independent state could be related to the Greater Hungary or the Greater Croatia concept? These latter deal with incorporating areas (making them <i>dependent</i>), rather than creating <i>independent</i> states. It would be useful to realize what other people talk about before you voice your opinion... <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">Adam78</a> 21:24, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, the answer is very simple: we can take <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHunTheGoaT_3edf.html" title="User:HunTheGoaT">User:HunTheGoaT</a> as a very good example of this what I speak. Since he created this article, we can assume that he support independent Vojvodina, but does he support it? If you see his user page you will notice that he has "No Trianon" tag there and now tell me how one can be for independent Vojvodina and against the Treaty of Trianon in the same time? It is simply impossible. The Treaty of Trianon was a condition that Vojvodina today exist at all, so if there is no Trianon, then there is no Vojvodina, there is no Croatia, there is no Slovakia, etc, and instead of them, there is only one thing - a Greater Hungary. So, if somebody is against Trianon that means that he is also against Vojvodina (dependent or independent no matter), and if such person tell that he support independent Vojvodina, the only way how it can be explained is that such person want to implement "divide and conquer" policy - to divide Serbs and to make Vojvodina easier target for Hungary than it is now. Just think why Albanians in Montenegro voted for Montenegrin independence...same performance, another actors... <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 02:42, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Independent Vojvodina and against the Treaty of Trianon in the same time is not impossible. I don't wan to restore of the Greater-Hungary! I say that the Treaty is not good. If Vojvodina will an independent state, this will change the borders of Trianon because Vojvodina has been given to Serbia and if it weren't Serbia anymore it meant the fall of the Trianon border.</dd>

<dd>But independent Vojvodina will not change Trianon border. If Vojvodina became independent border with Hungary still will be the same and the Trianon still will be valid. The point of Trianon was that Serbs and other Slavs of Vojvodina (who were majority in Vojvodina) live in their own Slavic state instead under Hungarian rule. The question whether name of this Slavic state is Yugoslavia, Serbia or Vojvodina is simply irrelevant - it is still Slavic state. So, you see, independent Vojvodina would be only a confirmation of the Trianon. And by the way, Vojvodina was not "given" to Serbia by the Trianon - it is Slavic citizens of Vojvodina that voted for it and Trianon recognized their right to self determination. Independent Vojvodina would be only another form of that right (if it is achieved by their own will), and it would retain everything what Trianon was. Regarding Kosovo, Kosovo is lost for Serbia (time will show whether it is bad or good), but that fact means that the relevant political factors in the World will give a compensation to Serbia. And do you know what that compensation is? The compensation is that they will not push Serbia further about its minorities and that Serbia will not lost any part of its current territory - in another words (this is a joke), but if all Serbs in Serbia become canibals and start to kill and eat its ethnic minorities, the World will not care (that is a compensation for Kosovo, my friend, so think about it).&#160;:) <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 13:34, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>And by the way, in the time when the Treaty of Trianon was signed (in 1920), Serbia did not existed as a state, but the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Serbs%2C_Croats_and_Slovenes_fdc0.html" title="Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a>. So, by your own logic, the fact that Vojvodina is not part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes but part of Serbia would mean that Trianon borders are already changed, right? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 14:27, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>We must stop our discussion about it. You know that Serbia is the succesor state of the SHS Kingdom. This is just philosophy. Why do you think that I am a supporter of this separatist idea. I just don't know why is Senta, Ada, Kanjiza and the other settlements with around 80% majority in Serbia. We can't speak Serbian enough good because here the 90% speaks Hungarian nearly perfect. Just those who came from Bosnia and Croatia can't stand Hungarians. I want just a better life for Hungarians. I think that the Trianon Treaty is bad, but to totaly restore the Greater-Hungary is also not good. I think there should be changes in borders in an other way. The propbleme is that neither Hungary neither Serbia don't care about us. But now we should end our talk. Bye!
