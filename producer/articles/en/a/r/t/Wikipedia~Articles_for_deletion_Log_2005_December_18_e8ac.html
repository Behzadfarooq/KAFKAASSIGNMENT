<dd>Russian, and deletable. Has nothing to do with any Nikolay nor Volkov. Content is "after the law about the Jewish autonome district was cancelled in 1993 [that's a real district in Russia], which originally passed in 1981, the district was in a strange situation. No new law had been passed, and of the five autonome districts that existed in the Russian USR, only the Jewish one remained (four had been granted the status of republics within the Russian Federation). All five previous autonomies were a part of bigger federation subjects". <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Autonomous_Oblast_bf4e.html" title="Jewish Autonomous Oblast">Jewish Autonomous Oblast</a> has the relevant and verifiable information. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolver_6882.html" title="User:Solver">Solver</a> 12:50, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>[...] It appears that Nikolay Volkov is in fact, the governor of the said Jewish autonomy (since 1991!). It probably won't be too hard to find the governor's bio, but this piece now surely looks like an anti-governor rant... and perhaps should still be deleted. There's no article about him in the Russian wikipedia too, if that's going to help to make a decision. <b>?</b> - <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntrovert_e3fe.html" title="User:Introvert"><font color="#004161">Introvert</font></a> <a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EIntrovert_66c0.html" title="User talk:Introvert"><font color="#004161"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 05:51, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm with Introvert on not being telling if it's upside down or sideways, but from the transliteration Rich provided I'm pretty sure it's just the name of the said autonomous oblast: Yidisher="Jewish", "avitanama"="autonomous", "gegnt"="<a href="../../../o/b/l/Oblast.html" title="Oblast">oblast</a>".

In addition some of the material on the page is dubious - there are no known Vulcanoids, Mercury Venus and Earth are not jovian type planets.

<li>Notability isn't the issue. The article cites no independent sources, and I cannot find any evidence that anyone has ever acknowledged this system of classification. (Sudarsky, in contrast, not only had at least two co-authors on his paper, but had the paper published in the <i><a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrophysical_Journal_38da.html" title="Astrophysical Journal">Astrophysical Journal</a></i>.) I was going to write "anyone apart from Whatmough", but upon reading <a href="http://www.extrasolar.net/speculations.html" class="external text" title="http://www.extrasolar.net/speculations.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> (which makes no mention of classifying Venus, Mars, and Earth in this way and does not even contain the phrase "sulfur jovian") it appears that <i>not even Whatmough</i> acknowledged the system outlined in this article. As far as I can tell, Whatmough used the Sudarsky system. This is simply not a part of the corpus of human knowledge.

<li>This term is not only neologism invented by the creator of the article, but the article is also wrong (as if the original classification system wasn't already very speculative).

<li>Chess blogs contains 4 external links; only 1 is a blog, 3 are indicated as <i>lists of blog</i>. In the "external links" section, I have cited the one blog, and one of the lists which contains most (if not all) links from the others. I don't think there is a need for a new sub-section; the current sections are split according to topics related to chess (programs, organisation, etc), not by technology used by the website which provides the information.

<li>No matter how many times you say it does not make in any truer than the first time you said it. NN is very much <i>Wikipedia</i> policy. Do not confuse Wikipedia with other Wikis.

<ul>
<li>Whilst I have no desire to get into a slanging match (which will do neither of us or more importantly Wikipedia any good) I do feel strongly that the statement "This page is considered a guideline on Wikipedia. It illustrates standards of conduct, which many editors agree with in principle. However, it is not policy." found on, for example <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiography_93d8.html" title="Wikipedia:Biography">Wikipedia:Biography</a> page says it all. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 21:07, 19 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a guideline on what is covered under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, speficially "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information" and "Wikipedia is not a link repository", and WP:NOT <i>is</i> a policy. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 17:13, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sorry I dont see your point. WP:BIO specifically says that what is on that page is not policy. It cant possiby not be policy on one page and policy on another? If that were so, some serious clearing up would need to be done to remove the ambiguity.<a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 21:13, 19 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>See <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#Articles</a>, which <i>is</i> official policy, under "Unremarkable people".

<li>It is not policy that people who don't meet any of the criteria in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> don't meet notability criteria. It <i>is</i> policy that notability criteria exist. If you say 'I believe that this person is notable even though he doesn't meet WP:BIO', that makes sense if you justify it. If you say 'This person isn't in any way notable but I don't care', then you're ignoring policy. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 09:22, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'd have to say that <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#Articles</a> being official policy, and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> NOT being official policy seems very odd. If according to CSD notability in Bios IS official policy it's ludicrous to then say it's not in BIO. However this is getting way off the mark, as the vote here is about Chess Blogs. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 22:03, 20 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not really. We have the CSDs to avoid cluttering up AfD with articles that have no chance of survival, including blatant vanity articles. We have the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and similar guidelines so that Wikipedians can give exact, precise, quick reasons for why the subject is notable or not by referring to the appropriate guidelines, without having to explain their reasoning over and over again in separate discussions. Two separate reasons, both perfectly valid. The reason one is policy and the other not is because an article that meets a CSD has no merit whatsoever, while an article that doesn't meet WP:BIO etc. may have some other virtue that we overlooked when creating the guidelines. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 22:31, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s>Delete</s> <b>Keep</b> (Changed due to Crypticfirefly's rewrite) (although I'd suggest moving the page to the name of his company, if any, as that's the notable thing, not him personally) Notability doesn't have to be policy - it's a shorthand for - not what should be in an encyclopedia - that's not a subject for policy. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 21:34, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>As far as I can tell, the name of his "company" was his own name-- he apparently operated the buisness as a sole-proprietorship-- there is no "company" name. "Fuso," etc. were just trademarks that he used. I did put a reference to him on the "Fuso" disambig page, which may help. I should add also, that he did most if not all the work personally on the custom frames that he was most famous for. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 08:19, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Dave Moulton has definite credibility with certain bicycle enthusiasts. A 'Google' search confirms this. (Pick out entries related to bicycles.) Richard D 13:39, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Found an interesting article about the guy in the May 8, 1989 issue of <i>San Diego Business Journal,</i> may add more info myself. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 05:33, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, I've rewritten the article. Though I had never heard of the guy before, I can make the following arguments for "notability": (1) in the mid-70's was well-known in professional bike racing. Many photos of British pros of the time can be found with their bikes prominently marked with Moulton's name. If nothing else, people might want to look him up for that association. (2) He was well known enough that people were ordering his bikes from other countries-- namely, the U.S. (3) News articles refer to him as a well-nown "guru" of frame-making or as a master frame-maker. Recent articles about other bike makers mention Moulton's association with their business. (For example, Masi apparently is still commenting on the fact that he worked for them.) Hope this helps. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 07:18, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I meant that the nom has not shown that this is not notable or unverified. I don't have time to google every nom and also don't feel that I can fully trust the nom's judgement. Since we have tons of podcasts/podcasters on the site, how am I supposed to decide which ones stay or go. Therefore, I have to default to keep pending some verification that Ms. Shelley Republican is not notable. I was hoping that editors with some expertise in this area would help guide that choice. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:38, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I share your same concerns, only because some of the other nomations made by Mr. Gustafson earlier today looked a bit hurried.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Yes, I agree. I can't run the risk of throwing away potentially valuable information. In this specific case, how can one judge the notability or popularity of a podcaster? Are there ratings or awards? Wikipedia policy or guidelines?

<li><b>Comment</b> So, are you saying that lacking verification, your vote above is one for a <b>Delete</b>? You're right, Google is rarely a good source when it comes to Websites, [http:/www.alexa.com Alexa] is far superior, but can't be used in this case since the Alexa rank will be for [http:www.blogspot.com Blogspot], Shelly's bloghost.

<li>I thought this woman was supposed to be a <i>popular conservative woman podcaster</i>. Is podcasting the same as blogging? Does Alexa rank podcasts?

<li><b>Delete</b>, well: I'm Turkish, and this is the first time I heard of this site. Its not a forum, obviously some people (probably owners of the site) keep posting articles that will make Turkish <i>right</i>-wing angry (no npov intended, this is what it is). Not to mention description also says "we are totally npov", obviously takes side. Not a famous site (its not hosted on its own server, first of all), not a fair discussion over the Turkish democracy (not a discussion as well, more like some sides gathered together to promote their ideas), doesn't have 5000 users, not a subject to media attention, technically cannot be rated on Alexa. I'd sum up that it does not qualify as a Wikipedia entry, furthermore the article is exaggrating and misleading.

<li><b>Delete</b>, a website whose only claim to notability is that it runs a popular and well-known piece of wiki software. The wiki for a freakin' MU* that I play on has more than 68 articles, for God's sake! And yes, it runs MediaWiki. And no, I will not write an article on it because I'm <i>sane</i>. If 'runs popular software' is a criteria for notability now, should we vote to keep all websites that use HTML? <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 13:34, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Here's a more exact translation: <i>Kaffaria is a modification of Kaffka's [sic] art in writing. In this kind of writing, four pens are needed, one between each finger [sic]. Then one must learn to write another letter with each pen. When one has done this, one is able to write entire stories in much shorter [less] time. Even Homerie Hugold(1312-1363) already used to have such a way of writing, though only with three pens. [The] Kaffaria subsequently perfected the writing art.</i></dd>

<dd>Surely this is a spoof? Kaffaria is a geographical designation in South-Africa, but there is no connexion with the author Kaf<b>k</b>a (single f). Homerie, as far as I am aware, does not occur, but has overtones of Homer. Writing with a number of pens at the same time, surely, is a game only practised by children?

<li><b>Keep for Academia</b> I am currently using this article in my paper for Sociolingustics in my discussion on Language of the Internet, and that alone I feel suffices for reasons to keep this article. It contains information pertainate to my research. Nearly all article are prone to vandalism and that is not sufficient grounds on which to remove an article. As for those who claim it as unencyclopedic, I ask that you please give me your definition of encyclopedic. If you mean something that would someday appear in a professionally published encyclopedia, then I'm afraid I disagree with you on the premise of Wikipedia. The nature of internet hypertext over print is that it allows for a much larger base of information, so while this information would not be pertainate enough to justify listing in a printed medium, it contains relevant information that seekers of knowledge would care to know. As for the person who claimed that there is no such thing as internet culture, I beg to differ. Even among professional circles it is recognized that there is such a thing as internet culture. I may not be a lingustics major, and I'm taking this class for fun, but I do know enough to claim that the internet does have a culture, and that the language used within the internet does have a history. Slang has literary significance just like any other language feature, and that of the internet is no exception. If you're really desparate for proof that I really am using this for my paper, look up Professor S. Dart at Macalester College a few weeks from now after I turn in my paper and ask if I discussed O RLY. --D. Ly 23:35 Dec 18 2005 (CST) <small>This user's third edit.</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Wikipedia is genius because it providers a pretty reliable place where everyone can share knowledge or use it. Most of it is kept in real time and even if you have the littlest knowledge which may seem ridicolous and would never be ever needed, you can contribute.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Where would people go to find out what these kind of, admittedly obscure, pop-culture references actually mean, if not WikiPedia? It is notable, and unlike other sources, the information listed; i.e. origin, meaning, history/evolution is encyclopedic. It may be a insignificant fad, but if it had no listing, how would you know?</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with <a href="../../../m/i/z/User%7EMizake_c9f1.html" title="User:Mizake">Mizake</a>, this is a wonderful article on an obscure subject.

<li>Whose spamming? I have a point of view. That point of view is that notability is not official policy, which is why I vote to keep things that are said to be non notable. I'm supposed to vote "Keep" without stating why? The reason happens to be the same, as I seek out so called non notable articles up for deletion. By the way, I cant see anything at <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> that says anything about notability. However at <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiography_93d8.html" title="Wikipedia:Biography">Wikipedia:Biography</a> it states quiet clearly that notability is a guideline not official policy.<a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 17:43, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I know it is not an official policy, but let me ask you something. Do you think that verifiability is the only acceptable standard for inclusion in Wikipedia? What if I want to write an article on my PC, or on my left toe, or on that day I went to the zoo when I was 8? Articles on these topics could be verifiable, but would they belong here? <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a><sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 18:39, 19 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, as there are accepted ways of verifying something, for example does it have X number of hits on Google. Therefor, whilst <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Maiden_6b08.html" title="Iron Maiden">Iron Maiden</a> would have multiple hits, Freddie and the Flintstones, who have had one practice session in Freddie's dad's garage would have no hits. Or maybe one if they had the nouse to write a website, but that would not count as verification. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 21:45, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Rationale: Striver is unlikely to improve this article, since he has an imperfect command of English. He writes stubs, not complete articles, and has said that it is up to others to fix his work. He also creates incomplete lists, or copies and pastes from online sources. This article was clearly created by cutting and pasting from online hadith collections. It completely lacks any narration that would clarify the issue for confused readers. Yet it IS a notable issue in Islamic history and even in current events, since it concerns the Quranic justification -- or lack thereof -- for the stoning of those convicted of adultery. If it were retitled to something like Islam and stoning (I'm not set on this title, there are probably better ones) and given another 30 KB of exposition, it could be a useful article. As it is, it is both unfindable and useless in its present form. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:20, 19 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think it is fair enough to have an article on a text in its own right. Maybe there should be a close relation with a more detailed article on punishment in Islam. <a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 00:32, 19 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A text? This is not A TEXT, this is several hadith, or collected oral traditions, from collections with thousands of them. More than 17,000 in Bukhari and Muslim alone. Striver pulled out hadith relating to one particular issue. It's the issue that's in play here, not the hadith. Tafsir (commentary) and sira (history) are relevant too, not just hadith. This is a job for ... Islamic-studies-scholar-man! I wish he would jump out of the phonebooth right now. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:10, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Poorly written article with little substantiation and few (no) references. More importantly, the very term is ambigious and resistant to definition as different institutions use it to refer to graduate students with limited responsibility or professionals with Masters degrees and signficant responsibility. I think this is (or should be) covered adequately in the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Residence_Life_3b9c.html" title="Residence Life">Residence Life</a> entry. <a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 05:13, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm going to try to spruce up the article a bit, but it is an important topic that needs to have an article here and not just be absorbed into the residence life article. We'll need to get rid of the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resident_Assistant_5844.html" title="Resident Assistant">Resident Assistant</a> article too if ElKevbo's argument is valid . Being poorly written is not justification enough for deletion. I don't see at all how the term is at all ambigious, and all that is needed is a bit of rewording (which I think I'll go work on). --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottyBoy900Q_4200.html" title="User:ScottyBoy900Q">ScottyBoy900Q</a> 02:34, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I know I'm going to get a lot of flack for this one, but so be it. This article, while about a person who achieved a certain notoriety through the media, still does not belong on Wikipedia, if for no other reason than <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia Is Not A Propaganda Machine</a>. This article reads like a press release from the defense team. It's horribly POV, from the text to the accompanying pictures, and while POV is not a reason to delete an article, I think from a policy standpoint this is not something that should be a part of Wikipedia. Most reputable news outlets do NOT release the names of alleged rape victims, and that self-imposed ban would extend to most if not all print encyclopedias as well. To acheive an air of legitimacy, Wikipedia should follow suit, and not simply say that because one or two unethical media outlets release information about a rape victim that it's just "OK" for Wikipedia to have an article about it. <b>Delete.</b> <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufflaw_0eb1.html" title="User:Tufflaw">Tufflaw</a> 06:34, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Notable accuser of celebrity who filed a court case under her own name against <a href="../../../k/o/b/Kobe_Bryant_69d8.html" title="Kobe Bryant">Kobe Bryant</a>. She involuntarily became a public figure, but after voluntarily filing a lawsuit, what little claim she can make to "privacy" goes out the window. She chose to sue a basketball star for rape, that makes her notable. If there's POV, clean it up. I will note that many "reputable news outlets" released her name - including the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a>, after she filed a public-record civil complaint against Bryant. You cease to have a claim to anonymity when you sue someone. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 07:25, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see how the fact her name became public after she filed a civil claim makes her life story encyclopedic, including information such as her various jobs or places of residence. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufflaw_0eb1.html" title="User:Tufflaw">Tufflaw</a> 07:49, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This person had intimate contact with a basketball star, accused him of rape, didn't testify in the case so the charges were dropped, sued that star and then settled out of court. It is ludicrous to argue that somehow that isn't notable. "Kobe Bryant" rape gets 980,000 Googles. "Katelyn Faber," in the neighborhood of 10,000. I see a lot of sourcing in the article to mainstream media coverage of this person. I think it's actually a quite good article which encyclopedically discusses the very issue you bring up - the ethics of reporting her name. Fact is, her name is now out there, it's widely-reported public record and it's certainly encyclopedic. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 08:11, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It should also be noted that Googling her name actually brings up only 311 unique hits, and a bunch of those have nothing to do with her. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufflaw_0eb1.html" title="User:Tufflaw">Tufflaw</a> 23:01, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm not saying it's not notable, just not encyclopedic. Notability is not an automatic inclusion factor, to my knowledge. There is also a degree of journalistic ethics that should be considered as well. At the very most, if her name should be mentioned at all, it should be in the article about the incident itself, or the main Kobe Bryant article. To create a separate article just for her and to describe the incident in such graphic detail comes across as an attack on her, and reads like propaganda. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufflaw_0eb1.html" title="User:Tufflaw">Tufflaw</a> 18:31, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think it's moralistic to claim that a person who claimed she was raped by a basketball star is entitled to any special treatment. Her acts were clearly encyclopedic - this isn't some woman who claimed to be raped by Joe Blow, she said she was raped by one of the biggest sports figures of the era. If you feel the article is biased, fix it so it's not biased. I am a journalist, and there's clearly *no* issue of journalistic ethics here. She voluntarily became a public figure. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 21:03, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Are you seriously claiming that anyone who is raped by a celebrity is voluntarily becoming a public figure by reporting that to the police? <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufflaw_0eb1.html" title="User:Tufflaw">Tufflaw</a> 22:53, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>She voluntarily filed a civil lawsuit, a fact that was widely reported in mainstream media. You're also showing your bias by saying that she was "raped by a celebrity" when that celebrity was never found guilty of any crime. She was *allegedly* raped. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 23:11, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't call her a rape victim, I asked you whether *anyone* who is raped (or even allegedly raped) by a celebrity automatically surrenders their privacy merely by the notoriety of the person who raped (or allegedly raped) them? <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufflaw_0eb1.html" title="User:Tufflaw">Tufflaw</a> 23:25, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Irrelevant. Faber voluntarily surrendered her privacy by filing a civil lawsuit. And yes, there ARE involuntary public figures. It's too bad we don't have an article on the legal concept of a public figure, but if someone is involuntarily thrust into the public eye, courts have ruled they may be a public figure whether they like it or not. [User:FCYTravis|FCYTravis]] 23:28, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Without commenting on the Hobson's Choice you're saying that a rape victim must face if they try to decide whether to file a civil suit aganist a celebrity, the mere fact of her filing a civil suit doesn't mean that this article is or should be encyclopedic. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufflaw_0eb1.html" title="User:Tufflaw">Tufflaw</a> 23:31, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fact that that civil suit was against a basketball star, and the suit alleged said star raped her, is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 23:35, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that the facts of the entire incident are encyclopedic, both the allegations and the subsequent media frenzy. An article just about HER is not. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufflaw_0eb1.html" title="User:Tufflaw">Tufflaw</a> 23:39, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. Very notable subject. Everything you're listing above is reasons to edit, not delete. I don't believe that her name should still be protected, since legally she is no longer considered a rape victim; however even at that the article should be moved to "Kobe Bryant Accuser" or something, not deleted outright. And all the alleged POV problems (I havn't read through the entire article) can likewise be fixed. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyboy_Will_540f.html" title="User:Flyboy Will">Flyboy Will</a> 07:17, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just because the charges were eventually dropped doesn't mean a person is not a rape victim. There was no claim that the charges were dropped because of any sort of hoax or perjury by the accuser, but because she didn't want to go on with the intense media scrutiny of her personal life. There's no legitimate need for the kind of information in this article to be available, which effectively victimizes her again. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufflaw_0eb1.html" title="User:Tufflaw">Tufflaw</a> 18:31, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What sort of twisted logic is that? I understand you have a POV on this, being an ADA, but we can't call her a rape victim because it was never factually established in a court of law that she was raped. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 21:07, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wouldn't call it twisted logic at all, and while I'm an ADA, I work very hard to keep my personal POV out of Wikipedia. If someone is raped, they are a victim of rape, whether their accuser is ever caught, or if caught is punished. If someone is murdered, for example, would you say they aren't a murder victim if their killer is never caught or convicted? Now, I don't know if this woman was raped or not, because I wasn't there. However, she shouldn't be punished or exposed to public scrutiny because she was allegedly raped by a celebrity instead of a non-celebrity. To say that by accusing a public figure of attacking her means that she is "voluntarily" becoming a public figure - well, THAT is twistic logic. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufflaw_0eb1.html" title="User:Tufflaw">Tufflaw</a> 22:52, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A murder victim is not necessarily a murder victim until a coroner's jury makes a finding, or someone is convicted of the murder. It would be appropriate to say they were a victim of homicide. In this case, nobody was convicted of the alleged rape so we must call her an "alleged rape victim." Saying she was a "rape victim" is implying someone was guilty of a crime, when in this case we have no such finding of guilt. She voluntarily filed a lawsuit, which makes her a public figure by any standards. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 23:11, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's semantics. If I rob a bank and am never caught, am I not a bank robber? I may not be convicted of robbery but that doesn't change the fact that intrinsically I am still a robber. Same thing, if I rape someone, does the fact of my never being caught mean that I'm not a rapist? Are you saying that any woman claiming to have been raped is not a "rape victim" until their attacker is actually caught and convicted?? <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufflaw_0eb1.html" title="User:Tufflaw">Tufflaw</a> 23:25, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not semantics, it's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">a neutral point of view</a>. We cannot call Ms. Faber a rape victim because the person she accused of raping her was not convicted of any crime. Hence, alleged rape victim. Wikipedia cannot make judgements that have not been made by a court of law. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 23:35, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Leaving aside the semantics, are you saying that if a person is "allegedly" raped by a celebrity, that it's OK to create an encyclopedia article about them unless/until their accuser is convicted? <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufflaw_0eb1.html" title="User:Tufflaw">Tufflaw</a> 23:39, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Have you not read newspaper articles on lawsuit settlements? The entire point of settling a lawsuit out of court is so the defendant can "pay off" the accuser without having to admit in a court of law that they actually did anything wrong. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 01:04, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

One thing though: It would likely be "danga dog" rather than "Danger". What I mean is that it wouldn't be pronounced <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danger.html" title="Danger">Danger</a>. It'd be pronounced "danga" as in <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banger.html" title="Banger">banger</a>, which is the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a>/<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian.html" title="Australian">Australian</a> slang term for <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sausage.html" title="Sausage">sausage</a>. This is likely the problem. Logically, it makes sense that "danga" would be a slang term for hot dog, as it would be based on "banger" for sausage. Hot dogs are basically a type of sausage, so it all adds up nicely. "Danger dog" as in "dangerous", though, is hard to believe.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Having met the band personally, I can say that they are a nice bunch of lads who take their music seriously and produce some quality material.I was directed to Dirty Alice two years ago by a friend when I was looking to produce and release an album of my own - a compilation of christian rock songs - and they were so accommodating that we actually decided to pool our finances, ideas and musical talent to produce the album together. The album even managed to sell 14,700 copies in its first year of release! Its production was the best four months of my life. I've never learnt so much from a band before and we have been in regular contact since.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think that the whole 'self-releasing music on the Internet by the droves doesn't count' argument is quite frankly pathetic. Having seen the meteoric rise of the Artic Monkeys by creating a fanbase utilising the internet and music downloads, it seems stupid to dismiss the releasing of music via the internet. These Dirty Alice guys seem to have a pretty professional website so I reckon they may well be going places and this seems to be backed up by the fact that they played New York in 2004. Though it doesn't say where they played, for a band based in England to go all the way to New York to play a gig suggests that they are already getting recognition in the music world. The very fact that these guys seem to have dedicated a large amount of their time to produce a significant number of albums means they must have an already large and enthusiastic fanbase, so I'd just wait and see where this band is headed before you hastily delete the definition. Plus I think of Wikipedia as keeping me informed about popular culture - and this is most definitely popular culture. P.S The guy who says he can't use the internet without google is a moron. If he can't spell definitely then nobody should have to listen to his inane, ill-considered opinion!<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.93.21.72.html" title="User:195.93.21.72">195.93.21.72</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/5/User_talk%7E195.93.21.72.html" title="User talk:195.93.21.72">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_195.93.21.72_3d3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/195.93.21.72">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b>, self-releasing music doesn't cost a band anything, and doesn't require anyone else to have heard or liked the music. I could record a song on a mic in 2 minutes, put it on the internet and claim i'm a recording artist. That would not make me notable. If the band gets some mainstream media attention (like <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arctic_Monkeys_191b.html" title="Arctic Monkeys">Arctic Monkeys</a> which you mentioned), you can try again with the article. See <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for what's generally considered notable enough. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 12:06, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Patent Nonsense / Hoax? I found this page from a request to create an article for <a href="../../../m/e/h/Meh_%28goddess%29.html" title="Meh (goddess)">Meh (goddess)</a>. Neither Meh nor Herrut appear anywhere in my extensive library on ancient Egypt, most notably in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0500051208/qid=1134894028/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-5343135-8911056?n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0500051208/qid=1134894028/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-5343135-8911056?n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. Google search brings up a few Christinanity-related pages, all listing "Herrut" as the basis for claiming Jesus was based on Osiris, and Herrut being the biblycal Herod. In conjunction with obsolete and incorrect names of Egyptian deities linked to it, this leads me to believe that Herrut is part of some hoax from the 70s or before. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyboy_Will_540f.html" title="User:Flyboy Will">Flyboy Will</a> 08:27, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just to add, those Herrut-Herod web sources claim Herrut is derived from "heru" which is supposedly egyptian for "to terrify". That is complete nonsense - "heru" is either the God <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horus.html" title="Horus">Horus</a>, or kheru which is 'voice', or possibly heroo which is 'day'. 'To terrify' would be something like "sebeha".

Considering that the Christian references to Herrut seem widespread (though there is no evidence that Herrut was an Egyptian god), <s>I vote to <b>keep</b> the article</s>, on the condition that it be rewritten and recategorized to discuss the contemporary Herod-Herrut connection rather than claiming Herrut was an Egyptian god. <a href="../../../a/d/u/User%7EAdunar_5cd8.html" title="User:Adunar">Adunar</a> 05:40, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. That essay by Massey is described by himself as original research.

<li><b>Keep</b> This issue is about what Wikipedia is. Mr. Rubb is, and for better or worse will always be, a pop culture reference. People who want information on these kinds of things will always prefer a thoughtful, sorted, centralized space to self-sorting through Google searches. However, without a huge breadth of articles such as this, Wikipedia is just a an open-text version of any other encyclopedia. As such, it is vulnerable to criticism that it (a) is open to tampering, and (b) lacks the professionalism of other encyclopedic sources. Articles such as this, however, give Wikipedia its own space among large pools of organized information, and thereby give Wikipedia a utility that it will otherwise, in time, come to lack.</li>

<p>I would have appreciated being notified of this event, since it is an acronym commonly used in skeptic circles, and not synonymous with the usual meaning of the word "scam". It was the result of long discussions and deliberations, and was carefully formulated to avoid falsely accusing people involved in unscientific practices, who weren't deliberately involved in real, illegal scams.</p>
<p>It isn't a typical definition of a word, but an explanation of an acronym. Right now Wikipedia has a hole in its knowledge base, because this bit of knowledge has been censored.</p>
<p>Mailer Diablo (below) mentions a "debate", but I haven't really seen one, rather I saw the old timers making a decision, but without explaining to me what is appropriate and inappropriate here.</p>
<p><b>I'd still like to understand this matter</b>, so as not to repeat it in the future.</p>
<p>Fortunately the acronym is listed at SkepticWiki, where it is explained more thoroughly: <a href="http://www.skepticwiki.org/wiki/index.php/SCAM" class="external text" title="http://www.skepticwiki.org/wiki/index.php/SCAM" rel="nofollow">sCAM</a> -- signed!! <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 21:01, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> up the spazza. Up the duff is common in quite a large number of countries, and has been around since at least 1941 (according to the <i>Oxford Dictionary of Modern Slang</i>), so its hardly a neologism. It's also the title of a (probably NN) play by Sarah MacDougall, so I'd recommend keeping that as a redirect as per Cap. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 05:54, 19 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The issue isn't whether it's a neologism, but whether an encyclopedia quality article can be created about it. I submit that there is very little more that can be reasonably said about Up the duff that is not already said in the article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The title is not POV, this is what the Inquisition historical revisionists are generallly calling this line of research (see the biblio section of the article for supporting evidence). BTW this is a legitimate line of research recognized by mainstream historians, it is not the same as, say, the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_deniers.html" title="Historical deniers">historical deniers</a>. --<a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 20:10, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, or Merge if possible. We don't need an article entitled 'The Inquisition Myth'. For NPOV purposes, the author, Gth0824 needs to add these points and data to the <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition.html" title="Inquisition">Inquisition</a> articles, where they could be useful but balanced. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadman2001_6cf1.html" title="User:Madman2001">Madman</a> 15:05, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Merge sources <i>cannot</i> be deleted. If its current title is unpalatable, then move it to a better one (or perhaps a subpage of the <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition.html" title="Inquisition">Inquisition</a> talkpage). By deleting the source article we're hiding the information on who contributed what from non-admins, which is Quite Probably a violation of the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. So, if we delete, we delete, and if we merge, we keep (tho' a move or whatever is possible).

<li>Actually, just to clarify for the record, and to avoid confusion, it <i>is</i> possible to merge page histories together so that the source article can be deleted while retaining the history from the source article in the target article.

<li>Good point about the article history. How about move it to a better name (and delete the no-history redirect, to remove the POV name), then NPOV the content, then possibly merge from the clean content leaving the redirect in place to hold the article history.... <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmason888_4d94.html" title="User:Jmason888">Jamie</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmason888_2146.html" title="User talk:Jmason888">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jmason888_945a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jmason888">contribs</a>)</sup> 15:45, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There is considerable recent scholarship about the controversies and debate surrounding what actually happened in the inquisition, more than enough to justify a Wikipedia historiography article about it. It would also help solve a lot of POV battles if we can simply "main article" all that cruft out to a single place because its becoming a real problem lately, almost all the edits lately have been edit-wars over this topic, it really needs to be expanded upon in its own article. --<a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 19:49, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nobody is arguing with the content - the title itself is what people have a problem with. "Inquisition Myth" is extreme POV. Controversy, Theory, something like that could be fine if a separate article absolutely must be created - however <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition.html" title="Inquisition">Inquisition</a> itself is short, and I see no reason why this can't just be moved there. If there is opposition, try to reach consensus via the usual channels. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyboy_Will_540f.html" title="User:Flyboy Will">Flyboy Will</a> 20:07, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A VfD for rename an article interesting.. the problem with putting it in Inquisition is it gives undo balance to controversial subjects. Also, there is more than one <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition.html" title="Inquisition">Inquisition</a> article, there are as many articles as there were inqusitions. It would be better if each article could simply "main article" to a central place that covers all the controversies, rather than repeating it over and over in each article. --<a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 20:17, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> if we were talking about holocaust denial nobody would be saying 'lets merge with the main article'.

<ul>
<li>This article does not attempt to deny the existance of the Inquisitions in the slightest. In fact, it presents an outline of all three waves of Inquisitions and identifies their victims. It is never suggested anywhere in the text that inquisitions did not take place.
<ul>
<li>Au contraire. The article presents every claim that minimizes the crimes as fact. Innocent III is absolved of all responsibility - as if he thought equating heresy with treason as anything less than a death sentence. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 14:54, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have not looked at it in detail, but with the ones I saw, I agree with the reversion of your edits. Including the vandalism you made blanking nearly the entire article!

<ul>
<li>If the 'editor' will not allow any POV other than their own on the article then removal of the offensive parts is the best approach. The editor refueses to engage in any discussion and it is entirely a personal POV piece that only seems to be supported by yourself and the editor. And yes I do suspect that you are the sock puppeter. --<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgonzilla_0cd8.html" title="User:Gorgonzilla">Gorgonzilla</a> 18:27, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The title of the article needs to be changed, but otherwise the content is supported and cited according to the rules of Wikipedia. As for sock puppets, Gth0824 is not me.

<p><b>It is likely that this will be moved to '<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Hadith_cd90.html" title="List of Hadith">List of Hadith</a>' if kept. Please take this into account when voting.</b></p>
<p>The title of this article is problematic, its scope is potentially enormous, and there is no NPOV criterion for choosing which "reports", or <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">Hadith</a>, are notable.</p>
<p>The title is problematic because "Muslim reports" is a very poor translation of "hadith". Hadith, or formally collected oral tradition, is an accepted, widely used term in Islamic studies. The user who created this article seems to prefer NOT to use Arabic terms of art in discussing Islam-related articles. Anyone searching for articles about hadith would not find this one.</p>
<p>But there are bigger problems than the title. There are many thousands of hadith. Bukhari and Muslim, the first two books of the Sunni canon, contain over 17,000 hadiths. There are four other Sunni books, as well as Shi'a collections. Is this article going to contain them all? The creator of the article says that only "notable" hadiths should be included, but he offers no criterion for notability. All the hadiths he has selected so far have to do with the long tradition of Sunni-Shi'a polemics, and prominently feature hadith used by the Shi'a in attempts to prove that the Shi'a are right and the Sunni are wrong. (The editor is a Shi'a.) However, hadith cover hundreds of other topics as well. If we included the most cited hadith for each of these topics (such as salat, zakat, hijab, inheritance, etc.) we would have an article as long as a book.</p>
<p>I asked the creator to consider picking another title and narrowing the scope of the article. An article on Hadith from the Sunni canon frequently cited by the Shi'a would be manageable and perhaps even useful, since the Shi'a editors keep listing the same hadiths, over and over, in various Islam-related articles. However, the creator -- with whom I have not been getting along -- refuses.</p>
<p>If someone else could persuade him to change the title and narrow the scope of the article, we could drop this whole AfD. Can anyone do so? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 05:15, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Zora said that i have only included narrations that are relevant to Shi'a Sunni discutions. Well, that makes them notable, doesnt it? Wikipedia is not a paper encylopedia, we dont delet lists only since they could be big. In fact, just the fact that it could become big makes it notable. IF it gets to big, will create breakout articles. Regarding notablility and NPOV, its the usual WP rules.</p>
<p>I did not choose "Hadith", since it would exluded non-"hadith" material, for example "Sira", letters and sermons. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 05:31, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> and delete most of the individual hadith entries. This is completely unmanageable. There is no systematic way to choose what should be on this list given. There is no systematic naming or scholarly precedent that is being followed for this. I understand the inclusionist impulse. I really do. However, it cannot be used for this article. Renaming to "List of notable hadith" is not enough. How do we set notability in an academic matter? Are Shia hadith inherently less notable because there are fewer Shia? How is the naming of the individual hadith done? At last resort I'd deport the various hadith to wikisource if their translations are in the public domain. An article like this removes any academic credibility from wikipedia. It exemplifies our bias problems and violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> in so many ways. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 03:49, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Gren, you know that many of this hadith are very prominently used in many articel around in Wikipedia. In this articles we can elaborate on their credibility, how they are sourced, whar different scholars have said about it and so on... We can drop "notable" and move it to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Hadith_cd90.html" title="List of Hadith">List of Hadith</a>. I mean, we have a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools.html" title="List of schools">List of schools</a>, and given that i do not understand how we can not have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Hadith_cd90.html" title="List of Hadith">List of Hadith</a>. Notability is judged on a case-by case scenario, its like sayin "its hard to decide if a school is notable, so lets delet <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools.html" title="List of schools">list of schools</a>". that does not make sense. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 04:52, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, as there exist no standard to what can and cannot be included in this list. Furthermore, it can be argued that every hadith is notable. Choosing selective hadith and adding them to this list will only create a biased point of view. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 05:32, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Let's start thinking about overcoming systemic bias here. If the "notable" in the proposed title irritates, move it to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_hadith.html" title="List of hadith">List of hadith</a> then. This is a commendable attempt to create a directory of articles and links to important Muslim texts, categorizing them by the authority cited and by which branches of Islam accept them. The info actually here is verifiable and NPOV, and doesn't present particular problems as to what to include. I doubt we will ever have to face this issue, but if (God willing) we end up with articles on each reported hadith, so be it. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 05:43, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Smerdis, there's no systemic bias in removing a junk article. I'm one of the editors working on Islam-related articles (which I suppose is overcoming systemic bias) and we have a lot of work to do ASIDE from dealing with thousands of hadith. Hadith aren't "texts", BTW -- they're often quite short -- sentences or paragraphs. Do you really believe that we should include 17,000+ hadiths in Wikipedia? That's a reductio ad absurdam. If someone wants to put all of Bukhari or Muslim into Wikisource (if they're not already there), fine. Do dip into some hadith collections (<a href="http://members.cox.net/arshad/hadithcol.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://members.cox.net/arshad/hadithcol.html" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>, <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>) before you insist that it would be just fine, really, to have articles for every single one of them. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 11:19, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

I would like to remind people:</p>
<p>If we have this <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Matthew_1%7Everses_63ed.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Matthew 1:verses">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Matthew 1:verses</a>, then there is no reason to not have a list of hadith. Nobody is going to bother to include random non-notable hadith. If you belive a hadith is biased or non-notable, vote down the hadith, not the list. This vote is not about weather WP shoudl have articles on hadith, only about linking to the existing hadith from a list. Nothing more. You dont like the hadith in the list? Add some of your own. You dont like a specific hadith? Improve that hadith, or afd it, not this list --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 13:21, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't feel the need to vote, but I will say that the hadith are so voluminous and so important that I would think they deserve their own wiki, and they can't really be done justice within WP. I would suggest to the authors that they consider developing a hadithwiki and then linking it where appropriate in WP. As with Bible verses, I think only the most important and best-known really deserve their own articles on the main WP. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 17:09, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, bro nobody is going to bother to copy random hadith here, it takes effort. Remeber that every single entry needs to be encyplopedi notable, otherwise it will be deleted. That ensures the notability of the entire list.

<li>Bah! How come we only see you in this vfd and not in one about any other list? If its about not liking lists in general, you go and try to change the WP policy about lists, not vote down individual lists. You dont like this specific list, since it at the monent containst Shi'a hadith, you said it in your nomination at the top! At least be honest about that.

<li>Sheesh! I said that I thought that the article ought to be renamed, to something like Hadith from the Sunni canon frequently quoted by Shi'a and that it should contain only Shi'a-preferred hadith. In fact, I think it should BE the hadith, not just a list of hadith. I don't quite get how wanting Shi'a-preferrred hadith re the <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">Succession to Muhammad</a> (which seem to be the ones you're citing) in an article constitutes prejudice against the Shi'a.

<li>I mean, I'm not sure how you would define notable. Since March of last year, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Times, the Nation Magazine, Mother Jones, Current Magazine, the San Francisco Chronicle, and many other press outlets have found it worth enough to note. The Roosevelt Review is the country's only student-published public policy journal of a national scope, and the organization is active at over 120 college campuses in the United States, and a handful in Europe. Can you elaborate on your reasons, beyond Kstinch's links, for declaring the organization non-notable? Andrew 05:32, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Kstinch here -- the reason I'm the main person listed in the history is because there were two articles, "Roosevelt Institution" and "Roosevelt institution" -- different capitalization. The one with incorrect capitalization had most of the editing history. If someone objects to the links, I don't mind people taking them down, my understanding of how this works is that a newbie does something they think will be useful with the understanding that someone else might decide it's not useful -- but I don't see the links as a basis for deleting the article...</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22roosevelt+institution%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22roosevelt+institution%22" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> says 43,000 pages refer to the Roosevelt Institution (though I think this is an overestimate). Alexa <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=rooseveltinstitution.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=rooseveltinstitution.org" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> says Roosevelt is (barely) among the top million most visited sites on the net, while others listed in the List of economics consultancies and think tanks (which represent a decent consensus about what is well-known) are similar or worse (for example <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timbro.html" title="Timbro">Timbro</a> and the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Politics_Network_e8a7.html" title="New Politics Network">New Politics Network</a> rank something past four million, <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_Round_Table_9af6.html" title="Business Round Table">Business_Round_Table</a> is at 1.7 million, <a href="../../../f/a/b/Fabian_Society_8979.html" title="Fabian Society">Fabian Society</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_%28think_tank%29.html" title="Reform (think tank)">Reform (think tank)</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_Policy_Centre_b8ee.html" title="Foreign Policy Centre">Foreign Policy Centre</a> are at just over a million. I wouldn't describe the Roosevelt Institution as one of the most prominent American think tanks but it does seem to get media attention (as Andrew argued) and seems to be something people on the net look for and find useful.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Another comment -- the fact that four different users at different times have created the article suggests that there's a need for it. If someone wants to edit the article, sure...</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Disclaimer: I do play a major role in the organization. I thought it was useful for me to correct some inaccuracies in the previously-existing article (among which, I was listed as the founder), to improve Wikipedia. And then while I was at it I listed it on the Think Tanks page, etc. Once it was listed for deletion I read over the policies and I it seems like there's a lot of debate about an organization's members to edit the page -- the consensus seemed to be that if it's an encyclopedic subject and written fairly it's OK, but if you're writing about yourself it does cast suspicion that it's a vanity article. Anyhow, if it's the consensus policy that I shouldn't have improved the original article because of a conflict of interest or something I'd be glad for someone to let me know and I'll refrain from editing the page in the future.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - the article has been one sentece for four months. There is already an extensive article on the <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a> that mentions three reports published by the Srebrenica commission, the Nederlands Instituut voor Oorlogsdocumentatie, and the Serbian government. I think this article is about the report by the first group mentioned in <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html#A_Plan_to_Execute_the_Bosniak_of_Srebrenica" title="Srebrenica massacre">this section</a>. In any case, the article in question adds no info to the larger article, and only serves the purpose of vaguely casting doubt on the independence &amp; objectivity of the group. It was previously tagged NPOV, but the tag was removed by the author. <i><b>×</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 17:37, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is about BBN, a private high school in Cambridge, MA, and its MONTHLY newspaper; this cannot possibly be worthy of an article. After all, it is a high school paper that is published eight times per year. The seems much more like student vanity than actual information for the public good.</p>

The Vanguard has been an institution since 1974 and the recipient of numerous honors from the Columbia Scholastic Association. Certainly this page is not of mass appeal, but that is the case for most encyclopedia entries. This page is very useful for a segment of users to get background on an honored and historic newspaper.</p>

<p>This article is very poorly written, flaunts the NPOV standard, and carries an overall tone of promotional material. That, combined with the fact that it is about such a minor character make it a prime candidate for deletion. Thoughts?</p>

<p>Reason why the page should be deleted- This page has no relevant information, only a link pointing to a website. The page should be expanded or deleted.

<li>Much as I liked your nomination (clearly explained your reasons, refrained from voting, etc.), I have to disagree with your "no hope that this page will ever be expanded". An expanded version of the page already exists, at <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Mujahedin_of_Iran_f285.html" title="People's Mujahedin of Iran">People's Mujahedin of Iran</a>. I found it by checking if <a href="../../../p/m/o/PMOI_bf9a.html" title="PMOI">PMOI</a> existed (to see if there were other things that PMOI could stand for). I see no reason why P.M.O.I shouldn't redirect to the same place PMOI does, so I've changed the article appropriately. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 16:48, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> certainly suffers from POV and some inappropriate content, such as the contact me part, but the concept that there is an art/science to design and hence methods is certainly appropriate. Since this primarily focuses on the work of John Christopher Jones it may be more appropriate to move it an article of that name and reorg it to be more consistent with standards <a href="../../../j/_/e/User%7EJ_E_Bailey_09c3.html" title="User:J E Bailey">J E Bailey</a> 18:19, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This document is about design methods and starts with John Christopher Jones. It should not be deleted as it is an important topic of discussion. It is not "cult" or "partisan", but is a valid area to articulate. As for the e-mail, I have taken it down as it seems as if it is culturally not in keeping with Wikipedia <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesign_methods_ba2a.html" title="User:Design methods">User:design_methods</a> Thank you for the commentary. If you go to design methods, it has been expanded to discuss the development of design research and design studies as a response to the work of the original group from design methods. I disagree that the content should be broken up, and give this a chance. This page is not promoting any specific group, but trying to demonstrate the development of design methods. <b>Owen and HappyCamper, if you would let me know what to improve to bring it in line with what your vision of Wikipedia is, I would appreciate it.</b> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesign_methods_ba2a.html" title="User:Design methods">User:design_methods</a>

<li>Thank you Owen. I am all ears on how to improve Wikipedia. Do you have any constructive suggestions? <a href="../../../d/e/s/Design_methods.html" title="Design methods">Design methods</a>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, the article is missing a definition. What is "Design methods"? An organization? An idea? A methodology? Check out other articles here to see examples of how a defining paragraph should look like, or read <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a>. Secondly, and more importantly, I find it amazing that a 3,000-word article about something that existed for 40 years wouldn't have <i>a single bit of criticism</i>. This is exactly what differentiates an encyclopedic entry from a sales pitch. (<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesign_methods_ba2a.html" title="User:Design methods">Design Methods</a> 17:41, 20 December 2005 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>Thank you Owen for the comments. I will clarify the definition of design methods and make sure it is known as a definition. I am all open for criticism, but also believe that the criticism should be followed by fixes, either by others (which I have invited others to do so) or by generalists who improve syntax. I think we all want to avoid terms like "fringe cult". Our collective goal should be to create a dynamic resource and assume contributors are trying to do the right thing and be specific on how to improve the content. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesign_methods_ba2a.html" title="User:Design methods">Owen×</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDesign_methods_8006.html" title="User talk:Design methods"><big>☎</big></a>
<ul>
<li>You're still avoiding the issue. I wasn't talking about criticism of your article; I was talking about criticism of John Christopher Jones and his movement/cult/whatever it is (you still haven't defined it). If you tell us that in 40 years he and his ideas haven't received any criticism, then you've proven my claims. <a href="../../../o/w/e/User%7EOwenX_7b06.html" title="User:OwenX">Owen×</a> <a href="../../../o/w/e/User_talk%7EOwenX_e744.html" title="User talk:OwenX"><big>☎</big></a> 13:44, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am sorry if you think I am avoiding the issue. Please read the revised introduction. John Christopher Jones is not the issue as design methods is much larger than one person. He was an important founder of the idea of design methods and he did receive a share of criticism. If you read down the article, I have tried to discuss how design methods expanded and changed. <a href="../../../d/e/s/Design_methods.html" title="Design methods">Design methods</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - this article is very misleading - it is at best an <i>essay</i> on a particular interpretation of design methods in the Western world.

<dd>Please put more effort into your nominations. "nn", which I assume here is intended as a stand-in for "non-notable", tells us nothing more than that you think the article should be deleted (we already know that, 'cos you nominated it!).

<li>No, there isn't. What we have is <i>no consensus to delete schools</i>, not consensus that schools are notable or that schools are valuable. However, the schools-are-inherently-worthy crowd are quite happy to flood AfD discussions with "keeps", while the schools-must-be-individually-notable crowd aren't willing to do the same when we clearly don't have the numbers. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 04:02, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oh, hello, it's you again. Thanks for affording me the opportunity to expand on my comments above. My dream is to see every English speaking kid in the entire world given the chance to add pertinent facts and pithy insights to a wikipedia article dedicated to their school. <b>All contributions</b> from these <b>young scholars</b> meet my definition of <b>valuable</b>, or even <b>precious</b>, for who better to contribute to school articles than the current inmates of those hallowed halls of learning? Wikipedia's <b>higher calling</b> is to encourage this participation, to stoke the intellectual fires of youth across the oceans. Yet, some of those articles, of necessity, will begin as stubs, or even sub-stubs. You must not view this as a cause of <i>disappointment</i>, but rather as an unavoidable consequence of Wikipedia's <b>noble burden</b>. My faith remains unshaken, though, that said stubs, with the passage of time, will form pearls that fully encapsulate the <i>encyclopedic quality</i> to warm the cockles of true blue wikipedians such as yourself. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 08:10, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into school district or town if article is both below three sentances and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture when AFD is closed. This school, like all others, is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on it's own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use.

<p>This appears to be just a copied-and-pasted resume of the actor in question. I question the notability, first off, and also, the creator of the page has the username Ewanthomson, which is the real name of the actor, so he's either a very big fan or, more likely, the actor himself.</p>

<li>The article was created by a member of the site, not the site owner. Also, currently parts of the text are copied from the site, but that is because it needs something to begin with whilst it is expanded. I personally was looking at expanding on what a Somma class is and I know others are looking at putting up things relevant to the site but which are not on the site. Part of the trouble is that the site has been running long enough that it has become encyclopaedic of itself, however that cannot be considered here because this is a seperate central encyclopaedia, not an individual site. I would expect the article to be given the decency of opportunity to be finished before being nominated for deletion. After all, it would be in the spirit of freedom of speech, and as we all know, the desire for freedom resides in every human heart.</li>

<li>Exactly. It outlines storys in the Star Trek world, albeit non offical ones. I belive that if Bravo Fleet, which has had their article up for quite some time, is allowed, then Section 47 should be permitted as well. Precident has been established that this is permitted.

<ul>
<li>This is not really a fan website, it is a sim. There is a wikipedia entry for Bravo Fleet which is a sim site similar to Section 47. If Bravo Fleet is to be allowed a Wikipedia page, then I believe that Section 47 should be allowed one too. Part of the article is copied from the site, however it is relevant and as this article is a work in progress, I don't believe that this will remain true for the whole article. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHero1701_f8a7.html" title="User:Hero1701">Hero1701</a> 00:54, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Both the site founder and current owner have been alerted to the accusation of copyright infringement so they can verify that this is not copyright infringement. If and when they deny the accusations, the delete votes based on copyright violation will not be valid. As for being a sim, then it is a notable simulation in being one of the few trivia sims around and with a concise history and current structure. People looking up <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simming_Organization_3483.html" title="Simming Organization">Simming Organization</a> probably want to see what sorts of site are around and how they are run. Section 47 already appears there alongside Bravo Fleet and so is just as valid for inclusion within Wikipedia and arguably more so because of the unique nature of promotion within the sim based on trivia.user:Sir Brutus</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><s>Keep</s> Abstain</b> I agree that the article needs to be rewritten, but it should not be deleted. Section 47 <i>is</i> a notable Star Trek sim site, even if it doesn't meet the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria. It was the second site to combine trivia and simming in one, and with the first site to do that having closed down some time ago, it is now the longest running site with this concept. Many sites have been created since featuring the same concept. (So maybe Section 47 does meet the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria after all.) Furthermore, Section 47 is not just a website, it is an organization, with an extended management system. I think there are many articles on Wikipedia about much smaller and less organized organizations. Finally, as the original creator (founder) of Section 47, I have no problem with parts of the text from the Section 47 website being used on Wikipedia. ··· <a href="../../../r/u/u/User%7ERuudVisser_f4a0.html" title="User:RuudVisser">rWd</a> · <a href="../../../r/u/u/User_talk%7ERuudVisser_bebd.html" title="User talk:RuudVisser">Talk</a> ··· 20:42, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think we have different ideas of what 'notable' constitutes in this case. I cannot cite any references to claim Section 47 meets the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria, because it probably doesn't meet them. However, I believe Section 47 is a notable organization within the Star Trek RPG community, for reasons mentioned in my original "Keep" post. I also believe that's sufficient to warrant a (properly written) Wikipedia article; to me, the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria are too strict. Wikipedia is a repository of knowledge.

Yet because it is present on an information sharing site and not being used for profit then copyright is technically kept.

<li><b>Comment</b> Most of the people opposed to this article, cite the fact that the Section 47 website doesn't meet the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria as an important reason. However, Section 47 is not primarily a Star Trek-related website (and certainly not a fansite, Agnte), it is an international organization that brings people together to share their love for writing fiction in the Star Trek universe. Yes, it does use a website to reach that goal, but the website is only a means, not the goal itself. If Section 47 conducted all its business without a website, would the article be allowed? I think that's the question that should be answered. Don't judge Section 47 against the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria, because they don't apply. ··· <a href="../../../r/u/u/User%7ERuudVisser_f4a0.html" title="User:RuudVisser">rWd</a> · <a href="../../../r/u/u/User_talk%7ERuudVisser_bebd.html" title="User talk:RuudVisser">Talk</a> ··· 15:43, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Agreed with Agnte's statement of lack of notability, there's only 280+ odd members but loking through the site less than half of them active, maybe a few dozen regular people active at most.

<li><b>Comment</b> there are quite a few book clubs listed on wikipedia. several hundred. perhaps you should delete all of those as well? I don't think so. as for the notability criteria, well, those don't mention simming organizations. At all. message boards, yes. Fan fic? no. In fact, there are quite a few fan fic pages... take a look at all of the links from this page... <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_Fiction_f965.html" title="Fan Fiction">Fan Fiction</a> are you going to get rid of all of them?

</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is something known as being reasonable. the only critera right now is wether or not it's notable. Well, It is for the people that read the article, isn't that what counts?

<ul>
<li>Of course notability is very subjective. However, I agree with Kalsermar and Agnte that Section 47 probably isn't notable enough by any criteria used on Wikipedia. Just have a look at the pages in <i>Category:Wikipedia notability criteria</i>. We may not all agree with those criteria, but many Wikipedians do, so it's a bit unfair to suggest Kalsermar and Agnte are being unreasonable. Does that mean the Section 47 article should be deleted? No, I still don't think so. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> contains arguments for and against deleting non-notable articles. I think the arguments against are more important.

<li>I feel sad about this because I always used to think of Wikipedia as a place to put information. I didn't realise the arguments for removing information were regarded by the admin as being stronger than those for keeping it. Maybe if the admin had a love for Star Trek then we would be kept along with all the book clubs which were probably checked by admins who have a love of reading. As it is, we appear to be less notable than entirely fictional obscure literary characters simply because we're not in paperback. user:Sir Brutus

<li>To Kalsermar: we do not feel this page should have beennominated for deletion.

<ul>
<li>The thing is, the majority of the Wikipedia community does <i>not</i> believe Wikipedia is an unlimited repository, and there are some good arguments for that view. The nomination for deletion was perfectly acceptable by almost any Wikipedia policy, if not all. Some have said the people in favour of deletion don't know Section 47 well enough to make a good judgment. In turn, I think most people in favour of keeping don't know Wikipedia well enough to make judgment, and that probably includes myself. I've only been active here for a few weeks, and I'm still learning the rules. I've changed my vote above to <i>abstain</i>; I'm still in favour of keeping, but I'm too biased and I don't think I've been on Wikipedia long enough for my vote to count. By the way, Kalsermar was right about some comments being dismissive and defiant, and I'm sorry to see that coming from the community that I set up. ··· <a href="../../../r/u/u/User%7ERuudVisser_f4a0.html" title="User:RuudVisser">rWd</a> · <a href="../../../r/u/u/User_talk%7ERuudVisser_bebd.html" title="User talk:RuudVisser">Talk</a> ··· 07:31, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>To Kalsermar: I'd like to just point out that your member count is inaccurate. The ranks list does not display all members since the site opened in the year 2000. Only recent trivia only members are kept on the inactive ranks page. {Section 47 Member}</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b></li>

<p>As a member of the site, I don't believe that it is a fansite, but more of an ongoing story. We don't just talk about how much we love the show, we create NON-CANNON stories, and missions, that are enjoyable to read, and enjoyable to participate in. We are one of the largest sites of this form of Star Trek Sim, so that I think that having give or take 200 members is fairly significant. I am not under the impression that it is in any way a copyright violation, but I am not a lawyer. Keep this article. BlAsTeR89 06:58, 24 December 2005 (UTC)Rye</p>

<dd>I am studying this right now in my Sociology classes. It is quite clear somebody has simply taken the textbook! All our sources seem to be highly critical of IQ and claim that it is "not a sociological explanation" (wtf?). Somebody apparently decided to totally reverse the bias of the article, too <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Achievement_in_British_Education&amp;diff=14003553&amp;oldid=12656400" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Achievement_in_British_Education&amp;diff=14003553&amp;oldid=12656400" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> (provided more sources added) I would say the article was a fair summary of what British "experts" say on the subject. I imagine its based on the intro of some longer tome which goes on to discuss each point in detail with sources/studies identified.

<li>The article is definitely <i>not</i> a fair summary of what British experts say. If it were, British expert opinion claims that UK education is a sociological disaster! At best, this article is what one sociologist says, without attribution, and so fails to be NPOV. It also fails to be worthy of inclusion in an encyclopaedia except perhaps as 'Conclusions of the X Report into British Education' (where X is whoever's POV this article represents).

<li>Exaactly so. But User:84.67.190.181 is misinformed. The consensus of British expert opinion <i>does</i> claim exactly that - that UK education is a disaster for working-class children! Their published work and textbooks reflect that and every new government initiative starts from that assumption.

<dd>Simply placing "Factors affecting" before the rest of title begins to clarify what the article is about; but, depending on what sources, references et al can be provided, a prefix such as "Studies of" may be more accurate.

<li><b>Keep</b> for extended/signficant appearance on hit show. An actor with comparable air time on a hit show, would be in pretty easily. As disappointing as it may be, far more people have seen this person, followed his activities (on the show, and reading in the press) than have any concern for most of the persons accepted in Wikipedia. The question is, are we picking who has been found notable by others (demonstrated in published national media coverage of them), or who should be. One shouldn't be notable for being on such a show, but one is (personally I don't understand the concern with these contestants, and wish reality tv would largely go away). Also, I think a practical rule of thumb for hit national reality shows, is about ten top contestants (if they're more than just a few episodes, and there's ample coverage specifically of them) are usually (not always) getting articles. For such contestants, rather than doing an AFD, a simpler approach is to redirect/unredirect based on completeness of article. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 11:13, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Worms is an extremely popular game. The weapons from the game are covered in an encyclopaedic fashion and form a useful resource. Incidentally, quoting from <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">Fancruft</a>, <i>Generally speaking, the perception that an article is fancruft can be a contributing factor in its deletion, but it is rarely the sole factor.</i> If this was a list of levels in Worms, or character names, or documentation of minute details of gameplay, I might agree.
