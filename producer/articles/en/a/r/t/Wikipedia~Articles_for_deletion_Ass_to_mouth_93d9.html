I'm completely willing to accept that this may be a commonly used industry term, but where is the verifiable citation of that? In it's current form the only reference is to the use of the term in Clerks II, which would make it a neologism by definition (and not a common one). This article needs to CITE AND VERIFY notability, not simply have a collection of editors here make assertions that "it really IS a common term, really!". I'm aware there are a number of terms in every industry that are commonly used colloquially but hard to prove, but it strikes that if there is any industry where one should be able to verify via web-based sources, it would be the adult industry. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 13:19, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

The term is for the most part a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a> of a sexual "move" seldom seen outside of the porno industry.

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelPlaya_f9ad.html" title="User:DelPlaya">DelPlaya</a>'s vote is the core problem with this debate at the moment, specifically for "so I've heard". I don't think anyone here is doubting that this is an industry term. The delete votes that I see (my own included) are that the article does not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> this according to wikipedia's policies. "Everybody knows", "It's well known", "I hear it a lot", etc are all <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel</a> arguments used to avoid citation. If no one is able to find a verifiable source for the phrase on the web for a term used in an industry with the largest web presence, that means the term is of questionable encyclopedic quality. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 12:40, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>By the same token, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a>, a bit of a problem arises in applying the same standards of verifiability to sexual colloquialisms (particularly of fringe sexual practices some may find unpleasant) as we do to, say, astronomical taxonomy. Sometimes "uh, doesn't <i>everybody</i> know what ass to mouth is" is what you have to work with, and you go from there. That's what that particular behavior <i>is</i> called (I can't think of a synonymous expression), and I really don't see why we need a citation from the New England Journal of Medicine to prove that. <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">Handjob</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/m/Rimjob.html" title="Rimjob">rimjob</a>, these are really not things you're going to have an easy time finding citations for, despite sexual behaviors occupying a central part in every culture that continues to produce babies (and orgasms). "Blowjob" is about 150 years old, and it's only very recently that etymologists have started to trace its origins. I don't think it would be a terrible idea to <b>move</b> this to a more encyclopedic-sounding title (although I can't begin to imagine what that would be Immediately-Post-Anal-Sex Oral Sex?), with a redirect from <a href="../../../a/s/s/Ass_to_mouth.html" title="Ass to mouth">ass to mouth</a>, a la, <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titty_fuck.html" title="Titty fuck">titty fuck</a> redirecting to <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammary_intercourse.html" title="Mammary intercourse">mammary intercourse</a>.

<li>None of the above editors have cited any sources. The article itself cites no sources. The only thing that it does cite is the quotations page for an IMDB entry on a film. <i>That film is a work of fiction.</i> There is no reason to believe that what the characters say is factual. Moreover, the quotations given <i>don't even explain what the concept actually is in the first place</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b>, I am 100% unsurprised that medical and psychological researched turned up nothing. However, cast your eyes over the net and you will see thousands (Google says millions, but let's be realistic) of uses of the term. With this much weight of evidence, to argue <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is arguing semantics. The term is not unverifiable but by dint of what it is "respectable" sources won't mention it.

<li><b>Comment</b>, in my opinion, and remember these are opinions that we have even though some present them as fact, this article is valid. This practice goes on and if Wikipedia is to have any credibility it must be complete, if we are to have a category on sexual practices it should give the prevalent ones. This is an example of where <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> (though I shudder to use it) is appropriate. There is a huge swathe of uses of Ass to mouth, ATM, A2M etc on the internet. There are interviews that include the term, it's not just in the "script" of a porn shoot, it is used verbally to communicate an idea. This is something real people do in their everyday lives, like it or not. Adherence to rules is ok but recognising when the rules don't serve the purpose for which they were written is essential. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">Malla</span></a><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMallanox_41c6.html" title="User talk:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">nox</span></a> 17:01, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>you do realize that "Ignore All Rules" is a controversial policy, right? and WP is not supposed to be about every single thing under the sun... If Wikipedia is to have any credibility, it should only have reliable, encyclopedic content that is not based on personal observation or research. The fact that this article violates so many policies and guidelines <i>must</i> raise at least one red flag in your head. And the phrase that this article is about just seems to be so unnotable -both from WP's standards and any layman's subjective viewpoint- even if it is often and only used in the porn industry. I mean, it clearly and without any wordplay or use of unconventional phrasing describes the act. It is unlikely to qualify for a copyright. It does not seem to be any special phrase whose history can be reliably traced. I mean, if this article is to exist, then we might as well create an article for "Guy On Guy" or something like that.</li>

The purpose of the cited source is, in the author's own words, "to challenge us -- in harsh language -- on men’s use of pornography". And it is therein that he uses "<a href="../../../a/s/s/Ass_to_mouth.html" title="Ass to mouth">Ass to mouth</a>". <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 08:37, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have taken the only material I could from the article and placed it into <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal-oral_contact.html#Anal-oral_contact_in_popular_culture" title="Anal-oral contact">Anal-oral contact#Anal-oral contact in popular culture</a>. What is left is well-cited within that context. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 08:54, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The two most recently added references do more than just <i>use</i> the term, they <i>describe it's meaning and practise.</i> Why do you persist in going on about <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal-oral_contact.html" title="Anal-oral contact">Anal-oral contact</a> when you should know by now that <a href="../../../a/s/s/Ass_to_mouth.html" title="Ass to mouth">Ass to mouth</a> can be performed without anyone's mouth being near anyone else's ass? You appear to be demanding nothing short of multiple peer-reviewed academic research papers on the subject, which is totally unreasonable in this context, and just adds to the impression that you are attempting to effectively censor the article by setting unattainable standards. As for your your edit to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal-oral_contact.html" title="Anal-oral contact">Anal-oral contact</a>, did you even read it first? The second paragraph of that article says: <i>"It is a distinct practice from anal sex followed by fellatio, which is often referred to as ass to mouth."</i></dd>

<dd>I have to agree, multiple source have been provided that the practice exists. It is real beyond doubt. As already stated, the source doesn't have to be about the origins of the term. If I added a source to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> it should prove there is a country called England on the island of Great Britain not why it's called England and where the term comes from. The crux of argument, correct me if I'm wrong, is that we don't know what to call it. It seems to have no proper name. In this instance I suggest we use a term that brings back a massive number of Google hits and move on to another subject who's verifiability and notability are in doubt. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">Malla</span></a><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMallanox_41c6.html" title="User talk:Mallanox"><span style="background:white;color:black">nox</span></a> 13:10, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
