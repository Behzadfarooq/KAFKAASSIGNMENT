<dd>Anomo, you got the gist of it. Dibbell has received criticism for his "immersive" or melodramatic approach to the article (I'd like to find some that's citeable). He was a participant and new to online community and you could say he was drunk on the experience. Then as now some people are dismissive of the event itself, but the importance of the article is a different matter.--<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 06:26, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I don't think this case deserves its own article (the actual events are not very notable at all), but would be fine as cutdown part of a Dibbell article andor an article on cyberspace crime as trialsanderrors suggests.

<li><b>Comment</b> The externally linked article is well just horridly unreadbly written. The article appeared to be an improvement, but still a long way to go. What it gets down to appears is just more of a hacking/prank and not a rape. That is, if someone did that to a man, a man wouldn't be in tears, just angry. I'm not sure all women would consider that rape either--hardly embarressment since it's anonymous online. It might be good to rewrite it by referencing notable sources that refer to the article. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 12:39, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly, Anomo. The debate over the meaning of the incident -- and Dibbell's comprehensive (although imperfect) treatment of its implications -- are why the article remains relevant today. There are people who read this and say it was just a prank; some of the participants were hard-pressed to explain why they <i>experienced</i> a prank as if it were sexual assault. That's the crux of Dibbell's essay. In any event, our article isn't here to explain the incident, but to explain the content and context of the essay. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 18:22, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Wasn't this a pretty famous article? Still, I'm not sure if an individual news article needs a Wikipedia article of its own. It's points are better discussed in WP articles that discuss the topic of the news article.

<li>It isn't a "news article", it is an essay.

<ul>
<li>OK, I admit I never read the essay/article/whateveryoumaycallit in full, and it's been time since even looked at it, anyway. =) Anyway, I'm not questioning its <i>notability;</i> What I'm questioning is whether it warrants an article of its own. We don't (last I checked) have an article on, say, "Go To Statement Considered Harmful" (but we have <a href="../../../g/o/t/GOTO_4b8b.html" title="GOTO">GOTO</a>, and a redirect to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Considered_harmful.html" title="Considered harmful">Considered harmful</a>), and we don't have an article on that Codd's paper, but we have an article on <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relational_model.html" title="Relational model">relational model</a> which points to it. Similar principle could be used here. Books (IMO) warrant articles, essays and individual articles are better off merged to the subjects they cover, unless they're <a href="../../../a/_/m/A_Modest_Proposal_989b.html" title="A Modest Proposal">really really REALLY famous and influential</a>. =) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 20:30, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I couldn't disagree more (okay I probably could but still). A couple of hundred years ago, it was common to print very long pamphlets instead of books, and there is always the question of what to call a book-length essay that hasn't been published with two outside covers. Articles and anything else that are both notable and verifiable can have their own Wiipedia article. If you're feeling sympathetic toward books, just to balance that, ask yourself, would this essay be notable enough for its own article if it were a book? If the answer is yes, then it should have its own article no matter what format it is published in. Let's discriminate purely on notability, not on format. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 20:39, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>*sigh* Okay, I really wouldn't like to argue about this, but my answer to whether or not an essay needs an article of its own would be a resounding "<i>That depends,</i> but probably not." If I'm saying essays aren't article-worthy and books are, that's just a rule of thumb - like most of the Wikipedia guidelines and policies, as interpreted every day. We're meant to look at the spirit of our policies rather than the letter; likewise, I can't say my ideas of article merging are universal and unbreakable. <i>In this case,</i> I'd say this is merge material. <i>However,</i> like I said, I'm saying this should be kept in some form. I'm <i>not</i> annoyed if someone elects to just keep this as a stand-alone article <i>for now</i>, and I can't bother to change my boldfaced recommendation because it's probably inconsequential considering other peoples' recommendations. All I'm saying is that please don't turn this into "Article sizes: Wikiality vs. Lutheranism" thing along the lines of "We don't have an article on Codd's relational model article, which has <i>only</i> been described as the most important computer science paper ever published, but we have an article on this cybersex incident." We're also <i>meant</i> to use common sense here. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 01:23, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Collegial discussion is good.&#160;;-) Wwwwolf, the question comes to whether there is sufficient material for an article on a specific essay. A merge recommendation is also problematic as there is no obvious article to merge with such as "cyberrape" (which may not even deserve its own article). The essay touches on aspects of cyber law and digital culture, but also postmodern concepts such as individual identity and the power of language. I know when I read it in the <i>Voice</i> so many years ago, I had no idea it would have this kind of longevity. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 10:23, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: the nomination was reasonable (based on the state of the article), and the nominator was reasonable and has already withdrawn. No scold necessary in this case.

<li><b>Keep</b> but it does need some rewriting for the reader (like me) who never heard of any of this before. Dhartung says above that "our article isn't here to explain the incident...." In the abstract, that's true, but one can't really understand our article about Dibbell's article without being clear about what transpired in the underlying incident. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 10:55, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
