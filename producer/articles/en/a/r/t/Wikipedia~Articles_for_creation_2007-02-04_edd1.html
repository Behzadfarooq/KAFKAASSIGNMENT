<b>Quick Bio</b><br />
Abandon Kansas is a Wichita, Kansas based rock/pop band that was started in 2005 by guitarist/vocalist Jeremy Spring, bassist Chris Martin, drummer Brad Regier and keyboardist Brian Nixon. A lineup change in early 2006 saw the debut of a new drummer, Brian Scheideman, in the place of Regier.<br />
<b>Recording History</b><br />
To date, Abandon Kansas has recorded two 3-song EP's. The first of which, entitled "Exactly What We Needed", was recorded in January, 2006 with producer CR Pendleton (of Pendlwood Studio) and engineer Dustin Hurlock. Exactly What We Needed played the songs "Exactly What We Needed", "Falls Apart" and "Fear of Heights", and was released in March of 2006. That EP, pressed in the homes of the band members in bundles of 50, has sold 18 million copies worldwide. The second EP, entitled "Minutes", included the songs "Minutes", "The Message" and "Eat Em While They're Blue", and was recorded (again with Pendleton and Hurlock) from August to October, 2006. Abandon Kansas began selling the EP at all tour stops beginning January 2, 2007, although the official hometown CD release wasn't until January 19. The band found it difficult to keep up with January's record sales of 31 million copies of the disc.<br />
<b>Touring History</b><br />
Abandon Kansas' first out of state show was in Tulsa, Oklahoma on October 10, 2005. The groups Dizmas and After Eight also played. AK packed all their gear into Brian's father's work van during spring break of '06 to get a small taste of touring. Abandon Kansas traveled south through Oklahoma, east, playing a show in Arkansas, and then headed north to Missouri for a few shows. Although it was only a week, it was good practice for the long road ahead. At the end of May, AK set out on it's first real tour, only this time the band was armed with a '94 Ford conversion van and a UHaul 4x8 trailer. AK traveled west, beginning in Colorado, then traveling south and further west, reaching Bakersfield, California before returning home. Only about a month after returning home from this tour, AK left again to travel north and east, playing shows in Illinois, Ohio and Michigan. These two successful tours afforded AK members the privilege of playing with some of their idols. The band was seen on stage with the likes of Coldplay, Bob Hope and Elvis Presley, they even had a brief stint of headlining shows which featured openers REO Speedwagon and Beethoven. After taking a brief break for the 2006 fall school semester to record and further their educations, the band struck out again on the release of the Minutes EP for another southwest tour. Beginning January 2, AK headed to Arizona and southern California by way of Oklahoma to begin playing their first winter tour. The cold brought new challenges, like wind chill and blizzards, but AK endured the hardships to bring the rock to cities like Tucson, Phoenix, Merced, Ventura and Rialto.<br />
<b>The Future of Abandon Kansas</b><br />
Abandon Kansas are currently writing and recording for another new album, possibly a full-length project. Plans include rigorous spring and summer touring in hopes of playing more shows than the 3,200 shows the band played in 2006. The group's high standards of album sales touring began with a simple idea. "We were just sitting around talking about what we wanted to accompish with [our first EP] Exactly What We Needed, and that's when [Brian] Scheideman said something like 'guys, could you imagine if we sold, like, 15 million of these CD's?'", Chris remembers. "So we made that our goal, and we surpassed it by several million copies." "If we stay focused on our goal anything's possible", says keyboardist and background vocalist Brian Nixon. Nixon continued: "No one thought we would sell 20 million copies of our last EP before it was even technically released, but we did it, and it's only because we love the music and the fans and, most of all, we love each other!"<br />
<b>Personal</b><br />
Jeremy is still attending Friends University, although he plans to graduate in the winter of '07-'08, unless he discontinues school to pursue music full-time. He has children in 22 states (nearly half of the contiguous states), 7 of which are from states he's never even been to.<br />
Brian Nixon is very involved in his closet company on the side. "Closets are very important to me," says Nixon, "sure, i don't spend <i>all</i> my time in there, but I have to make sure everything is orderly and neat before I like to come out. He is also attending Friends University, and will be for the rest of his life.<br />
Chris Martin's main goal is to learn to play the bass guitar. All of Abandon Kansas' bass lines are actually played on the keyboard by Nixon's left hand, and when playing shows, Chris stands and "rocks out" with an unplugged Gibson bass. Chris also enjoys watching movies that shouldn't have even been made, like Waterworld and Black Christmas.<br />
Brian Scheideman is engaged to a fine young lady and they will be married as soon as she graduates from the eighth grade and gets her braces removed. We're all very happy for the couple and their first son, Andrew McMahon Scheideman (4 years old) is already learning how to play the drums!</p>

<p>New Trier High School first had a water polo team in 1994. After coaching at Glenbrook North High School for four years, David Goodspeed was hired to coach the Trevians. He created and coach a very sucsessful program and coached it for four years until 1998, when he was asked by female players on his team if a Girl's team could be founded and if he would coach them. He did so for a three years until Kim Moore and eventually Mike Leissner took over for him. In 2001 and 2002 the Girl's team placed fourth in the IHSA State Water Polo Tournament. When Coach Goodspeed returned to the Boy's Team with coaches Jim Battle and Dan Daly, he set about to claim the one prize New Trier Water Polo has never earned, the title "1st in State." In 2004, his team came close coming in 4th in state but as of 2006, neither the New Trier Boy's or Girl's team has claimed the IHSA title.</p>

<p><br />
Corona Schr√∂ter (January 14, 1751 ‚Äì August 23, 1802) was most well known as a singer. Regardless of that fact, throughout the early part of her life, she studied many instruments, which included the keyboard and guitar. Her father, Johann Friedrich Schr√∂ter, an oboist, was her first teacher, who also taught his three other children music as well. Corona‚Äôs brothers, Johann Samuel and Johann Heinrich, were a pianist and a violinist respectively, and her sister, Marie Henriette was also a singer.</p>
<p>When she was thirteen, Corona and her family moved to Leipzig. It was there that she caught the attention of Johann Adam Hiller (it is thought that Hiller‚Äôs wife was Corona‚Äôs godmother). Hiller, an operatic composer, had become seriously frustrated with the inadequate education offered to women. To remedy this, in 1771, Hiller opened his own school. In this coeducational setting, students learned a wide variety of musical subjects, including solf√®ge, diction, technique, Italian, and the keyboard. Corona flourished as a singer, but when compared to her fellow student and rival, Gertrud Schmeling (a.k.a. Madame Mara), in Hiller‚Äôs <i>Grosse Konzerte</i> series, Corona‚Äôs voice did not contain the power that Gertrud‚Äôs had, possibly due to poor training which may have damaged her voice. However, she had an intensity that could not be rivaled in the eyes of many of her devotees.</p>
<p>During her time at Hiller‚Äôs school, Corona became good friends with <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Wolfgang_Goethe_ea9e.html" title="Johann Wolfgang Goethe">Johann Wolfgang Goethe</a>, and when he moved to Weimar in 1775, he brought Corona along as a court singer for Duchess Anna Amalia. She first performed in the court on November 23, 1776. However, while she was employed as a singer, Corona became quite involved with the amateur court theatre, performing in at least eighteen productions, many of which were written by Goethe himself, who, on a few occasions, starred opposite her, as in the performance of his play <i>Iphigenie auf Rauris</i> in 1779. Goethe‚Äôs singspiel <i>Die Fischerin,</i> was especially important to Corona. She not only starred in the leading role of Dortchen, but composed incidental music for the play, including the famous opening song <i>Der Erlk√∂nig,</i> which is quite different in form from the version composed <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Schubert_d1e2.html" title="Franz Schubert">Franz Schubert</a> over 30 years later.</p>
<p>When the amateur court theater was replaced by professional actors in 1783, Corona continued to sing in informal settings and act. She also began to teach singing and took up writing and art. She formally withdrew from all court performing in 1788. She became friends with <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Schiller_7210.html" title="Friedrich Schiller">Friedrich Schiller</a> during those years, whose poems she later set to music. Unfortunately, these lied are lost, as are her two dramas, hundreds of arias and duets, and an autobiography given to Goethe in 1778. However, two collections of lieder were published by her, the first in 1786, followed by another in 1794. The first collection was more popular than the second, probably due to its more simplistic nature, considering that the second contained many songs in French and Italian. These two collections are some of the first and largest publications of lieder by a woman. When the first collection was released, Corona had this to say about her work: <i>I have had to overcome much hesitation before I seriously made the decision to publish a collection of short poems that I have provided with melodies. A certain feeling towards propriety and morality is stamped upon our sex, which does not allow us to appear alone in public, and without an escort: Thus, how can I otherwise present this, my musical work to the public, than with timidity? For the complimentary opinions and the encouragement of a few persons‚Ä¶ can easily be biased out of pity. The work of any lady, moreover, will indeed arouse similar pity to some extent in the eyes of other experts.‚Ä¶</i> A review of this first collection said that Corona‚Äôs abilities for composing were not equal to her potential. The reviewer felt that the songs had much spirit in them, but were not written in a way that brought this out. He did say that the performances of these pieces were helpful to understanding the depth of them. Ultimately, he blamed this deficiency on her lack of education, a real problem for women of this time.</p>
<p>Corona was also immortalized in other ways. In 1782, during a eulogy for a deceased theatre director, Goethe praised her for help in shaping theatre in Weimar, particularly in himself. Seven years earlier, a work about theatre history was dedicated to her due to her well-known abilities.</p>
<p>Corona spent the last eight years of her life teaching acting and singing. However, lung and respiratory problems forced her to move from Leipzig to Ilmenau with her long-time friend Wilhemine Probst in 1801. However, her condition was so serious that she never recovered and died there a year later.</p>

<p>The Southside Rollin' 20's (sr20's) are a new, influential and intimidating youth street gang. The gang originated in the ghetto areas of Adelaide, Australia in the year of 2006. They have since branched out and now cover many areas of Australia. They typically like to keep discreet about their operations and do not receive much media attention compared to their American equivalents. Their slogan is 'Keep It Locked, Keep It Loaded, Keep It Gangster Baby!' according to their third-party website and myspace page.</p>
<p>The gang is made up of a group of 'core' members, which can be found on their third-party website, as the group does not like to expose itself officially (this discretion has successfully kept the gang out of the media spotlight): The core group consists of nine men named Wappo, Kelly, Matt, Sam, Mini, Cooper, Joe, Brad and Saxon. This group of men are believed to meet on regular occasions in various secluded locations around the Adelaide suburbs.</p>
<p>The only official online record of the gang is a myspace page which was created soon after the gang's birth.</p>
<p>So far the group hasn't been given any formal criminal charges.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: On 2nd February 2007, three butchers got into a fight at a wet market at Block 209 of Hougang Street 21.</p>
<p>The butcher, because of jealousy, had used a cleaver to injure 2 victims.</p>
<p>This is how it goes: The Police received a call at 5.30am, but the suspect ‚Äì a Chinese man (The Butcher mentioned at the top) in his early 50s ‚Äì had already fled the scene.</p>
<p>The fight allegedly broke out because the suspect was jealous of the good business enjoyed by his neighbour.</p>
<p>The first victim suffered gashes to his nose, hands and legs, while the second had cuts to his face and shoulder.</p>
<p>Both were sent to hospital for treatment, but by the afternoon, their business was opened as usual.</p>
<p>They both said that this is the first time a fight has happened in their 20 years of working side by side.</p>
<p>The Police have arrested the suspect and investigations are underway.</p>
<p>"I grabbed his chopper and my hand got hurt, my legs as well. He's jealous. He doesn't have any business. He was already complaining about it last night," said Ang Eng Guan, the first victim.</p>
<p>"The two men were fighting, and I tried to stop the fight, but the suspect came at me instead. I didn't know he'd struck me, and even threw the chopper in my direction. I didn't know I was hurt till someone told me I was bleeding," said Tan Kah Siew, another victim.</p>

<p>The housler political party was founded in 1928 Kansas city. Though rocky roads lay ahead from the beginning the 50 original members were able to hold on till 1930,when in the midst of the depression,people turned their hopes to this mostly radical republican party. The hausler movement was espeacially popular in the region that consisted of missouri,iowa,arkansas,and northern texas. My political history says that it had grown so much in power that by the mid 1940's it had grown into a full blown political mascarade. Though it flourished feverently in the communist fearing 1950's it lost power extremely in the early 1960's and turned to being an underground almost mafia like organization. They came out of hiding in 1984 and to this day have a weakened power wich could threaten their very existince in this liberal and communist filled land we call the coasts fo america. Though none of the original members are alive,several people beleive they are in hiding,just waiting for a better america. VOTE HAUSLER IN 08' their candidate is Holland. They're debating right now wether or not to run for political office. google{hausler wikipedia(the hausler political party the hauslers0published in 1987Antonio-pierre 10:56, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Originally formed in New Jersey in 2002, and now sweltering in the heated depths of Florida, Bodies In The Gears Of The Apparatus has become an entirely destructive force to be reckoned with... With their speed, originality, and technical musicianship that put them at the top of any death/grind band out there and an intense live show that will leave you completely devastated in its wake, they have managed to crossover several defining genres and garner praise from metalheads AND hardcore fans alike! Brutal and hopelessly insane, this band is the next step towards your own lurking dementia! In March of 2006, Bodies in the Gears of the Apparatus went on permanent hiatus. (Source: Lambgoat.com) Florida's Bodies In The Gears Of The Apparatus have reportedly called it quits. Formed in 2002, the band has released material with The Spew Records in addition to a split with Despised Icon through Relapse Records. Vocalist Josh Vitale commented on the split: "We're all very upset to see this band go, but for now, this is the best decision we could decide on. We will all be in other bands, most likely not with each other. We had a lot of critics both positive and negative - both of which made us stronger people and we'd like to send out our thanks to those many who angered and inspired us enough to work harder ,moreover, we want to thank everyone who supported this musical project for the past three years. Finally, thank you so much for making this a wonderful and unforgettable experience." - Taken from their official MySpace page</p>
<p>Since the split-up, vocalist Josh Vitale bought a ticket to California to try out for The Faceless but didn't join because "his vocals didn't mesh well". He then moved to Indiana and was involved in the band Arbiter of Conceit and also joined and played shows with Decrypt. Both as vocalist. Then out of the blue, Josh quit Decrypt. Josh now is living in Tampa and will be going to school. Aaron Haines and Ian Sturgill have since started the band "Success Will Write Apocalypse Across The Sky" with John Collett of Dehumanized on vocals.</p>

<pre>
IS THE PERIOD OF STORM AND STRESS OF LIFE- DO YOU AGREE?
</pre>
<p><br />
The period of adolescence is drawing our attention from various points of consideration. This stage of life affects all sections of people somehow or other. As such it is sometimes described as the most dangerous period or awkward period of one‚Äôs life. Stanley Hall, a psychologist from America has described it as the period of storm and stress of life.</p>
<p>There are different reasons behind such statements. Colorful changes in all directions naturally make the boys and girls quite sensitive and restless at this stage. Their physical needs, emotional and social changes give rise to certain psycho-physical needs and problems. They feel strong urge to fulfill these needs in their respective environment. But if the environment fails to make effective realization of them, it may create tension, excitement and emotional upcharges in them. If the parents and teachers do not have adequate knowledge of them, they may fail to appreciate their problems and in helping to realize their needs.</p>
<p>Consequently, the situation may become quite critical and problematic. Under such circumstances, the stage of adolescence is described as the ‚Äúperiod of storm and stress‚Äù of life. Their turbulent feeling and emotions in mind may naturally create storm and stress. If the teachers and parents do not have sympathetic understanding and appreciation of their problems, in that case, the storm and stress of the adolescents are very likely to affect every section of people in the society.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we have affair knowledge and conception of their possible psycho-physical changes and take effective steps for realization of their needs, in that case, we may not have the reason to describe it as storm and stress of life. It is therefore necessary to consider their needs and their possible situations from proper perspective. If their needs and requirements are effectively understood and sympathetically considered, in that case many of their possible problems can be averted. Storm and stress may only be created if we have complete indifference to and lack of understanding and appreciation of their basic needs. So, it is the negative attitude of the parents and the elders that make the situation quite hostile to them and create storm and stress in their life.</p>
<p>So, instead of describing the stage of adolescence as storm and stress or a dangerous period if life, Rousseau, a philosopher has rightly described it as the most formative period of one‚Äôs life.</p>
<p>The stage of adolescence is undoubtedly very significant form the educational and the psychological point of view. It is in this stage that colorful changes in all directions-physical, mental, emotional and social take place and thereby makes the boys and girls quite sensitive and restless. Changes in all the directions, naturally give rise to certain psycho-physical needs never experienced before. If these needs could not be effectively realized in the environment, may give rise to certain psychological problems to the adolescents. So it is evident that the teachers and the parents should have first hand knowledge and experience of the various psycho-physical changes and their respective needs in dealing with them.</p>
<p>Physio-chemical changes taking place at the stage of adolescence have their far reaching effect on the later psycho- physical development of the boys and girls. With the onset of puberty, they have their sudden experience of menstruation and seminal emission for which they were not prepared. Such changes have their relative effect on the adolescent‚Äôs body and mind. They bring about necessary physical and structural changes in the body. Although due to inadequate and insufficient knowledge, they often fail to adjust themselves with the environment. As such, excessive and unusual fear, shame, hesitation and anxiety may give rise to emotional tension and maladjustment. Many of the adolescent boys and girls are also liable to mental diseases and abnormalities resulting from sexual changes at this stage.</p>
<p>Adolescence can be considered as the crossroads of one‚Äôs life. The psycho-physical and the bio-chemical changes of this stage are making the adolescent boys and girls typically masculine and feminine in their outlook, attitude and behavior. They are more self conscious about their physical changes and development. The sense of masculinity and femininity of the boys and girls bring about necessary changes in their behavior, thought, feeling and activity to distinguish them as men and women. So it is the stage of adolescence which experiences qualitative as well as quantitative changes in the body.</p>
<p>Importance is also laid on the stage of adolescence based on the interests of the young boys and girls. Their interests vary from personal, social, recreational, vocational and sexual interests.</p>
<p>Thus we can lay great importance upon the stage of adolescence as it is basically the bridge between early childhood and adulthood stage of life. Hence, among the various stages of life, it is quite evitable that the adolescence is the most important period.</p>

<p>Squeeze, James taylor, Jackson Browne, and Rick Astley are what I grew up listening to. In the late 90‚Äôs indie rock bands, such as Self and Failure, became more of an interest for me. Those bands inspired me to become a musician. I picked up guitar at about age 13 and started a band with my brother, Zac, who at the time was learning to play drums. We would sit in our room and cover anything from Weezer to Incubus to Sum 41 songs. We eventually began writing our own songs and after a couple of years our band was searching for a lead singer. Zac and I had just recently met Hayley at school and we found out that she had an outstanding voice. So, we asked her to join and she did. When we needed a bass player, Hayley suggested that we call her friend, Jeremy, that she'd been in a band with before. She said he could play anything on the bass and that he had a really cool feel for music. We thought that he might add a really cool sound to our music and so he came to my house and practiced with us. Even though he looked completely different from the rest of us at the time, we loved how well he sounded with us. He joined the band that day, and that's how our band began.This is told by josh Farro</p>
