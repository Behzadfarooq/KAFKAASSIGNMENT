<p><i>please re read original article, it has been updated with a lot of new material as of august 11th</i></p>
<p>This is a renomination due to the unusual outcome of the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Arab_hacker_649a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Arab hacker">first VFD vote</a>. The basis for the original nomination was non-notability. There were 7 Delete votes, plus 3 Merge votes (all of which recommended different pages to which to merge). The presiding admin discarded some of these votes on the grounds of lack of seniority, which apparently upset someone enough to open <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Tony_Sidaway_4a42.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Tony Sidaway">an RFC</a>. So, let's try this again and see if we can reach a consensus this time. My own vote is <b>delete</b>. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> (<a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFirebug_6151.html" title="User talk:Firebug">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Firebug_2eb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Firebug">contribs</a>) 12:41, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
<ul>
<li><s>Keep</s>. <i>Changed vote; see below</i>; I closed the last VfD, which was inconclusive because most of those voting were too new at the time (this may not be the case if the same people voted again now). The reason for discarding votes was not "lack of seniority" but (mostly) extreme newness--we tend to ignore votes from extremely new voters because of the possibility of sock puppetry.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I wasn't doing this in order to attack your original decision; I just wanted to see if consensus could be reached this time.

<li>Well, I still don't have seniority, so this may as well be the last time I do this. I have read the article again, it has been re-written, and the re-write is interesting. However, none of the links show that the group the re-written article puports to exist actually exists. The first three links<a href="http://mauna.org/tiki/faq.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://mauna.org/tiki/faq.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://forum.regierigby.co.uk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://forum.regierigby.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.rubbersideup.com/forum/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rubbersideup.com/forum/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> are links to defaced pages, on which we see that hackers who claim to be Arabic have had their way with someone's server. However, these three links do not prove the existence of the Arab Hacker group, but merely prove the existence of hackers who claim to be Arabic. There have already been several cases of hackers who claimed to be Chinese or Arabs or what-have-you turning out to be thirteen-year-old script-kiddies, so this literally means nothing. The fourth link<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/printthis/2000/0,4814,53940,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.computerworld.com/printthis/2000/0,4814,53940,00.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> is to an article which mentions the FBI is on the lookout for Arab hackers. It does not proport that this group, the Arab Hackers group, exists. Instead, it mentions other groups in specific in the text of the article, and gives an un-cited list-box that has, as one of it's entries, "Arab Hax0rs." It can be argued that this is one and the same with Arab Hackers, but without a citation on the list-box, it is unclear as to where the list originated from. As such, the article seems to me to be poorly cited, offers no real proof that the group named "Arab Hackers" the article covers actually exists, and gets a <b>Delete</b> vote from me. <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 15:02, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I *have* cleaned up VfD articles I think are worth the effort of saving from the axe. I've done it twice already. But, this isn't an article I think is worth saving. I can find no evidence that convinces me that there is a group of hackers called "Arab Hackers," and the evidence given in the articles does not convince me of their existence, either. However, if you think it's worth spending the time, feel free to clean it up yourself. =) <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 21:32, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. As the last "keep" vote on this I will just point out that my reasoning for holding out on this group's notability is that it is a yahoo group with 7000+ people <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/arab_hacker/" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/arab_hacker/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, this link was included in the latest revision of the article, which seems to point to further evidence in its links. <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUber_nemo_c380.html" title="User:Uber nemo"><font color="black">→ubεr nεmo</font><font color="#3399FF">→</font></a> <a href="../../../u/b/e/User_talk%7EUber_nemo_e4f4.html" title="User talk:Uber nemo"><sup><font color="#EEEEEE">lóquï</font></sup></a> 04:29, August 11, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Comment</i> The links the article points to alledge that the FBI is trying to catch them. Somehow, I think the FBI would not be trying to catch them if their members had a Yahoo group, given that the FBI has the right to simply subpoena IP's and e-mail addy's to track the members down. This seems EXTREMELY unlikely - and is more likely just a group of wannabes. If they really were who the FBI was looking for, it seems to me they'd already be caught and jailed. The existence of the Yahoo group called "Arab Hackers" only proves the existence of a yahoo group called "Arab Hackers" - it does not prove that the Yahoo group and the alledged international criminal conspiracy/hackers group are in any way related. <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 21:19, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Comment</i> Unfortuantely, that doesn't mean anything. <a href="http://www.zone-h.org/en/defacements/filter/filter_defacer=George+Bush/" class="external free" title="http://www.zone-h.org/en/defacements/filter/filter_defacer=George+Bush/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zone-h.org/en/defacements/filter/filter_defacer=George+Bush/</a> Looks like the President's been naughty, too.&#160;;) The key is not <i>"Can I find defacement by people who call themselves Arab Hackers and claim to be on a Jihad,"</i> the key is <i>"can I find something OTHER than what could be done by a twelve-year-old who might think it was cool to call himself an Arab Hacker on a Jihad?"</i> For example, a US Government site that lists the group as being one that's sought after for extradition/interrogation/arrest. <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 22:52, 14 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Comment</i> I would like to know what kind of evidence would prove this? There is no way more definitive evidence could be produced unless you want some sort of a video. "a day in the life of Arab Hacker". Maybe some satellite footage. I say that adequate evidence has been provided. there are literally hundreds of pages with the "fuck U.S.A. and israel" message so obviously, unless its a mere coincedence, they are connected. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuraisam_da37.html" title="User:Samuraisam">Samuraisam</a> 04:19, 15 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Comment</i> As I said above: <i>For example, a US Government site that lists the group as being one that's sought after for extradition/interrogation/arrest.</i> I can find evidence that George Bush is defaming websites on zone-H.org. They only keep track of the names, they have no way of verifying if that really IS an Arab Hacker group or just one kid, or if the president is really vandalizing web-pages. Yes, I acknowledge that it's not unreasonable to presume what you're suggesting. However, we're <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">not allowed to presume things when we write articles.</a> If we're going to assert that a secret hacker group exists, we have to offer solid proof it exists that can't be explained as just one kid with a computer. <a href="../../../x/a/a/User%7EXaa_c878.html" title="User:Xaa">Xaa</a> 04:53, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
