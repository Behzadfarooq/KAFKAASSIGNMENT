<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is not a directory. I live in Alabama and I have actually been to the Patton Creek Shopping Center. There's nothing that sets it apart from the shopping centers in Birmingham, Alabama, much less shopping centers in general. The only reason someone would be looking for information on this place would be to find a restaurant or movie times. It's a brand new place. It hasn't had time to have any significant impact on the community or the State of Alabama to warrant inclusion in an enyclopedia. If it had been the site of riots and protests or an infamous killing spree by disgruntled store clerks--- that would be different. All that happens there is that people buy books, clothes and gifts and then eat out afterwards. Nice place, but I assure you it is not notable. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 21:10, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I see two references in the article. One is from the local chamber-of-commerce about one of its members (and thus not independent) the other is about the mall's "architectural concrete masonry" from the Alabama trade organization that the company that did the masonry work belongs to. So even if the article were to be rewritten about the architectural concrete masonry of this particular mall (and I really cannot see that), it still wouldn't have two independent sources. Moreover, this is just a normal mall with the normal stores functioning in a normal way, so there's nothing particularly notable about it. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 00:38, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. One argument against the claim that all malls are the same is the vigorous competition between real estate developers for the combination of attributes that will bring in tenants and shoppers, which means that mals try hard to differentiate themselves from their competitors, and the fact that malls sometimes go out of business (see <a href="http://www.deadmalls.com" class="external free" title="http://www.deadmalls.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.deadmalls.com</a> for more). So here are some questions that I would ask about any mall. Is it a transit hub, with a bus terminal part of the mall, or is it hostile to transit users? Do the mall's security personnel have a reputation for bullying or racism? Have their been documented incidents of these behaviors? What is crime like in and around the mall? Was there a controversy about building the mall, perhaps because the land was originally zoned for other purposes? Have the mall's owners made substantial contributions to local politicians? Many of these questions can only be answered with access to the local newspaper's archives, which makes it difficult to put together an article from thousands of kilometers away. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 07:39, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> And restaurants try hard to differentiate themselves from their competitors. Heck so do gas stations.

<li><b>Comment</b> As I don't believe in rampant deletion of articles and that there should be a good reason for an articles deletion, I agree that the perhaps obscure location might hinder the locating of independant sources (at least on the internet) that might indicate the uniqueness of the mall. It might be an idea to ask users from the Alabama area (such as the original creator of the article, <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucs2004_7ff0.html" title="User:Bucs2004">User:Bucs2004</a>) if they could shed some light on some local sources. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinmeister_cfe3.html" title="User:Justinmeister">Justinmeister</a> 21:37, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>As Requested:</b> I don't believe in the rampant deletion of articles, but I don't believe in having articles that don't meet Wikipedia's criteria, either. I promise, promise, promise you that the local sources in Alabama do not treat Patton Creek Shopping Center any differently from any other mall in the Birmingham area. In fact there are a handful of identical malls that were built in the Birmingham area recently, including Patton Creek, and they're regular, everyday, ordinary malls. It's just not a big deal, escpecially now that it's built. It's a nice place, just like a lot of other nice places.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a very notable project. The shopping center is part of a major revitalization of the area which includes a number of shopping areas, restaurants and public areas. The center required major reworking of surrounding highways, including the first "flyover" in the area, which was named the <i>Birmingham Business Journal's</i> New Construction Project of the Year. <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/birmingham/stories/2003/03/10/focus5.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bizjournals.com/birmingham/stories/2003/03/10/focus5.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Patton Creek exists in the shadow of the Galleria, Alabama's <i>top non-paying tourist attraction</i>, bringing in 14 million people a year. The construction also raised issues relating to the government's right to imminent domain when private land was taken to built highway on/off ramps. This article should be rewritten to note its notability, not deleted because it is poorly written. -- <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="Brush Script MT" color="#0000FF" size="4">AuburnPilot</font></a><a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><sup><small>talk</small></sup></a> <small>17:33, 4 November 2006 <sub>(<a href="../../../u/t/c/UTC_9234.html" title="UTC">UTC</a>)</sub></small>

<li><b>Comment</b> As an attorney in Alabama who has actually been to the Patton Creek Shopping Center I can tell you that the events surrounding the construction of this place, including the legal history, were <i>(YAAAWWWWN)</i> uninteresting and ultimately unnotable. The thing that's notable is the <a href="../../../r/i/v/Riverchase_Galleria_7326.html" title="Riverchase Galleria">Riverchase Galleria</a>, and Patton Creek is <b>just one of many</b> shopping centers that have been built in the area. The "flyover" is marked as the "Galleria" when you use the exit off of the highway (not "Patton Creek"). It is, as you say, merely <i>in the shadow</i> of the Galleria. It is, as you say, merely <i>part of</i> an economic expansion. Being the next-door neighbor to the Galleria is not an assertion of notability. The <i>Birmingham Business Journal</i> is a minor publication that exists primarily as a propaganda tool for major business interests in the area. There's no hard-hitting neutral journalism to be found there, and besides that your argument would suggest that every year a new article should appear in Wikipedia depending on which new construction is the best thing currently happening in Birmingham, Alabama. Patton Creek belongs in a directory, not an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 19:12, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And in reply to your statement: My belief is that material that is verifiable and does not contain any NPOV violations should have a place on Wikipedia. Using other people's reports (notability) is a way to try to achieve some assurance of that, but it seems like it's just a shortcut for Wikipedians doing the fact-checking themselves, and that when it is easy to do then they should do it. I can understand that when it's a complicated question of law or science which is hard for laymen to understand (which is why there is NOR, to avoid that uncertainty), but I don't really see the application to this particular article, which makes reasonable, referenced assertions about the mission and history of a wiki that has existed and operated for over a year, and which is well-known within its sphere. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 06:46, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Apparently it's a favorite at <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:Wikia" class="extiw" title="wikia:Wikia">Wikia:Wikia</a>, but that doesn't make it notable.

<dd>There are around 2100 articles in Category:People. I do not know how many of these articles would be included in the conservative count - some are, of course, stubs, while others are highly trafficked, linked and/or featured - but I'd say around 4/5 of them, or ~1700. This is not surprising given that the chief part of a community <b>is</b> its people. But why would anyone want to take them out? WikiFur is not Wikipedia - it is intended (in part) as a public directory of members of the furry fandom, and it is used as such by many, who find it convenient to get a summary of facts, accomplishments, and links to further information. We do encourage users to develop public articles about themselves if they are in the fandom, because in this case much of the information that would normally go on user pages <i>is</i> relevant to the topic of the wiki. It is often the topic that new users have the most knowledge about to hand, so they can make a quick contribution, plus it gets them used to having their writing edited. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 21:42, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, I'm just saying as far as measuring WikiFur's notability by article number isn't accurate because most of those articles are written about people who, frankly, don't matter in a global encyclopedic sense any more than I do. So, number of articles probably shouldn't be used to offset the low google results, since the articles are not at all about significant people. Like, it's not like these are essential articles to be knowledgeable about the furry fandom, and many are autobiographical. This is compared to ED (might as well get that out of the way), which, while not a good article candidate in itself in my opinion, has information about famous internet people that you just can't find anywhere else, thus making it a more notable source of its purpose in comparison to WikiFur. I think the very low traffic kind of speaks for itself. I'm sorry, I'm trying really hard not to like insult your wiki and am not expressing myself well and probably insulting it anyway, but I'm doing my best here. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiltopia_1488.html" title="User:Miltopia">Miltopia</a> 22:59, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's fine, but the only person who's brought up measuring notability by article number (twice) is you. We all know anyone can make a wiki with lots of articles, usually by <a href="http://man-wiki.net/index.php/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://man-wiki.net/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">importing them</a>. The link I pasted above was in reference to editors, as I see community involvement as a big factor in wiki notability. In that sense, I'm not quite sure what you mean by "very low traffic". WikiFur certainly don't get a billion hits a week - more like 120,000 - but then the furry fandom does not have a billion people in it. We're happy with our figures, as they make for a high-traffic site within its domain (especially considering we're not giving out porn&#160;:-). I would argue that this, plus the ability to verify the facts in the article from the given references (which I don't think anyone has disputed), is sufficient reason to keep it.<br />
ED is a discussion apart from this AfD. While I agree with Wikipedia's link policy, I think it should probably have an article. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 20:58, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Could you please all let me know how I could make this page not suitable for deletion? could I add references to it for music reviews? This band aren't just another band. They have been signed by a record label (bad sneakers records), but only in August. Would it be permisable to include neutral online reviews as part of the page to eradicate this problem? The most notible review of the band is to be published on 22 November in the NME magazine.

<p><b>Nomination</b>: I came across this because it was in the category of pages needing their neutrality checked. My evaluation is that the page appeared to be biased because it is a personal essay (albeit a short, formatted, and wikified one), which violates Section 1.3.3 of the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> policy. Furthermore, I have concerns that the essay is violating the "It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source" provision of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, although the article may not be presenting a synthesis of the arguments advanced in the two books listed as "sources" and may instead simply be a case of presenting unchanged arguments from the books without attributing them correctly. Nonetheless, I think this entry is an essay and on that ground alone ought to be deleted. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 01:05, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article has been created approximately 12 different times, and deleted each time. The earliest delete seems to have been in April. The article appears to me to be autobiographical, as the author at one point signed his name "HINES" on a talk page - however, I have asked him if he is Brad Hines, and he has neither confirmed nor denied it. The links the author gives do not seem to support notabilty. (He was quoted in one line of a story in USA Today, but the article was not about him. The other links are, I believe, mainly about the industry he is in rather than the person himself). An independent search also has not turned up anything notable about this person, and it's my belief that he is therefore not notable.

That article in the USA Today was written in the first place because Brad Hines suggested it. You can call up Jon Schwartz the editor at the USA Today and verify this.</p>
<p>The other thing to consider is the fact that as time goes on this entry will only become more valid as Mr. Hines gains credibility (although he is already noteworthy per his age, accomplisments, and press credits that back these up). I blanked the page to start over as I had screwed up my HTML. Also please note I am new to wikipedia.</p>
<p>Please check the entries for both <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Zuckerberg_9e76.html" title="Mark Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Parsons_432c.html" title="Bob Parsons">Bob Parsons</a>. Anyone can see both these entries are very similar. There is little information on the domain industry on wikipedia. It's people like me that will build this and change it, please help me work together with you folks to make it solid information.</p>
<p>What does it matter if Googling "Brad Hines entreprenuer" turns in little results. That's ridiculous. Try Googling "Brad Hines Domains" A QUARTER MILLION come up.</p>

<dd>Ok, I'll take your word on that - but a friend of Brad Hines is only marginally better. The argument that the person "will be notable eventually" is made pretty often. However, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a crystal ball</a>, it reports those people who are currently notable - not those who think they will be.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Mark Zuckerberg and Bob Parsons work in the same industry as Brad Hines, but that does not make <b>him</b> notable. I work in the same industry as Antonin Scalia and Eliot Spitzer - but am nonetheless non-notable.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>(added paragraph:) About the Google hits. I only get about 250. I haven't studied them, but it looks like at least half are about someone else (someone at Lockheed). So 125 hits isn't a lot - I probably have about 50 pages with my name on them, and I'm not actively promoting a business and starting websites that include my name. (end of added paragraph).</dd>

<p>Here is the thing though, the analogy about Zuckerberg or Parsons had nothing to do with industry, I could have chosen Dan Galambous instead for example. It was about the magnitude. All Three are Presidents of their company. Niether zuckerberg nor parsons have donanted an Art club to a university either. In fact, based on what you have told me, zuckerberg's entry ought to be removed. It seems to mostly dicuss his personal life.</p>

<dd>At the risk of selective quoting (which I don't mean to do), Utzchips and I have been continuing a conversation on his talk page (which is not strictly the right way to go about it, but I wanted to feel him out on this issue a bit without clogging up the AfD). Here are a few things I've learned:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Brad Hines is about to start managing a rap artist.</li>
<li>Hines has an apparently self-published book about how you can get rich buying and selling cars. www.autoprofitz.com.</li>
<li>Hines has donated to an art museum.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>None of those things necessarily militates one way or the other, and I encourage you to read the full talk page for context if you're interested. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 04:06, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hines donated A virtual museum, not to a museum. He currently manages lenny P and is a rapper himself (montrealbrad.com).

<p>Argh. Now we've got two apparently brand new users with no user pages or discussion pages arguing to keep within 10 minutes of each other.

<li><b>Keep</b>, among domainers, Brad Hines is really well known, even if he's not universally famous. I think the press he's gotten verifies this. '"BradHines" domains' gets 264 hits. I remember when the old rule was "if it matters to 1000 people, its notable for wikipedia." Consdering the ever-growing size of the domain community and the attendence of the conventions these days, I think that Brad Hines surely meets this threshold, especially as the President of Yum Domains. <a href="../../../i/v/y/User%7EIvymike21_1400.html" title="User:Ivymike21">Ivymike21</a> 03:05, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Okay then. I should really go create an article about my crush. She's popular, so I'm quite sure at least 1000 of the people at my school would care. Do you honestly think that means she is notable enough for an article? And as for your 264 google hits, that at LEAST picks up every single Brad Hines mentioned on the Internet. And I can imagine the search terms not being in quotes, this giving you results from every page that mentions ANYONE with first name Brad along with ANYONE with last name Hines. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">babble</a></sup> 03:28, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I usually hate it when, when someone voices an opinion against the majority, people start asking "why are you voting that way?" (Because that's their opinion...) But I'm going to break my own rule to pose a question - if someone who was in Hurricane Katrina is quoted on the front page of USA Today commenting on the hurricane, are <b>they</b> therefore notable? Similarly, if a little-league team wins the Little League World Series, and one of its players is quoted in the New York Times, is that little-leaguer notable? I'm just not sure that saying that "a quote is enough" wouldn't open up the gates to anyone and everyone - there are hundreds of news stories every day, and most of them quote at least a person or two. Or is there something about this particular quote that makes you think it is different/sufficient? I'm in no way saying that your position is "wrong" - only that I'm not sure I understand it yet. (Oh, and I don't think JChap meant offense by reformatting your comment - he was just trying to make it easier to read.)

<dd>Re: your examples -- is the Katrina victim's job to be a professional hurricane victim? Is it the Little Leaguer's profession to be a Little League player? A quote is enough in this context since it is directly from the man's profession and area of expertise. I took no offense at being reformatted, but made mention to discourage others from doing the same. I think bolding the lead word puts too much emphasis on it as if a vote, rather than a brief summary of my discussion points. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 03:23, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm. Those are fair points. But then the requirement is that the person is quoted for saying something in connection with his job and expertise? What about an attorney that is asked to comment on a murder case? It's clearly his job to be a lawyer and know the law, but he could just be some yahoo attorney the reporter happened to know. Would the comment in an article make him notable, if he'd not otherwise ever done anything notable? (I'm taking you down this road, because it's suddenly looking like <b>I</b> might be notable.&#160;:-P) If so, what is he notable <b>for</b>? He's not a notable lawyer, so he could only be notable as "that guy that said that thing that day."

<dd>There is another genre that is being more widely used to refer to this type of music, and under a broader range of sub-genres than just Goth/Industrial. It is called <a href="http://www.myspace.com/sepiachord" class="external text" title="http://www.myspace.com/sepiachord" rel="nofollow">Sepiachord</a>. The only reason I have not created a stub, or even mentioned it on wikipedia at all as of yet, is because it is approximately two months old. Even though it is quickly being recognized as a reputable term by various performers creating old world inspired music. So if this new genre which isn't quite validated yet doesn't have an article, I see no reason why a solo artist who has made up a new spin on a previous genre has any notability. Btw - if you look at the user who created the Victoriandustrial page, it is Batteredrose. A reference to a website hosting EA's lyrics. This is obviously a fan made page to try and sell EA's music to others.

Unless third-party sources document his notable achievements while president, I cannot deem this person as notable enough to justify an encyclopedic article about him.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 17:55, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> That's your POV. I think alot of people think that being the president of a prestigious college (actually 2 in this case) is a notablie acheivement in itself (the NY Times thought so) and easily worthy of an encyclopedic article. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 19:06, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The two colleges listed are fairly notable, and the president of them seems notable to me, as well. I agree with the comments of the above two votes. However, I think the article could use some clean-up; he's not notable for the skunk-killing adventures of his dogs. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 21:44, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The NYTimes article is one source for notability. The college newspapers are reliable sources for the article, but not for a claim of notability, because college newspapers always cover the seniormost administrators from time to time. Having only one independent coverage is not sufficient to establish notability to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standards. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 19:17, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I do not see what it is that makes this article blatant advertising. Some of the facts aren't verified through the sources (like reasons for Ad-Up surviving the dot-com bust), but they can be either verified or removed. The last AFD got deletion based on the nom, "Article asserts notability but has had an unreferenced tag since August 2006. I can find no sources to backup the claim. Smells like linkspam." Without being look at the previous version of the page, I can't tell wether this is similar content to the deleted page; but considering there's a few sources that give it mention in the online advertising world, I'm guessing this version is different than its predecessor. I'm leaning toward keep unless someone proves me otherwise. —<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> <sub><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitaphane_f38a.html" title="User talk:Mitaphane">talk</a></sub> 05:30, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've looked at the previous version. It's the same set of references, from the same editor (Chez37 (<a href="../../../c/h/e/User_talk%7EChez37_677b.html" title="User talk:Chez37">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chez37_6cfb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chez37">contribs</a>)). However the in the previous AFD discussion <i>not a single editor</i> who wanted the article deleted actually addressed the references and gave an explanation of how they didn't demonstrate that WP:CORP was satisfied. So personally, I'm inclined not to speedily delete this as a re-creation but to let this discussion run, in the hope that this time around <i>editors will look at the cited works and discuss them, applying the criteria</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:04, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>All of these statements are not applicable. None of the articles are based on press releases. Press release based articles all have similar text, usually with no noted author, and appear in multiple sources all around the same time. None of that is the case with any of these references. The referenced articles all came out at different times, over a span of several years, and are each independantly written with a byline attributed to different authors. Each article is on a different aspect of the industry and noted facts about Ad-Up which are relevant to this article. The Wall Street Journal and Entrepreneur Magazine are NOT trivial publications in any way, and as noted above, NASE Magazine, though not as well known, is multi-page glossy four-color printed publication with a circulation in the hundreds of thousands and is not published by Ad-Up nor is it advertising from the company.

<li>The fact that self-admitted a deletionists, with a pre-biased attitude against any stub article that isn't yet fully fleshed out is proof of nothing except that their stuborn opinion continues to be plastered on worthy and important articles. None of that opinion is relevant to the real facts of this issue. Deletionists -- please apply your attitude where it's really needed, on that list of articles below, all of which have no references whatsoever! Or if you are so inclined, find the relevant research and improve on this article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article still reads like advertising or a business directory entry; to my mind this is an independent ground for deletion, whether or not sources exist: the article still needs to be rewritten from scratch. The quality of the sources seem highly debatable; two are general puff pieces about banner advertising, in which a member of this firm was one of several similarly situated people interviewed. The third seems to be an entry in a directory of online advertising businesses that specifically does not meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 16:46, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Again, The Wall Street Journal and Entrepreneur Magazine are NOT trivial publications. That is NOT debateable. The articles are not solely about Ad-Up, so of course other companies and their executives are often quoted within such articles. The subjective opinion label "puff pieces" is also not acurrate, nor revelant -- the point of the cited references is to back up statements in the article, and they clearly do. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Chez37 (<a href="../../../c/h/e/User_talk%7EChez37_677b.html" title="User talk:Chez37">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chez37_6cfb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chez37">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<dd>NOTE to closing admin &amp; Moondyne who if he was really interested in exposing annonymity would reveal his/her real name and connections with the Internet Advertising &amp; SEO industry. Clearly this user has a bias against Ad-Up for no reason other than it must be a competitor of some company he/she has an interest in. Anyway, what's the difference if I sometimes I take the time to log in as chez37 (my ID) and someimes I don't bother because for a quick entry or edit its not worth the hassle so the ID shows up as my IP address -- surely the powers that be can tell it's the same IP and my account so I'm obviously not trying to hide that fact. And why should it matter when I first logged in under any given IP address. This has absolutely ZERO relevance whatsover to the legitimacy of this article. Get a clue folks. Get on the really truly important issues and real spam, not articles with 8 legitimate citations. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Chez37 (<a href="../../../c/h/e/User_talk%7EChez37_677b.html" title="User talk:Chez37">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chez37_6cfb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chez37">contribs</a>) 15:03, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>Chez37, for the record I have no involvement in either Ad-Up or any of its competitors or the SEO industry. I had never even heard of the SEO industry until about 2 weeks ago and certainly had never heard of Ad-Up. Rather than make accusations of foul play, you would do well to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> when a number of other editors give reasons that this article does not meet the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">notability criteria</a> for Wikipedia. No-one is suggesting the company does not exist - that issue is not being discussed here. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia and must set parameters as to what is relevant content. Hundreds (possibly thousands) of articles get deleted every day for these very reasons. I've had several of my own deleted so I understand that you may be upset. My advice is to chill out and have a read of some Wikipedia policies and essays like <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_be_a_fanatic_0d59.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't be a fanatic">Wikipedia:Don't be a fanatic</a>. I was going to ask you to declare your own association with Ad-Up but that would be rude and none of my business. —&#160;<a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoondyne_51fd.html" title="User talk:Moondyne">Moondyne</a> 02:06, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When people have a blatent, even self-admitted bias against any new, small stub article, or just make lame comments "this reads like an ad" which is purely subjective, unsubstaniated, biased opinion and has absolutely nothing to do with the bottom line, which is this: <b>according to <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">criteria</a> the article need only be the 'subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself' to be admitted.</b> I've already clearly explained that all three (that's multiple) cited publications are legitimate, non-trivial and that they are obviously not from press releases (since the articles are each about several different companies, and each article is about different aspects of the industry, each article is from a different author, and came out at very different times over a period of years. Nor is their source Ad-Up. Quoting an executive of the company within those references doesn't mean the source of the article is the company -- people are quoted all the time by periodical authors who have done their own research. The sources (Wall Street Journal, Entrepreneur Magazine, and NASE Magazine all are hard-copy published magazines with circulations above 6 figures, and all have currently active online accessible versions for easy verification. Since several Wikipedians had previously questioned some of the facts, such as the company's start date and corporate status, citations have also being included which reference very well known and respected industry indicies, such as Alexa, ClickZ, Yahoo, and the California Secretary of State. A total of 8 relevant, legitimate and independant sources have been cited for this Ad-Up article, while numerous other articles for other companies in the same industry with NO REFERENCES at all (see the list above) have been admitted and unquestioned for quite a long time, so clearly there is some BAD FAITH going on with the delete-happy attack here -- it is not assumed, it is obvious. 61.7.156.244 21:22, 6 November 2006 (UTC) (Chez37)
<dl>
<dd>Bad faith? Look, I think we need to all take a clear look at the article again so we can GET ON THE SAME PAGE.</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>The Alexa link is worth zero. It shows that the site has been around a while. That does not make it notable. That is "Works carrying merely trivial coverage".</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> requires the valid articles are listed in industry indicies. Alexa is exactly such an industry indici. You'll note that many new companies, as well as old companies with no current activity are not listed. Therefore, Alexa is a useful, valid, a respectable guide. 61.7.156.24 23:21, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Ditto for Archive.org. What is this supposed to show? That it survived since 1996? That is "Works carrying merely trivial coverage".</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>this is one of 8 references, which ad to the overall coverage showing that the company was established very early in the pioneering days of web advertising (which is in itself notable) and yet has also survived this entire time. Name 10 other web ad companies that can match that description. There are VERY few. 61.7.156.24 23:21, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Ditto for State of California. Why did you even include these? The question is not "has the company been around a while" but , according to WP:CORP, has anyone noted the company AND has the company DONE anything worth noting.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>These citations are included, again, because "industry indicies" are a requirement of WP;CORP -- read it -- it is useful, good info. The State of California is probably the single most reliable and trustworthy source cited. It further establishes that not only was the company started back in July of 1996, but also that it is a California C-Corporation -- NOT a trival LLC, or some small DBA, it is an established, governmentally recognized corporate entity. That alone doesn't make it notable, but it does make it non-trivial. 61.7.156.24 23:21, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>With ClickZ, again -- read the actual cite. All it's saying is <b>the exact same thing as the Ad-Up Media Kit</b> . The media kit is available <a href="http://www.ad-up.com/new/Ad-Up_MediaKit_19990331.pdf|here" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ad-up.com/new/Ad-Up_MediaKit_19990331.pdf|here" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Odd, the titles and gist of what the media kit says matchs ClickZ pretty closely. As stated above, the ClickZ cite is hardly more than a press release.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>All this proves is that ClickZ did good research and verified that the company's services matched what the company indeed offers -- this shows honesty on the part of both parties, not a press release. Note that ClickZ does not provide a phone number or email, or even a contact name -- all things one would expect from a press release quote. But anyway, this citation is provided only to show that Ad-Up had evolved at a point before the Internet crash (1999) in a multi-service agency, rather than a simple banner ad network -- and that, even if it did come from a press release is notable, because it is clearly what made that company survive. This is history folks. Don't deny it. Read it. Understand it. Learn from it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> says the company must be <b>the subject</b> of multiple non trivial work <i>whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself</i>. Now, the Economist cite, is rather flimsy in that regard. But I'll let it slide, even though it does nothing but quote him, and site some figures. We'll say that is a source. Importantly -- the article is from 1998. EIGHT YEARS AGO. I'll come back to that point in a minute.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Clearly you are not alert nor paying attention at all. There is no 'economist cite' -- perhaps you are too busy reading some different entry while poping oxycotins and writing nonsense.61.7.156.24 23:21, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The WSJ is the infamous furnature quotation. I think people are being unfair on this one. It is actually a good cite, in my opinion. However, it's from 2000.</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Please read the entire cited article. It is not about furniture. You kids are missing the whole point. Internet and eBusiness history is built by radical companies that start in strange and different ways. The models of how their businesses succeded are extremely important to the future. If you can only see the furniture in that article, you my poor friend, need to learn to read braile.61.7.156.24 23:21, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My main point, now, is that <b>all</b> of these articles are six to eight years old, before the collapse of the big 'internet' bubble in toto. There is nothing recent. The company hasn't gotten any coverage over what it's done, over it's partnerships, over opening any new markets, or for new technology. Reading the article, one can't see WHY it's notable. Saying 'it is notable because the cites are relevant' is disinginuous becuase they <i>aren't</i>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To answer your question: <b>Ad-Up is notable because of at least four reasons: 1) Ad-Up started very early in the web ad business 2) Ad-Up developed its own propreitary AdServer (at a time when Doubleclick was likely it's only competitor) 3) They evolved in advance of the Internet bubble by expanding their services 4) They have survived over 10 years and continue to operate in the present day despite litterally thousands of other similar companies having come and gone.</b>61.7.156.24 23:21, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>What you need is 3 things. You need at least one source from independant media saying something the company has done, and you need to add cites and sources about what they've done. The article claims that the company has bought up and absorbed several other companies -- cites for those?</p>
<dl>

<li><b>Keep</b> Article has been updated so that the citations to the references make their relevance clear. People need to respect these references and stop deleting them, because then others complain there aren't enough references. None of the referenced articles are from press releases; they all came out at different times, over a span of several years, and indeed all of the articles refer to multiple other companies because their topics relate to industry issues, unlike a press release which would be solely about just the one company. If there's any remaining issues, please read the entire references *fully* again -- Ad-Up is mentioned several times in each article, and none of them are about 'funriture'. Keep in mind that any company listed in Wiki is going to appear like an ad, especially if the company offers marketing services. However, given the number of references cited in this article compared to the list of other wiki company articles above that each have NO REFERENCES WHATSOEVER, its seems their deletioist efforts are better focused on those entries, and leave this demonstrably well-researched article in place as it should be. Wiki delete happy folks, please... move on -- there are plenty of other articles much more deserving of your attention (start with the list just above). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Chez37 (<a href="../../../c/h/e/User_talk%7EChez37_677b.html" title="User talk:Chez37">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chez37_6cfb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chez37">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<dd>1. The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself.</dd>
<dd>2. The company or corporation is listed on ranking indices of important companies produced by well-known and independent publications</dd>
<dd>3. The company's or corporation's share price is used to calculate stock market indices. Being used to calculate an index that simply comprises the entire market is excluded.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The sources cited make it look like the company might satisfy #1. However, reading the articles it becomes clear that the company is not "the subject" of any articles in notable publications. For example, in the USAToday article, the only mention of the company comes when the company's founder is cited. Apart from that, the article does not discuss Yum Domains at all. As for the other criteria, I could find no ranking produced by <i>any</i> publisher listing Yum Domains, nor can I find any refernce to its shares being used to calculate a major stock index (I'm not even talking about the DOW here, I'm talking about <i>any</i> major index). Hence, my proposal for deletion based on non-notability. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 14:53, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

We started growing so fast that it got out of our hands. We were eventually brought to justice by our University and had to serve probation. Since then we do not throw parties and are pretty much gone except with this website. We tried to take a new direction by getting rid of the frat but keeping the website to have something to share with everyone. Now any reference to Sigma Epsilon Chi is only parody.

<p>This is a weird one. If we allow a page on Wikipedia called List of Google Bombs with clickable links to the bombs in question, each Wikipedian clicking those links actually strengthens the bomb if they go to the link (which parses the bomb title to google) and clicks on the first link they see. This is the same sort of problem (although clearly to a lesser extent) as if we were to allow "list of clickable links that try to exploit your browser", by the very technical nature of the article, it poses a problem. Secondly, this Wikipedia article would be essentially adding to it's own notability by directly influencing the phenomenon on which it commentates; consider a page with a simple hit counter on it that Wikipedia links to in an article called "This Page Receives a Lot of Hits", the same technical theory applies in that the existence of the article makes it more true. I added subst:prod to this page and it was seconded, the author of the page essentially told me to go away and leave it alone, removing the tags, which while not against any policy shows a poor dismissive understanding of someone else's point of view. I believe this page is not catered for in existing policies but all the same, it's not an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElomis_0932.html" title="User:Elomis">Elomis</a> 03:37, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Unless I'm missing some <a href="../../../j/a/v/JavaScript_6861.html" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a> trickery, there is no "effect worsening" because Google has no way to tell that you clicked the top link, only that you searched for the "bombed" term. --<a href="../../../d/g/i/User%7EDgies_d44c.html" title="User:Dgies">Dgies</a> 05:17, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> That's part of the way Google works, (there's more to it than that but) people who search for a term and click on a result 'strengthen' that result, results that are ignored are probably not 'good' search results so they are demoted. When Wikipedians click links in List of Google Bombs they are, whether they realise or not, searching for that term through Google. Subsequently clicking the results strengthens the link and exacerbates the Google bomb. <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElomis_0932.html" title="User:Elomis">Elomis</a> 06:00, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, to clarify between Dgies and Klomis, Google returns a small fraction of its results pages with the links embedded in Google links, e.g. <a href="http://www.google.com/blahblah/www.example.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/blahblah/www.example.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/blahblah/www.example.com/</a>.

<p>Article about a non-notable person. Prod was removed from article by anonymous editor without comment. Only possible claim to notability is a book published by a vanity press by the name of PublishAmerica (see <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A25187-2005Jan20" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A25187-2005Jan20" rel="nofollow">Washington Post article</a>). Current Amazon sales rank into 7 digits. Google search for '"gentleman of leisure" +neiwert' gets just 44 hits, none of which appears to be a review of the book.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Does not pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">notability criteria for an individual</a>. I won't list all the criteria since it is clear that Neiwert is not an athlete, politician, artist (ie. sculptor, painter etc.), participant i na major event, actor/tv personality, or an honeree on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. This pretty much limits us to the following two criteria:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1. The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.</dd>
<dd>2. The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I cannot find any (let alone multiple) non-trivial works for which Neiwert was the "<i>primary subject</i>". Nor could I find any source suggesting Neiwert has made a widely recognized contribution to his field (whatever that may be). As always, if someone can provide sources demonstrating the individual satisfies either of the above two criteria, I will rethink my suggestion. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 15:04, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In his defense...</p>
<p>Although it is true that anyone can post a blog on a site such as Myspace.com, not everyone can be in their top ten rankings, which is based on total amount of unique hit's per day. If Neiwert's blog registered number one, which it has, and been confirmed to be, then he's got more popularity, meanstream popularity, than most people who are "notable bloggers." Each day on MYSPACE over 600,000 blogs are posted , on average. Neiwert consistantly makes the top 10 every time he writes something. Top 10 in blogs, out of 600,000. That's pretty notable. He has done numerous radio shows as a guest to talk about not only his book, but his blog.</p>
<p>Also, he is known more for his blog, than he is his book. But he is a published author, so that's why that notation was put in his description. That can be taken out if it has to be, but it is what it is! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Yoshikwan (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yoshikwan_88b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yoshikwan">contribs</a>) 22:25, November 2, 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li><b>keep</b> We feel this entry should be kept. The history section provides a unique insight into the 90 yr old history a school - the first type of school, in terms of it's architecture, in the country. It also provides a good refernce point for those people wishing to research about teaching with technologies and who reuire information about 'up to date' ICT within schools. Links are made with a famous UK Footballer too. The entry is quite comparable to many other school's entries. The text also demonstrates high quality original research, which local study museums will find of interest. The fact that the school is a 'kindergarten' school makes it even more worthy for inclusion - schools educating smaller children have just as much status as those catering for older students. For these reasons the entry is very worthy and credible and not any different from entries from other schools.Rippleinfants

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm a fan of the Freespace games, but I just can't figure out why I would want to look this up in an encyclopedia (as opposed to a gaming wiki). Granted, it isn't really that much worse than, say, a list of Pokemon by name. However, consider that it's a list of fictional ships which aren't individually notable outside of the very narrow game context.

<p>I've tried to mark this for a speedy (first for being a test page, secondly for no assertion of notability), which has resulted in a scattershot series of claims turning up to assert notability. Google's never heard of the gentleman in relation to his film/TV credits, which is perhaps unsurprising since he was 11 at the time of Home Alone 2 coming out and I can only recall the one cute child star. I should also add that I checked IMDB as well as doing a standard Google. What Google <i>does</i> throw up, though, is a personal homepage which is under construction and not much else, which makes the descent claims more than just a little iffy, and likewise the "promising scientist" claim. In terms of the medal he apparently received, I couldn't find any evidence of that either, but I'd almost have to wonder whether that's sufficient notability given the number of people who've been honoured for their roles in the aftermath of 9/11. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 06:41, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>That's <i>much</i> more like it.

<li>No, but remember Ontario's road system is very different. There are very few actual provincial highways in Ontario considering its size. There are however a sizable number of county roads or regional roads, which this falls under. Many of them are just if not more notable than your average tertiary highway in New Brunswick. -- <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> - <a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarl_Andrew_5969.html" title="User talk:Earl Andrew">talk</a> 03:31, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - While it might not be necessary a notable route right now, it will definitely be in the upcoming years due to the rapid growth of Orleans and Cumberland. If the article is deleted it will likely be re-created in a year or two as major development is planned in the area of Trim Road and will be an equally important commuter route then neighborhing Tenth Line Road and the route will likely be equally notable then Innes Road the main E-W commuter route (besides the 174) in Orleans.

<li>Actually, there's more information from secondary sources to be had than just the 1 sentence. From the cited articles we can source the fact that a competition was run to pick names for the buses, the fact that originally at least two alternatives were considered to using names of famous people, the 18 specific names that were added in April 2004, and the 19 specific names that were added in September 2005. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:03, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> – I make no dispute with your facts, but what's the value of that information? Just because there's information out there doesn't mean it's remotely appropriate for an encyclopædia. Those sources could be given as further reading from the main article, and besides, there's no reason why the mention which goes in the main article should only be one sentence as you seem to be concerned about. It could be several, but it should not, in my opinion, be a reproduction of the list which I stress is available on the bus company website. – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 18:25, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You came close to answering your own question. The value of that particular information that I mentioned is context and detail, of course. It's more informative for the reader to know the history than just (to quote the article) "Since 1999 many of the buses have had the name of a famous person commemorated on the front.". Otherwise we might as well have articles like "Bill Clinton was President of the United States. There was a scandal.". Note that we are not discussing the article at hand (and I didn't say above that we were), but your assertion above that "the fact that the practice happens is quite enough information". It isn't enough information. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:52, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> – There is indeed a wider point at issue here. But to compare the <i>importance</i> or <i>usefulness</i> of the bus-naming policy of the Brighton and Hove Bus Company with the Presidency of Bill Clinton is not a realistic comparison. And (to discuss the article at hand) it is enough information for us here when the other (detail) information is available in the sources for people who want to dig. On the whole, Wikipedia doesn't feature sources copied out verbatim, but rather précis of those sources for the benefit of readers who want to retrieve the information efficiently. – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 19:02, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's a very realistic and pointed comparison. What you are missing is that your evaluation of the "importance or usefulness" of the information being discussed here is entirely subjective. I can imagine that there are people in Brighton and Hove for whom the scandal related to Bill Clinton is wholly unimportant and useless information that has no impact upon their lives, but to whom knowledge about the way that the local bus company names its buses is important and useful. (Read the very first sentence of the very first article that I cited, for example.) And the issue that we are discussing is not the copying out of primary sources (which I've not actually disagreed with you about and which is a perfectly good point). I explicitly wrote "secondary sources" above, and pointed out that there is material to be had from those secondary sources beyond "the fact that the practice happens", just as there is information to be had from secondary sources beyond the fact that "there was scandal". It turns out that it is about 3 paragraphs' worth. ☺ <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:45, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>We'll have to agree to differ (although I think we're somewhat talking about different things.) I defend my subjectivity though. The content of Wikipedia should be objective.

<li><b>Keep</b> - the article is poorly-written at present, but that's grounds for improvement, not deletion.

<li><b>Counter-comments</b> (in answer to Demiurge's comments):
<ul>
<li>For one thing, since the Ofcom report is about a different topic (competition in the radio market), it is telling that some companies of mere hardware get mentionned at all. And for another thing, it's about the weight of the source: when Ofcom says those three companies are the main suppliers of transmission equipment, it provides a great authoritativeness to the information, regardless of the main topic of the document. IMO, this claim in a governmental document, that Alice is one of the main players, shows as much notability as three dedicated puff pieces in industry magazines. It's about the spirit of the notability criterion, not the letter: a non-notable, local company simply doesn't get mentionned as one of the three main players in an Ofcom document, whatever the main topic of said document.</li>
<li>Another point about the "Ofcom criterion" would be: would accepting it open a Pandora box of hundreds of small companies being justified too? No: the Ofcom report mentions only three names. And those three companies Ofcom list as main players on this market, why wouldn't they be documented in Wikipedia? How can this market and domain and topic be covered on Wikipedia, if even the top 3 players named by the authoritative Ofcom aren't allowed on Wikipedia?</li>
<li>"Catalogue entries and sales brochures" may not be admissible for their content itself (commercial hype), but they can still provide good hints, since we're not just talking about an abstract company but also its products and its sales. For instance, if a company's products can be found all over the world in all catalogues from resellers, then it does provide another sign of notability: a non-notable, local company's products just aren't sold and found everywhere.</li>
<li>The other items aren't convincing by themselves, sure, but such accumulation of different sources help show there's something there, at least for casting a reasonable doubt against just immediately killing the article without further investigation. (If there's only a handful of highly specialized industry magazines, for a relatively very small readership, finding dedicated articles online is illusory, it'd require a professional to lookup specialized databases in his library.)</li>

<p>The result was <b>keep, possibly merge pending discussion</b>. Despite the numbers&#160;!voting delete, I don't think I've ignored consensus closing this AfD the way I have. Around the 5th/6th November the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_probability&amp;oldid=85240673" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_probability&amp;oldid=85240673" rel="nofollow">original research essay</a> was removed, and replaced with the beginnings of an encyclopedic article. Many of the earlier&#160;!votes were based on the OR essay which no longer exists. There appears to be agreement that this is a subject worthy of an entry in an encyclopedia, and the article may need to be reduced to a stub and built up again with the content from <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_probability_temp_50ad.html" title="Philosophy of probability/temp">Philosophy of probability/temp</a>, or merged into <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_mathematics.html" title="Philosophy of mathematics">Philosophy of mathematics</a> or elsewhere.

<li>How could you say so firmly that is original research? Could you say what research is about? What is its subject? And what are the obtained theoretical results? It is in fact just an expanded definition of "philosophy of probability". The philosophical concepts can not be presented just like the mathematical ones - simply stated and in a standard manner. Any definition or presentation would look like an essay. I could give you all the bibliography for finding all ideas of the article in works of classics. It is nothing original there. --infarom

<li><b>Delete</b> but <b>userfy</b> at User:Infarom for the time being. I think that an article on the philosophy of probability (the meaning of statements cast in terms of probabilities, the epistemology of probability) is a valid subject. This reads too much like an essay for main encyclopedia space <i>for the time being</i>, but the author says that he has a bibliography he's prepared to add.

<li><b>Comment</b> This page was created by a new user, User:Infarom, and then listed for deletion a scant five hours later.

There seems to be general agreement that the subject of the page is a valid topic, so what is at issue then is the current content. I don't see any attempt to push a point here even if the initial creation contained original research by Infarom. Neither deletion nor userfying seems to me to be warranted—this can all be handled by the normal article development process.

<p>I've not participated before in a deletion process, however I have experienced the 'deletion' event. Is it a simple majority vote? If we take 'userfy' as stronger than delete and allow that comment content overrides a 'delete' vote (meaning, the vote is dependent upon changes being made to the page), then the count (at the time of the time-stamp of this comment) is 7 deletes and 6 nots. Who mediates the controversy? This suggestion (<a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_probability_temp_50ad.html" title="Philosophy of probability/temp">Philosophy of probability/temp</a>) by <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> would be a very good starting article. <a href="../../../j/m/s/User%7EJMSwtlk_8dfb.html" title="User:JMSwtlk">jmswtlk</a> 16:06, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are a bunch of administrators who close AFD discussions. Sometimes they get closed early, if the article is shown to meet a <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a> or a <a href="../../../c/s/k/WP%7ECSK_91ce.html" title="WP:CSK">criteria for speedy keeping</a>, or the outcome just becomes totally obvious.</dd>
<dd>AFD is <i>not</i> a vote, although it sometimes gets treated as one. AFD is meant to be a discussion to <i>measure consensus</i> as to whether an article adheres to our policies and guidelines, or could be cleaned up to do so, or if instead it is unsalvagable and needs to be deleted. If everything was running on time, the clear closes would happen on the sixth day after the AFD discussion began, so November 8 in this case. AFD closure is a process that is normally backlogged, and it isn't unusual for the discussion to run a few days extra. This article is definitely evolving to be better.</dd>
<dd>Both the temp page and the current draft of the article have their points; they ought to be combined. I'd now say that this is far from being original research. It does need further work, but so does almost every article here. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 19:51, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Note to administrators - The /temp page could be altered with content from the main page and be of value. Comments related to 'original research' may have applied to the initial contents; they cannot apply to the concept or its importance. Adding to my remark from above, I've noticed that 'wiki' now doesn't seem to allow time for evolution. No page, that I know of, manifested itself with 1 edit for which there was never a change. I can see jumping on vandalism. Why jump on someone proposing a topic even if the approach seems self-serving initially? By the way, when something is deleted, are the contents gone or are they still accessible in some log? <a href="../../../j/m/s/User%7EJMSwtlk_8dfb.html" title="User:JMSwtlk">jmswtlk</a> 21:07, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Nikil Parekh looks at first glance to be notable, what with the many awards and 120,000 Google hits. However, looking through the many links from the page, it's noticeable that they are all to paid-for groups, blogs, the poet's own website, vanity presses and so forth. In other words, though a strenuous and successful self-promoter, there are no sources meeting <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> that substantiate the poet's notability. The record book mentioned is run by Coca-Cola in India as a promotional gimmick and does not check the "world records" it prints. Equally, it is noticeable that the poet's website lists his Wikipedia article as an achievement. Taken together with the article creator's work on Only as Life (also up for deletion), and his contributions to other articles and debate, I think there is some evidence of a walled garden being created. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 12:28, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Strong Keep of this great article on Nikhil Parekh</b>- I really dont understand what's all this debate about Nikhil Parekh. People here who are trying to remove him from Wiki, are downright jealous , nothing else. Parekh, conforms with all WIKI guidelines, and he is indeed India's most famous poet. The Limca Book of Records is ranked only 2nd to Guinness Book. How can you say that its a mockery or something illegitimate. Its the biggest record book of its kind in India representing more than 1 billion Indians across the world. Parekh has entered it twice in a year. His other records are truly international. For instance, his awards at Preditors and Editors, Poemhunter, the EPPIE award which again is the highest honor given to ebooks today, are all noteworthy and to International standards. I think we must divert our energies to other people here at Wiki, rather than get after Parekh, after all what he's achieved. Wiki is not a ramification of enviousness for a particular person or in this case a notable poet. And how many times should I reiterate that I'm not Parekh, this is really outrageous and invokes some action against those who are saying so. I'm just doing my best to create and edit wiki pages, as per wiki standards. My aim is not to promote Parekh, but to ensure that the best stays here at Wiki. Before you comment please research. Atleast research Limca Book of Records in India, and you would find that its the biggest record book of its kind in India and only 2nd to guinness book in the World. And again as I'm iterating above, all of Parekh's other international awards and acclaim are truly prestigious. He's published in the Commonwealth Magazine, now would you call that a gimmick too. This is really outrageous and a downright mockery, an envious interpretation of a world famous poet, simply to tarnish his image here. I would implore Wiki people themselves to carry out extensive researches on Parekh before thinking of removing this wonderful wiki article on him. After all the success that he's attained has really done India proud and so the world. There's no point deliberating about his awards and acclaim, as research would show that its truly noteworthy. I feel its a situation as absurd as this, that next people would start challenging the credibility of the Booker or Pulitzer prize and then say that those who've won it are self promoting themselves , and should be removed from Wikipedia. Truly and irately preposterous. Coolkeg908 13:19, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Supporting my argument</b>-Well quite untrue. I have also edited sections on Poets, Poems, adding vital informations to other poetry communities, international poetry groups on the Internet. And, yes, I agree that my contributions have been mostly pertaining to Parekh. But what's wrong with that. I am a great reader of all his works and have researched several of his works thoroughly. I also see several several other wiki editors like me here, who have worked on a particular individual/person, as their research base on that person is almost picture perfect. In my case, I can say that about Parekh. Since I have studied thousands of pages on him over the Internet and elsewhere. I have studied him in national news, periodicals, websites, groups and have followed his poetic creations worldwide. Thus am emphatic to list his name at places here and contribute the most authentic information about him. So what's wrong in that. Which Wiki rule specifies that you cannot singularly contribute about a person. Or, as according to you, that if you do indeed contribute singularly about a specific person, then you yourself are that person. Its preposterous and absurd. Stop this babyish enviousness and concentrate upon the context of your debate. Wiki is not guided by personal enviousnesses or kidplay's of removing or keeping an article. It goes on articulately assembled facts and figures. May they be provided by anyone on earth, it doesnt matter. Facts and figures if they are legitimate and noteworthy, then Wiki would place them, irrespective of whatever bias people might have to this issue. And in Parekh's case, as I've also said above, the facts rule. His awards and international acclaim, his other records and stuff are simply incredible. Do thorough research Jim before you come to conclusions , come up with logical (not emotional arguments) to support your clauses and then suggest deletion . Best to you. I hate the prospect of this becoming a personally quagmired warfield here, rather than basing its judgements upon legitimate facts and figures concerning the poet.

<li><b>Supporting my argument for Limca Book of Records India, which lists Parekh as a World Record Holder</b>- Jim you mention above, or rather make a mockery of Limca Book of Records India which is run on the patronage of Coca-Cola India. I just felt like putting my points forward regards this. Each country, most of the developed countries have their own book of records. India is almost the world's largest population. It has a more than a billion indians. Limca Book of Records is the only book after the Guinness Book of World Records in the world, in official world rankings. For a verification of this, please do various searches and research on Limca Book and you will know. It represents the pride and honor of more than a billion Indians. It documents all its records very scrupulously and verifies each of them to excruciating limits of detail and authenticity, just like guinness book of world records. I have known many other book of records like Singapore Book of Records documenting records by people of Singapore, then there's a Malaysian book of records documentiing records by people of Malaysia. But out of all them countrywise, the Limca Book of Records India is the only of its kind next to Guinness, as its been in operations since the last 17 yrs in India. The longest standing record book to Guinness Book in the World. All other record books of other countries are just a thing of recent past, maximum 4 to 5 yrs in existence. Limca Book of Records India is available from all major online outlets and across the World. A close look at its contents, spanning nearly more than 500 pages in each of its annual edition, would reveal that it goes to great depths to authenticate all its records and record holders and gives them record breakers certificates just like Guinness Book does. How can you say that it doesnt verify its world records. For that matter you'd say that every other record book , including Guinness, just lists its records without verifying them. Now this is really absurd. There's no record book born like that. They are all authentic in their own respects, representing their countries and bringing out the best of their countrymen , record breaking feats, chronicled in a book. Parekh is listed twice in Limca Book of Records . His website shows his National Certificate of Honor for his records with the Book. These are great honors from a great record book, that he's achieved for his poetry. Limca Book of World Records, Record holders regularly appear on all television programmes, media, all across the world, just like Guinness Book. Such is the significance of this book in which Parekh has been listed for two records in the space of 1 year. Next time, before you propound forward an argument or make a mockery of a world class organization such as Limca book of records, please come up with accurate facts and figures, otherwise such is considered unethical emotionalism. I agree, that the Limca Book of Records article here at Wiki is a stub, I have myself tried and expanded it . And am still working on the same, with my research on various things . Best, I'd propose, you buy a copy of the Limca Book of Records from any reputed store on the Internet, such as ebay, or amazon or the likes. Once you have the physical edition in your hands, and have seen the facts figures documented, the painstaking depths to which they've been researched just like Guinness, then please lay your suggestions here. I already have the physical edition of the book with me and am therefore speaking my opinions of the same, after witnessing more than 10000 records covering multitudinal spectrums of arts/culture and human achievement by more than 10000 record holders across India and of Indian origin. The very fact that Nikhil Parekh is listed twice in the Limca book of records, is a matter of great honor for the world. More specifically, both his records in the book, if you closely observed are for very prestigious categories. One for receiving and writing the most number of letters to World Leaders and Organizations and the other for being India's only Eppie award winner. Both International caliber records in an equally adept Record book of Indian origin, functioning as the largest of its kind in the country, since last 17 yrs.

<li>For the life of me, I cannot see any sources or things in his bio which are self publicizing. They are all facts assembled together to form a wiki sketch on him. Facts, just like assembled in several thousand other wiki articles of encyclopedic level. So what's wrong in highlighting the facts. And each wiki article for that matter appears a bit self publicizing, as it portrays the achievement of notable people/organizations and things. Its a strong keep, not weak delete.

<li><b>Opinion</b>-Well when a person is famous, and when you google search him or search on him on virtually any search engine, virtually lacs of results come up. I have known poets better than Parekh, who have earned accolades and when searched upon in search engines, they yield lacs of results. So what, if Parekh yields lacs of results when searched. Thats thanks to his accolades. I've never seen anyone put in, what you call extra effort to make more search engine results. If you're well spread, in this case as his poems are published at countless websites, its ostensible that the search results would be mind boggling. Nothing wrong with that. Doesnt prove that he's self promoting. There are thousands of writers inferior/superior to him, who yield better results in search. That doesnt imply that they self promote or are bogus. Just that their work is well spread and well recognized, well affiliated and networked globally, that's why the mind boggling number of search results. Its perfectly OK. As far providing resources and authentication to all his awards a simple click to his website would pacify all queries. All certificates, original documentation and everything to the minutest of detail is listed here at his site, in the awards section of it. Also there are countless other places on the internet where the same can be verified in their original forms. Mind you, even the biggest names out there in the industry, who're writers/poets and creative writers of all kinds self promote, so in the first case there's nothing wrong with that. And, if there are lacs of search results to your name, that doesnt necessarily imply that you self promote. It is just that you are well networked/affiliated and published across the globe in countless magazines and websites, that they show up. The more famous an individual, the more are the search results on him. So what's odd. Why be envious or bring the emotional quotient again. There's no need to compare if Parekh has more search results to his name than his other contemporaries, or lesser than them. That's not the issue. Issue is verification and meeting WIKI standards. And research yields on Parekh, all that is said in his bio. Coolkeg908 18:15, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Opinion on your downright rudeness</b>-Who gave you the right to call me a promotion department. I am just a fellow wiki editor like you here , authenticating information and leading to the most trusted sources to articles. Its downright rude and contemptuous of you to call me promotion department. I am just here and doing my best I can to authenticate information and provide as much editing as possible to the article, improving it and leading to the best sources of verification. If you have a comment to leave you are most welcome, or for that matter a counter argument. But this is no way of answering back and labeling someone as lower than you. We’re all equal rights here as wiki editors. Please don’t denigrate your fellow people who are also and equally trying their best to do their job. I hope you get my point. So lets stick to the credibility of this article and its verifications. And for verification of all of Parekh’s records and achievements his website as well countless other sources on the Internet can be looked upon . At a click verifications can be yielded. Those who say, things cannot be verified are being lacking information and not taking the pains to verify and research further. Anyways, please curb now from any name calling or rudeness. Thanks.

<li><b>Opinion Poetry Books</b>-His poetry books are not even mentioned in his biography. There is just an external link to them. Most poets, even the award winning ones here at Wiki self publish. And no, they are not vanity presses where he's published. Those places if you investigate and research further are major print on demand digitial marketplaces. The author doesnt pay a penny to publish. Its all technology oriented and making latest use of technology. Also this is only his list of publishers who've published him in book form. If you see the magazines and websites of the world that have published him, individually for his poems--then you'd come to know that there are names like the Commonwealth Magazine involved which are the best in the world today. Research, research and more research before basing your opinions. There's no point getting after someone without details, facts and figures. I iterate again. Books are just a part of his biography. There are several other aspects to it as well, like winning the EPPIE award for best poetry which is one of the most prestigious awards in the world today awarded to ebooks. Then he's there in the Limca Book of Records, refer to my discussion to that above. He's also featured in the top 10 rankings of Preditors and Editors readers poll, again a very prestigious readers poll in the world, which is also listed at Wiki. There's just too much to this poet as far as credibility is concerned and doesnt make a strong candidature for delete. Coolkeg908 07:36, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Sigh. Despite the inevitable tirade that this will unleash, I am sorry to have to bring new information to the table. I have this morning received an email from Vijaya Ghose, editor of the <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limca_Book_of_Records_5f83.html" title="Limca Book of Records">Limca Book of Records</a>. "Dear Mr (----),</li>
</ul>
<p><i>We have enlisted a couple of claims of Nikhil Parekh. Longest Poem is not one of them. He has formidable competition in John Milton's Paradise Lost and our own Mahabharata. However, he has written to many heads of state and has received replies but not from the head of state but the secretary or executive assistant. He is is the first from India to feature on Eppie. We checked with them. Regards Vijaya Ghose.</i> So Parekh, though probably not notable as a poet, is indeed an Indian world record holder. I suspect that this changes the balance on his notability, though the article would still require a great deal of clear-up. I will notify everyone who took part in this vote and ask admins to extend debate a little. Sorry. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 05:57, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Reaffirming weak delete</b>. Without evidence that the Eppie award decision was substantially <i>to him</i> or based on <i>his</i> contribution to the compilation, I too see no notability as a poet. I don't think "first X ethnicity to in any way contribute to Y thing" is a point of more global renown. Which leaves the corresponding-with-leaders record. It's an interesting acchievement, but still fairly limited how truly notable that acchievement is in terms of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for the person. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 06:48, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete or Revise to subsume all trivial categories into general headings</b> (per Arvedui's suggestion). This list is meaningless, since hundreds of extremely trivial words can fit into this category. For example non-human is on the list.

<dd>If the list is kept and revised, I think that the whole "depending on context" section should go; it's just as trivial (Sung-if sung) and doesn't really say much about the words themselves.<a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 06:56, 1 November 2006 (UTC) revised <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 05:38, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>no. the "depending on context" section is good. in that context, they are then autological, they are valid examples. but i dont really see how "non-human" qualifies as a discription of a word. thats like saying "gill-less" is a description of a human. so then non-human also cannot be selfdescriptive. "Maybe limit to those for which the opposite could conceivably be true for a word", suggested by Lecontejohn should do, since only that is effectively discriptive--<a href="../../../l/y/g/User%7ELygophile_b1b0.html" title="User:Lygophile">Lygophile</a> 14:37, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Non-human is currently an actual word on the list, as is inanimate. If you wanted to exclude the infinite trivial examples of that sort, that might make the list more interesting, but it would be hard to justify that, since they do conform to the definition of autological, despite being utterly trivial.<a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 18:02, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I strongly disagree with the suggestion that the list as it stands is composed mainly of trivial examples, or that it will inevitably come to be dominated by them, despite the fact that virtually infinite trivial examples may exist. If you're concerned about the latter happening, then it would be enough to add a single-line entry to cover something like "all negative adjectives, such as non-purple, etc..." or perhaps add a short intro suggesting that people try to keep the entries "interesting". Currently the list is a concise, useful, effective and perfectly harmless demonstration of an obscure linguistic phenomenon, which is composed of far more interesting examples than not, and I think killing the article to save it from potential triviality is like killing a patient to save him from possibly catching the flu. --Arvedui 01:09, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>It's not that anything has changed; the problem with the earlier nomination is that it was nominated by someone who voted keep; therefore the case for deletion was never made to begin with. For what it's worth, I thought this was a useful list as well, until I realized how trivial the category <b>autological</b> was (basically all negative descriptions are autological, for a start). That is what I see as the important point, and it wasn't brought up at all in the previous discussion. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 20:48, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>With respect, you may be giving the act of nomination too much credit here... While the first nomination was made pre-emptively, it still resulted in a virtually unanimous vote to Keep, and I doubt it was the lack of a preamble calling the list pointless and trivial that determined that outcome--indeed many of the reasons people have voted Delete in this round were explicitly refuted in the last (listcruft, pointlessness, no-search, etc). Again, I grant that there are many trivial examples to be found, but it's easy enough (trivial, even!) to include them in general terms so as not to bog down the list as a whole while keeping the interesting part available for those who might want it. While this round of voting looks to me like No Concensus leaning towards Delete, I'm disappointed by how little weight is being given to the really overwhelming Keep vote granted earlier to what is essentially the identical list. --Arvedui 01:09, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, you may have a point about including them in general terms. That might actually be a good way to solve it. I'll change me vote. (Let just add, though, that it's not only negatives that are trivial. Practically the whole "depending on contexts" is, as well.) If you take out all the trivial examples, there isn't much left of the list... <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudahH_796f.html" title="User:JudahH">JudahH</a> 05:38, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>definite Keep</b>, though probably it needs to be revised or mover to the wiktionaries apendices (as sugested when it was nominated for deletion before). its either an examples list, or a wiktionary thing. on the other hand, there are probably much more silly and trivial lists on wikipedia. and the risk of triviality on this page is no arguement, as that doesnt make the artical itself less desirable or encyclopedic.--<a href="../../../l/y/g/User%7ELygophile_b1b0.html" title="User:Lygophile">Lygophile</a> 14:23, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I wasn't suggesting that you were the subject, but rather that the subject does not meet the criteria for <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">notability.</a> There are thousands of professionals who do good work, but to include them all is to turn Wikipedia into a directory.

Tengwarian 21:06, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Appears the tack has now changed from suggesting it is a vanity article created by subject, to now not being appropriately notable. Any chance you know this type designer? I Agree there are, thanks to software like Fontographer, countless numbers of people who could produce a technically functioning type. Those people do not recieve places on the American Institute of Graphic Arts' website. The subject's work is clearly acessible by links. <a href="../../../g/e/a/User%7EGearedBull_b9c5.html" title="User:GearedBull">CApitol3</a> 04:09, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please assume good faith here. My use of the phrase "vanity page" is consistent with its definition <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_page.html#Notability_and_saliency" title="Vanity page">here,</a> and was not a personal attack. I do not know him (her?) personally, perhaps you do? Such accomplished contemporary American font designers as David Berlow, Cyrus Highsmith, and Sumner Stone have not merited Wikipedia entries, let alone Robert Hunter Middleton, Bruce Rogers, or Chauncey Griffith. And yes, I can go ahead and create these pages. But I still cannot see the significance of distinguishing this person over these others. With respect, I don't believe that a single award given by a trade organization to thousands of designers annually meets the standard for notability. At this point I think it's best that we leave this decision for the editors, since the Wikipedia docs state that there is "no consensus regarding notability." Yours respectfully, Tengwarian 07:33, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>An additional apology, GearedBull. I see further down on that page that "the use of the word 'vanity' is discouraged in deletion discussions." Please chalk this up to the awkward elbows of an old academic - I did not mean to offend! Tengwarian 07:42, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>O, no harm done, but I'm disappointed that you continue to suggest I might know the subject. Please assume good faith when I have here twice, once on the article's discussion page, and once on your own discussion page professed I do not know the subject, and that I do not even know the subject's gender (though I would guess male given the ratio of type designers), or where s/he is geographically located (NY is my best guess, though Seattle comes up in some online returns). What I am more familiar with is the subject's <b>work,</b> which is what I based my article upon. Agree there should be a host of other articles: Robert Granjon, a longer bio for Anton Janson, more on Tschichold, and yes, I suppose Cyrus may have achieved more thus far, etc. But I don't see any precedence for thresholds (writing the big guys before the lessers). Wikipedians write about what they are more familiar with. In my own case here typfaces I have seen and worked with. Neil Macmillan's <i>An A-Z of Type Designers</i>, though not giving Ragan a full, separate entry mentions him as a co-creator of several typefaces. I will add that to the refs. The AIGA is not a commercial organization, this isn't an industry publication or award, pardon me if you already know that the AIGA is more akin to the American Institute of Architects than a commercial trade organization like Printing Industries of America, where the organization has a not very oblique reason for citing and awarding professionals: business. best, Jim <a href="../../../g/e/a/User%7EGearedBull_b9c5.html" title="User:GearedBull">CApitol3</a> 14:45, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Although the IaM concept is based on 'orginal' research, what subject isn't? At least at the beginning. Claude Shannon had to start somewhere. The original research for IaM has taken place over 30 years, several continents, many countries and countless companies. It is the result of work by several specialist devotees to the subject of information and has found special favour among all of the original commercial and academic users. I have little doubt that is becoming a key issue to all organisations that are embracing the new philosophies. Due to the nature of the developments and issues of intellectual property rights during the developments (trade marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, etc), little public domain documentation was available until now. This will now change because many who have been exposed to Informational Management want to know its difference from Information Management right from the start, hence Wikipedia. The IaM concept as described is not proprietary. References that include rationales and details for IaM that are public domain include: 'Brain' 1975, and 'The future of life and intelligence' 1986? by Victor Serebriakoff - both available from Amazon.com (I will double check dates and add publishers shortly). I will also refine and add more detail as time permits. Considering the excitement it is causing in enterprise / information architecture environments such as TOGAF and X.25, I would have thought the entry would have created a desire to know more, not a desire to consign it to ignominy... <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProf_7_a23f.html" title="User:Prof 7">Prof 7</a> 13:18, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i><b>Message</b></i> - Currently we do not have a large number of reliable sources online to support our article. As such, we understand your wish to remove this article. If it comes to that, then we would abide by the rules of the Wikipedia administrators. However, when mainstream press reviews of Swamiji's book are available, or more online references from reliable sources show up, I believe that the requirements for notability will be fulfilled; at that time, we may or may not readd an entry on Swami Sai Premananda. Please let me know if this is a suitable solution for all. Thank you for keeping our article on your site thus far. talesh 21:34, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Reviewing the VfD and AfD, all I see is a bunch of keep votes based on ... google hits. No sources. No PROOF that this can actually be done. Loads of hoax pictures. In the VfD the main reason repeated for keep was that this was a 'real, growing article'. It's a stub with a CARTOON drawing of a fantasy act that men want to believe in.

Voting 'clean up' or 'expand' is pointless, since nothing -- <b>nothing</b> -- has been done to do either since the VfD or 1st AfD.

<li><b>weak Keep</b> Ultra-Renaissance art movement and merge the members into it. Then add cite. It is mentioned in an award-winning documentary and is mentioned in a few other places on the web. It is hard to judge where this type of thing stands in history because it looks like they are probably using irony of a sort to make themselves look less than they might be. We need citations and preferably a list of exhibitions. No one asked for the article to be improved before it went for afd, that seems problematic to me.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 13:25, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi! Mike, None of the references provided by you have any information about Ultra-Renaissance art movement. Some of them are about the documentary film <i>The King of Pluto</i>, which according to you <i>mentions</i> the movement. Since you've provided some references about <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Wrathell_f693.html" title="Mike Wrathell">Mike Wrathell</a>, I've removed from the list of articles nominated for deletion for now. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 13:06, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>strong Keep</b> <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcel_Duchamp_9a05.html" title="Marcel Duchamp">Marcel Duchamp</a> once said, "Art is whatever the artist says it is." I have provided enough notable references to show that I am a true artist and it is my right as an artist, like Duchamp, to be a member of an art movement. Thus, The Ultra-Renaissance, is also valid by all known standards of art history. Dada, or Dadaism, was created and coined by the artists within the art movement. Likewise is the case for The Ultra-Renaissance. Let me ask you this, you naysayers: are you not tired of not having heard of any new art movements since Pop Art? It has been nearly 50 years since an art movement of note was on the scene. I am trying to help the world by injecting art into the public discourse. I have achieved some notability with my art, as acknowledged, even, by some people here. It seems only fair and logical that my art movement should also be accepted here, much like Linus and his blanket. Can you really separate Linus from his blanket and still have the internationally-known character? Or Schroeder from his piano? The accusation that my entries are mere self-promotion after I supplied references of note seems to be hyperbolic. Art is an important thing, and if I am attempting to bring art more into the public consciousness, I do not find that the act of an ego maniac. I assure you "The Ultra-Renaissance" was mentioned in "the king of pluto," and would be happy to mail Wikipedia a complimentary DVD of the documentary. A work of art I made with the help of fellow Ultra-Renaissance artist Tom Marchione was exhibited at 4 Star Gallery in Indianapolis, IN titled "Ultra-Renaissance Fountain," which is an homage to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcel_Duchamp_9a05.html" title="Marcel Duchamp">Marcel Duchamp</a>. By the way, B. W. C., Roy Zornow, and Tom Marchione are all present on the New York International Independent Film &amp; Video Festival page for "the king of pluto" so I hope that qualifies as a reference of note for them as well as for me and The Ultra-Renaissance itself. I understand that you need to see references and will try in the future to see that more references are generated for Ultra-Renaissance art. However, there are enough to justify keeping this "ring" on your site. The Ultra-Renaissance is a valid, living art movement. I just made a work of art last night with Tom Marchione, in fact. The Ultra-Renaissance is also present in "W, or Strange Things Begin To Happen When A Meteor Crashes In The Arizona Desert" in a scene where I am thrown into a spaceship bound for Pluto. The two cowboys who toss me in the ship at the orders of "W" are wearing Ultra-Renaissance tee shirts with the name of the movement on them as well as an image drawn by myself and Brently Comstock, aka, B. W. C.

<li><b>?</b> I do not know how the issue of seeking notability has come up with a valid contemporary art movement. Are we to assume that all contemporary things are to be deleted since they may wish to obtain notability via WP? It seems like a downright blind acceptance of cynicism. I can appreciate a cynic, and always got a kick out Diogenes saying to Alexander, "Get out of my sunlight!" but I am also mindful of Nietzsche's axiom, "Greatness is being both cynical and innocent." If WP is to be a valid resource, I do not think the deletion of all contemporary references is in WP's best interest. WP's greatness is its very contemporary validity. To delete The Ultra-Renaissance art movement seems to be a step in the wrong direction. Sowff 04:17, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It's unclear that Lynn Coulter is sufficiently notable for a Wikipedia article yet. Furthermore, the article has at various times read like a resume or an advertisement. I have noted the issues on the talk page previously but there still seem to be problems. The primary author may be Lynn Coulter herself, editing via a user name and an IP account. <a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The book has multiple reviews from reliable and independent sources, and is published by a reputable publisher, the University of North Carolina Press. I added the ISBN. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 17:40, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete.</b></s>. The sheer number of reviews cited reads like something you put on the back cover of your book, in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox</a>. This author does not meet Wikipedia's notability criteria. I know too many people who have books through university presses. I wrote a book published by a larger publisher than that, but my bio does not deserve an article in Wikipeida. Also, because the article does not cite sources, it does read somewhat like an ad or the author's personal bio. The author may be totally innocent, but the way it's written comes across as something she, her publicist, or a meatpuppet wrote, not quite as an encyclopedic entry. The book itself might be worthy of a WikiBooks entry, but the author is not. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 17:53, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Change to <b>neutral.</b> Although I still question the notability, I can't see any harm in leaving this stub now that it's not a soapbox. The article may need monitoring.

<li>University presses publish a lot of scholarly books that are important but have limited press runs. Some also publish books for a broader market that they intend to make money on, as is the case here. I mentioned the name of the publisher mostly to show that it isn't a vanity press -- this is a book that both the author and the publisher will be making money on. The reviews themselves are sources, I think. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 18:33, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is still a résumé, although a much longer one than before; it isn't an encyclopedia article.

<li>Many thanks to everyone that's commented pro and con so far. It looks like there are two issues -- notability, then the article itself. Right now there's no consensus yet one way or the other.

<li>"I'm notoriously bad at follow-through on this sort of thing" &lt;-- that sounds so very much like me! I suggest we vote on the article as it is during the AfD, not based on our hopes. If Jeff gets to it during that time, then we can evaluate the article with his edits. Otherwise, we evaluate it as is. That puts Jeff under less pressure. Having said this, my own personal opinion remains that the article article merits deletion on grounds of notability; if that's the case, then not even Jeff can fix it. If, however, the consensus is that Lynn Coulter is notable, then the article is worth preserving as a neutral stub until Jeff recreates it.--<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A.

<dd>Hmm, how far did it get? If it's been sitting there with just a Cleanup or Attention tag on it for five months, it could be argued that editors simply didn't know about it (of course it would also mean that the article is seldom-visited and perhaps shouldn't be around in the first place). It needs a definite plan of action set out, and nobody's sitting down and doing so. Is there a "Wikiproject evolution" or somesuch it could go under where it would get more attention? We could try putting up requests for attention in Talk pages of the articles which link to it. I'm not convinced that deletion is the right course of action in such a situation. Of course, if the alternative's complete inaction, well, I could be persuated. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Sockatume</a> 01:41, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That it has been tagged for five months does not mean much. By the way, have <i>you</i> tried to clean it up?

<dd>If we first accept that you truly believe that the article needs cleanup and not deletion, why over the past 5 months haven't you made attempts towards that?

<dd>To Hackwrench's points- first) I haven't gotten around to cleaning it up, but will do so now that it is on AfD. As to the second, do a google search for the phrase, one gets as some of the top hits <a href="http://www.strongatheism.net/library/atheology/argument_from_evolution/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.strongatheism.net/library/atheology/argument_from_evolution/" rel="nofollow">[59]</a><a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/atheism/evolution.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/atheism/evolution.html" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 07:36, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Except that those seem to be the only top hits that are not clones of the Wikipedia article or spam. It seems that the only reason it is anywhere near the top is because the wikipedia article and clones link to it and several widely linked wikipedia articles link to this article in their "see also". Also, as I noted above, the phrase "argument from evolution" isn't widely used. While Google reports about 4800 pages, you only go to 208 before Google sais that the rest are hidden due to being too similar to the ones already displayed.<a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackwrench_e4dd.html" title="User:Hackwrench">Hackwrench</a> 07:49, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The argument is not about 'evolution' at all, which simply means change - from the Latin verb 'evolare' meaning to change. Even the stupidest of fundamentalists admits that things have changed: society for example and even that change is necessary to 'bring God's plans to fruition.' As far as the natural wortld goes; the question is: by what process has that chagned occurred? One theory is the theory of natural selection as put forward by Darwin and Wallace. This is people usually mean by <i>the theory of evolution</i>. It is not the theory of evolution, but <i>a</i> theory of evolution. There is no reasonable argument against the evidence for change as evidenced by the fossil record. The question is how that change occurred. An enlightened theist might neatly solve the debate by saying that of course God created a wonderful world in which animals could evolve by natural selection. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 150.101.122.132 (<a href="../../../1/5/0/User_talk%7E150.101.122.132.html" title="User talk:150.101.122.132">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_150.101.122.132_22f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/150.101.122.132">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Disputed murder convictions is a well accepted topic. Robert Rivera was very newsworthy when his case was active. The Delaware County Daily Times (circulation 160,000+) featured him on the front page many times and lists over 70 articles about him. The site is backed up by trial transcripts and police reports recorded by government officials. The items involving the law officer mentioned are backed up by the transcripts and reports. No conviction can be disputed unless there is some contention that the prosecution's case is false. Prosecution witnesses cannot sue for libel because someone contests their testimony. There is no libel issue here.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Users are free to contest specifics and rewrite sections they think are unsupported. Something could be wrong, but no one has found any specifics. This article violates the POV of some users who want to censor by deleting any mention that government prosecutors are capable of error. Wikipedia does contain many articles on individuals who were legitimately convicted. I am not aware that they are contested on POV grounds because they fail to cite that prosecutors sometimes make mistakes. Wikipedia should contain accurate facts, not just puff pieces of a world viewed through rose-colored glasses. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanras_e82e.html" title="User:Danras">Danras</a> 19:13, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Danras, I don't believe that Wikipedia is any more biased than the rest of society when it comes to highly controversial cases. It's not that we want to censor opposing viewpoints, it's just that those viewpoints need to be independently documented. The only reference you currently offer is the robertrivera1.com website, which for the most part only presents one POV. If you can add in other references, such as press coverage and opposition writings, this article has a better chance of surviving. Check out <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumia_Abu-Jamal_fb96.html" title="Mumia Abu-Jamal">Mumia Abu-Jamal</a>'s article for an example of the kind of article you want to write. Even though the Abu-Jamal article still has neutrality problems, it is much more well-documented than the current Rivera article. --<span style="border:3px solid #00f;font-weight:bold;background-color:#c00;"><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_cea5.html" title="User:Roninbk"><span style="color:#fff;">RoninBK</span></a><sub><span style="background-color:#fff;"><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_Esperanza_3389.html" title="User:Roninbk/Esperanza"><span style="background-color:#0f0;">E</span></a><a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERoninbk_7cd0.html" title="User talk:Roninbk">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roninbk_59dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roninbk">C</a></span></sub></span> 03:28, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> If the "items involving the law officer mentioned are backed up by the transcripts and reports", then cite them. Official court documents are legitimate sources. But if the court permitted certain evidence and testimony that is in dispute, then the reason and source of the dispute <i>needs</i> to be referenced.

<p>I am puzzled about this one; a long article with references, etc, but I failed to find a <i>single</i> Google, Yahoo, Amazon, etc, hit (except Wikipedia and related sites) about either himself or his books. He is indeed mentioned on the website of the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_Mountaineering_League_d772.html" title="Korean Mountaineering League">Korean Mountaineering League</a> (KML), but the rest of the article does not describe him as particularly notable (or even particularly non-notable sometimes, as in the last paragraph of the lead).

<p>This article is well-written. However, it appears to refer to a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a>, and seems mainly to be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. The term "sequence profiling tool" does not appear in a cursory check through PubMed abstracts, the external links on this page, or Google, with the exception of articles written or co-written by one of the editors who created this page. There does not appear to be other support for the <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notability</a> of this term.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I have indeed never heard the term in bioinformatics; the article seems to be a collection of different tools and topics grouped under a neologism (and the section on microarrays has nothing to do with the rest&#160;!) and as such, I'd be inclined to delete the page. However, it'd be a pity to loose the content, since most of it could be used on a more generic page along the line of "Bioinformatic tools". Could we integrate it somewhere else (I haven't really looked where yet)&#160;? <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchutz_72ef.html" title="User:Schutz">Schutz</a> 23:13, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is a good idea. The <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioinformatics.html" title="Bioinformatics">Bioinformatics</a> article has a <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioinformatics.html#Software_tools" title="Bioinformatics">Software tools</a> section. If this article were renamed and reworked slightly it could be a "main article" for the section, called, say Bioinformatics software tools. I don't think referring to most of these things as "profiling tools" though fits with common usage.

<li><b>Keep</b> honestly, this is silly. "Sequence profiling" is obviously not a neologism, I don't know how adding "tool" would become one - presumably "sequence profiling software" wouldn't sound at all out of the ordinary. No objection to a move to "bioinformatics software" or somesuch though, as that would be a more appropriate title, would be consistent with existing lists of bioinformatics-related software, and would allow more room for expansion. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 01:20, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I think "sequence profiling" is a neologism as well. A quick Google reveals a similar situation--many of the top hits are to either (a) copies of this article or (b) other pages by the author of this article. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrouse_1daf.html" title="User:Grouse">Grouse</a> 08:16, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, the random anons showing up to keep this is a bit strange. Try searching for "sequence profile" and you'll have better luck (though, to be fair, 3D-1D profiles aren't covered in the article, and I agree that BLAST and the like don't really fall into the category - the more common usage refers to alignment techniques). Support a move/expansion/cleanup to Bioinformatics software or similar. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 14:19, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Indeed, "sequence profile" is used widely, but it means something else. In one definition<a href="http://phylogenomics.berkeley.edu/profilealignment/" class="external autonumber" title="http://phylogenomics.berkeley.edu/profilealignment/" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>, sequence profiles are "matrices of real values, representing the probability of amino acids at each position in a corresponding multiple sequence alignment." This has very little to do with what is discussed in this article. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrouse_1daf.html" title="User:Grouse">Grouse</a> 14:38, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I've moved the microarray stuff to its own article, since I was the one who originally added it and I can't for the life of me remember why. (Sequence profiles are not necessarily matrices, by the way; they can be coarser than <a href="../../../p/s/s/PSSM_8fe5.html" title="PSSM">PSSMs</a>. This content is more like "sequence representation" though.) <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 01:55, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>KEEP IT</b>. The concept of sequence profiling is well known and sites like <a href="../../../n/c/b/NCBI_db71.html" title="NCBI">NCBI</a>'s <a href="../../../b/l/a/BLAST_3e0c.html" title="BLAST">BLAST</a> and <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/Multi/blastview" class="external text" title="http://www.ensembl.org/Multi/blastview" rel="nofollow">Ensembl</a> offer very exhaustive services. It is also very evident in sites like <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entrez.html" title="Entrez">Entrez</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioinformatic_Harvester_e342.html" title="Bioinformatic Harvester">Bioinformatic Harvester</a> which compile, process and present <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metadata.html" title="Metadata">metadata</a> in <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioinformatics.html" title="Bioinformatics">Bioinformatics</a>. So while such well known services have existed and the concept known implictly, there has been very little documentation to elaborate on this. I tried to help compile a formal write up that would help readers grasp the concept as well understand the future directions of the field. In fact the field is gradually evolving to new sites/services that accomodate new kinds of data profiling for research scientists. So, while the term and article may look original, the content is well established in literature and known to scientists.</li>

<ul>
<li>Merging the article with any major topics is a good idea but given the length and content it will be too long to be included under ny one particular area. I have a list of possible such topics. Alternatively, splitting the content will also tend dilute the core concept.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. In further discussion on the <a href="../../../s/e/q/Talk%7ESequence_profiling_tool_7f62.html" title="Talk:Sequence profiling tool">Talk:Sequence profiling tool</a>, the author says "You have a point in that the term does not seem to appear in the bioinformatics literature, but is taken implicitly . Also, as you say, the term "profile" is used very loosely to mean different things. So I decided make a start by defining one 'profiling' concept; that of Sequence profiling tools. Some liberties were taken but the core concept holds." This is an admission that the term does not appear in bioinformatics literature, and was created by the author. Furthermore, no one has yet addressed my objection that this page is entirely <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrouse_1daf.html" title="User:Grouse">Grouse</a> 08:16, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Possible merge or rename, but do not delete</b>. Although the title may be an original turn of phrase, the content of this article is not original research. It describes the set of bioinformatics tools used to present sequence data and sequence relationships in informative ways - I'm not aware of a specific term that's consistently always used for the topic, so I feel the title is simply a descriptive phrase (in place of Bioinformatics tools for presentation and analysis of sequence data), rather than a neologism. Perhaps simply <a href="../../../s/e/q/Sequence_analysis.html" title="Sequence analysis">sequence analysis</a>, a stub article, would be a better name for the majority of this content. I am sympathetic to the idea that most of the article deals specifically with representation and analysis ("profiling") of sequence data, a worthy subject of its own article. However, the paragraph on microarray analysis is not related to this sequence profiling theme, and could be merged elsewhere. I will think about this some more, but I strongly feel that because this article deals with a specific, notable topic supported by many high-quality outside references, it should not be deleted as original research. <a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryman_cf3f.html" title="User:Dryman">Dryman</a> 23:29, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../s/e/q/Sequence_analysis.html" title="Sequence analysis">Sequence analysis</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - It seems decent enough to keep. By far not the worst or most unnotable page either. Besides, everything that is now solid scientific belief was once original research right?
