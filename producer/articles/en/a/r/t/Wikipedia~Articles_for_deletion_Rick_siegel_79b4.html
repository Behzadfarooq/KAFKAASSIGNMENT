<li><b>Comment</b> I'm adding this comment on top of page to say that I made some changes on the article and dugg for sources of content that I added to external links. It seems since the video 911 eyewitness got out, several people have been wondering about that guy. IMHO wikipedia should provide information about that guy as it is pretty scarce. <a href="../../../i/z/w/User%7EIzwalito_c762.html" title="User:Izwalito">Izwalito</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> made some edits to the article to try to make it more NPOV and reduce vanity. Not sure how it might affect the AfD (of which I have no opinion at this time). --mtz206 14:47, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Obviously people have a very difficult time being objective about Rick's page. As he is directly associated with the most important event in 50 years of US History, it would be nearsighted to delete his page. The simple act of filming the events of 911 from such a unique vantage point merits inclusion on its own. Bpd1069 16:01, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Since my above comment, the amount of information on the page has been expanded and clearly shows a notable history. I have also read the the page re Deletion of pages. The only possible category this could fall under would be a user page but as this page was not created by Rick himself as stated below, even that category would be a stretch. I believe the problem is Rick's affiliation with the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories, and as such there is a knee jerk reaction to deminish his credibilty. Bpd1069 01:39, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP - Don't Shoot the Messenger</b> Rick is a 9/11 eyewitness and internet webcasting pioneer. When he started videotaping the burning towers he had no idea they were going to freefall at the speed of gravity therefore proving controlled demolition and government treason. After the fact, his testimony and video/DVD are historical evidence that could and should be used in a court of law to bring the real masterminds behind 9/11 to justice. Is this why he and his DVD are being attacked for deletion?

<li><b>Comment</b> - The fact that complicit behavior and obstruction of investigations indicate that top government officials are responsible for 9/11 is not Rick's fault. He is not the one who gave approval to carry out domestic terrorism during US wargame exercise week and implode the first three steel frame structures in history live on television assuming the public would never catch on. Are the concerted efforts to remove an eyewitness to the crime of the century nothing more than desperate attempts to maintain a coverup of the truth?</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think all the edits from anonymous show this has a lot of interest from the world outside of Wikipedia. People do not know your system, neither do we.

It seems accurate enough, although vacant of the breath of the man. I think Izwalito seems to have a reasonable solution that would allow Wiki to bubble up the content and time will determine.

<dd>about a) I'm trying to contribute in that way but as I said earlier I know nothing about the guy, and am certainly not the most qualified for this job</dd>
<dd>about b) actually that's how I ended up here. While doing research for working on <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> I found an article signed by rick siegel about <i>agents efforting on wikipedia to silence the most provocative and authoritative documentary yet released</i>.&#160;::: Obviously the guy has no clue about what is wikipedia and how wikipedia works, but IMHO that doesn't make him a phony guy or a bad fellow, and I know very well how wikipedian can react in a stubborn closed-minded way, especially in case like this when one unhappy individual makes bad publicity to wikipedia and use wrong means to try to get what he wants. My guess is this is a typical case of <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">newcomers being bitten</a>, it is difficult to cope with a whole community when you are a single individual or a bunch of individuals. Now I would like to see people **hint**apologize**hint** for their wrongdoing and start working together, not against each other.</dd>
