<p>Non notable? It's only the largest dark-side telecommunications enthusiast community in Australia. That forum is a forum, but the people under there are a real community. I'm not even from there, and I know that. Beleive it or not, there are telecommunications outside of the United States. Just because you don't know about something doesn't make it non-notable. Being from Canada, myself, I've actually had contact with those folks on quite a few occasions.</p>

<dd>Considering I don't come from the US, I am quite aware that there are telecoms outside of that country, thank you. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowells_4fc9.html" title="User:Chowells">chowells</a> 09:14, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>tim makes an extremely valid point, just because you dont know about it doesn't make it non-noteable, If you had any clue then you'd know the differences (or moreso advances between australia and america's telephone companies) these advances making phreaking 'harder' and the fact that Ausphreak is bringing in a large group of people is a more then enough reason to have it mentioned, its that even through the difficulty people manage to find a way showing to people that where there is a will theres a way, this ausphreak article is somewhat inspiring and it would be a great loss seeing it go.</p>

People are constantly seeking the history of our boards, and there is no where else, to my knowledge, that is it documented, So what better place than Wikipedia? The place where most people go to find the information of which they seek? Just because the acts detailed and the information contained within ausphreak's community is albeit "shady" does that mean the people should not be able to access informaion about who they are, what they have done etc?</p>

With 1420 current members, and almost 10,000 hits a month its more then a website it's a community. We have meets and people traveled from all over australia at the start of this month to attend the annual Ruxcon conference (including myself) in Sydney. The diveresity of the group is huge. We're are not just phreakers, or hackers we're people from all walks of life with a common interest. To learn.</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well let's look at Wikpedia's guideline for the inclusion of web sites on <a href="../../../w/e/b/Wikipedia%7EWebsites_fbda.html" title="Wikipedia:Websites">Wikipedia:Websites</a>. Having an Alexa ranking of 10,000 or better". Hmm, Ausphreak has an Alexa rating of 1 480 365 <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.ausphreak.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.ausphreak.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> -- you don't meet that one.</li>
</ul>
<p>-&gt;<i>Whilst true, our other domain, networkpunk.com, has a rank considerably lower. It's more than just a web address, if that wasn't clear within the article itself. Furthermore, websites/communities such as Phone Losers of America do not meet this magical 10,000 number, yet are left relatively alone.</i></p>
<p>"Having been the subject of national or international media attention within the last 2 years". I don't know about that one.</p>
<p>-&gt;<i><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=onY&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=gmail+hack+ausphreak&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=onY&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=gmail+hack+ausphreak&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google GmailHack</a> - I'm sure you'll see it gained international media attention nonetheless.</i></p>
<p>"Having a forum with 5,000 or more apparently unique members". According to someone else in this AfD you only have 1420 members which is quite some way off 5000. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowells_4fc9.html" title="User:Chowells">chowells</a> 09:14, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>-&gt;<i>Just because we choose to cull off inactive (yet still unique) members, does not mean we have not had over 5000. Nonetheless, Ausphreak should not be judged solely as a website as it is more a reference to Australian hacking and phreaking in general.</i> IdleFire 12:26, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Non-notable. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 10:38, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete.</b> It's a well enough written article, but it's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> what Wikipedia is for. Host it on geocities if you think it needs a place on the web. (I see the Ausphreak website seems very proud of its Wikipedia entry, even bold linking it. Someone commented above that the history of the boards is not documented elsewhere -- well, why not document it on your own website?) Lastly, non-notable. <a href="http://www.underground-book.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.underground-book.com/" rel="nofollow">Underground</a> is an actual book that covers Australian phreakers &amp; hackers from the late 80s-early 90s in Australia. None of the topics in that book have Wikipedia articles and they're actually somewhat notable (appeared in the media at the time, set some legal precedents). <a href="../../../p/f/c/User%7EPfctdayelise_e220.html" title="User:Pfctdayelise">pfctdayelise</a> 12:51, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>-&gt;<i>One of our community members is Electron, who has stressed that the book is not something to be taken as gospel - we offer a non-biased perspective on issues related to the Australian hacking and phreaking scene that can not be seen in any other forms of the media. It was simply felt that people could gain from such information posted here on wikipedia, and was never meant to serve as an advertisement for ausphreak.com itself. The link was only to allow members to add things that I may have missed when writing the article initially.</i></p>

<li><b>Your Parent Wikimedia, on its main page, hold the saying "Imagine a world in which every single person is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing."</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I have read your policies into your website inclusion policy, and yes i agree with it, <b>TO AN EXTENT</b>.</p>
<p>Google is, disputably, the largest search engine of its kind in the world, and it is noticeable. Ausphreak is the largest community of its kind in Australia, so why is it not like noticeable? It may not be the world, but it sure as hell is noticeable for the 1000s of Australian members who use it everyday. The website hits are not the whole picture here, you seem to be looking towards Ausphreak as a website, but it is a community of entusiasts behind the screen of the domain and forum who everyday submit and share new information.</p>
<p><b>-- 0xF050</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> seems like a perfect content page for the Ausphreak website. Visit again down the road. <b>∴</b> <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHere_05b1.html" title="User:Here">here</a>…<a href="../../../h/e/r/User_talk%7EHere_e90f.html" title="User talk:Here">♠</a> 18:21, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I wouldn't trust the Alexa stats on ausphreak, as we are mostly computer savy and don't like spyware on our computers.</p>
