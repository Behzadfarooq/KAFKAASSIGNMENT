<li><b>Do not delete</b> As I will post momentarily and in greater detail on Talk:Bonza bottler day, Bonza Bottler Day is not a “so-called holiday,” a “web thing without legs” or a hoax. Regardless of whether one views it as frivolous or otherwise, the references, external links, and even commentary at [Talk:Bonza bottler day] and on this page (i.e., Nojybles’ submission, below) evidence Bonza Bottler Day as an actual – not virtual – occasion that is acknowledged and celebrated in the USA and abroad via live events, radio broadcasts, and virtual and online media of various forms. Disdain for the quality of “special events” such as Bonza Bottler Day that are listed in <i>Chase's Calendar of Events</i>, and for the people and purposes that rely upon that resource, does not diminish the fact that <i>Chase's Calendar of Events</i>has been endorsed by sources that Wikipedia describes in [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" rel="nofollow">Reliable Sources</a>] as “likely to be reliable, and [which] are regarded as reputable sources for the purposes of Wikipedia”. Here are some such endorsements:</li>

Reference and User Services Quarterly]].</p>
<p>.In his endorsement to delete the article (above), Calton acknowledges the existence of newspaper articles that cite Bonza Bottler Day (and the fact that he hasn't read them because they reference <i>Chase's Calendar of Events</i>.) However those articles, one should note, were published in media outlets that meet Wikipidia’s [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" rel="nofollow">Reliable Sources</a>] guidelines.</p>
<p>•It is worth mentioning that my interest in Bonza Bottler Day is more than frivolous. I frequently use the history, purpose and uses of the event as a case study when teaching university courses at the college and undergraduate levels, professional seminars, and educational talk shows about business and public affairs, and in articles that – although published in blogs – have been cited elsewhere and elicited favorable - in some cases, grateful - responses. Some respondents were already familiar with the holiday and enjoyed reading about it; some of those people appreciated learning about implications or details that they were previously unaware of; and other respondents enjoyed learning about the holiday for the first time. Please note also that, despite the existence of greeting cards and a variety of directories, almanacs, calendars, and written and online media about Bonza Bottler Day, Wikipedia:Bonza Bottler Day was the source for the “Best Answer - Chosen by Asker” when an Australian submitted a copy of the article in response the Ask Yahoo! question: [<a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060726205737AaevHuj" class="external autonumber" title="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060726205737AaevHuj" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] and here [<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060726205737AaevHuj" class="external text" title="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060726205737AaevHuj" rel="nofollow">What is Bonza Bottler Day?</a>].

<li><i>Calton acknowledges the existence of newspaper articles that cite Bonza Bottler Day</i> NO, Calton acknowledges the inserted newspaper references, and notes that from the headlines that they are obviously NOT about this so-called Bonza Bottler Day but about <i>Chase's Calendar of Events</i> -- meaning that as references they fail the "non-trivial" test, no matter how much respectability you try to attach to the sources. And given the ludicrously low standards for submission and inclusion in <i>Chase's</i>, they're not up to the "reliable source" standard -- no matter how much quoting of their ad copy you do. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:49, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, lots of reliable sources publish utter trivia from time to time, there's nothing unusual about that. Trivia published reliably is still trivia and not really worth noting in an encyclopedia that is decidedly not about trivia (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>). The dearth of Google hits is truly telling for a "national" holiday.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> As for the holiday being "made-up," I concur with Joe Kress' response to the issue at [Talk:Bonza Bottler Day]: "Of course this is an made-up 'holiday' or, more correctly, an event as the article itself implies, but all holidays were once made-up." -Lisatolliver 05:13, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> the holiday. I personally learned of this holiday reading Wikipedia this past March... Since I have celebrated every applicable month with my coworkers, as the tradition dictates.

<li>I understand and share your concern. However, I first learned about Bonza Bottler Day several years ago when conducting research in support of a marketing course I was developing and associated radio broadcast. Further investigation unearthed a number of articles, almanacs, calendars and even greeting card sites that referenced the holiday, its founder and its sponsor. Subsequently, other people who have heard/read my discussions about the holiday have furnished additional sources and references. I thought it would be appropriate to compile that information in Wikipedia.--Lisatolliver 04:54, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>I understand and share your concern.</i> No, you don't, or else you might have started off with some actual evidence that met basic verifiabilty standards, instead of the flimsy blog references you started with and wikilawyering handwaving you've resorted to. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:54, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>As a newbie on Wikipedia I have addressed the Bonza Bottler Day deletion and now wish to do the same with Elaine Fremont. As I knew Elaine but lost touch with her over the years, I was glad to find a reference using her name. I originally read of her holiday and it's title in our local paper but also learned of Elaine's death from an automobile accident. Consequently, I was so shaken by her passing that I forgot the title. I recently searched on the web and was able to find reference and the information that I sought. Therefore, I request that this information remain for others to locate and understand the history and purpose of the holiday. I feel I should add, Elaine was a friend from church - not a friend of a friend or any of the sort. A real, flesh and blood, lovely girl that Lisa Tolliver has referenced and whom I personally knew. Elaine had a great sense of humor and would probably be laughing at Carlton's blunt and callous desire to eliminate something that he/she obviously has difficulty in understanding. Lighten up - smile - enjoy life and next month - celebrate Sept. 9 / Bonza Bottler Day with a box of cookies and surprise the office with a smile! --DKnebel 03:28, 9 August 2006 (UTC) <small>User's third edit -- the first two being to Talk:Bonza bottler day</small></p>

<dd><i>I recently searched on the web and was able to find reference and the information that I sought.</i> Free "callous" advice: that means this article doesn't belong here. Wikipedia is not a publicity service or promotional vehicle: its intent is to record stuff that already has notability, import, and -- most importantly -- verification. Frankly, I find your clumsy attempt at emotional manipulation grotesque. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 04:08, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - The current hard copy edition of Chase's indicates that Bonza Bottler Day is trademarked. The fact that the trademark is not in the Library of Congress federal trademarks index indicates that it is trademarked in one of the 50 states. I have sent an inquiry to the holiday's sponsor to inquire which state it is trademarked in, since a link to the listing in the relevant state trademark database provides another reliable source. A reliable source that has already been provided is the reference by Steve Clark, [<a href="http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=0&amp;did=14556037&amp;SrchMode=1&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD&amp;TS=1155151967&amp;clientId=56233" class="external text" title="http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=0&amp;did=14556037&amp;SrchMode=1&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD&amp;TS=1155151967&amp;clientId=56233" rel="nofollow">whose article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch</a>] does not rely upon Chase's and is published in a reputable newspaper. Additionally, the Bonza Bottler Day article info box types the holiday "[Humorous observances]" and the article is internally linked to [Hallmark holiday]. That seems appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several issues seem inappropriate and inconsistent about this entire discussion. ONE: Bonza bottler day lists more external links and references - including those above which are reliable - than multiple Wikipedia [Humorous observances] and [Hallmark holiday] articles that have neither been marked as Afd nor the subjected to heated contraversy such as this. Consistency with regard to RELIABILITY OF SOURCES would dictate that the those become Afd too. TWO: Consistency with regard to NOTABILITY would dictate that ALL [Humorous observances] and some [Hallmark holiday]s be deleted or that Bonza Bottler Day not be deleted.199.97.121.99 20:14, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. Let's review this others and create separate AfD's for them, too. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 20:47, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> I can't even get to the references – they're all behind some kind of registration firewall. This and the other "funny holiday" articles should go. Until today, I didn't even know any of them existed excluding April Fool's Day (not that I'm some kind of notability barometer - I'm just saying). Not to denigrate Bonza Bottler day observers to whom I'm sure this is important, but every day is bound to be some kind of "Third Tuesday in April Day" or "National Underarm Deodorant Day" or something. Besides, tomorrow could be "National Toenail Clipping Day" in the U.S. while it's some other kind of "official" or humorous day in every other country around the globe. 120 countries with 120 different "official" days for any given calendar day, multiplied by 365? I think it's ridiculous and unachievable to include all of them or to even make the attempt. <font color="darkblue"><b>Baseball,Baby!</b></font> <font color="red"><sup><i>balls</i></sup></font><font color="darkblue"><sup>•</sup></font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BaseballBaby_1aec.html" title="Special:Contributions/BaseballBaby"><font color="red"><sup><i>strikes</i></sup></font></a> 01:45, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
