It was orginally tagged for speedy deletion under A7, but I removed the CSD tags as I felt having a contract with WWE was at least an <i>assertion</i> of notability. I prodded the article, the prod was endorsed, and then the prods were mysteriously removed by an anon without even an edit summary. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 00:18, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> a chorale club founded in 1885 that has toured Europe and Asia doesn't seem non-notable to me, but on the other hand the article appears to be a copyvio from <a href="http://ucchoral.berkeley.edu/ucchoral/mchorale/" class="external autonumber" title="http://ucchoral.berkeley.edu/ucchoral/mchorale/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font>iggurat</a> 01:13, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I couldn't find any either, which is why I was commenting not voting delete&#160;:) I think it's a moot point, as the current incarnation appears to be a copyvio, so it may be best to remove it entirely, and if anyone wishes to write a sourced article on it at a future date encourage it. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font color="red">Z</font>iggurat</a> 02:12, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Was prodded b/c "relevance unclear". I am deprodding and taking to AfD precisely because there is some significance, but it's not clear how much, and consensus is needed. This is a host of a real radio show on a station in Guelph, Ontario, which is not exactly a primary market. It's a once-weekly show and runs from midnight to 2AM. That's as bad as a radio slot gets. Yet I am not sure if we should be deleting this article for a bona fide radio host. <s><b>No vote</b></s> - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">CrazyRussian</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crzrussian_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crzrussian">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">email</a></small> 01:20, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I would be ok with this move, as long as it avoids the same problems that the Andrew Patterson article had. Namely, it still needs to be shown that the radio show has some significance. To bring up the example I used below, I think everyone would agree with me that a random college DJ isn't notable. To expand it to the idea of a Free Cheese article, it wouldn't make the college DJ any more notable if he got a partner and named his timeslot.<a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarhorus_8a29.html" title="User:Warhorus">Warhorus</a> 02:04, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Yemen does not compete at the Commonwealth Games. Mohammed Nasir represented Wales, as he is Welsh (well, from Newport, so he's Monmouthshirese). The reason, I suspect, that the article asserts that Nasir represented Yemen is that he is of Yemeni ancestry. Of course, he was part of the Welsh team, won a bronze medal for Wales, and doesn’t represent Yemen any more than Sol Campbell represents Jamaica at football. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 01:30, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete<s>/merge</s></b> (from Prod nominator): The hotel is already mentioned in Rudy Colombini so I prodded this article (and Nob Hill Hotel), but if there's more info in it worth merging, that's fine. I believe this article to basically be advertising because of (among other things) the mention of the Fitzgerald and Nob Hill hotels in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nob_Hill%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California&amp;oldid=52239463" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nob_Hill%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California&amp;oldid=52239463" rel="nofollow">this revision</a> of the <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nob_Hill_adcd.html" title="Nob Hill">Nob Hill</a> article under "History and significance". That section plugged both of these hotels even though neither one of them is actually in Nob Hill (the so-called Nob Hill hotel is actually in the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenderloin%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California_2a57.html" title="Tenderloin, San Francisco, California">Tenderloin</a>, though not in the slummy part of it). It also describes them as a fancy hotels in the same sentence as the Fairmont and Huntingdon, though they're not comparable at all, at least in size. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 03:51, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

An international directory of Laughter Clubs is posted there - all with contact name, tel. and emails - as well as many videos and worldwide media coverage on this method. I have rewritten this entry and shorten it to a basic definition. There is something UNIQUE about Laughter Yoga, in that it is a method where you laugh for no reason (no reason = no mind = no ego, no power-struggle, no past (guilt) and no future (worry). It brings you easily into the "here and now" where only equilibrium exists and tension gets released without the need to verbalize). ALSO this is a grassroots wordlwide social movement (please visit the website for valid proof). I would be very happy to expand this entry again in a way acceptable to WP. There is a great value in this for the common good, yet obviously you may say I have a partial viewpoint. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Sgendry (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sgendry_0c83.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sgendry">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: This issue has been discussed twice before. While the article is written as a 'how-to', the subject matter itself is not a "how-to". While Wikipedia wouldn't have an article on "how to do brain surgery", "<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain_surgery.html" title="Brain surgery">brain surgery</a>" is a valid article. The opening paragraphs are a valid description of the subject. If people object to the rest of the article, that should be discussed on the talk page of the article. SimonP's comment at the last AfD was the best: "just make sure it is descriptive rather than prescriptive". I would agree to a "cleanup" tag on the article referencing these issues but not an outright deletion. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamw_5671.html" title="User:Samw">Samw</a> 00:37, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

In any event, I think fairer analogies would be betwixt the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spark_plug.html" title="Spark plug">Spark plug</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain_surgery.html" title="Brain surgery">Brain surgery</a> articles and between this article and Brain surgery techniques, which, even if written consistent with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a how-to guide"</a>, we'd still likely delete in view of its being overly specific (we'd merge, I think, any encyclopedic information to a broader article, such as <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurosurgery.html" title="Neurosurgery">Neurosurgery</a> or even a section of <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgery.html" title="Surgery">Surgery</a>, and I don't think anyone would object to merging here, although I supported <i>delete</i> in view of my conclusion that there was nothing to merge). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 03:12, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>The nomination for AfD is predicated on the article being a "how-to" and thus doesn't belong. Has the issue now shifted to the "notability" of the subject? I'm not aware of any notability guidelines for technical subjects. Any verifiable technical subject is fair game AFAIK. See <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voigt_notation.html" title="Voigt notation">Voigt notation</a>; that must be much more obscure than this topic. I cite that simply because I contributed; I'm sure there are many technical subjects even more obscure. If the issue is that it's a how-to, my assertion is that while it may be partially written as such, the subject matter is not. Let's flag it for clean-up and rewrite it so that it is "descriptive" rather than "prescriptive". <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamw_5671.html" title="User:Samw">Samw</a> 03:15, 31 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Even as the nomination is in view of the article's quality as a how-to, we may nevertheless support deletion on other grounds. When I use <i>non-notable</i> here, I mean the term to mean that the information is exorbitantly trivial (or, as I said above, overly specific; cf., esoteric, where your <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voigt_notation.html" title="Voigt notation">Voigt notation</a> adduction would be apt) and thus unencyclopedic (even if formulated other than as a how-to). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 19:23, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>So on the issue of notability, I strongly object to technical subjects being held to a "notability" criteria. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. Until there is established consensus as to what is notable and what is not within each subject area, as many topics as possible should be covered. <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top-hat_shim.html" title="Top-hat shim">Top-hat shim</a> has 13 Google hits.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: If you want a clone of britanica why bother with wikipedia? Britanica (or encarta etc) doesnt have stuff like this, Wikipedia DOES. Seriously, Who needs wikipedia if all it has is the same inane "lowest common denominator" goop as all the commercial ones? You can be just like them or you can be special. To be just like them is to doom the experiment to failure and gives away the greatest point of strength wiki has, the ability to present RARE information. I think I need my own web page for this stuff.</li>

<dd>As an asside to the above comment "there's no guarantee that this is quality work".

<p>This is problematic and hinges very much on the definition of "prophet". If we take the doctrinal view that the purpose of the prophets was to announce Christ then the last prophet is <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Baptist_0931.html" title="John the Baptist">John the Baptist</a>. If on the other hand we define a prophet as a leader endowed with <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charismatic_authority.html" title="Charismatic authority">charismatic authority</a> then <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Peter_1d6c.html" title="St Peter">St Peter</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_the_Just_a659.html" title="James the Just">James the Just</a> would be "early Christian prophets" as leaders of the Jerusalem congragation. Under <i>that</i> definition John the Baptist would be out of place. Finally, if a prophet is anyone who has received a message from God, then the list is quite endless; many people are mentioned in the New Testament by name that received a vision or a word from God.</p>
<p>These points have been raised on the talk page, there has been no reply, and I'm at a loss to say where one could take the article. Besides, we have an article on <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Christianity_6b3f.html" title="Early Christianity">Early Christianity</a> already. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 03:02, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

AFAICT, reelin is present in abnormal quantities in schizophrenics, but this article is 1,500 words long, and outside of the title the word "reelin" only appears twice.

<li><b>Reply</b> There is technical information out there about the correlation between reelin levels and propensity toward schizophrenia but it has not apparently risen to the level of being an "hypothesis" as much as it is a speculation that warrants further investigation. I would think that this information would best be covered within the schizophrenia article but WP should not be designating something as a "hypothesis" when the scince / medical community has not already done so. ("Hypothesis" has a technical meaning within the scietific community.)

For the Reelin's role in SZ, look out for Erminio Costa's scientific works, for example: <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=15961543" class="external free" title="http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=15961543" rel="nofollow">http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=15961543</a> --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECopperKettle_9495.html" title="User:CopperKettle">CopperKettle</a> 12:08, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>P.S</b> O.K.

<li><b>Merge</b> if there is anything of value anyone can extract from it, the article is poor, otherwise <b>Delete</b>. Talk of a reelin <i>hypothesis</i> is a little unusual but there is plenty of scientific basis for it (e.g.<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14993361&amp;query_hl=3&amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14993361&amp;query_hl=3&amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> which says "the morbidity risk of schizophrenia...may arise as a consequence of compromised RELN expression" - essentially stating a reelin hypothesis of schizophrenia), but would be better covered as part of the neurodevelopmental hypothesis. --Coroebus 10:53, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>keep</b> Why delete a article on a game that people may play.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Cite Sources</b> Has an encyclopedic history section. Wikipedia is not paper. How an artcile with a history section going back to the 1880s can be called an ad for an organization (the MBTA) formed in the 1960s is beyond my understanding - the history starts 80 years before the organization. Furthermore, the MBTA doesn't provide this service, it only subsidizes it, and the article says this. The map and fares section should probably just be replaced with external links - but I wasn't quickly able to find the source of the data, so the article definitely needs source citations. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 01:42, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b> I actually did read the comment about the previous <i>merge</i> and don't know what to make of the rather odd decision to put this vanity piece into an otherwise contentless article about an organization. Perhaps a <b>delete without prejudice</b> to recreate the page when and if an actual article about the organization is drafted. But this, along with its odd history, should just be gotten rid of and let future editors have a clean start if they want to give it another try.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I learned something new today - there's a category called "Articles with ASCII art"? Anyway, take a look at the graph ... it doesn't seem to be entirely accurate. For example, the Dead Sea Scrolls are just as ancient as the other ancient copies - we just didn't have them available until recently. Also, I'm not entirely certain that the NKJV and NASB really belong in the same column as ASV/RSV/NRSV. NKJV and NASB are really a separte fork. At any rate, an ASCII art map of Bible history probably isn't that helpful. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 19:47, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

As quoted from the article "Poe recently became well known in New Zealand when he won a $500 raffle run by the Wellington Boy Scouts Brigade. Poe received nationwide media attention, and was interviewed on Campbell Live by well respected journalist and liberal, John Campbell". National media coverage for winning <i>only $500</i> at a lottery? The article also claims that "according to legend, he purchased an ice-cream from the local store. The ice-cream stick is currently on display in a framed cabinet in the local tavern."

<li><b>Delete</b> This seems to be a fairly common term on Google, but I cannot decipher its true identity. It seems to be a widespread inside joke, with the humor being the plausibility of the name and ever-elusive true identity of the fictional association to outsiders. I could be completely wrong, but my web travels lead me to believe this. Perhaps if the term reaches a certain degree of prevalence, a true article could be created, but for now, kiss it goodbye. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">Adambiswanger1</a> 05:41, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Perhaps some of the explanation of this topic can be moved to <a href="../../../y/a/c/Yacht_Rock_%28show%29_1367.html" title="Yacht Rock (show)">Yacht Rock (show)</a>, although it appears the show itself may not meet the criteria in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a>. So that you can see how I arrived at this: I started looking for how notable "marina rock" was, and it turns out that searching for "marina rock" doesn't even show the phrase itself in normal use until <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22marina+rock%22&amp;start=30" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22marina+rock%22&amp;start=30" rel="nofollow">positions 36 and 37 on Google</a>.

The article is about how these terms were starting to get mainstream coverage. Note the topic. Now that post links to this article: <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/0549/051207_music_talktalk.php" class="external text" title="http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/0549/051207_music_talktalk.php" rel="nofollow">"Talk Talk: J.D.

First words in the interview from J.D. Ryznar, the producer of <a href="../../../y/a/c/Yacht_Rock_a346.html" title="Yacht Rock">Yacht Rock</a> (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>J.D. Ryznar: I've always fantasized about what it was like being guys making music back then—certainly a freer time, and the boats looked like they were fun to be on. <b>I came up with the term "yacht rock," but Hunter [Stair], who plays Kenny Loggins, and Dave Lyons, who plays [soft-rock impresario] Koko, have their own term: "Marina rock," as in Marina del Ray [where Yacht Rock takes place]. So we compromised: Yacht rock had to do with the more elite studio artists.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is the creator of the show saying explicitly that "yacht rock" and "marina rock" were intentionally coined phrases for the show. So now that one knows that its a neologism, one looks for independent research to see if it's widespread or at least has independent research somewhere else. I can't find any independent research. This article appears to be <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> in the Wikipedia sense of the term, which is a no-no. If it is not original, then, lacking any independent sources, it appears to be speculation, which is an even bigger no-no. In addition, nearly all mentions of the terms "yacht rock" and "marina rock" on Wikipedia come from an edit streak in the last 48 hours by a <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernandobouregard_51c0.html" title="User:Fernandobouregard">User:Fernandobouregard</a>, including creation of "yacht rock" categories. --<a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7ECloseapple_0d0e.html" title="User:Closeapple">Closeapple</a> 05:15, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - perhaps a neologism, but it <i>does</i> vividly sum up a recognizable genre of music, for which no other popular name exists. Furthermore, the article does offer a concise and factually solid introduction to the genre - it isn't just a plug for the show or its inside jokes, and even as a fan of the show I actually learned things here. I would say the "marina rock" discussion should go, though, since it rambles considerably and seems to definitely belong to the inside joke category. Keep the reference to the ancient Usenet use of "Yacht Rock" in reference to Jimmy Buffett, though. If anything this article could stand to be a little more elaborate, perhaps with some quotes from old reviews to give a context to the "critically despised" theme.

<li><b>restore/redirect/(re)merge</b> and wait to see if the term extends beyond the show. I cannot agree with those wishing to delete for a couple of reasons. First, the term is the name of the show, so in the very least it deserves a (re)merge, redirect, or restore but not a delete. Second, the term is defined by various sources (granted, in the context of the show) such as <a href="http://www.sfweekly.com/Issues/2005-09-07/music/garrett.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sfweekly.com/Issues/2005-09-07/music/garrett.html" rel="nofollow">SFWeekly</a>, <a href="http://www.insidenova.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=ISN/MGArticle/IMD_BasicArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1128769149036" class="external text" title="http://www.insidenova.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=ISN/MGArticle/IMD_BasicArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1128769149036" rel="nofollow">InsideNOVA</a> and the host Steve Huey, a contributor for <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Music_Guide_0e49.html" title="All Music Guide">allMusic</a>.

More mentions are popping up on major blogs and papers weekly. note: I am the creator of the show, which I do not make for profit. I have nothing to do with this Wikipedia entry for the show or the term. The entry popped up months ago, created by an unknown author, and I keep tabs on it to help make sure all the facts are accurate. Whether this hurts or helps the argument, the fact is, the term is out there now in the cultural lexicon, and people need a place to go to find out what it means. This Wikipedia entry is satisfactory in the definition of the term. If this is a "neologism" and breaks the rules of Wikipedia, at the very least a breif definition of the term should be redirected to the entry about the internet show, which, for the record, closeapple, has been rightfully and easily cleared of the notablility concern. Hopefully the links I've provided can help you editors begin to filter out the original research and clean up the entry to closeapple's satisfaction. And save the fact that Yacht Rock is a new term, these links (as well as the fact the internet show has been written up by Reuters, AP, Spin, Entertainment Weekly, Newsweek, and the LA Times) certainly disprove the arguments for deletion at the top of the list.</li>

<li>I just read over the article again. It's hilarious! I love the picture of the Pieta, also. nice touch. Oh, and perLogan--perhaps the reason why supposedly have better statistics is that many baseball greats are south american, which makes them necessarily catholic. Also, if you'd like, I could share with you some sluggers who <i>weren't</i> catholic. Hank Aaron? Barry Bonds? Mickey Mantle? . <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">Adambiswanger1</a> 18:28, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>no joke</b>Adam, I would have preferred a San Deigo Padre icon in the thumbnail, but I didn't see it in the Commons, so I guess it is not fair use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonds and Aaron are Catholics, amigo. Aaron is an inspiration as a black Catholic and speaks at black Catholic youth get togethers. The Catholic Church was a refuge for Aaron as he pursued Ruth's record in a hostile environment. I don't know if Aaron would have broken Ruth's records had he been subject to the political hotbeds of Southern Baptist churches. Kareem Abdul Jabbar converted to Islam to avoid black Baptist politics, he was not the only black celebrity to do so. There is a famous story about Bonds at Sierra High Catholic H.S., where his lay teacher told him to 'gear up, baseball will never do anything for you.' The only Latin player I listed was Sosa, the rest are Anglo, African-American and Irish. Baseball players were predominantly 'Protestant' until the influx of Latin players. My point is about the two elite records that Ruth set, single season and career. Maris was not the great player Mantle was, but Mantle didn't pass Ruth, now did he? If you reject spirituality in total as a materialist, then yes, the idea must seem comical. I offer this sincerely, though. It is certainly as valid an article as the bygone Ruth curse on the Red Sox. <b>Tolkien and Ruth</b></p>
<p>I am surprised no one has commneted on the oddity that Tolkien and Ruth would both be raised by priests, beginning in 1904, who would encourage amd mold their careers, and their contributions would remain vital even as the 21st Century begins. per Logan0703</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Even if you just briefly scan Philippine (especially in Mindanao) culture and traditions as well as its' historical connections to Indonesia, you'll find this article worth keeping and improving. As a resident of the Philippines, I <i>know</i> that there are many more Indonesians than that figure - that figure merely gives the number of Indonesians who entered the Philippines legally, and not those who entered the Philippines illegally. According to estimates, thousands of Indonesians come to the Philippines (especially through Mindanao) where they get Muslim Filipina wives, hold businesses, and even train in terrorism camps. It is very evident that there is a wide disparity between the views of foreigners and Filipinos. In this case, since this is an article pertaining to Philippines, I think that it would be alright to surmise that the Filipinos are correct..--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthewprc_06ba.html" title="User:Matthewprc">User:Matthewprc</a> 21:55, 02 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Should the individual article pages on all (around 200 in number) the guantanamo detainees be included in wikipedia? I feel these pages aren't substantial to wikipedia being encylopedic. There are more then 700 detainees in the US Naval base camp. If their names are released, should all their biographies be collected and article pages be created for all of them? If yes, then, I'd like to point out there are currently thousands of POWs detained by a lot number of countries all over the world. Would wikipedia be a place to host information all those detainees, from all over the world?</p>
<p>I strongly feel such pages are a seriously violating the notability criteria, turning wikipedia into what is infamously called, the junkyard of information. In this case, even the list of detainees is more than enough to be considered encyclopedic. We want and expect wikipedia to last long, like encyclopedia brittanica, 1911. Cos, in the longer run, in the next 50 years, there may be a number of wars, battles, detainees and POWs. I don't think wikipedia should have <b>all</b> the information relating to that. Though the facts and plights of the detainees may be important for the world to know, including all the information of every single detainee may be considered too trivial to be considered encyclopedic. Therefore I'm marking it as AFD on the guantanamo detainee pages, starting with the first one in the list. And I expect a consensus and mutiple deletion on all the detainee pages. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChezhiyan_aed1.html" title="User:Chezhiyan"><font color="#0082B8">Chez</font></a> <sup><font color="#698B69">(</font><a href="../../../c/h/e/User_talk%7EChezhiyan_033e.html" title="User talk:Chezhiyan"><font color="#0082B8">Discuss</font></a> <font color="#698B69">/</font> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Chezhiyan_3de9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Chezhiyan"><font color="#0082B8">Email</font></a><font color="#698B69">)</font></sup> • 08:21, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I understood the nominator to mean that this AfD had been noted as an AfD discussion on a page about the guatanamo detainees as a group or about the camps. But I couldn't find that giving of notice on probable pages nor can I see it in the nominator's contribution log. If this is to be a test case for all of the detainees, it ought to receive wider than average notice. I've gone ahead and notified the article's initial creator, but wonder if more should be done. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a></li>
<li><b>Keep this one</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia.</a> We have the space for all notable detainees. And as time passes and they become less important, the content can be trimmed down. This is part of the normal versioning of encyclopedias. That this detainee was involved in negotiating an end to one of the hunger strikes makes him more notable than the average detainee. Article has links to two reliable sources. I reserve judgement on the articles for other detainees until they are nominated - but I suspect that only a proper subset will be deletion worthy. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:07, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

ANY article that concerns a subject that may be considered not to be significant would by up for deletion -- and there are a LOT of articles that just about any member with an account here would consider insignificant.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It can be agreed that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia.</a>, but the same policy says <i>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia.</i> Plus, it cannot be figured where, 200 odd pages (as of now) on Guantanamo detainees will come under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The decision on these pages will pave way for a stance on notability in the absence of a guideline or policy. If not deleted, will it mean that any article on detainees in other nations as well be allowed to be created?? Instead, I'd suggest an article on the experience of the detainees be created and a line that this person helped end the hunger strike be included.

<dd>This is a good idea, but someone should write that article first, then nominate appropriate detainees for deletion. After writing the article the editors of it should have an educated sense of which ones are worthy of their own article, and which are not. If we want a delete and merge outcome, which I expect will be appropriate for most of the prisoners, we need someplace to merge it to. I don't see any appropriate articles wikilinked in this one or in the category. It would probably be too much for <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extrajudicial_prisoners_of_the_United_States_c6c4.html" title="Extrajudicial prisoners of the United States">Extrajudicial prisoners of the United States</a> or <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guantanamo_Bay_detainment_camp_d6fa.html" title="Guantanamo Bay detainment camp">Guantanamo Bay detainment camp</a> which are already getting long, but ought to be a sub-page of one of them. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 14:22, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Disclaimer, I started this article, and most of the other Guantanamo articles Chez has suggested should be deleted.
<ul>
<li>Chez, no offense, but your arguments in favour of deleting all these articles are based on unfortunate misconceptions. If these individuals were merely POWs, about whom there was no controversy, or misunderstandings, I would agree with you that they wouldn't merit individual articles. You are laboring under a misconception if you think they are POWs. The nature of their incarceration is a subject of great controversy largely because the Bush administration has chosen to not afford them the protections of POW, even though many legal scholars believe this is a violation of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a>, and members of the US judicial branch concur. You are laboring under a misconception if you think their identities remain secret. 5,000 pages of transcripts, containing some of their names were released on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_3.html" title="March 3">March 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, followed by two lists of names, released on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_20.html" title="April 20">April 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_15.html" title="May 15">May 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.</li>
<li>Chez, there is an excellent site called "the Jurist", maintained at the University of Pittsburg law faculty. It is an excellent, very neutral, very reliable site that gives short articles on current legal matters. If there is no fair-minded, authoritative site about the principals involved in one of their reports, they write a backgrounder themselves. But if there is a fair-minded, credible page somewhere, they cite that page. They have cites some of the articles on individual Guantanamo detainees here on the wikipedia, as in <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/04/guantanamo-detainee-tells-military.php" class="external text" title="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/04/guantanamo-detainee-tells-military.php" rel="nofollow">this article.</a></li>
<li>Chez, I saw you were on the recent changes patrol, and the new articles patrol. You cited <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. I suggest you re-read the portion entitled <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_battleground" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a battleground</a>, which reads, in part: <i>"Every user is expected to interact with others civilly, calmly, and <b>in a spirit of cooperation.</b>... Rather, approach the matter intelligently and <b>engage in polite discussion."</b></i> -- So why did you wait until I had created hundreds of articles, spending hundreds of hours to do so, when, as a regular patroler, you probably noticed these articles months ago? Why didn't you write me with your concerns the very first time you noticed an article that concerned you? Other people did write me, during the last couple of months, when my efforts accelerated, once the DoD released the detainees identities, and 6,000 pages of transcripts. I took their concerns seriously, and modified my efforts to take their concerns into account.</li>
<li>As to whether the individual detainees will "fade into obscurity":
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> also says wikipedia is not a crystal ball. They might fade into obscurity. Or the nature of their incarceration and interrogation might remain the focus of ongoing controversy, just like <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynching_in_the_United_States_0822.html" title="Lynching in the United States">Lynching in the United States</a>, or <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_American_Internment_ef99.html" title="Japanese American Internment">Japanese American Internment</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_Canadian_internment_5397.html" title="Japanese Canadian internment">Japanese Canadian internment</a>. These articles may serve as an invaluable resource if the American public were to decide that the inhumane conditions at Guantanamo represented the same kind of blot on America's record as the paragon of freedom and democracy and the rule of law as slavery, lynching, and the internment of those of Japanese descent during World War 2.</li>
<li>Do you think we are going to run out of disk-space? The capacity of hard drives is doubling every two years. Wikipedia is a success. Expect to see the size of its disk-farm increase. Let me suggest that if it ever becomes necessary to purge articles, solely because of a lack of disk-space, that the candidates should be chosen purely on a "least recently used" basis. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 14:27, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>There are other articles that reference these articles, like:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charities_accused_of_ties_to_terrorism.html" title="Charities accused of ties to terrorism">charities accused of ties to terrorism</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../c/a/s/Casio_F91W_87a3.html" title="Casio F91W">Casio F91W</a> -- the "terrorist's watch"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As Sherurcij noted, if all these articles was rolled into one article it would be overwhelmingly large. Not only would that make it hard for browsers to load, but it would be useless for other articles to reference it. Suppose the chariites article referenced the omnibus article you suggested, how would the reader interested in which Guantanamo detainees were accused of ties to Al Wafa, or Al Haramain Foundation, find that info? -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 14:53, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> "Anti-Persianism" gets 10 hits on Google.

It ignores twelve centuries of minimal or no friction between Arabs and Persians. IMHO, the section of older history is also grotesquely slanted and inaccurate.

<li><b>Delete</b> It is worthwhile looking at the reasons why this article was created <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anti-Arabism#POV_POV_POV" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anti-Arabism#POV_POV_POV" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> and also how widely the term "anti-Persianism" is used <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-42,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22anti%2Dpersianism%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-42,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22anti%2Dpersianism%22" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> - the only evidence for the use of this term is once in one article <a href="http://www.venusproject.com/ecs/aFarrokhArab.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.venusproject.com/ecs/aFarrokhArab.html" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>, but some of the material in this opinion piece has been copied and pasted into the "anti-Persianism" article, as I pointed out here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-Persianism_by_Arabs&amp;diff=55464473&amp;oldid=55446879" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-Persianism_by_Arabs&amp;diff=55464473&amp;oldid=55446879" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>. Out of 12 hits on Google, three are related to this article, indicating that this is original research. The chief problem I have is that this article interprets many actions against Iran as anti-Persian racism, when in fact only 50% of the population of Iran is ethnically Persian and these actions have political motives rather than racial ones. Criticism or actions against the Iranian state by Arab governments appear to be deemed anti-Persianism in this article. I suspect that the reason why "anti-Iranian" and "anti-Persian" are conflated is precisely because there is little evidence to support this polemic. There is more evidence to support an article on "anti-Iranianism" <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-42,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22anti%2Diranian%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-42,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22anti%2Diranian%22" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>, although it would have to be broader than just sentiments expressed in the Arab world.

<dd>
<ul>
<li>I disagree with deleting all anti-X-ism articles.</li>
<li>However, I am against the creation of articles based on an -ism that does not appear to exist outside Wikipedia</li>
<li>I am in favour of an article on anti-Iranian sentiment, as I believe that this prejudice does exist</li>
<li>However, I am against an article that focuses just on the prejudices of some Arabs and that there is a large amount of prejudice against Iranians elsewhere in the world</li>
<li>So, I propose that this article be renamed Anti-Iranian prejudice or Anti-Iranian sentiment, be widened to include the hatred or fear of Iranians <i>wherever</i> it occurs (not just Arabs) and the matters relating to POV and copyright violations in the article are cleared up. If this is agreed, then I would vote to <i>keep</i> the article.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 22:52, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Zereshk has since renamed the article <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Persian_sentiments_28a8.html" title="Anti-Persian sentiments">Anti-Persian sentiments</a>, which is a positive development. I have made a proposal for a separate Anti-Iranian prejudice that would clear my remaining objections (along with the misgivings of other editors) and would establish the difference between racism against ethnic Persians (who form 50% of the Iranian population) and hatred of Iran as a nation: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anti-Persian_sentiments#Proposal" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anti-Persian_sentiments#Proposal" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>.

<dd>I don't like the idea of "Anti-Iranianism" because then there is more than just a single ethnic group. There is definitely racism against Persians so I think renaming the article is a good idea, but it should stay focused on anti-Persian ideas. Problem with "Anti-Iranianism" is also that "Iranian" in this way only means citizens of the country of Iran, and not any ethnic groups. There might be some hatred because of that, being citizen of Iran, but the hatred is more directed against Persians, and not so much against other groups. So the aim of the article is valid since widespread racism exists in the Arab world - and especially Saudi Arabia, UAE, Yemen, Bahrain - against Persians and anyone seen as being "Persian" or "Persian-like". <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 11:44, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>... I am a little bothered by having <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Arabism_9893.html" title="Anti-Arabism">Anti-Arabism</a> and not this... not sure why (I don't know the subject well at all... just that there is mutual animosity that pops up from time to time)... It does get more google hits but... it is possible that the terminology is not as singular as with anti-Arabism... are there many different terms, maybe? I do think the article is not very good. It conflates anecdotal evidence into a tale.... I mean... quoting traditions like this does is quite dangerous... we need to be quoting secondary scholarship not trying to make our own (and if anti-Arabism suffers from the same problems they should be fixed as well). Are there any academic (relatively) non-partisan works on this? The only ones this seems to cite are related to Iran and not Persians in general... I don't vote delete because I don't know if there is scholarship on this... but, this article is dangerous because it masquerades as being fact when... well, it's just not. And sadly, I think non-neutral articles are looking more sophisticated and escaping scrutiny. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 11:41, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> The reason why I got involved in editing the Iranian anti-Arabism section (a mere section, not a bloated article like this nominated one) was because anti-Arab Iranians were using that section to make racist statements against Arabs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Arabism&amp;oldid=41183865" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Arabism&amp;oldid=41183865" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Arabism&amp;oldid=38077383#Anti-Arabism_in_Iran" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Arabism&amp;oldid=38077383#Anti-Arabism_in_Iran" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> I was new when I started to correct this section, and so I had little knowledge of what is considered acceptable, so I sought the advice of an admin and another user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Inahet/Archive1#Anti_Arabism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Inahet/Archive1#Anti_Arabism" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>.

<dd>I agree with you that there are tensions and in some cases animosity and racism towards Iranians by Arabs, but my point is that the article conflates <i>Iranian</i> as a nationality and <i>Persian</i> as an ethnic group that comprises 50% of the Iranian nation. "Anti-Persianism" or "Anti-Persian" are terms that have been virtually invented by the article author, whereas Anti-Iranian sentiment is widely written about.<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-42,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22anti%2Diranian%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-42,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22anti%2Diranian%22" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> How can one realistically argue that anti-Iranian attitudes expressed by Arab football supporters during a soccer match is evidence of hatred against the Persian people rather than Iran as a country? My other point is that anti-Iranian attitudes are not only evident among Arabs but other ethnic groups and countries. Why are Arabs singled out and anti-Iranian sentiments among Americans not dealt with? I have no objection to an article on Anti-Iranian prejudice, which is something I originally suggested on the Anti-Arabism talk page, covering all aspects of the issue and not just Arab-versus-Persian.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز</a> 18:07, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article contains notable and factual information that is not present in any other articles. The phrasing and title of the idea conveyed "anti-persianism by arabs" is irrelevant. All previous arguments presented against this article seem to either quibble about the title of the article or bemoan the "irreparable" state of the organization and tone. Unless it is original research, the premise of the article, not content, should dictate its fate. I find the cumbersome title and POV style to be irrelevant in the discussion. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">Adambiswanger1</a> 17:50, 29 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, but the "premise" is exactly it. The premise of this article is that "Anti-Persianism" (or whatever you call it) is a unified phenomenon across the eras, providing a single interpretative framework for each and every real or perceived grievance Persians have against Arabs, from mistreatments during and after the Islamic conquest, to the behaviour of football fans today. And this idea, I believe, is indeed irreparably original research and tendentious, no matter how well the details are sourced. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 18:01, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't think that the difficulty of the task (studying the animosity towards persians across time and in different contexts) warrants the deletion of the article. What is needed is good, hard work on the part of a scholar.

<li>But, google the anti-Kurd or anti-Turk one... you get 132 hits and 66 hits... these are not terms in wide currency... which makes the article original research. It's not that there can't be expertise but when you put it under a specific title it has implications... such as that we are citing scholarly sources... I mean, the name is very important... we don't want to call the Yankee-Mets rivalry "Anti-Yankeeism by Mets fans"... there is a rivalry that may notably be mentioned somewhere... but giving it a name that is not in common currency is original research and not something we are supposed to be doing. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 05:00, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Mani, we've had these arguments at other articles. Those books do not prove what you think they prove. The early Arab conquerors did not consider themselves superior just to Persians -- they considered themselves superior to everyone. North Africans, Egyptians, Syrians, Sindhis ... if they weren't Arabs, they were second-class citizens to the later Rashidun and the Umayyads. They were dhimmis, they paid jizya, they had to wear distinctive garments ... none of this was directed at Persians qua Persians. The Arabs did NOT force their subjects to learn Arabic; in fact, they would have preferred it if they didn't learn Arabic. Arabic was the official language of government and religion, which is not the same thing as enforcing it as the language of everyday life. The Islamic conquest section of the Anti-Persianism article is a biased and historically inaccurate polemic, which says a lot more about the mindset of Iranian nationalism than it does about history. As someone who CARES about historical accuracy, I must protest your characterization of that section of the article. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 02:33, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment</b> Note that all the other articles about "anti" this or that don't point fingers. "Anti-Semitism" is allowable; "Anti-Semitism by U.S. citizens" is an accusation. I'd be fine with an "Anti-Iranian sentiments" article.</p>
<p>Also, as others have pointed out, the proponents of this article can't decide whether it's about Iranians or Persians. Citizens of Iran are of many ethnicities, speak many languages, and follow various religions. Sometimes the term "Persian" seems to be used of all of them; sometimes it is used only for the 50% of Iranians who are "ethnically" Persian (which is itself a devil to define and a subject of controversy). Now just "WHO" is this supposed prejudice directed against? I have the impression that current political tensions can lead to animosity towards Iranians in general, whatever their background (animosity not necessarily Arab -- the Bushistas seem to be trying to whip up the same thing in the US). The same way that "Americans" can be hated in some countries whether they're black or white, of Slovak or Mexican stock.</p>
<p>This kind of thing rises and falls according to the political weather. During World War II the U.S. and Russia were allies, and the brave Russian soldier was the U.S.'s friend. Then the Cold War and the same Russian soldier was an evil fiend who wanted to invade and oppress the U.S. (<i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Dawn_afbf.html" title="Red Dawn">Red Dawn</a></i>). After the Iranian Revolution, Iranians became dangerous wild-eyed zealots. In another fifty years ... who knows? Perhaps they'll be the brave allies of the Euro-US Federation in the fight against Uzbeki imperialism. Framing current trands as evidence of a deep-laid plot going back millenia is ... absurd. It doesn't belong in an encyclopedia, UNLESS Zereshk and his friends can come up with cites showing that many Iranians believe it -- in which case it belongs in an article on Iranian politics, or the politics of the Iranian diaspora. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:12, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Iran and Persia ARE used interchangeably often enough and prejudice toward Iran can not be considered unrelated to Persian identity of Iran. When Saddam Hussain attacked Iran, it was all of Iran that was attacked but he did use the Persian vs Arab argument. More importantly, history of Iran is that of Persia since the country was called Persia in the outside world. When we talk about historical stuff we have to use PERSIAN since all Iranians were labeled as such. some people are trying to imply Iran has nothing to do wiht Persia and dislike of Iranians has nothing to do with Persians!! <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGol_cff6.html" title="User:Gol">Gol</a> 10:32, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have read the article and this discussion, and am familiar with other ethnic articles on Wikipedia. This article is typical in content to already listed "Anti-Foo" articles. Though I personally question the entire series, there is no reason to single out this one for deletion. The article is well-sourced, reasonably NPOV (like many articles there is room for improvement), sticks to its subject, and modestly calls the subject a "phenomenon" rather than movement or ideology. The new title is better. NOR should be a concern, but I don't see many conclusions or editorials in the text, rather it seems mostly to summarize the sources, as it should.

Delete - I am familiar with the ethnic issues of the Meddle East region and can confidently say this is a constructed hate page which has no real base.

Please note that the supposed names in the fist line of the articles (عجم ستیزی) also (ایرانی ستیزی) are both in Farsi/Persian words and not Arabic, in effect the writer(s) of the article could not come up with any Arabic word or name for this so cold phenomenon.</p>

<p>Mehrdad should change his name, since <i>Mehrdad</i> (Given by the Sun) is a <b>Persian</b> name. He is an Azeri nationalist and seems to hate Persians. A person like that, with such hatred in his dark heart, does not deserve such a noble name. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 10:46, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Khorshid, I have no hathred for Persians/Fars people at all. In fact I am partly Fars and I have Kermani ansestors, as well as Hamedani as well as Tabrizi so I am Iranian with any definition as well as being Azeri. I belive this ultra nationalistic idealogy of small group of people so called "Roshan Fekran e Fars" (Fars Luminaries) who do not respect the basic rights of other other people in Iran, including the Turks, Kurds, Arabs, Turkmens and Baluch. <a href="../../../m/e/h/User%7EMehrdadd_0feb.html" title="User:Mehrdadd">Mehrdad</a> 15:38, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> as a non-Persian Iranian, I have to say that unforunately both Anti-arabism and Anti-Persianism do really exist and have already had many political implications and induced wars. Therefore I think there is no question about the existence of these phenomena. There is no question about the important consequences of them either. Ajam-Arab story is a long one.

Some changes and additions have been made to improve the clarity of the concepts the article is addressing. I know some people have misgivings about the whole concept of anti-national articles, but apart from this objection, is there any point in continuing this AfD?

<p>Another vanity article for a student film. That the 'official website' cites the creation of this article as 'news' gives it away, really, along with the redlinks. Oh, and the plot also reveals the studentishness: available set (school) + available actors (school kids) = plot (about a school kid in a school).

<li><b>Keep</b> Original poster makes unverified assumptions of the movies based solely upon the plot. "studentishness". Story is based mainly in a psychologist's office and a unamed, enviroment. If the original poster took time to read the screenplay, he would understand that it is not mostly about 'school', as he put it. Nowhere in any of the text and/or official website does it state the ages of anyone involved, therefor, it is incorrect and unfair to assume the ages of the cast/crew bassed upon a couple of sentances, which were not properly read. Shooting has also begun and completion dates are listed, this would mean the title in question is, "In-production" which is an acceptable state. Needless to say, should the project fall through, the article will be deleted. Distribution in New Zealand has been obtained and can be verified if need be, Australia's distribution will most likely be handled independantly. Movie has been submitted to IMDB and is currently in the process of descision. Article is non-biased and formatted correctly, references to it being non-notable are speculation to the popularity of it. Article exists so anyone can look and discover what the movie is if they hear about it. Article is not designed as the original poster claimed, 'vanity'. Nor is it designed as a student film. For it to be a student film, it would require me to be a student of a highschool, college or university. Seems I am neither of these, how can it be a student film? Because it focuses on high school students? Elephant is also listed in here as dealing with high school students and that isn't a student film. Additionally, link on the home page back to this and the reference to 'red' writing are invalid and pointless comments. They serve no purpose and do not affect the explanation. cchamber 17:42pm, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Oppose</b>. I am not familiar with the Wikipedia submission process, but I have been asked to argue in favor of a JerryC Wikipedia submission. JerryC is without a doubt an Internet phenomenon. Youtube, Google Video, and many other video sharing sites are populated with <b>hundreds</b> of videos of people covering (copying/playing) JerryC's Canon Rock. JerryC videos became popular because of the stark contrast between his high end guitar &amp; compositional talent juxtaposed against the humble back drop of his tatty bedroom. If he had recorded his videos on stage, I'm sure few people would have noticed. However, he does currently have a huge Internet following. I run a non profit JerryC video link site: [<a href="http://www.jerryc.co.uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jerryc.co.uk" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>]. I have no financial or contractual link with JerryC (in fact I've only emailed him twice). My site gets 40,000 Unique visitors per month, and has had 8.5 million hits in the last 5 months. I would say, that's popular. I think at the very least, JerryC should get a mention on the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">Internet phenomenon</a> page, but really deserves his own link. It's not about promoting him as an artist, but more about documenting the Internet ripple his video's have caused (the Canon Rock covers). Megazoid --82.152.166.122 19:45, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> Surely if someone has tried to make an article in the past and there are so many viewings he must be at least a "notable artist".

<p>The definiton of notable is worthy of note, remarkable or a person of distinction. Jery C is worthy of note, he is remarkable and he is a person of distinction. He is a very talented guitarist, one could easily say he is a virtuoso. Not only this but he is also a very competant drummer and pianist. Not only this but he is very distinctive as the music he plays is very different to what one would normally hear, unique even, apart from his covers of course! There is a vast amount of interest in him all over the internet so surely he is a notable artist at the very least. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunder_Cat_62bc.html" title="User:Thunder Cat">Thunder Cat</a> 20:39, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> That definition of notable is becoming out of date as there are other people who are popular and notable on the internet alone. Jerry C is an example of them and we should reform our definition of notable to accept people like him.

<li><b>Verification</b> The 15th most viewed video on YouTube, is a cover (copy) of JerryC's Canon Rock video by a young Malaysian - FunTwo.

It has had 4,612,731 views, and was mentioned in an article on The New York Times website [<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/03/arts/03tube.html?ex=1301716800&amp;en=ca77a5cefaee9b3f&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/03/arts/03tube.html?ex=1301716800&amp;en=ca77a5cefaee9b3f&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>]. JerryC is mentioned in both the video, and the article. JerryC's original Canon Rock video has been posted so many times on YouTube, that it has diluted its true ranking unfortunately. A Google search for the term "JerryC" produces 134,000 results [<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22JerryC%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22JerryC%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>]. It is interesting to note, that this is more results, than some of the band entries currently listed on the wikipedia <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">Internet_phenomenon</a> page. For example: "Lemon Demon" [<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Lemon+Demon%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Lemon+Demon%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>] produces 124,000 results.

This article is premature... It's time to <b>delete</b> it until <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is established. Of course, an encyclopedic article would discuss in some length his work (preferably spelled correctly - misspellings stand out when they're red links). I'd be more inclined to accept the article if it truly had significant substance besides the POV/biographical first paragraph.

<p>Below is a paste of my thoughts as an economist on this issue, including a list of ommissions, errors and misleading insinuations. It is my belief this page will never be free of a measure of bias, and as such will lead to a consistent misrepresentation of the facts for every Wiki user.</p>
<p>Ultimately it is not the purpose of this encyclopedia to air misleading statements, errors, and arguements that are so narrow and unverified as to be redundant.</p>
<p>I also wish it suggest that while individual components of the article are factual, the phrasology, presentation, and arguments are not. All the facts can be found elsewhere in wikipedia, and thus we must question what purpose it serves to bring them together so poorly here to substantiate a fundamentally misleading argument.</p>
<p>For every user that reads this article and is entirely convinced due to a lack of economic education, wikipedia has failed. Here now are some of my specific thoughts:</p>
<a name="Fiat_Money" id="Fiat_Money"></a>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Petrodollar_warfare_%282nd_nomination%29_dae7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Petrodollar warfare (2nd nomination)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fiat Money</span></h4>
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, the point about fiat money is largely a platitude, nor important in substantiating the theory.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most if not all currencies are in the form of fiat money (whether they be convertible or not to a commodity). Even in the century from 1800 to 1900, Triffin identified that 95% of new money creation on the European continent was in the form of credit or fiat money - a period largely claimed to be dominated by the Gold or Bi-metallic standard and exchange rate stability.</p>
<p>The principle of accepting the value of fiat money is now engrained in our culture, and moreover backed up by the fact that the currency is "legal tender". I.e. it is illegal not to accept the money in settlement of a debt or other contract.</p>
<p>My point is, that this article is misleading in how it presents the link between the physical fiat money and its value as being weak, when in fact it very strong, nor would it be any stronger if it were convertible to a commodity.</p>
<p>If anything this article should focus on whether the currency is MIS-valued, or will receive a SHOCK to its value as a result of exogenous impacts. To play devil's advocate, if the dollar were freely convertible to gold or some other commodity, and the dollar took a hit in value (say to a fall in international reserve holdings), the dollar would still suffer. The economy would shift from the dollar to gold, in an exact parrellel of a shift from the dollar to another currency.</p>
<p>If we went even further to suggest that the US issue actual gold coins, the theory states that in order to maintain parity, the money supply must vary with the balance of payments. If gold is over-valued at the mint (i.e. there is a reduction in demand for the gold dollar, and the nominal value of gold is greater than that of the domestic currency exchange value) then you will still get a flight of capital from the US, and instead of a shift in currency values (since the gold price is essentially fixed) it would be prices of good that went through the roof instead.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this argument that the a currency is somehow flimsy, and more vulnerable as a result of being a fiat currency is ridiculous. No system of currency could protect against the shocks described in this article.</p>
<a name="M3_removal_from_the_statistics" id="M3_removal_from_the_statistics"></a>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Petrodollar_warfare_%282nd_nomination%29_dae7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Petrodollar warfare (2nd nomination)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">M3 removal from the statistics</span></h4>
<p>While the article credits the official reasons for the abandonment of the M3 measure, its insinuations are towards that of a modicum of duplicity. Not only is there a risk of this being defamatory, but it ignores the true nature of econometrics. Constantly our system of economic measures are being changed. A cursory glance of the statistics published in the economist will show the myriad of different money measures used across the Globe.</p>
<p>Specifically, correlation between movements in M2 and M3 for the last 6 years are almost 1 to 1. In fact, M2 moves slightly ahead of M3, so any shift in M3, can be slightly predicted by shifts in M2.</p>
<p>The loss of the M3 statistic is justifiable, and moreover is no hinderance to economists in that M2 is virtually a perfect proxy for M3.</p>
<a name="A_GLARING_OMMISSION_in_the_argument" id="A_GLARING_OMMISSION_in_the_argument"></a>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Petrodollar_warfare_%282nd_nomination%29_dae7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Petrodollar warfare (2nd nomination)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A GLARING OMMISSION in the argument</span></h4>
<p>A signification topic for debate among American economists is the issue of China's currency dealings. Greenspan himself has critisized China's maintainance of an undervalued currency versus the dollar.</p>
<p>How do they achieve this? By buying as many dollars as they can get their hands on, and selling their domestic currency. Ultimately....why would an administration hell bent on protecting its domestic currency from losing its value through a fall in foriegn holdings, so openly critisize and condemn the policy which results in the largest foriegn, non-utilised stock of dollars on the planet.</p>
<p>This theory is....largely, rubbish in my opinion, poorly argued, lacking in decent evidence, with extremely tenuous links and furthermore is incredibly short sighted.</p>
<p>It is unencyclopedic, and more importantly, actively misleading and should be removed. I should also point out that many developing nations peg to the dollar, or adopt a full or partial policy of dollarisation (i.e. using dollars as the domestic currency) and these policies are generally opposed by the US policy makers due to the inflationary impact.</p>
<p><br />
....what I ask you to focus on, is that this article will never be anything more than a collection of disparate facts, widely accessible in properly constructed NPOV factual articles across wikipedia, laiden with bias, POV and misrepresentation of economic theory. What purpose then does it serve?</p>
<p>In my opinion, at the least, it does not serve the fact seaker. If nothing else, any impact is greatly exaggerated (an always will be). A study by Flood and Rose estimates the losses at 1/200th of GDP, in terms of lost seignorage.</p>

<li>OK. But we have an article on creationism, too; so "The theory is whack," is an argument for pointing out that it is rejected by mainstream economists, not for deleting the article. A google search reveals that the only person who seems to use the term is the author of a book by the same name. <b>Change</b> to a discussion of it as a book, not a hypothesis. Encourage Unclebob to quote economists <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">other</a> than himself who criticize the basic ideas therein. --<a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> 13:02, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Some valid points there. However, this topic is so out of left field that there is little or no mainstream criticism of it - this it will be essentially impossible to provide a balanced view on the topic. What little evidence exists to disprove the theory and more over the uneconomic inferences drawn were listed in my critique above. Much of the theoretical analysis above is made on the basis of models created by "other" economists. I apologise if it was not wiktiquette or some such to suggest deletion, but you be hard pressed to find any other encyclopedia giving space to conspiracy theorist's ravings, based on inferences that are counter factual and counter theoretical. There is nothing counter factual about creationism, whereas the inferences in this article are, and will continue to be in order to serve the purpose of the conspiracy creators - long may their books sales continue.</dd>

Its about factual and theoretical errors, being consistentently represented as accurate because of the skewed nature of the public debate and seeming importance attached to that.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I've read the article in full. The subject is notable, but the treatment of it is seriously flawed. It should be rewritten about the book. As it stands, it is just a collection of wacky conspiracy theories. Unclebob made a procedural misstep by bringing this here, but this should be forgiven a newbie. If we keep, we should support him rewriting this steamy pile of pony loaf.

<p><br />
In general I think the consensus is that the subject is sufficient ACTIVE, at least in the internet domain, to warrant inclusion. In one week from now (when I am liberated from exam considerations) I will re-write the article focusing on the claims of the theory, and a more full and cited criticism and theoretical de-bunking section. I apologise for not using the AfD properly...albeit I believe more effective discussion resulted than would have ever been possible in the discussion page&#160;:p. Feel free to Aye or Nay to this idea.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any recommendations as to what procedure would be used if some other "economist" attempted to re-assert the haphazard economics on a period basis, either by deleting the critcisms or by other means etc. would be appreciated. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUnclebob_8bc8.html" title="User:Unclebob">Unclebob</a> 18:20, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Per my comments from the last AfD on this: Non-notable. This seems like a vanity page to showcase someone's research (though it is so poorly written as to suggest it probably wasn't the work of the author showcased). As pointed out on its talk page, most of the google hits for this page point to advertisements for this guy's book or to blogs. On Lexis/Nexis I searched full text for all available dates for "petrodollar warfare" in major papers, then in all news transcripts, then in all wire reports, for all available dates, and did not come up with a single citation for an article mentioning that phrase. <b>Not one</b>. A search of EBSCOHost for academic journals found not a single use of the phrase. A <a href="http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Petrodollar+Warfare&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Petrodollar+Warfare&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">google search of books</a> mentioning the phrase returns nothing. The <b>only</b> results on Google scholar is <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22petrodollar+warfare%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22petrodollar+warfare%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">a link to an essay by Clark</a> posted to a site called "ratville times" and three other pieces that list Clark's book as a reference but do not use the phrase "petrodollar warfare." <b>None</b> of those four sources is from a peer reviewed article or even from an article published in print (as opposed to on websites). This looks like a vanity page for a young scholar. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 19:39, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not going to weigh in on whether the article should be deleted or not. Perhaps it'd make more sense as part of the main "Rescue Rangers" article. However, I think it's definitely notable, just as much as other major furry works like Jack or DMFA which aren't under debate. It's really a fully-fledged fan-created graphic novel, and was created and released as such. It's an accomplishment which is fairly unique, as most other comics are episodic on-going affairs, often times lacking a single cohesive storyline. Considering OMaM's readership, if it were a regularly comic, instead of a completed work, this discussion probably wouldn't even be coming up. I was directed to this work by Mat Sherer of Badly Drawn Kitties fame, in an off-handed comment he made about a year ago in his blog. (Unfortunately, the Internet Archive is down at the moment, so I couldn't try and look for it. If corroboration is necessary, I'm sure he wouldn't mind speaking for himself. Heck, why not ask notables in community to weigh in?) Mat isn't even necessarily a part of the CDRR-specific fandom, but he seems well-connected to other notables in the community, and his comment mentioned the waves this comic was making. I think that speaks loudly enough about the level of impact it's had. --BeeBot 17:06, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Though this may be the only page I've contributed to, I hold no association with "Of Mice and Mayhem" or its author. I use wikipedia quite regularly. However, this is the first time I've come across a page that was nominated for deletion. Given the contents of the page and the subject it was referencing, I was compelled to open a wikipedia account and voice my opinion on the matter. I would also like to note that I have not participated in alerting anyone to this page's impending deletion. I am merely a voice among many who feels this subject is notable enough to warrant a reference on this site. And though I am aware this in not up for a vote, I'm hoping the administrators will at least take this under consideration and reconsider. –BabylonLegacy 12:04, 1 June 2006.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I saw this page ages ago, and considered deleting it. However, I put it off to go after even more useless webcomic crap that we had lying around and never came back to it. The guy seems to have some iota of talent, but the arguments above say it's notable to the Chip n Dale fandom? That really isn't enough, because I'd vote to delete an article on the Chip n Dale fandom any day. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 05:26, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: There must be dozens of pages about fandoms, series, webcomics and shows that aren't as noteable as "Of Mice And Mayhem". Yet they deserve a place to. Furthermore, most people got it wrong that it's important to Rescue Rangers fandom. It's considered an accomplishment in the whole furry and anthromorphic fandom. Most of these fans, when asked if they know this comic, are likely to give a positive answer. Even if some have never watched the series itself. And the comic's creator still recieves praise for his work. I find the claim that it has little noteability very dubious. ---CD--- 11:34 2 June 2006 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 62.45.51.85 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.45.51.85_2b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.45.51.85">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd><b>Comment</b> -- an explanation is in order. During Oxford's terms, there is some serious intercollegiate rowing that takes place. However, there are also many more low quality races before the main events, in which a great many social crews with silly names compete, usually as an excuse to go out and drink heavily the following night. This is one such crew, from literally hundreds each year. (I still have my crew shirt with "Demon Axe Warriors From Oblivion" on it, somewhere). Anyhow, they're not associated with the Boat Race crew <a href="../../../o/u/b/OUBC_401a.html" title="OUBC">OUBC</a> in any way, besides using the same stretch of water. Fun, really excellent muscle-tearing drunken fun, but not notable. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></dd>

<li>Mark David Chapman killed a man, not to mention a highly regarded singer/songwriter and Norma McCorvey was part of a monumental decision in the US Court system and reversed her decision.

<li>I still think your definition of 15 minutes of fame is drastically flawed. You listed people that have an impact. 15 minutes of fame has been and will be recorded into this site. You are trying to imply that 15 minutes of fame, something that has an importance that immedially goes away, has to be something that has lasting effects. There are many fades, and other events that quickly wash out but have articles here. Does that mean we should wipe out Jimstown because it doesn't have a lasting social effect? <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 19:41, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>User:Put It Down Boy has been quite persistent in creating what are a string of hoax articles related to the fictional (or at the very least, extremely non-notable) band "Evil Chemistry." No substantial Google hits for the band, the albums, the members, etc. Quite interesting for a band that released an album that "has sold 5.4 million units in the US." <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 17:11, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Even if it was "the first BitTorrent search engine", this does not make it notable in my opinion. "BitTorrent search engine" is not a significant website category. It is just a BitTorrent index that happens to also have a search function. BitTorrent indexes were plentiful before Zoozle. Furthermore, just demonstrating that Zoozle did exist in February 2004 does not prove that no other similar site existed before. At the end of the day, this article does not adhere to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../h/a/a/User%7EHaakon_f760.html" title="User:Haakon">Haakon</a> 19:48, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

Quotes: "Do you like zoozle? Then add us in Wikipedia. May they stop deleting us&#160;:)" "If you see more <b>content related</b> articles, may add us&#160;;)" This is their "help us" page, largely dedicated to encouraging fans to linkspam Wikipedia. To see the effect of this, notice that several of the keep votes here are by low-editcount users.

<p>Ok. Here is my suggestion: i will take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB</a> and i will modify zoozle to fit the standarts. i will remove the "please at us to the wikipedia" on the helpus.htm site and few things more. lets work together to find a solution that is "win-win" for everyone of us. please give us a chance. we can add a link back from zoozle to a special wikipedia category that needs to be focused working at. as said before we have 30 000 unique visitors on zoozle everyday. with a link back to wikipedia with the comment to "activly take part in the wikipedia community by providing help &amp; articles" it should be possible for zoozle to contribute back to the wiki family. so everyone is helped!</p>
<p>let me summarize what Torsten and I will do on the weekend: - at the upcoming weekend i will modify zoozle to fullfill <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB</a> needs - i will remove the "add us to wiki" from the help pages ( en + ge ) - we will add a link to wiki + usefull comment to <a href="http://www.zoozle.net/zoozle.php" class="external free" title="http://www.zoozle.net/zoozle.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.zoozle.net/zoozle.php</a> - the page that a search query goes to and that has about 950 000 visits so far in may 06</p>
<p>I would please you in return to give us a change! a change to change zoozle - a change for zoozle in the wikipedia community?</p>
<p>Yours, Sebastian ~~~~. --Thecerial</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot simply "modify" Zoozle to become notable, which is what <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is about. Wikipedia articles live or die on their own merits, not on some "agreement" or covenant between Wikipedia and webmasters. <a href="../../../h/a/a/User%7EHaakon_f760.html" title="User:Haakon">Haakon</a> 22:44, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are votes against deletion and for deletion and i see no "winner". Thecerial descriped a good solution. @Haakon: I will never understand people like you&#160;;) Information should be free! <a href="../../../d/a/t/User%7EData5000_e704.html" title="User:Data5000">Data5000</a> 12:58 2 June 2006 (MET)
<ul>
<li>That's because Haakon is committed to building an encyclopedia while you seem to be trying to use wikipedia to get traffic to your site. This sort of thing is a common problem here.

<li>This is a valid aspect of UK planning, which has become more notable since Merton LBC 1st did it. It is less known as the 'Merton rule' nowadays, but this term rolls off of the tounge much better then the <i>ten percent of the energy used by a new development must be produced by renewable energy hopefully on site, but off site if needs be. This will be enforced through Development Control and a section 106 agreement ... rule</i>.</li>
<li>So yes its a Neologisim, but then so are the 'Newbury criteria' and thats common usage.</li>
<li>The text is blatantly ripped a promotional site, as i pointed out in its talk page. But i guess you new page patrol and deletion peeps can't be bothered to actually research stuff before you add that tag you love so much huh? It should remain as a much shortened article after it has had a re-write.

<li>Yes, I did copy and paste this from TheMertonRule.org<a href="http://themertonrule.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://themertonrule.org" rel="nofollow">[67]</a>, and originally copied that from solarcentury<a href="http://solarcentury.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://solarcentury.com" rel="nofollow">[68]</a> too, but I am the person who set-up TheMertonRule.org and I have full permission from solarcentury to use their stuff.

<li>I acknowledge that the article as stands in not really in encyclopaedia style - I just didn't have the time to edit it when I whacked it up, and was lazily hoping that some experienced wikipedians might help me clean it up and make it more appropriate.&#160;;)</li>
<li>Like <a href="../../../b/j/r/User%7EBjrobinson_2266.html" title="User:Bjrobinson">Bjrobinson</a> points out, this <i>is</i> a valid aspect of UK planning, so I think it should be included here.</li>
<li>'The Merton Rule' is common usage in the renewable energy industry too (its not just planners who use the phrase).</li>

<dd>So we have a clash between policies. The fact that he was fast in recreating a deleted page (itself grounds for a speedy deletion) bothers me. The fact that this is vanity, itself grounds for deletion, bothers me. But Roger C. Ambrose is notable enough for a Wikipedia article (it should be <b>disambig</b>uated from two actors named Roger Ambrose). So how do we split this baby? <b>Move</b> this to Roger C. Ambrose (now a redirect page), make Roger Ambrose a disambiguation page, and state in no uncertain terms that such autobiographies are not permitted on Wikipedia. The advertising must be eliminated, too - and the awards section and everything with his web site address must go. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 21:03, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Maxamegalon2000, As I follow the discussion and arguements back and forth, I am confused by your advise to me here to collect as many independent sources as I can find for this article. If I am hearing several other editors on this, even if I did this I am not allowed to be involved in the article. This needs clarification. Additionally on the Bob Fink article/discussion I see that editors frown on even close "associates" from being involved. I want to play by the rules and get along here but as a newbie I am at a loss as to the "yes" and/or "no" of this all. Roger ambrose 01:23, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Okay, I originally closed this AfD early as a G4; however, after further reading of statements here, on the article's talk page, and on the article itself, I find it inappropriate to close the discussion early and have reopened it to run its course. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 05:00, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I respect your vote to delete, but breaking those guidelines aren't reasons for deletion. They are reasons for clean up and reasons to review an article, but simply containing original research, unverified statements and things that aren't verifiable aren't causes for deleting whole articles. Especially when one can independently verify that the subject has achieved some note in his particular field. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 15:46, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>That's the whole problem. One cannot "independently verify that the subject has achieved some note in his particular field." Indeed, I have independently verified that he has not achieved note in his particular field, yet you have chosen to reject my personal research as "unverifiable." So where is the verification for your so-called "independent" research, Batman? Cuthbert11 3 June 2006</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>NOTE</b> Cuthbert11 you have not verified anything, you cannot call a friend up (which you probably never did anyway) and say "well my friend says this..." that's non-verifiable. The listing on IMDB, while only a listing, indicates that this person has been active in a particular field for 25+ years, and has (through two emmy awards) achieved notability for it. I wonder why your only edits from the username of "Cuthbert11" are to this page? Who are you a sockpuppet of? <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 15:22, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>According to Cuthbert11 above, the article was deleted as a nn/vanity page and swiftly reposted again. Swiftly recreating a deleted page is grounds for speedy deletion. However there is a conflict in the guidlines, since the subject's notability is sufficient to deserve an article. Mr Ambrose hasn't said why he so badly wants his name to appear in Wikipedia's electronic ink (and there is frankly no reason why he should have to), but someone apparently quickly recreating a vanity-style article on themselves like this disturbs me. Perhaps this has tainted my judgement in deciding which policy to apply, but I feel much more comfortable selecting the one labelled "delete". Deleting the page is not "final", it simply provides the opportunity for someone to rewrite it from a clean slate using published sources without having to concern themselves with the baggage in the existing article. <a href="../../../j/l/l/User%7EJll_a192.html" title="User:Jll">Jll</a> 16:12, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A problem is that some AfD are often markedly improved after being listed, but people obviously vote on the listed version. Maybe that's why you didn't give a Keep or a Delete or even a Neutral? I'm inclined to improve this article because I think it has the makings. But I'm not going to do so, because the consensus might be deletion and it will be a waste of effort for me. This is yet another case of an article that could have benefited from Cleanup being sent straight to AfD. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 06:26, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you want to improve it, there's nothing stopping you from doing so. Deletion by AFD isn't a bar against creating a new article on the same topic. This article as it is right now is useless, but you can copy it to your userspace, work on it there, and resubmit it once you feel it would pass an AFD. Honestly, though, I am not seeing any non-self-generated information out there, so I'm not sure how easy it would be for anyone to write a good article on the subject. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 15:52, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Uncertain</b>. I'm split on this because a lot of this is good info, but at the same time almost every character on the show at least a few times gets hints of their own...very few characters are really truly implied strongly to be gay...perhaps not enough to justify a page. But at the same time...it seems like such a waste. Maybe we should make one single page for things like this. To put in things of cultural significance...misc information in general.

<li><b>Merge and Rename</b> The information at the bottom in terms of LGBT content and reactions to the content are the best portion of the article. The article should be renamed to LGBT references in the Simpsons, with the bits about each character being trimmed down and/or moved to the specific character's page - a list of the characters referenced along with a one-line summary next to each one will suffice when set alongside the overall big picture. --ElizabethFong 02:15, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<b>We're not free publicity??? Are you an owner of Wikipedia?? Do you speak for them?? NO Publicity Sought!</b> The criterion being applied to music and record companies on Wikipedia, is currently very flawed. The main reason, is because it does not reflect the true state of the music industry. There are, in fact, TWO sides to this industry; major labels and true independents. A record company calling themselves "independent", who is charting on commercial radio; is NOT a true independent record company. Independent record companies, who are unaffiliated with major labels; are being unfairly locked out of the market, therefore UNABLE to chart. This is NOT publicity, nor is it vanity. It is the truth. This encyclopedia should address current issues, as they really are. Legendheart</p>

<li>As I have already stated I do have sympathy with your position but the core of this is that a label, whether independent or affiliated to a major, will, on point of fact, struggle to assert notability having only released 2 albums.

<li><b>Comments</b>. Uncyclopedic diatribe about Wikipedia is removed as unrelated to subject of article. Links and assertions of notability must be made in the article itself. Also; the history of recorded music in the United States is full of independent labels that made it big, most notably Atlantic Records, Motown, Elektra, and A&amp;M Records... Some of these labels made it because of a large stable of acts performing on massive US tours. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 23:41, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li><b>No Delete</b>. These aforementioned labels are in fact major labels. They were only able to "make it big" AFTER they had affiliated themselves with a major label. The truth is, NO true independent label "makes it" without a major label affiliation. The "history of recorded music in the United States" DOES NOT show independents "making it big" because the industry has been monopolized for decades by the majors.</li>

<li>I suggest you double-check your research regarding this matter. A&amp;M no longer exists after merger with Interscope Records; the other three were notable independents two decades before they were bought up by majors (records from Motown were originally sold from the trunk of Berry Gordy's car a few years before a period in which one-sixth of all singles sold in the US were from that company, for example). The examples I cited should be inspiration for persevering in a climate in which it is difficult to get a toehold, but it does happen: see <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Row_Records_d0bb.html" title="Death Row Records">Death Row Records</a>. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 02:06, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>True, to a point. There is more to having an LLC, than merely "paying a small fee". Having an LLC also means assuming the responsibility of business ownership. This is NO SMALL task, it is actually a VERY SERIOUS matter. Anyone who is serious about conducting their business, AS A BUSINESS; will form a proper company structure. Legend Heart Records, LLC is a boniafide LLC registered in the state of Washington. It is a GENUINE business, and independent record company.

<li><b>No Delete</b> Sounds like thinly disguised major label sympathizers on here. There have been record companies that started with one artist, since the 50's and 60's. This has no bearing on notability or goals reached. I know many folks, including myself who have followed independent acts, bought their recordings, etc. But when you request them on commercial radio? Forget it. Hey! Certain people are afraid to rub the majors the wrong way, dead wood can't blossom into a flower. Good luck Legend Heart.

<p><b>Not Delete</b> - Just for the record I didn't stumble across Legend Heart Records. I am familiar with Wikipedia, but have not joined until today. I am a lover of independent music, although I am not a musician. I do have friends who are musicians, and they mentioned this article to me. Not that I owe you any explanation. I read the article and it doesn't sound like advertising to me. It sounds like a company description. Sorry, Grand, Fan, or whoever you are...but I just don't believe you. If you are a musician like you say you are, then you are either with a major label or you are a major label sympathizer, and that in itself is very sad. I would suggest looking for sock puppets elsewhere. Maybe even in the mirror (Not making any judgements about you of course).Rikrok77</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I know I said I was done with this but the link in the article is grossly misleading. Business Wire describe themselves as <i>the leading source for full-text breaking news releases, multimedia and regulatory filings for companies and groups throughout the world</i>. In other words, this is Legend Heart's own press release, repeated <i>verbatim</i>. The idea that they think they are the only band in the world ever to release their own record is quite the most ridiculous notion I have encountered anywhere on these pages. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 07:32, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment:</b> What's really ridiculous in reality, is someone who opens their mouth without knowing what they are talking about or having the intelligence to read something thoroughly before embarrassing themselves. This would constitute being grossly ignorant of the truth. Case and point? The only one saying that Legend Heart --the band-- is the first band to ever release their own record, is Ac@osr!</p>
<p>What is being stated is, that Legend Heart Records, not the band, is the first self-discovered, label-band. As for the two posts following Ac@osr, apparently research is "grossly" absent from these obviously lame "run with the pack" statements. This is becoming a huge waste of time, on something that has proven to be extremely not worth dignifying.</p>
<p><b>You Can't Argue with Ignorance:</b> It is now very clear, that this forum intends to exclude Legend Heart Records from being included in Wikipedia's list of independent record companies; regardless of what anyone says outside of your ignorant clique. Truth is, Legend Heart Records is working very hard to improve fairness for all true independent record labels; in the music industry. This, by the way, <b>is notable</b> (do yourselves a favor, and look up the word 'notable' in the dictionary). A little research on your part would have uncovered this publicly well-known fact, but then you are not interested in knowing the facts; because your closed minds were already made up from the onset of this discussion. The good work <b>will continue</b>, regardless of people like you. <b>You are insignificant</b> to the notability and success of this independent label, and others like it.</p>
<p>To the people who feign sympathy for the "plight of indie labels." You are offensive and insincere; therefore, dishonorable in character. Legend Heart Records does not depend on the acceptance of people like you. The good work being done is <b>self-evident</b>. The <b>future is bright</b> for independent music. This you can <b>never</b> take away. The fact that Wikipedia depends on donations, speaks for itself. And where the primary donations come from doesn't take much to figure out, or the real reason you have fought so hard to <b>exclude</b> Legend Heart Records from being listed in Wikipedia's list of independent record labels.</p>
<p>You are highly unenlightened and closed minded. <b>Scholars in your own minds.</b> The public will know about this experience, and how we were STONEWALLED and EXCLUDED from Wikipedia's list of independent record labels. Everything comes out in the wash. Have a party stroking each other's sad egos. We will not waste another second of our time, or energy. Legendheart</p>

<li>Legendheart, I had made only constructive comments, not a decision, until your <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>. Frankly, I was hoping that someone would add to the article enough to establish notabiility of the label, or of the band that appears to be synonymous with it (OBTW, check your history and you'll notice that pop/rock is riddled with acts with their own labels prior to having a contract or even a hit - <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> recorded and "released" his first single on a vanity label before he signed with Sun Records, for example. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> did something very similar, too). I wish everybody the best of luck, but there's no stonewalling here: we have repeatedly stated what was needed for inclusion and it's become clear that it cannot be provided at this time. That doesn't mean that it cannot be provided when the label becomes more established, however, and despite the rant and diatrible above, I look forward to that occasion.

<p>Damn...here I go wandering in as an anon despite promising myself not to and I find an article on a subject I'd written about elsewhere. I thought I'd extend the courtesy of replacing the adspeak with an article I'd done at Wikia's Radio Control wiki. Arenacale hit it on the head; most Jada toy cars are "urbanized" late models with "dub" wheels, stereo amps, candy paint and the like. They also have a line of toy R/C cars. For the record, I've done this as a courtesy to Wikipedia since I do remain active on other Wikia sites.

<li><b>Keep</b>. What terrible confusion - why is Doggbert voting against an article he created?

<dd>Again, don't create lists under such a title as 'SERIES' as you did earlier, and at least say what the list is at the top of the article before dumping miles of stuff, and you may have a chance ... <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquendil_375b.html" title="User:Equendil">Equendil</a> 17:52, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>OK, I've done all I can (and will) do to this. To Doggbert: Sorry about the confusion. I hope you understand Wikipedia a bit better now. To the rest of you: It's been nice swinging by if only for a brief time. Regards, Lucky 6.9 15:46, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>--Doggbert 16:27, 31 May 2006 (UTC) Thanks for the edit. That's basically the same outline I created earlier. I hope it doesn't get deleted again.</p>

<p>This is a list of news programs on a small TV network, which are already listed on that station's page.

In spite of this, the article has no real information that is not contained at the station's site.

Were we to be using the terminology as descriptive in an article, I'd object; here, though, our article is apropos of a trope that is increasingly common (to be sure, if the article is not/cannot be properly sourced w/r/to the frequency with which the term is used/the prominence of certain users, deletion would be in order). The article oughtn't to include original research, of course; instead of attempting to prove the correctness of the phrase, it ought to detail the arguments of others who make claims for and against the phrase.

<li><b>Question:</b> There may be a better place for this, but I don't know where. Homey has now re-titled this article so "phrase" is no longer in the title. I moved it back, he moved it back again. During the period this article is being considered for deletion, wouldn't it be reasonable for the title to at least remain the same? It is even more objectionable without "phrase" in the title. Homey also says it is "non-standard" to have "phrase" in the title.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Characterization contained in title may be disputed, but the phrase itself is undoubtedly in notable usage. Having seen some delete votes, <i>every single one</i> seems to be on the basis of factual/political opposition to the analysis done using the term; no delete voters actually even tries to deny the notability of the term itself (or really, the NPOV of the article as a whole). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 01:20, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

I distinguish the two by noting that this phrase is notable not solely for the message it conveys, but also for its prominent and frequent usage, as against the Saudi phrase, which yields only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Saudi+apartheid%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Saudi+apartheid%22" rel="nofollow">115 Google hits</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 02:16, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The point is that the phrase is in wide usage, not that it is being used to demonize Israel. As <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> notes, the phrase "Saudi apartheid" is not widely used (I would note that the comparison of Israel with South Africa partly arises from its historically close relations with SA during the SA apartheid years). Just because you disagree with the politics of a phrase, this doesnt change the significance of its wide usage. Wikipedia is not censored in that way. Anyway, it is also used in contexts where the phrase is refuted and debated - [<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=site%3Ahaaretz.com+israel+apartheid&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=site%3Ahaaretz.com+israel+apartheid&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">400 hits on the website of the leading Israeli newspaper</a>] <i><b><a href="../../../h/a/a/Haaretz.html" title="Haaretz">Haaretz</a></b></i> (and most of the hits are to do with Israel, not South Africa) (corrected previous 26400 hit result due to typo.

<dd>Israel officially opposed the apartheid system in South Africa, but was also against international sanctions against South Africa. There is a long history of military cooperation and trade between the two countries which continued through the 1980s when international sanctions against South Africa were implemented. South African uranium was vital to Israel's nuclear weapon program. In exchange, Israel helped pre-apartheid South Africa develop their own nuclear bombs.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> it is not our job to determine whether a topic belongs based on whether we personally like a term or phrase but rather to determine whether that term or phrase has entered either the academic or popular lexicon. Like it or not <i>Israeli apartheid</i> is a widely used term with a specific meaning. A google search of the phrase returns 258,000 hits <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22israeli+apartheid%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22israeli+apartheid%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[83]</a> we also have "Israeli apartheid week" on many campuses and the phrase has been used widely in the media. Our job therefore is not to censor a phrase we do not like but to ensure that the article on that phrase is balanced and NPOV. Merging this article with <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-occupied_territories.html" title="Israeli-occupied territories">Israeli-occupied territories</a> as some have suggested is not viable since the phrase has also been used to describe Israeli policies within the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_line.html" title="Green line">Green line</a> as well as in the Occupied Territories (even though some reserve the phrase for the latter. Merging with <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a> is also not viable as the term "Israeli apartheid" predates that project by at least a dozen years and is intended to address much more than that. Instead of trying to ban the term opponents should be working to improve the article and make sure it's balanced and NPOV. Some who hate the term realise that that is not enough to justify deletion, <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">User:IZAK</a> for instance, no slouch when it comes to defending Israel, has posted the following on <a href="../../../i/s/r/Talk%7EIsraeli_apartheid_%28phrase%29_7beb.html" title="Talk:Israeli apartheid (phrase)">Talk:Israeli apartheid (phrase)</a>:</li>

<dd><i>To Zeq: This phrase exists and is very "popular" today (in my view it's unfortunate, but what can you do, we cannot control the universe). The phrase is coming up more and more in the media, academia, and in political debates, so it is a valid Wikipedia article, no question about it. It can present all the views in the body of the article. There is nothing to fear. I think it is too early to ask that the article go to "Request for Comment". If you and Homey can calm down and debate it rationally then it can be resolved here. Let us ask other more seasoned editors to give their views here first. Stay calm, everyone.

<dd>Homey: Your point is well-taken. Yet, I do not see the need for stridency. Israel is a democracy that allows freedom of speech and is mature and strong enough to allow people to voice their views, even when they are repulsive. So far, the only person they banned in Israel was Rabbi Kahane, because he was too "racist", but it seems that many Israelis can live with being tagged "apartheid this-and-that" by leftists and Arabs, so be it. Let's see what Arabs can live with in their "democracies". <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 23:12, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not saying that it is correct to use the term "Israeli apartheid" to describe the treatment of Israeli Arabs, personally I think the usage is problamatic. My point is that it is widely used in this way meaning that a merger wouldn't work. It's not for us to dictate how the phrase should be used though I think an article should be NPOV and not act as if the term is correct or accurate. Homey 23:16, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Viriditas. "WHAT?!", you say? The fact that there are articles in the Jewish community that attack and denounce this phrase is evidence enough of its notability. If this phrase were dealt with in a NPOV manner, as all articles should, then it will not become a soapbox. WP:NOT a soapbox was intended to guard against people enforcing their own viewpoint on an article. In addition, Other phrases have been included in Wikipedia, as other editors have mentioned, and they have not become soapboxes for <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">anti-Islamism</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/t/Better_dead_than_red.html" title="Better dead than red">anti-Communism</a>, etc. POV Magnet or POV Warring is not a reason to delete. All articles have the potential to become POV magnets, it only depends on the ferocity of the editors to push their own pov. "POV Title" does not apply because the phrase itself is POV, not the article. Policy says, "All Wikipedia articles must be written from a neutral point of view, representing views fairly and without bias." However, one must realize that certain titles will result in POV articles. POV Title is simply a simplified way of saying, "the article is POV because the title is POV." In this case, the title is POV but the article can be NPOV. The phrase was coined by a Jewish person, Uri Davis, and used by Desmond Tutu. I don't see how they are "leftist" media, nor nonnotable. <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECopysan_6de1.html" title="User:Copysan">Copysan</a> 00:20, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well said. I have always liked how good Wiki articles on <b>controversial</b> topics were; proof that the Wikipedia process can actually work.

<li>By now, I was particularly careful in my choosing article titles to be NPOV.

The words you mentioned above are stable common 1-word slurs found in dictionaries. The 2-word combination <i>Israeli apartheid</i> is a neologism slapped together and [ab]used as a political epithet in Cold War and antisemitic propaganda. What's next? Arab intransigence? French promiscuousness? German cruelty? (FTR, I have utmost respect to these and other peoples). I am sure you'll find a bunch of google hits for these. BTW, why is <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Canuckistan_87ee.html" title="Soviet Canuckistan">Soviet Canuckistan</a> a redir?

<li>Because the article is showing the phrase as the object of discussion, not the elements of apartheid supposedly apparent in Israel's domestic policy. There needs to be a distinction between the phrase itself and the policies. They are two separate things to be discussed, and I think some of the editors here don't understand that. However, if a discussion about the elements of apartheid supposedly apparent in Israel's domestic policy were created, then I would support merging Israeli apartheid (the phrase) into a section in the larger article about the elements. Then, it would be relevent to the greater dicussion. <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECopysan_6de1.html" title="User:Copysan">Copysan</a> 02:56, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Umm Homey: Regardless if you are right or wrong -- you should NOT have made a change to the title of this article in the MIDDLE of this heated vote and debate as presumably people who have been voting, particulalrly in the early stages, did so with the original title "Israeli apartheid (phrase)" around. Your actions, as with blocking <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">User:Zeq</a> whilst you were having a discussion with him, are unbecoming of an admin and could be <i>interpreted</i> as both serious POV-pushing and an unfair power-play (having the buttons to switch around redirects and titles of articles) by an admin. You need to take a deep breath methinks and take a few steps back and let the debate unfold in full BEFORE making final changes. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 04:28, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Izak, see my "Question" above. After Homey changed it, I changed it back, but he reverted it. Now, there is a discussion (mostly between me and him) on the article's talk page over what the name should be, at the same time as there is this discussion here over whether the article should exist or not. It didn't seem right to me, either. However, for the moment, I am leaving it as is, otherwise, it is heading toward a mutual 3RR violation. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 04:34, 31 May 2006 (UTC) (Edited own comment -- <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 04:36, 31 May 2006 (UTC))

<dd>Homey, I appreciate the action that you took here on the name (although I have since had to move it back since someone else changed it), but I do not agree with your intended action if the deletion request fails. I have read and re-read <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_policy_7dd3.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming policy">Wikipedia:Naming policy</a> and there is nothing in there that prohibits a parenthetical to indicate that the subject of a title is a phrase as opposed to an actual thing, process, phenomenon or whatever. As I said on the article's talk page, the fact that parentheticals are discussed only in connection with disambiguation pages, does not mean that is the only time they can be used. Therefore I suggest that if this article is not deleted, you initiate a discussion of renaming the article, including your opinions about what the naming policy is or what it should be, <i>before</i> moving the article. Maybe that needs to be the <i>next</i> vote created by this ill-advised article. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 19:12, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So why do you think that the procedure advised in <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_b839.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming">Wikipedia:Naming</a> of proposing a change of practice at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_b869.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions</a> should not be followed in this case?Homey 19:16, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Because as far as I can see, no change in policy (probably a more applicable term than "practice") is being proposed. You have not shown me anything that says that this parenthetical in the title is contrary to current policy. (And you don't need to refer to my quip about "maybe it's time for a new standard," that was based on <b>your</b> representation that the parenthetical was against the rules, which I believed at the time, but which upon actually reading the rules, does not appear to be correct.) <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 19:43, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: Earlier in discussion, it was described as a 'rabid, polemical, revisionist fringe term'. If this is true (and it may well be) It is perhaps inevitable that any article on the Arab-Israeli politics will attract controversy. But what is important is that we do not react to the clamouring of one group or another - down this route lies the dangers of revisionism and the erosion of Wikipedia as a valuable source.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: For my part, I think apartheid has little in common with Israel and is grotesque oversimplification being used for dramatic effect, but enough notable people find some value in the term that is definitely deserving of an article. Besides which, it's well sourced and balanced. If you feel it is a purely propaganda term, this article would be the perfect place to debunk it using lots of sources. It will be a hotspot for vandalism and edit wars, but as long as everyone sticks to the facts (and doesn't delete any) we should be fine.</li>

Using Wikipedia as such a platform will only lead to polarization, which this page accounts for. Hence, BLANK VOTE!

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> the phrase has been established as notable. There is absolutely no reason this cannot be a neutral article.

</dd>
<dd>As such, I cited Viriditas' argument in that it expresses that this term is merely part of a targeted propoganda campaign. As such, the article is about a neologism (see <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>), and consequently, it violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> in that it makes WP into a publisher of what Wikipedia policy considers original thought.

<dd>Bwithh's links in the comments below go to notability, well established in my view. Neologisms are frowned upon because they are seldom notable. Reporting on something is certainly different than promoting it or from publishing it as original thought. This thought is quite well-established outside Wikipedia.

<dd>To be perfectly clear, without the word "(phrase)" in the title, it would be unacceptable. An article about the use of the phrase by others is fine and constructive.

<li>OK, <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28slogans%29_d6de.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (slogans)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (slogans)</a> is basically what I was looking for but could not find, I suppose that is because it is archived and not linked directly from the main "conventions" page. It says an article title "may" be tagged "slogan" (or by extension, "phrase") on grounds of offensiveness. What I cannot figure out is whether this statement is "in force" at this time; but since there is no rule that says this is <b>not</b> the case, I don't see why an article title cannot include "phrase." Ironically, as noted elsewhere on this page, the inclusion of "phrase" in the title evidently convinced at least one person that it is <b>not</b> POV!

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It is a legitimate POV and a notiable phrase that represents the POV. It is only offensive to critics. There are critical of every possible POV and every POV is offensive to someone. If we are going to start to delete articles on this basis then this is tantamount to censorhip and suppression of certain POV's. There are many other articles with titles that represent a notable term or phrase, some of which are very offensive. Someone pointed out one such article is <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tar_baby.html" title="Tar baby">Tar baby</a>. Are you going to delete that article too? This is a strong Keep and its a good, balanced article that is informative for the debates on both sides of the fence, and more imprortantly it passes the notablity requirement. I studied Pol. Sci. and the term is widely used in academia. The phrase is even widely used in Israeli political discourse. Take a look at the book by the title of <i>Israel: An Apartheid State</i>, which argues for the correctness of the term. There is in Israel a Committee Against Apartheid <a href="http://www.geocities.com/NoApartheid/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/NoApartheid/" rel="nofollow">[94]</a>, and the Movement Against Israeli Apartheid in Palestine <a href="http://www.maiap.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.maiap.org/" rel="nofollow">[95]</a>. Infact it seems it just becaues the slogan so effective in capturing the image of this POV that critics wants to censor it all together. This is unacceptable. We report on all views and issues, provided they are notable. The articles on any subject should be balanced and present all sides of the articles subject given the same criteria.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 13:57, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, certainly notable, certainly a sensitive topic. There are verifiable sources to use and scope of the term. While there can be discussion, the article is written carefully to avoid strong POV. In fact, as of the version I read, it is very close to NPOV, unless the readers have very strong POV themselves. As for merging, it is too early to tell. It may very well become a subarticle for a more comprehensive look at modern apartheid. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedE_dbe1.html" title="User:TedE">Ted</a> 17:09, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> Humus sapiens, please don't hijack my edits and present a false impression of my intentions and the content of the articles . Those were direct quotations from the articles - hence the quotation marks, not "made up headlines" (isn't obvious that lengthy sentences are not headlines?). You're the one who is soapboxing by hijacking edits. I'm merely showing the notability of the term in the media. Yes, the first quotation is from an article criticizes/condemns the term while acknowledging that it is being widely used. The second article actually criticizes <i>Israeli</i> euphemisms. Here is the paragraph before the excerpt I originally used:<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=344378&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=14&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y" class="external text" title="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=344378&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=14&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y" rel="nofollow"><i>"To handle the settlement controversy politically, legally and ethically, Israel has developed a unique word-laundering system. To avoid the value judgment connoted by "occupied territories" or "liberated territories," Israel invented the term "administered territories."</i></a>]. The article then points out Israeli alternative phrases for "apartheid" as more examples of what the Israeli writer is calling "word-laundering". But the key thing is that both Haaretz articles cite the term as widely accepted, not whether they are for or against. My point is the notability of the phrase, not whether the term is wrong or right. And here is my original comment before it was hijacked, for the record:</li>

<p>As some others have said during the course of this discussion (either on the article's talk page or here, or both) there is too much reliance on Google searches to "prove" the notability of a term. Google hits may be indicative of something, but I am not sure what, and the other question is, where do you draw the line? How many Google hits are "meaningful"? Just as a little experiment, I decided to plug various terms followed by "apartheid" into Google and see what happens. All of the phrases I put in were in quotation marks, for example "israeli apartheid," "islamic apartheid," etc. (I think the absence of quotation marks is what results in statements on the main AfD page that a certain search revealed millions of hits.)</p>
<p>Please be assured that by "testing" any particular term I did not mean a slur against that group, religion, or whatever. I just typed what popped into my head. So don't anybody be offended. It's just a little experiment.</p>
<p>Here are the results, which are grouped together in what seems like some logical order and in numerical order within the groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>"israeli apartheid" 247,000</li>
<li>"american apartheid" 84,700 (note, "u.s. apartheid" got 2,250)</li>
<li>"arab apartheid" 334</li>
<li>"palestinian apartheid" 270</li>
<li>"indian apartheid" 117</li>
<li>"serbian apartheid" 37</li>
<li>"chinese apartheid" 23</li>
<li>"russian apartheid" 5</li>
<li>"bosnian apartheid" 1</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"jewish apartheid" 2,010</li>
<li>"islamic apartheid" 735 (note, "muslim apartheid" got 458)</li>
<li>"christian apartheid" 24</li>
</ul>
<p>And here is one I was surprised by because I thought I was making it up, but obviously I wasn't:</p>
<ul>
<li>"sexual apartheid" 17,100 (apparently most refer to bias based on sexual orientation)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, what does all of this prove? I am not suggesting it proves anything, other than that you can find just about anything on the Web. So, where <b>do</b> you draw the line? "American apartheid" sure does get a lot of hits, so why isn't there a Wikipedia article about it? (At least, I did not find one.) I am not suggesting that there should be such an article, but does that mean that there is some "magic number" between 247,000 and 84,700? Or, does it mean that 247,000 hits, by themselves, do not justify a separate article? (Somewhere a lightbulb turns on of its own volition.)</p>
<p>Maybe Wikipedia should not aspire to be a reflection of the informational chaos of the Web, but rather an oasis from it. (Hey, that was pretty good, can I copyright that? Not if I post it here, I guess. Oh well.) <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 00:30, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe because Israeli apartheid is around 3x more than American apartheid. Also, note that people use Google Test in addition to the Scholarly Article-test and notable person test. Desmond Tutu, presumably a first hand experiencer of apartheid has used the phrase. I think he would konw about apartheid. <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECopysan_6de1.html" title="User:Copysan">Copysan</a> 01:11, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the link. I find the author's introductory paragraphs interesting and correct, and his conclusion laughable. What he is saying is, the use of this phrase is intellectually lazy except when <i>he</i> thinks it is applicable. And then, by denigrating the use of the phrase for any purpose other than what <i>he</i> wants to use it for, his use of it as an epithet becomes that much more powerful. I think a similar attitude went into the creation of the article we are talking about on this page. Fortunately, some people can see through things like that. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 03:31, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wonder if we should have an article on: "Palestinian Death Cult Lynchings" . After all much like Homey took a web apge from "globalexchange.com" one can use this as a source&#160;: <a href="http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=20829_Palestinian_Death_Cult_Lynchings&amp;only" class="external free" title="http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=20829_Palestinian_Death_Cult_Lynchings&amp;only" rel="nofollow">http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=20829_Palestinian_Death_Cult_Lynchings&amp;only</a> .</p>
<p>after all the argument of google hits is a two edge sword - this search give 720,000 (6 times more than "Israeli aparthide":</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Palestinian+%22Death+Cult%22+OR+Lynchings+OR+Lynching&amp;btnG=Search" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Palestinian+%22Death+Cult%22+OR+Lynchings+OR+Lynching&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Palestinian+%22Death+Cult%22+OR+Lynchings+OR+Lynching&amp;btnG=Search</a></p>

In any cases, I tend to agree that this constitutes a fork, but I'm curious about what prompted the creation of this article in the first place? It might be undue speculation (in this case accept in advance my deep apologies), but it may just be that some users have been discussed by a certain type of control on some Israeli-Palestinian conflict related articles &amp; decided to create this fork to be able to edit (see <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamas.html" title="Hamas">Hamas</a> for constant controversy about very simple things; many users seem intent on only writing "Hamas are a bunch of baby killers evil fanatics" instead of neutrally explaining the creation of this terrorist group (which lift very important questions: can a terrorist group lead a state? so that's now a "terrorist state"? But if we accept "terrorist state", are they the only one?...

I'm not a fan of the term, but removing mention of it from the article, plus a delete and protect would mean that anyone searching for the term, which is at least somewhat notable, would not locate the article or a redirect for the item they are looking for. I have suggested that this term be summarized in very short paragraphs in the main article and a redirect placed to Israeli West Bank barrier. The redirect would then only be used when searching on the term -- which is what people are looking for! All internal wiki links should use the agreed upon term of Israeli West Bank barrier. Also, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apartheid_wall&amp;diff=55544199&amp;oldid=55319976" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apartheid_wall&amp;diff=55544199&amp;oldid=55319976" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> seems like a large copyvio as it is copied directly from the source article. <a href="../../../r/_/_/WP%7ER_3abc.html" title="WP:R">WP:R</a> says that redirects should be deleted if offensive, <i>but not if term is discussed in article</i> -- which it was before being converted from a redirect.

The article is not about the barrier per se but about the use of the term and it is our job not to censor phrases we don't like but to determine whether a phrase has entered the popular lexicon or not ("Apartheid wall" passes that test) and ensure that the articles about them are balanced and NPOV but, if consensus is against keeping then we really have no choice but to <b>merge and redirect</b> as, like it or not, it's more likely that a user will search for "Apartheid wall" than any other term. Pretending the term does not exist and attempting to ban it by deleting without redirecting does a disservice to users and therefore to the project. Homey 22:01, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> and <b>redirect</b> to either <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid_%28phrase%29.html" title="Israeli apartheid (phrase)">Israeli apartheid (phrase)</a> and/or to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a> depending on the perspective: If the rationale is to examine Israel's policies as co-inciding with "apartheid" then the so-called "apartheid wall" is part of that subject when viewed in those terms, on the other hand, if the purpose of the term is basically to provide a "<b>colorful <a href="../../../p/e/j/Pejorative.html" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> <a href="../../../a/d/j/Adjective.html" title="Adjective">adjective</a></b>" to a known subject, it can safely and accurately redirect to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a>. Not every colorful POV term gets its own article when a reasonable good NPOV article about it exists already. Thus, for example, even a widely used term like <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart_attack.html" title="Heart attack">heart attack</a> gets redirected to <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</a>, or for an article about <a href="../../../w/i/f/Wife_beater.html" title="Wife beater">wife beater</a> one must go to the article about <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spousal_abuse.html" title="Spousal abuse">spousal abuse</a>, and so on and so forth, thus merging is a good solution here too. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 22:59, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> My concern about a redirect, which I believe I expressed on the talk page for this same article many months ago when the suggestion was made there, is this: If you search on "Apartheid Wall" and it redirects you to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a>, does that imply that Wikipedia is "saying" that the barier is an "Apartheid Wall"? I don't know. If I were a "newcomer" and saw that redirect and had not read this discussion among the thousands and thousands of non-article pages, that is what I might think. I don't know how to resolve the issue, I am just pointing it out. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 00:47, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>6SJ7: Let's avoid <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_reasoning.html" title="Circular reasoning">circular reasoning</a> (which by the way, redirects to <a href="../../../b/e/g/Begging_the_question.html" title="Begging the question">begging the question</a> -- how ironic!) Wikipedia is not <i>that</i> sophisticated <i>yet</i> that it can provide every last nuance to all words, phrases, and facts. Wikipedia is not "saying" anything! Wikipedia is just a bunch of PCs, servers, and anonymous editors hooked up together on the Internet. A good merge or redirect, in this instance to the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a> which will actually have information about how the barrier referred to by the term "apartheid wall" by some critics came to be, which will then actually qualify and explain what the fuss about the "apartheid wall" name is all about. You can't wish it away because you don't like it. Using the above analogy, maybe you should possibly ask if the redirect of "<a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart_attack.html" title="Heart attack">heart attack</a>" to <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</a> means that a "heart attack" always means a "myocardial infarction" only, even though very often people use the words "heart attack" as a <a href="../../../f/i/g/Figure_of_speech.html" title="Figure of speech">figure of speech</a> denoting great surprise or shock and not God-forbid a real heart attack. Obviously, Wikipedia cannot cater to every last fool on Earth and ultimately "newcomers" reading these articles are required to use their brains and discretion, as they should always be doing. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 01:51, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>don't see why this article should be deleted. No reason is given. Can we be rational about this please and explain the reasons for deletion please. It's useful information for anyone interested in filmmaking. Include it in transwiki but I don't know anything about that anyway. This article is for the Wikipedia and forms part of the content for the filmmaking article. Egrabczewski 1 Jun 2006. [copied from talk page by Girolamo Savonarola]
<ul>
<li>Useful information it may indeed be, but it simply does not meet the criteria currently in place regarding article entries. Specifically, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wp%7Enot.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wp:not">point 8 of "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information"</a> - what has been created is an instruction manual (and one that is in fact only correct for one very specific subset of filmmaking practiced in one region). This information is indeed useful - however, its place is not in an encyclopedia but a wikibook; specifically the one I've cited above. As with the AfD nom on roll number, I would like to suggest that perhaps you read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> briefly, in order that your work is as productive as it is useful. I've also had to redirect several other articles you created because we already had other articles on the topics, or because the subject was so much of a subset of another article that it didn't require a separate article (which was also composed of paragraphs you <i>cut</i>, not <i>copied</i>, from the original articles). I think that overall your work is good and certainly has a place in either the Wikipedia or other wiki projects, depending on the content, and I don't want to discourage you in your efforts! However, I'd just advise more caution and familiarity with the editing policies. <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirolamo_Savonarola_76cd.html" title="User:Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a> 20:01, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>I sincerely feel that this article is extremely useful for someone that is involved with &amp; wants to understand this particular process (such as myself). It details step-by-step, a process about which it might be difficult to find information elsewhere.It has helped me greatly and I'm sure it will continue to be useful to others as well. Just because it does not match certain criteria set by Wikipedia isn't a good enough reason to deny someone this information. Infact, this article shlould be expanded to include other example and terminology.</p>
