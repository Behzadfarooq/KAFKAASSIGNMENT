<li>I am happy to see the article deleted so long as you can answer this question- what do you call a frim?? Are you suggesting that there is no word at all for that sort of thing??
<p>I would also like to note that neither Splash nor FreplySpang are Hollywood TV writers. A lot you two know about sitcoms, with your noses in philosophy books or political science articles all day long. Have you ever been to a Hollywood pool party??? Well, then: You wouldn't know.</p>

<li>In response to your challenge I will take what I hope is not flaimbait at its word and suggest <i>comedic misunderstanding</i>, the classic <i>miscommunication</i> or it's more verbose brother <i>getting the wires crossed</i>. And what about that old favorite, <i>dramatic irony</i>? Sure, perhaps they don't have the flair or brevity of "frim," but what of that ignoble day, thousands of years in the future, when we've run out of four letter words and there is a more important concept than this that needs rapid communicaion. It is that day that I will raise my tequila and celebrate what I believe will be the outcome of this VfD. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirmob_3a04.html" title="User:Sirmob">Sirmob</a> 03:55, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Neologism. Presumably these Hollywood TV writers would write the word into a drama or sitcome if the word was that common in those circles. This appears not to have happened.

<li>Well, we've heard from the word police, now let's hear from the people. What concerns me is the slippery slope that we are on. Sure, a child word, just a few years old and getting used to life, like "frim" is easy to attack. The gang of bullies has gathered around this tender child, knocked her down and are ready to try to kick her to death. I say "NO." Let us unfurl the banner, raise the roof beam high, light my candle, break out the tequila. Where will it stop. One day "frim" is got rid of, next day perhaps another newish word like "spam" used to mean unwanted Email will be axed. Then day by day the nitpicking, jack booted word police will get rid of more and more words on one pretext or another until we are reduced to trying to communicate with a few guttural utterances. Imagine scientists, poets, philosphers trying to communicate with "arrrghh" and "aye aye." A new dark ages will be ushered in made worse, and perhaps prolonged by the lights of perverted science. Let us, the DEFENDERS OF LANGUAGE, therefore conduct ourselves so that if we exist for a thousand years, historians will look back and say, "this was their finest hour."
<p>I would also like to point out that I was not the one who put the "definitions" section in the comedy article. If it is forbidden to discuss word meanings in Wikipedia, then the whole "definitions" section should be deleted.</p>

<li>Somewhere deep in my soul I do wish I could say wictionary, but I cannot, so my suggestion to the most determined author is to save the wikitext and fight this battle himself where it has the slightest chance of survival, if he feels he truly must.

<dd>Since I also have no doubt that someone will claim that the OED doesn't say what it says (does anyone besides me have a subscription? I can't be the only one), here's a freely available that provides evidence that I'm not just fabricating the OED text. Here's the early form of the word used <a href="http://gnu.mirrors.tds.net/pub/gutenberg.org/etext06/8bwlf10ua.txt" class="external text" title="http://gnu.mirrors.tds.net/pub/gutenberg.org/etext06/8bwlf10ua.txt" rel="nofollow">in Beowulf</a> (search for "fremu", in context means "excellent" or "lusty" or "vibrant"). I 100% agree that the original definition was idiotic, and should have been replaced. But given that the people that posted it somehow managed to stumble on to a <i>real word</i> that <i>isn't in the wiktionary</i>, I think it would be irresponsible of us not to correct the error and transwiki it to wiktionary. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 13:40, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: being the author of the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaz_%28model%29.html" title="Chaz (model)">Chaz (model)</a> article, I feel quite strongly about this topic. (And, contrary to the opinion expressed by Flowerparty below, Chaz is indeed quite a notable model in this genre.) I think that this list, as earlier asserted, has the potential to become an important and impactful resource. I admit that this list has quite a number of blank spots, but these blanks can be addressed, and, indeed, are being addressed. Personally, I would have filled most (if not all) of the blank spots a long time ago, but my notebook computer, with a lot of relevant information on this topic, is currently in the repair shop. I pledge that just as soon as it is back in my hand, I will at least put up stubs for most (if not all) of the blank spots, and as my leisure time permits, make those stubs more substantial. Also, if I may add, I believe that it is very easy to know who is is or who isn't in the "big bust" genre or not, since (besides the evidence of one's own eyes) there are some rather authoritative sources to arbitrate, e.g. magazines such SCORE or Voluptuous. And contrary to R. fiend's assertion, <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolly_Parton_7625.html" title="Dolly Parton">Dolly Parton</a> IS famous for more than her bustline, and she is not on this list because she is not a model, whether big bust, topless, glamour, or whatever. She is primarily a musician, and a darn good one if you ask me&#160;:) <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJalabi99_f6c7.html" title="User:Jalabi99">Jalabi99</a> 18:07, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>This list would seem to represent a valid pornographic sub-genre; there are two main reasons why I think it should be deleted:</p>
<ul>
<li>The columns of red links are inviting dozens of articles for complete non-notables such as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chantal.html" title="Chantal">Chantal</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaz_%28model%29.html" title="Chaz (model)">Chaz (model)</a> (and probably others) which are in turn clogging up vfd.</li>
<li>Who defines which actors have large breasts anyway? Do those listed condsider themselves big-bust models and performers? Chantal doesn't look particularly remarkable in this department, for instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second point doesn't mean the genre can't be discussed in general terms, so I propose an article be created at big-bust pornography or possibly big-breast pornography. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowerparty_4b7e.html" title="User:Flowerparty">Flowerparty</a> 00:59, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Those concerned at the number of model listings "clogging up vfd" can either nominate fewer models or remove redlinks, according to taste. On the subject of which models have big breasts, I'd suggest that this can be ascertained by visual examination. Chaz has enormous breasts, Chantal's are not really that big (and more to the point she doesn't seem to have much of a public profile). Normal editing and reference to verifiable sources (Scoreland, Voluptuous, etc) can settle any disputes. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 07:14, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Unfortunately, visual examination is not enough.

<ul>
<li>Complete poppycock. The size of the breasts is immaterial; the visual effect and the purpose for which they are displayed provides ample context. Uncle G's refutation also misses the point. A list of small people would probably be unencyclopedic but a list of circus midgets would not. A list of hirsute women would probably be unencyclopedic but a list of bearded ladies would not. Similarly, a list of big boob models is encyclopedic because there are external criteria that can be used. A big boob model is a woman who models for pornographic or glamor pictures and for whom a selling point of her pictures is the display of her boobs in such a manner as to emphasize and celebrate their size. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 04:01, 19 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wrong. The only "external criteria" cited here so far have been your personal opinion as to what constitutes "enormous breasts" and "not really that big". There has been a marked failure here to produce concrete NPOV criteria. At least you're trying to come up with one now (which rather belies any assertion that I missed the point); but note that what you've said above is not what the article says, and note that the purported criterion that you've just invented here doesn't appear to actually exclude anybody, since pretty much all (female) pornographic models display their breasts in order to celebrate them, and once again doesn't actually define what a "big-bust model" is in a concrete and NPOV manner. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:53, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Your argument seems to have been constructed in ignorance of the existence of big boob pornography as a genre. It's very easy to tell if someone is a big boob model. She has big boobs. If there's any doubt you ask if she's appeared ina big boob magazine. We don't need any stronger criterion than that. Yes, I think you missed the point, by a mile. It's blatantly factually incorrect to claim that "There has been a marked failure here to produce concrete NPOV criteria." --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 06:38, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The irony of <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>'s rationale is that it provides an example of why this list is inherently not from the NPOV and doesn't have a place here. "Chaz has enormous breasts, Chantal's are not really that big." According to what criterion? According solely to <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>'s personal definitions of "enormous breasts" and "not really that big".

(The suggestion that whether someone is a big-bust model "can be ascertained by visual examination" is, at best, a woolly one.)

<li><b>Comment</b>. It is simply false to say that there are no criterion for who is and is not a big-bust model.

<li>Actually, it's pretty clearly true. The article contains no criteria for who is and isn't on the list except to say that it is only for "big-bust" models (without defining what "big-bust" is), and you've produced no criteria so far other than ones based upon your own personal personal definitions of "enormous breasts" and "not really that big", or non-exclusionary ones that simply include every pornographic model whose breasts have ever been displayed at all. This article is currently in exactly the same position as the article at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_Fat_People_on_Television_146d.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of Fat People on Television">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of Fat People on Television</a> is in. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:53, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: This list has no function. Do not ask "what's the harm." Ask "what's the use" of this article? First, it is inherently POV and therefore violates the deletion guidelines. Secondly, it comes from someone's hobby and reflects a private interest. Third, it is unreferenced by other articles and ever shall be, most likely.

Most articles don't even give their real names, but some do have their turn-ons on the like. It's basically the makings of a porn fansite, which is fine and all, but not in Wikipedia. I'm all for including porn stars who have reached a level of fame/notoriety that goes beyond having fucked someone while an amateur videographer ran his handi-cam.

The arguments about the subjectiveness of the title were excellently dismissed by Mr Sidaway. Clearly, if a model appears in big-bust mags or features on big-bust websites, she is a big-bust model.

Clearly, a set number (via consensus or a group of valid sources) would remove the bias -- because, right now, this list is extremely biased and a majority of the performers listed there are not-notable.

Your definition is no better, as it simply dodges the question entirely. "a model [who] appears in big-bust mags or features on big-bust websites [...] is a big-bust model" does not provide a concrete and NPOV definition of "big-bust". It merely provides a circular definition. (Ask what a "big-bust mag" or a "big-bust website" is, and the answer will be "one that features big-bust models".)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Anyone find it odd that this vote is so close, but the List of small-bust models and performers is basically unanimous for deletion (admittedly that article is worse, but still)? Is that ugly <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a> rearing its head again? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:07, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b>: Actually, the List of small-bust models and performers has one vote -- from the creator. Otherwise, I believe one of the reasons that the vote is nearly unanimous is due to the fact that the article is new. Now, the "big-bust" list is older and has been worked on by others, and there is probably a sense of attachment to this article from its contributors. Hence the debate. Just my two cents. -- <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Beaudoin_Jr._f03b.html" title="User:Joe Beaudoin Jr.">Joe Beaudoin Jr.</a> 22:22, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, I did say "basically" unanimous; I do have to wonder about a vote that has the comments "I hate fake tits", but no matter. As for the "people vote keep because they worked on the article" rationale, well, I've seen it before and my response is the same. It seems to make more sense that people work on articles because they think they are worth keeping, not that they think articles are worth keeping because they worked on them. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:31, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think this list was very useful, I don't suppose it's easy to understand. But just as people are interested in what happened to mainstream celebrities of the past, people who follow the careers of these models would find it very helpful to have this index handy. Also, I'm not sure that information can be stupid by definition. If it's a genre that exists, doesn't having a reference of it serve the mission of the wikipedia?</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Simple definition: a model or performer whose principal claim to fame is her "big" bust. We don't need to set a minimum circumference; we just rely on the marketplace.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: Simply because the concept of a "big-bust" performer <i>can</i> be abused does not mean that it is non-notable.

<li><b>Delete</b> A list of performers who have large breasts (with no other criteria) does not strike me as encyclopedic, especially if many of the models have no other notability, and a limitted one at that. Now, if it were a list of performers who are especially notable for having large breasts (e.g. <a href="../../../l/o/l/Lolo_Ferrari_e6c8.html" title="Lolo Ferrari">Lolo Ferrari</a>) then I think it would certainly be worth keeping. Without some extra criterion for inclusion, this list could easily include every porn star with breasts over a certain size, and/or every performer to ever be featured in a themed item of media, which strikes me as both un-maintianable, and listcruft. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcelight_76ef.html" title="User:Icelight">Icelight</a> 00:19, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Also Strong keep</b>. Some can be edited out, others need additional input, Kitten Natividad is a case in point, as you can't discuss director Russ Meyer without mentioning her. Yes "big-bust" is a slightly vague term, but if it encompasses more than a few, so what? The underlying thread of VFD seems to be a dislike for the topic.

<li>I disagree, I understand that he is party spokesperson. In any event, he is known publicly via national television and radio media in England, as he has had a profile as an environmental protestor, and has appeared in newspapers, and on radio and television shows in relation to environmental issues. - Brett Collins 02:10, 18 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You'll have to prove those claims. The first three pages of Google hits certainly don't appear to mention any media attention at all. The very first Google is a Guardian bio-tub because he was a <i>candidate</i> for election earlier this year. He didn't win, however. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 02:20, 18 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Clearly he did not win as an MP, however, I stick by my last post. On looking at Google, I disagree with you, the first three pages for 'poorun' (depending how many results per page you set!) include articles in south london press and other local/regional papers, and the observer newspaper. I've personally seen him on the politics show (TV), and several times have heard him talking on Radio 4 programmes (BBC, discussing citizenship, genetically modified foods, and development in the Peak District National Park). Also, I'm sure he is still a spokesperson for the Green Party. What do others think? - Brett Collins 02:37, 18 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> One more thing: the agreed wiki guidelines on 'notability' state that the following should be kept (amongst many others): - Major local political figures who receive significant press coverage / Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events / Alternative tests: Other tests for inclusion that have been proposed include: The professor test -- If the individual is more well known and more published than an average college professor, they can and should be included./ Expandability -- Will the article ever be more than a hideous stub? Could the perfect article be written on this subject? / Google Test -- Does the subject get lots of hits on Google or another well known search mechanism? / All of these apply, so I would argue that the subject is at least notable.</li>

<li>I'd remind you of the guidelines - about a local figure who receives significant media coverage being notable (I will post some links to media coverage later when I have a chance); I also find it strange that you don't think a national spokesperson for the fourth largest party (in terms of both seats and overall number of votes) in England Wales is not 'more notable than the average college professor'! Could one of you answer that? Surely he is 'a lot' more notable than the average college professor, and therefore merits at least an entry (see my previous post above setting out the current guidelines on what is 'notable'). Certainly I've seen politicians of lesser or equivalent standing undeleted, e.g. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Nugent/" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Nugent/" rel="nofollow">Brian Nugent</a>],[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonia_Bance/" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonia_Bance/" rel="nofollow">Antonia Bance</a>],[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Crummey" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Crummey" rel="nofollow">Jason Crummey</a>] - Brett Collins 20:20, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, but those are all just one sentence mentions for quotes. There are lots of activists and lots of them acquire some media coverage by standing for election. Unfortunately, he's not a spokesperson for the party, hasn't done anything notable and didn't win an election. He's a great guy I'm sure, but he is still not notable. There are also plenty of lawyery types out there, and almost all of them are non-notable too, though I struggle to work out if he's even a lawyer or whether he just sits in the courtroom with them. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 14:58, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: It is not entirely unreasonable to have an article on the way the conventional way of depicting people on Egyptian reliefs and paintings has been parodied in popular culture. As for "original research", many of the pop culture-related articles on Wikipedia are in fact original research, in the sense that they do not cite reputable academic publications (or even irreputable non-academic publications) on the topic. Is that even possible to avoid, while still covering such areas? <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 05:24, 18 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>P.S. This, of course, isn't much of an article. Perhaps a more general article on Ancient Egypt in popular culture would be more appropriate. For that references could easily be found. But until that is actually written, this one can be moved or redirected, I suppose. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 06:08, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There is no reason we can't do that. The Walk Like an Egyptian article will stand on its own. In response to Uppland's point, I will cite sources which help confirms verifiability - it is my concern that many of our articles do not outline their sources. My understanding of original research is that it puts forward a new interpretation of events rather than facts or points of view from people with some relevance to the issue. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 05:56, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>When the song "<a href="../../../w/a/l/Walk_Like_an_Egyptian_b7e2.html" title="Walk Like an Egyptian">Walk Like an Egyptian</a>" came out, it prompted fresh discussion of the very point that this article is discussing. This isn't original research, inasmuch as there <i>is</i> a particular manner of locomotion here that has been enacted by the world of entertainment for at least a century. <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilson%2C_Keppel_and_Betty_9cce.html" title="Wilson, Keppel and Betty">Wilson, Keppel and Betty</a>, an old vaudeville act who performed the <i>Egyptian Sand Dance</i> featuring exactly this method of walking, formed in 1910. This particular mode of walking is <i>not</i> connected with <i>solely</i> the song by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bangles_9034.html" title="The Bangles">The Bangles</a> or a 2004 fashion show (Note the date that the article was written.), and did not even originate with them either. A rename or a merge specifically to that song would be inappropriate. The article is somewhat misleading, and could do with some cleanup. No people have seriously held the belief that Egyptians walked this way. <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilson%2C_Keppel_and_Betty_9cce.html" title="Wilson, Keppel and Betty">Wilson, Keppel and Betty</a> was a <i>comedy</i> act. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:06, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, are you serious about keeping the porno actress?

<li>Actually, we should have an article on the (ahem) actress, as she does seem notable in her field. I'm reluctant to remove the "pediatrician" info, as it was the basis for this vfd... but it's an obvious hoax, and since it is not an advert, an attack page, or a copyvio, it does no harm for it to remain in the edit history. So, if the VfD goes "delete" as to the original article, we can just keep the replacement (unless folks wish to delete that as well). --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 13:25, July 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Appears to be a vanity page about a fake programming language.</p>
<p>I can find no other references about the existence of this language, nor of the language creators mentioned.</p>
<p>The original article submitter included no source for the content, and that person's other contributions on the same day included vandalism: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=62.254.64.18" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=62.254.64.18" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> (look at the <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Lee_368a.html" title="Bruce Lee">Bruce Lee</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicine.html" title="Medicine">Medicine</a> changes, in particular.)</p>
<p>Also, the programming code samples provided are meaningless. The Java sample is just a braindead <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hello_world_program.html" title="Hello world program">hello world program</a>, and the C++ one is comparably braindead (in addition to probably not compiling).</p>

<li><b>do not delete</b> The seperation of the two articles allows one to have a clinical veiw while the other has a multiple point of veiw. I would also like to note that the ABDL article has sections dealing in more practical matters, something that infantilism does not. There were complaints about how the Infantilism article was writen before and there was some agreement that the seperation of the articles would cut down on article size and keep the point of veiw consistant for both articles.<br />

<li><b>do not delete</b> Though addressing the same general topic, the two articles address it from two very different places. Like the above voter said, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantilism.html" title="Infantilism">Infantilism</a> is more of a clinical exploration and <a href="../../../a/b/d/ABDL_3587.html" title="ABDL">ABDL</a> is more from the point of view of people practicing it. If there is to be a re-direct, it should be merged instead of just deleted. But seeing as they originated as one article before being split due to article length, re-merging them wouldn't make much sense.<br /></li>

<p>This site was created as a plug for a new discussion forum dedicated to a radio show, Coast to Coast AM. Aside from POV wording, it featured unsubstantiated claims that it was related to a previous, official forum though it appears to have simply co-opted the name. It was created in April and has been pretty desolate, despite it's creator spamming Usenet repeatedly. Does not warrant a Wikipedia article, IMHO, and the original Art Bell message board was simply titled 'Post to Post' (no "AM"). Yesitis 06:37, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Looks like a neologism or hoax to me, too. Interestingly, Sdrows (which would be a more sensible title, being word with an S on either end) returns quite a few hits (I believe that backwards sites are a way of beating news-site censorship in countries like China). But as for the current article, I'd suggest that the writer of it needs to learn how to use English <i>forwards</i> before trying anything more adventurous. "Oppersite"?

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand- this is a topic studied by Australian high school history students (eg my year 8 son last term), with a view to getting the students to understand and evaluate conflicting source materials. There is some compelling evidence in favour of the Portugese discovery but there are some key facts which highlight why it is very probably not the case. As at this time the merge / rewrite into European exploration of Australia does not do the topic justice, in particular missing out on the Dieppe Maps. When my son started this topic, I came to Wikipedia and was dissappointed at the paucity of material here and in particular the lack of reference to these maps.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 02:28, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> ... I originally thought "delete/merge" but I just went and played with it a bit and I'm happier now.

<li><b>Comment</b> Why oh why would you rather have the definition of a surname (this is an Encyclopedia, not a list of surnames) over the perfectly valid definition of <b>Bosh</b>, which is a widely used term and an integral part of modern British youth culture.

<ul>
<li>It's not the definition of a surname. <i>That</i> is happily sitting in <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Bosh" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Bosh">Wiktionary:Bosh</a>. This form of article is a <i><a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">name disambiguation</a></i>. It is a navigational aid, not a definition. People with the <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_name.html" title="Family name">family name</a> Bosh can be commonly referred to by that family name alone. (e.g. "<a href="http://www.nba.com/news/pow_050110.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nba.com/news/pow_050110.html" rel="nofollow">Bosh, Bowen named players of the week</a>.")

<li><b>Keep</b> The actual article as written, The rewrite is fine, but it completely ignores the original definition of BOSH (yes, definition, because a definition was clearly given), If is only as a supplementary aid,ok, but emphasis should be given to the word first defined and which created all this commotion in the first place, Isnt the main purpose of this Wikipedia to introduce readers to words and definitions they are not familiar with or have heard in passing and would like more information on?? I have personally seen the word in its original context and i live thousands of miles away from its birth place, I actually came to this Wikipedia to find out more about it and was satisfied with its definition, What are future readers going to do when the word goes global and a suitable and original definition is needed? Many words have started their careers this way, deleting it now would be the equivalent of deleting "cool" in the 1940 or "phat" in the 1990's, Sure there are other definitions for it and they may seem non-sensical to first readers, but they mean something to many and eventually will be vindicated. Not knowing the word is not a valid excuse to delete it, Now you know it, use it, live it and leave it alone, <b>MIMI13</b> (and no, im not a sockpuppet and yes, it is my first edit)

<li><b>KEEP</b>. so basically, what Splash is saying is that since the word BOSH already existed before 2000 and is already someone's name, it cannot be possible that a new definition and/or another usage can emerge? maybe the article is nonsense to some people, it seems to me that is simply stating how and why and by whom did this new way of using the word first came to be. New words appear every day, some out of the blue with crazy spellings (D'oh!) , some are simply new twists on existent words (the word "brilliant" actually means reflector of light, and im sure those who refered as something good or amazing as "brilliant" in the early days were laughed at.). Both the surname and the original definition are valid of course, but as you said, this is not a dictionary, so the new usage of the word should be given a proper stage and see what happens. No one person has the right to delete the word because it seems "nonsense " to them and deprive the general public from seeing it. that is bordering censorship. <b>Mimi13</b>

<li><b>well said</b>, it belongs in a ancyclopedia, which is more adept at trying to explain the universal truth the word implies, is more than just a word, is an attitude, and to understand it one needs to see its origins and its developement.

<li>There is no "universal truth" to be explained here. Bosh is just a surname, some writings by Edward Lear, and nonsense — the items listed and linked to in the disambiguation. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:37, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>nonsense</b>. Bosh is a word used in the UK to mean "nonsense". It is regarded as excessively polite and upper-class, and so has dropped out of fashion quite a bit, but is still widely used, particularly in mocking upper-class accents and so forth. Bosch is a surname. Bosh should be <b>transwikied</b> to wiktionary, and the article should only <b>redirect</b> to Bosh the book by Lear. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 18:16, 23 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wiktionary has an article already, note. In fact it has two, one on the common noun and one on the proper noun. There are links to both of them in the name disambiguation version of the article and in the discussion above. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:12, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is fine as a disambiguation page. I'm sure wiktionary doesn't wish to be the VfD dumping ground.

<li><b>Delete</b>. There is already a Wiktionary entry.

<li><b>Keep</b> although a merge wouldn't be disastrous. I have previously stated that I thought the article should be merged and redirected to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html" title="Australian English">Australian English</a>, but that was at a stage when it was a woeful stub with seemingly no potential. Since it has been expanded upon (though, admittedly, it still has a way to go) I can see it developing into a useful article. I do, however, take issue with the labelling of theories of a distinct South Australian accent as "myths" given some linguists would undoubtedly assert this. A more detailed and referenced discussion is required in that regard. There was previously exploration of "South Australian English" in the Australian English article, but this was progressively removed, most probably because the dominant opinion is dismissive of regional variations in AusE.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 15:31, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Do not merge. Given that a reference book does exist, I think this article is sufficiently verifiable and notable. The fact that many Australians dispute the existence of this dialect is worthy of mention therein; the fact that South Australians might take pride in differences is also worth mentioning.

<dd>No, I didn't say that, read the second half of my parenthetical. I think the best option would be a single page discussing all regional varieties of English (you could then put a para there about how South Australianisms are more often derived from Cornish and German, if that's the case, then in other dialects). That webpage you link me to is full of colloquialisms, yeah, but has a lack of things like stras/devon. Should we have an article on 1932 English in Adelaide? The colloquialisms they used then were probably quite different from those in 1832 Adelaide. The page also doesn't have a whole lot to say on other things you could discuss like pronunciation differences. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> 12:57, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

Of course the stras/devon/polony/windsor thing's mentioned there, otherwise I'd hardly've known of it. Now if the significant thing in Aussie regional variation is words, can you show me why (given the three regions in SA), SA English forms a unit? Just for political reasons, or are there actual linguistic regions for that?

<dd>The Australian Word Map site identifies 27 "dialects". However, <i>none of these crosses a state/territory border</i>. There are good reasons why this is the case, such as the history as six separate British colonies (by the time of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_federation.html" title="Australian federation">Australian federation</a> anyway). This set up economic/education/media/etc ties to the state/territory capital cities. In parallel with Jauncey's book there are also publications about West Australian English (also 3 dialects), Queensland English (5 dialects) and so on. It is conceivable that 27 articles could be written at some stage but for obvious reasons I'm not keen to do that at present. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 04:30, July 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>When you started this page, you should have seen this text: <i>Please do not create an article to promote yourself, a <b>website</b>, a product, or a business (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>).</i> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 17:30, July 18, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>EXACTLY why we AREN'T promoting it. We are giving a detailed listing of how the site came about, what the site is about... not promoting it.
<ul>
<li>The act of merely <i>creating</i> the article could be seen as promotion, but let's leave that aside for the moment: "<i>J-Revolution.com is a great source for information</i>", "<i>While you are there, you can learn many things"</i>, "<i>Pulling in staffers from all over the world, J-Revolution aspires for the top</i>", "<i>the staff and admin have made a name for themselves on the internet for being there for the users</i>" is all promotional language that is not appropriate for an encyclopedia. See <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and also <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Wikipedia:Importance</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 17:47, July 18, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Keyword: "promote." The article in question never says something like "...so go visit (Webpage name here) today! It gives a brief overview of what the site contains, and some minor background information. If, for example, Burger King only told you what their products contained, and gave a brief background of it, in an ad, I don't think they would gain many sales from that ad. A more solid argument would be that it is irrelevant or non-notable. If the act of creating that page is advertising, than the Google page needs a load of work. The Google page includes a link to their search, even though it is posted as Google Inc. Seems like a silly way to cover an ad. The article in question could use some minor editing to be appropriate, but that is not a reason to exterminate it entirely. --<a href="../../../1/0/0/User%7E100%25MoreAwesomeThanYou_2782.html" title="User:100%MoreAwesomeThanYou">100%MoreAwesomeThanYou</a> 17:54, 18 July 2005
<ul>
<li>If POV were the only issue here, then yes, some minor editing <i>would</i> be fine for this article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 18:10, July 18, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That would be why I said that a more solid argument would be that it is irrelevant or non-notable. I stand by my opinion that it is notable enough to be kept. --<a href="../../../1/0/0/User%7E100%25MoreAwesomeThanYou_2782.html" title="User:100%MoreAwesomeThanYou">100%MoreAwesomeThanYou</a> 18:20, 18 July 2005</li>

<p>Yes, and if you notice, we say that we ASPIRE for the top, that you CAN learn many things, that we WANT to be the best, we never say we are. We are not being biased.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of importance is the main issue here, not bias. The site does not seem to be notable enough to merit an article at Wikipedia, at least not yet. --<a href="../../../k/f/p/User%7EKFP_849a.html" title="User:KFP">KFP</a> 18:08, 18 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed. Notability is definitely the main issue here. I was merely pointing out problems with the promotional language in the article, which is a side issue. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 18:10, July 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore you would be biased against the site. Saying that YOU think it isn't notable enough. To some people it is.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. You assume that others are "biased" against something they've only just heard of. That's not the case. This is (a) a non-notable website and (b) self-promotion. It's not an encyclopedia article.</li>

<p>Except from amazon.com entry: Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) is an American electronic commerce company based in Seattle, Washington. It was one of the first major companies to sell goods over the Internet. Amazon also owns Alexa Internet, a9.com, and the Internet Movie Database (IMDb).</p>
<p>Amazon assigns a unique identifier, the Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN), to each item it sells. (For books, the ASIN is the same as the item's ISBN, if it has one.) Amazon offers access to its catalog via web services, much as Google does to its search engine. In addition, a9.com provides search engine services directly on the Amazon.com site.</p>
<p>Launched in 1995, Amazon.com began as an online book-selling company but has now branched off into many other areas, including DVDs, music CDs, computer software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, and more.</p>

<li>"The people voting delete do not seem to be familiar with the phenomenon..." Really? I thought many people were interested in it! Surely our fellow Wikipedians should know about it. I did. Before listing this article on VfD. "There are probably more than 500 photoshopped images..." Probably? How can you know? Is this like the "tourist guy"? Show me where I can see these 500+ photoshopped images. In fact, I'm going to make more than 1,000 photoshoppings of myself in the next week, and make an article about the photoshoppings, because, you know, there's 1,000 photoshoppings of a picture of me. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiFan04_3ba8.html" title="User:WikiFan04">WikiFan04</a><sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikiFan04_a372.html" title="User talk:WikiFan04">Talk</a> 4:02, 20 Jul 2005 (CDT)</sup>

<p>Certainly I originated the use of the word like that (I actually got the word from an episode of 2 Stupid Dogs), but pretty much all of my good friends use the word, and it has been passed on to places as far as Idaho (I had a friend that got people to use it there). So, really, it's not just me, though certainly it would seem that way as I'm the only person who would probably care to have it up on wikipedia. But I still feel I have a right to claim the word, not as my own, but at least for the usage I came up with. - John</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>,I find this word quite useful and it has been a part of my regualr vocabulary for a number of years. It doesn't matter where it orginated so long as people find it facilitates communication. It's true what John says. I have heard it used by people who know neither he nor I. Shakespeare invented words that have come into common use. Feem, even Heinlen's "grok" is in wikipedia. "Grok" was a fabricated word, but people found it useful, and even though it's more or less an inside joke among scifi fans, it's used for more than getting cheap laughs. I see no difference between "grok" and "feem" in this respect. Keep it, or if it MUST go then just move it to the Wiktionary. - Will Mockridge</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>,I use this word about 90% of the time that I can't remember a common usage word such as "pan" or "run" but if I can manage to insert a word there, the sentence makes sense. This happens to me more often than it should, and just because you've never heard it used doesn't mean it doesn't have useful applications to others. I say keep the word, since "neologism" (to use one of your own shiny five dollar words) keeps the language evolving.

<li>Please note that Heinlein and Shakespeare are both famous people, which gives the words they invented slightly more weigth.

<p>It defies dictionary definition, since it is not so much a word as a tool for not having to use words. That's why the mimicked dictionary part of my entry looks comical and ridiculous. I was also under the impression that the purpose of an encyclopedia is to stab at an impossibility - a complete collection of all human knowledge. Now, there are some tribal groups somewhere with dwindling numbers that speak their own language and have their own customs who probably number less than the people who use the word feem. But the main point is this: having this entry in Wikipedia obstructs nothing and can only add to one's knowledge. There are no real reasons to NOT put it in. Oh, and it's also not a joke, since people use it without even thinking about it. - John</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>,Does a term have to be known/used <em>throughout the entire English-speaking world</em> to merit inclusion in a international collection of knowledge such as wikipedia? There are plenty of current entries that are completely acceptable that not everyone in the world, or even a specific country such as the USA, knows. This word is not known just among a small group of friends in the Southeast. I personally know several individuals from locals such as Washington (state), Idaho, Utah, and California (who have never been to Georgia at all) who effectively use 'feem' in their vernacular. Besides, sundry modern English words and phrases began as "in-jokes between friends" and eventually became used by a sizeable portion of the population. See the many California 'surfer' terms or internet terminology that have become commonplace among the rising generation in North America. Every year, such diction becomes more widespread. Now, I am not promising that feem will become so common, for I cannot see the future. Nevertheless, it <em>is</em> a vehicle to express certain ideas that other words or phrases cannot sufficiently illustrate. As John stated, it can only add to human knowledge, not detract. I see no reason not to include it in this encyclopedia, in spite of prejudices formed by those unfamiliar with said word. -A. Pauluk</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I see no reason why it should be deleted, or even moved to the Wiktionary. We have demonstrated a "national" usage. While most people who use the word live in and around Atlanta, I personally know of people who use the word in Michigan, California, Idaho, Utah, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, Ohio and Russia. The spread of the word is both through actual communication and through the Internet. I find it quite a useful word, and say it quite a lot in all seriousness in order to avoid perplexing conversation gaps. Because of it's interesting etymology, I say it merits it's inclusion in the Wikipedia. It's not just a word, but a new way of going about conversation that can help reduce the prevalence of "Like, Uh... You know" in our language. Praetorian42 06:24, 19 July 2005 (UTC)~</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, In-joke neologism is the best description I've seen so far. I don't see how an "interesting etymology" merits entry. An "useful etymology" perhaps, but this entire article is simiply made up on the spot. The majority of the rules center around "you can use this however you feel like at any point". Subjunctive is a mood not a tense by the way. Further, if you really believe it has merit as a replacement to words like "uh", than you should add a section to speech disfluencies. The likelihood of someone actually wanting to look this up on their own is next to zero. (editted because I suck at words)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> neologism. 03:46, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I've been a user of various Wikis since 1999, and I find it ludicrous that I should need to justify myself. I'm logged in here under my natural name. I'm easily googleable, you can find my work history at SuSE, etc. You can find edits minor and discussive of mine on c2, the moin development wiki, and other such. I can't show you the logs of me reading throgh wikipedia policy, sorry!

<dd>Add me to those angry at the sock puppet accusations. I have been "zsazs" on #trax for over ten years, was at the reunion, met RaD Man, and was interviewed by him. The fact that I created an account speaks that I am willing to stand by my opinion on deleting this entry. The channel in question as a whole obviously finds itself not wanting to be on Wikipedia. There are no other IRC channels that I can find on Wikipedia. The #trax Wikipedia entry is certainly a vanity article, albeit created by someone not within the regular community. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolpo_125b.html" title="User:Polpo">Polpo</a> 21:54, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure it was my first edit, that doesn't make me a sock puppet. At the very MOST it would make me a "meat puppet", if I didn't actually have some knowledge/relevance to this topic, which I do. Additionally, YOU INTERVIEWED ME ON CAMERA, Radman, therefore you should understand I exist. Would it help prove that I am not a sock puppet if I took a picture of myself with a sign so you could compare to the Trax 10 years pictures that it's me? Have you considered visiting scene.net #trax and talking to us to see that we're quite real? —RedPenguin 21:08, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>— After reviewing the timeline and the rest of the information on the page again I found it of not only questionable correctness (which I attempted to address) but of striking irrelevance. Therefore, I am changing my vote to delete. While an article on a community can be worthwhile, (consider The WELL) that is generally if the community itself generated or offered something of relevance. In this case, while many members of the community were computer musicians of some note, the community itself had overall little impact as anything other than a place where people chatted. Therefore the history of the channel is of no general interest, and instead, individual trackers should be considered in the context of a tracking article. If the argument can be made that #trax DID contribute something, then that should be the content of the trax article and not irrelevant information about schisms or the nationality of regulars.

<ol>
<li>You should be clearly indicating your bias as the author of the page.</li>
<li>You are accusing these voters of being <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">Sock Puppets</a>, which is clearly defined as indicating pretend existances created solely by a single person for the purpose of falsely magnifying or hiding their influence. Since you are fully aware of the individual existence of each of these people, see for example: <a href="http://kmods.dyndns.org/~jrodman/krisgale-trax10_files/" class="external text" title="http://kmods.dyndns.org/~jrodman/krisgale-trax10_files/" rel="nofollow">pictures of them</a> taken at one of the events mentioned on the <i>very article</i> under discussion, you are either misusing terminology or simply lying. (Incidentally note RadMan's clear <a href="http://kmods.dyndns.org/~jrodman/krisgale-trax10_files/008_radman.jpg" class="external text" title="http://kmods.dyndns.org/~jrodman/krisgale-trax10_files/008_radman.jpg" rel="nofollow">presence</a> at the event.)</li>
<li>I specifically went and read the voting policy before mentioning this vote to the sources which were used in the creation of this article. The policy makes no mention of voting being reserved for users or longstanding users. It makes a suggestion that it is better for the votes to be from logged in users. As a result I recommended to these people that they might want to create accounts. The rationale behind this suggestion in the voting guidelines was not given, so I was not able to surmise that it is "wrong" to vote as a new or non-user. In fact, the text rather suggests the opposite.</li>
<li>These are not irrelevant humans who have no relation to this article. They are the <i>sources</i> who populated this article. As such they are the <i>experts</i> on this information, more so than you, the article author. The sources of your information, the actual experts on the topic, believe that the information is trivial and non-encyplopædic. They are weighing in with this opinion. I believe this is relevant.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I've created a user account for myself so you all would know who I am, know me as a relatively long-standing member of the #trax community, and not have to refer to me by IP address. As such I've reverted RadMan's comment re: the fifth edit associated with the IP, since I'm proud to say that the edits here are my first. I offer that the scant record of our collective previous contributions to Wikipedia is immaterial to the discussion. RadMan is well aware of the individuals contributing here, so all that's proven by mentioning our edit records is that we care enough about this topic to chime in. I feel that RadMan has done more to demonstrate his assumption that the very members of the community he strives to document are not acting in <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">good faith</a> here, than to demonstrate any concrete reasoning why the #trax entry conforms to Wikipedia's content guidelines.

<p>I'd like to point out that people aren't voting according to the rules. What we <i>should</i> be voting on is whether or not this is encyclopaedic and belongs on Wikidedia. In my view, it doesn't fit either requirement. There's no precedent on Wikipedia for this type of super-detailed, chapter-by-chapter synopsis and it just goes overboard in my opinion. If you can't afford to buy the book, you can borrow it from a library or a friend or wait until the movie comes out on TV. Wikipedia is not here to provide free e-books. My vote is to <b>delete</b> with prejudice--meaning that we don't want to set a precedent here; the brief overviews/synopses we have for other major works (including The Satanic Verses, Huck Finn, Pride and Prejudice, and even the other Harry books) are plenty. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 16:03, July 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

The conclusion of the court? "A detailed summary of plot constitutes an abridgment that exceeds what is required to serve any legitimate purpose".

<p>Somehow I feel that we need to inform a higher authority, eg. the Board of Trustees about this. If a copyvio lawsuit could potentially occur, it's only fair that those people who are truly involved be informed, not us lay Wikipedians.

<dd>I've voted, however I would like to second the above. Voting should never take priority over the legal status of WP, and if the Board feels that this article constitutes a copyvio sufficient to initiate legal action, then it should be removed post-haste.

<dd>Thirded. If this is a copyvio, Harry Potter is such a vast money-making empire that I have a suspicion we could be at great risk of a lawsuit.

<dd>I agree with this.

<li>Yes, <b>but is it encyclopedic?</b> THAT is the question this Vfd was to answer.

<ul>
<li>I think this VfD is asking more questions than just "is it encyclopedic?", most deleters seem to be arguing it's a copyvio. I believe the full plot summary was moved to its own article so the main article would have as few spoilers as possible and also for size considerations. In my interpretation, the size of a plot summary is likely to be in direct proportion to both the size of the book/thing being summarized and the hype surrounding a release. They key word in most definitions of the word "encyclopedia" I've seen is "comprehensive", though I am all for succinct summarization at a language level generally but in this case I think everything included is relevant. Feel free to clean it up without removing clarity yourself. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 12:55, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I suggested an investigation should be undertaken, if it is determined by someone official that the plot summary content should be removed then someone official should remove it regardless of this vote. But until then, legal considerations that don't fit within a defined area of wikipedia policy are orthogonal from a standard vote for deletion and discussion of the issues by the wikipedia community. Have Harry Potter publishers actually threatened a lawsuit?

<li>Ok good, I thought for a minute you were saying voting and discussion should cease here because the Board of Directors has been summoned. Anyway, isn't the burden of proof on the pro delete crowd to prove (or for the b.o.d to determine) that the article is unworthy of wikipedia since it doesn't obviously violate any wikipedia policies? The chapter by chapter summary seems to be relevant to the overall plot of what happens in a lengthy book, though regardless I fail to see how excessive summary length means we should delete it (or drastically reduce it after merging back). Putting full plot summary details in its own article for the purpose of keeping spoilers separate was a good idea. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 17:25, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'd say that is way fewer spoilers, though it does give away the big kahuna spoiler. I may be wrong but I think at one point all spoilers were moved to the full plot summary article, size was obviously a concern too. The spoilers in H. B.

<li><b>Keep</b> I can't believe there is evenan argument over taking it off temporarily.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Putting aside the copyright infringement question, a lot of you seem to be missing a major point: Encyclopedias do not generally contain lengthy synopses of <b>any</b> novel.

<li><b>Strong Keep and Condense</b>: While I don't see this as a copyright infringement, it is longer than the length for articles regulate and should be shorten and possibly renamed. It is not a substitute for the book itself but it is immensely helpful for those who wish to be informed on the major plot points. It is rather a bit longer than other summaries for each book. While I would like the other summaries lengthened, this one has not only the major plot points but some of the minor plot points as well. It should be condensed by at least 3 page lengths especially when other books in the series which are much longer and not nearly this well expanded on. It should be proportionate to the size of the original condensing to approximately 2-5% of the original book length and 5-10% but not to exceed 15 pages printed materials in regular Times New Roman 12pt font if not newly released.

<li><b>Keep</b> There is no reason that a plot summary cannot be as long as the contributors wish to make it. The amount of interest in this book certainly justifies a longer article. As for the copyright paranoia, I can think of few things that are less likely to be sued than a scholarly synopsis with very few quotes for an encyclopedia based in a country other than the author's. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesteve_4de4.html" title="User:Thesteve"><font style="background: darkblue" color="#FFFFFF">&#160;T</font><font style="background: #0000AA" color="#FFFFFF">h</font><font style="background: #0000CD" color="#FFFFFF">e&#160;</font><font style="background: blue" color="#FFFFFF">St</font><font style="background: royalblue" color="#FFFFFF">ev</font><font style="background: #6666FF" color="#FFFFFF">e&#160;</font></a> 06:05, July 22, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The chapter by chapter organization seems to make it easier for the entire community to participate in the summarization process. How long should the article be in your view, 2/3rds current size, half, 1/10th, deletion = 0?

<li>That seems way too short to me, that isn't a summary, not enough core context, it basically just gives away the ending. The HP phenomenon seems to be about the overall story of what happens, and what happens to the characters, rather than just the ending of each book. Also, summarizes should probably be in some proportion to the size of the book being summarized and HP books are actually quite lengthy. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen-master_21ee.html" title="User:Zen-master">zen master</a> <a href="../../../z/e/n/User_talk%7EZen-master_a0a3.html" title="User talk:Zen-master">T</a> 12:26, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

I agree that there is probably considerably more written in Wikipedia on Atlas Shrugged than Harry Potter, but it is in-depth, not merely a recounting of events. The Bible is the most influential book ever written, and as such it receives a special status. In some instances I think the Bible articles could be trimmed down, anyway. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy summaries are miniscule in comparison to this one. The opening volume of the series is summarized by a mere 290 words, even shorter than the "short" summary at <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Blood_Prince_231d.html" title="Half-Blood Prince">Half-Blood Prince</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesmusik_3e65.html" title="User:Jamesmusik">James</a> 04:10, July 23, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>So you're saying that you would like this article to be less summary and more analysis, but such things are generally encyclopedic? Great! I look forward to seeing your improvements.

<li><b>delete-temporaily</b> Considering the popularity of the book, at least give a month breathing time so others can spend the time reading the book without giving away any pertanent information.</li>
<li>I disagree with the copyright arguments. It is legal to photocopy 25% of a work and this article sumarizes the plot in much less space than 25% of the book. Furthermore, I disagree with the non-encyclopedic nature of this article arguments. I beleive that the mere fact that the article exists is an interesting social commentary in and of itself and highly academically useful. I believe that BOTH the article and the discussion should be saved indefinately. Moreover, as Wikipedia is an opt-in set up (that is people have intentionally choose to access information from the site) I don't believe it harms anyone who wishes to read the full text of the story themselves. Rather, people can exercise their own disciple and choose not to read this article. That is what the spoiler warning at the top is for. I vote KEEP and ARCHIVE Forever (and link to this discussion) SkyJamer</li>
<li>It is most certainly NOT legal to photocopy 25% of a copyrighted work that is in print. There is no hard and fast guideline, but most publishers will not allow more than 10-15% of an in-print work to be reprinted even if you were to pay them royalties; printing even that much without even asking for permission would almost certainly be seen as a copyright violation. Copyright law, including what does and does not constitute fair use, is an extremely complex subject, and cannot be summarized by blanket statements like "you can reprint this percent without permission".

<li><b>Keep All</b> - For one thing, this is a continuing work in progress, and this deletion is coming in the middle of it all. The pages need to be worked on but not summarily deleted. Wikipedia is conducive to expanding its knowledge, and you can't fit absolutely everything about these characters onto one page. People have tried, and it only gets really messy and far beyond the recommended size of an article. Many people have been working hard to demonstrate the lengthy stories and characteristics of these games, but they're more complex than is suitable for a single page, and if each character is given an individual page, not only will there be boundless room for expansion as the series progress, but the article can serve its purpose: to teach people what they want to know. And besides, people will eventually get into strategy sections too, which will make this all the more worthwhile. Nothing should be deleted. Seriously, though, what does it hurt? (Edit: Sorry, I forgot my user name, which is <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShackleton_b277.html" title="User:Shackleton">Shackleton</a>.)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>, both on the category and several individual articles (<a href="../../../j/i/n/Jin_Kazama_23cb.html" title="Jin Kazama">Jin Kazama</a>, for example). Some of the individual character pages include a <i>lot</i> of information, and consolidating such pages with <i>every</i> other Tekken character article would look (a) <i>horrendous</i> and (b) disorganised.

He's as important to Namco as Ryu, Ken and Chun Li are to Capcom. I personally don't even think anyone can come up with a good reason to delete these pages. the argument for Keep is so strong: list pages are too long and there's too much known information about each character...the only reason why Lists are created is if there's little information for each item, otherwise we could have "Lists of the Presidents of the United States", "List of States", etc. If any further proof is needed, go to "Edit" of the "List of SC chars" and it says "...this page is &gt;90kb, please shorten..." (paraphrased). With all due respect, I don't think the detractors understand the magnitude of information available for these characters. Strategy alone (and I don't mean FAQ-like but general, informative stuff) could fill up a page. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubbachuck_65dc.html" title="User:Bubbachuck">Bubbachuck</a> 18:38, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>There is none. Similarly, there is no scholar who uses <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prussian_Holocaust_b9c4.html" title="Prussian Holocaust">Prussian Holocaust</a> and <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_Holocaust_c20a.html" title="Ukrainian Holocaust">Ukrainian Holocaust</a> for the events the POV pushers apply to what WP describes as <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evacuation_of_East_Prussia_813e.html" title="Evacuation of East Prussia">Evacuation of East Prussia</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holodomor.html" title="Holodomor">Holodomor</a>, respectively. There was no way to have these articles deleted via VfD. I ended up writing these articles about the terms, pointing out that it is arcane and obscure. <b>The article about the term doesn't imply its legitimacy</b> if it says explicitly that the term is not used in the mainstream . There is no reason not to do the same with Old Ruthenia. Again, <b>deleting</b> is fine with me. But if it has to stay, should be the term article rather than the article about the <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kievan_Rus%27_1194.html" title="Kievan Rus'">Kievan Rus'</a> or a redirect. And under no circumstances should two articles be allowed to simply duplicate each other. <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kievan_Rus%27_1194.html" title="Kievan Rus'">Kievan Rus'</a> is the article for the historic material.

<ul>
<li>Your arguments are misdirecting. The "holocaust" articles are about these terms and their (biased) usage. "Evacuation" is a descriptive term about an event that does not have an established name. "Holodomor" The article in question attempts to <b>establish</b> a new name for a thing that was never called in this way in English language, mainstream or else. This is a fresh POV pushing, to be resisted. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 23:49, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>To the contrary, the article denounces the <i>attempts</i> to establish the new term. A redirect helps establish a term more than an explanation denouncing it.

<p>I just thought that perhaps redirect of Old Ruthenia to <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruthenia.html" title="Ruthenia">Ruthenia</a> might also be not a bad idea. The <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruthenia.html" title="Ruthenia">Ruthenia</a> article already includes the info on usage and etymology. Not that I would mind deletion of Old Ruthenia, but the old way (redirect to <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kievan_Rus%27_1194.html" title="Kievan Rus'">Kievan Rus'</a>) was a more odd solution, I think. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a></p>

<dd>All right. Should we restore it then? My point, as I said, is that whether the article ends up with a <b>delete</b> or a <b>redirect</b>, nothing can prevent a malicious user to recreate a fork or fill the entry with bs. A redirect to <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruthenia.html" title="Ruthenia">Ruthenia</a> seems both reasonable and defensible. I am just afraid, the deletion won't last (even if it passes). Anyway, the fork will go away for sure. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 17:51, July 19, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I do understand your arguments; in fact, it was me who created this redirect some time ago, for the very reasons you are putting forth now. But please contemplate seriously what I am saying now:</dd>
<dd>"Old Ruthenia" was never in use <b>as a distinctive term</b> for a certain entity, like <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Sacramento_4208.html" title="Old Sacramento">Old Sacramento</a> or <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Norse_cc89.html" title="Old Norse">Old Norse</a>. One may speak of, say, "Old France," and there even is <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_French_38c4.html" title="Old French">Old French</a>, but I don't think anybody ever will want the redirect Old France. There is no practical reason to have this Old Ruthenia redirect: most certainly every thing was sometimes old and sometimes new, and sometimes neither. That is why I placed it for deletion, rather than reverted to my original version, to close the issue once and for all. And each time this russophob will try to recreate it, I will delete it basing on this vote, rather that engage in revert wars. There are even precedents to create an empty protected page, using {{mediawiki:noarticletext}}, if the guy will be too perisistent. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 19:15, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now I got the idea. If you, as an admin, are allowed to use the vote result to delete the reappeared article in the future, it is indeed for the best to do the VfD once and for all. Unless, of course, a different text gets dumped into the newly recreated entry. Then, we will need a new VfD. It's amazing, how easy it is for a frivolous editor to waste so much time of so many others. But that's common in life, not only in WP.

<li><b>A Defense</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Whether you believe the Totally Obvious deserves an entry in the Wikipedia depends on your conception of the Wikipedia. I'm sure conceptions of the Wikipedia are many and varied, but for the sake of my argument, let me draw a simple but useful dichotomy here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you think of the Wikipedia as a more or less informal communitarian reference work, you'd probably have no sustainable objection to including the entry here proposed. If, on the other, you see the Wikipedia in more possessive or rigid terms as an effort toward definitive epistemological excellence and authority -- the open source rival to the Encyclopedia Britannica -- then you're probably of the mind of many on this page to exclude it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I happen to be of the more liberal camp here, as in many things, and even in spite of my patently interested position in the debate, I would endorse its inclusion on these philosophical grounds. Indeed, I find the position and the practices here demonstrated by those who have sought to exclude it rather misguided. For one things, it is contrary to the "public commons" spirit of the wikipedia as a whole and, in many cases, contrary to the spirit of their own arguably marginal contributions. Secondly, and more substantially, it establishes a false and unfitting expectation for the Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As a sometime college instructor of writing, I encourage my students to browse and read the Wikipedia freely in the course of their research -- especially their preliminary research -- of a subject. But I sternly advise them against citing it in their final papers or essays. Not that the information is inherently unreliable, but there are more reliable sources out there. Open markets have, under the right circumstances, a capacity for great wisdom. But they also have a tendency toward speculation, mania, and extremism -- all things that make the Wikipedia much more enjoyable reading than most traditional encyclopedias. Reputable, deliberately funded, professionally staffed journals and reference books have established their credibility in their field and they make it their reason-for-being to uphold that credibility. The two types of cultural production can certainly reinforce one another. But it would advance the debate here, I believe, if their different roles were not confused.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is not to say outright trivia, libel, slander, vandalism, hate-mongering, or incoherence have any place here. But a casual perusal of the Totally Obvious should reassure a fair-minded viewer that, while it may be irrevent, ramshackle, and novel, it rises above that more minimal standard for relevance and is worthy of the namespace here requested for it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But put aside these philosophical arguments and let us focus on the practical merits of the case at hand. Objections or votes in favor of deleting the Totally Obvious entry have been justified on the following grounds:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. It's nonsense.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Rebuttal: This is an invidious and almost wholly unsubstantiated claim. As noted above, a casual investigation of the Totally Obvious should satisfy a reasonable person that there is some sense behind: a sense of humor, a sense of the absurd, a literary sensibility, a political sensibility -- there is much sense in it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. It's promotional</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Rebuttal: This can be said of every entry as any entry in the Wikipedia that includes external links -- or refers to external events! -- is liable to the same charge. I would guess that the blog has done more to promote the Wikipedia than the Wikipedia has done -- or will ever do -- to promote the blog. Moreover, even if this were a motivation driving its original submission to the Wikipedia, it is not a primary one. As one voter suggests above, this might even be looked upon favorably as a singular and creative application of the Wikipedia as a gateway for public recognition and public evaluation. If it is ultimately frivolous or transient, let it moulder away in its namespace --or, more in the spirit of things, be overshadowed and pushed down the page by more substantive claims to its namespace.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. It's a joke</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Rebuttal: I take this objection as having something to do with either the way it is represented in its entry or with the thing itself. That the thing itself might be light-hearted, irreverent, predominantly comical spirit is no real claim against its inclusion here. If the objection is against the tone and terms with which it has been represented, that may be emended easily enough, without exterminating the thing altogether.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4. A violation of procedure</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I can offer no defense of the pranksters and vandals who have injected themselves into this debate other than to say their efforts have been pretty harmless thus far.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I recognize that those who oppose inclusion of the Totally Obvious here in the Wikipedia on institutional ground probably do so out of the noblest reasons. But in doing so, they make us all victims of that inexorable law governing unintended consequences. In positing themselves as dogmatic guardians of the integrity and civility of the community, they have introduced the most negative and unnecessary emotions to the matter. And in trying to preserve their own particular vision of the Wikipedia, they have ended up, in an admittedly very minor way, undermining it by making it smaller than it need be. It's the Wikipedia, not the Cliquipedia. If you want to establish small coteries of like-minded individuals who share your tastes and would suppress that which challenges your views or vision, I'd strongly recommend setting up a blog.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would say that there are a lot of neologisms in the world, every day, new words are created. It would seem that we could not use new words until they got old, like Wiki could use 'rap' because it is more than 15 years old, but not 'bling-bling' because it is too new, too neo. The point is, are people using them or is the author just making them up? Wiki is concerned with the latter, not the former. Here is the source: Wikipedia does not accept fan-made neologisms unless they have realistic evidence of existence via search engine hits (e.g. Google). Gate's Law produces significant hits on Google. It therefore passes the Google test for neologisms. <a href="../../../c/y/f/User%7ECyferx_cbb6.html" title="User:Cyferx">Cyferx</a> 22:04, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. While researching this tragedy on the Web I was led to the Wikipedia page and found it very useful. An encyclopedia article that contributes to research (I'm a Ph.D. criminologist) is worthwhile, indeed.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. While most of the thousands of deaths in this conflict are not notable, this one in particular is.

<p>Recently undeleted because it was voted to be deleted without proper process, I'm re-nominating it partly because others in the undeletion discussion asked for it to be re-nominated, partly because I also think it should go on basis of being little more than trivia.

It's terribly written! Here's a sample sentence: "The circumstance that individuals, groups or entire nations are not clothed, is in such cases not simply an expression of a natural form of living, but reflects in an allegorical manner intentions of the author, or it fulfils different functions within the text." The writer means: "Sometimes nudity plays a symbolic role in science fiction." --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 05:11, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

Brent Bozell</a> and his PTC protest-group. While disliked by some religious <s>loons</s> activists, the show also has progressive religious defenders, as seen in <i>Religion in the Simpsons</i> which is available at Amazon. As a lightning-rod in the "culture wars", the longest-running prime-time show presently on US television finds its morality (of which visual nudity is a frequently referenced short-hand indicator) the subject of frequent discussion. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 09:04, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: on the basis that its not encyclopedic, it would be absolutely foolish to delete, as that way the list would be lost and no one COULD make it encyclopedic without persay, watching all the DVDs.

<li><b>Delete</b> -- I now feel confident both articles should be handled the same way -- if this phenomena of cliche pictures is encyclopedic, then write about that in an appropriately titled article, but this seems to just be a non-notable intricacy of the barely notable forum site Fark.com which is something that should not expand into a whole article on its own, because people just would not look for something like this in an ecyclopedia.

IMO the related VfD should result in a redirect, and this should be kept, because this article is already encyclopedic and interesting, and because of the likelihood this will be an even more encyclopedic article. After all, we've VfDd and kept an article about a woman who's only encyclopedic accomplishment in life was to climb mt everest in a skirt and wrote a book about it.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Frances is a douchebag. Then again, so are Drew Curtis and Jeff, the two head honchos behind fark.com, so it's not like fark users aren't used to that sort of thing. Anyway, as I've said before -- when we use fark, we try to forget about its many, many flaws (such as the unfair deletions, paying to be linked on the main page, the superiority complexes of TotalFarkers, etc.). Some of what helps us forget are the funny cliches and articles that appear. The "Ha Ha" guy is one of those cliches. It's almost like someone has to die of cancer and the article linked to the main page for the admins and moderators -- as well as Fark posters both lite and TF -- to not be douchebags. When you attack the items used from the site, you attack its users as well. Most think its funny, and most think it is relevant. If you are going to delete it, and I don't think you should, then at least link the stupid thing to fark.com which you SHOULD have done in the first place. Which makes me think, if you are going to link it to fark.com, and have it listed as being relevant to the site, wouldn't it need its own entry to explain WHY it's there in the first place? Granted, Admiral Ackbar is listed due to Star Wars. But he has additional significance as it relates to Fark.com. It's really a fine line here, but why make such a big deal out of it? When it comes down to it, it's just an image, and you guys at Wikipedia aren't exactly the most superior life forms on the Internet, either. Nobody is really going to notice this after it calms down, and now that it's one day later after one of the Fark admins went off his ritalin and all but demanded that Fark posters who liked the image stopped using it, things ARE beginning to calm down a bit. At least, that's the way it seems to me. --68.158.111.157 01:09, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article indeed seems to be much more informative than the original "Ha Ha Guy" article. I have done a lot of reading on what does and does not constitute a valid Wikipedia article. Everything I have read so far suggests that the article is completely legit. These internet memes are fascinating and I see no reason whatever to remove them. There are no space constraints - as previously mentioned, this is not a paper encyclopedia! Furthermore, the arrogance of those that seek to remove the page is disgusting to me. If the article is not "noteworthy" to you, simply don't read about it. I find lots of stuff in the Chinese language Wikipedia to be "not noteworthy", yet I am not parading around trying to remove the content. I think Wikipedia was built for articles like this in mind. --<a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigizen_3647.html" title="User:Digizen">Digizen</a> 02:47, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
