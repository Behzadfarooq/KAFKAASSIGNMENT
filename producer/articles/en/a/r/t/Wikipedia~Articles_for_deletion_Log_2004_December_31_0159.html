<li><b>Delete.</b> After some brief googling, I didn't find anything that would distinguish this player to a sufficient extent to warrant an encyclopedic entry. --<a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidG_2ba7.html" title="User:RidG">RidG</a> | <a href="../../../r/i/d/User_talk%7ERidG_5b69.html" title="User talk:RidG">Talk</a> 00:59, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, there are many articles in Wikipedia about sportspeople of a similar standing in both basketball and other sports. This article has improved since it was nominated for deletion, and as it stands doesn't break any of the current deletion policies. (I have restored the VfD tag on the article, it was removed by <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">User:Boothy443</a>) <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 01:18, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, nn (I'll be outvoted if enough people think <i>any</i> professional basketball player in the US should have an article here). <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 01:29, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Tentative Keep</b>. It may not be logical, but there seems to be wide precedent that all professional athletes are fit subjects for Wikipedia biographies. Certainly, we have many articles on professional rugby and football players on obscure English teams. I think this is too bad, but since the inclusion/deletion criteria are pretty vague, precedent is all we have to go by. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:10, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b>. The original vfd was for "dirty" article, which looked suspicious. People with "spectacular" ocupations are "notable" according to wikipedia criterion: there is high probability that the info about them will be sought for, however lousy ball players they are. This is not fair with respect to other decent people, but... <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 02:19, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep. Not just an average BB player--frequent starter in the pros, and on some all-time top-ten MSU stat lists from his collegiate career. Article as tagged was a mess and didn't establish notability, but re-write is better. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 02:28, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Obvious <b>keep</b>. Mikkalai, "other decent people" presumably only have to meet the same bar and you can write about them too.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 02:40, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> agree with <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a>, sorry about the VfD removal. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> 04:20, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Abstain: I thoroughly disagree with the supposition that <i>any</i> NBA player is automatically notable, or that any MLB player is, etc. These athletes need to be stand-outs on their teams and/or appear outside of their team. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:25, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the rewrite is good enough. I listed the page as it was a repository of statistics, not an article. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">Smoddy</a> | <a href="../../../s/m/o/User_talk%7ESmoddy_5430.html" title="User talk:Smoddy">Talk</a> 11:25, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Merely being signed to a professional team means nothing - they have to show that they can achieve at that level to be worthy of inclusion. Four years as a starting player for a team in a major league is what I personally feel is the minimum required in terms of duration, and from comments above it would appear that he has achieved that. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 11:42, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Unfortunately wiki doesn't have other means of banning certaing page names from recreation of persistent trolls. I even gave them some slack by posting the old text in the talk page talk:Andr√© Nilsen, so that they could enhance his notability. I have nothing against Mr. Nilsen. I am against the promotionalist efforts to present a student organisation as an advisor of global importance, with powerful spamming wherever possible in wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 21:39, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Unfortunately wiki doesn't have other means of banning certaing page names from recreation of persistent trolls.</i> AFAICT, there is no consensus that this particular page name should be "banned from recreation" in the first place. If such consensus is reached, that this page name should indefinitely be stopped from creation regardless of content, then I would support implementation of such a solution in a manner which doesn't otherwise break the functionality of the wiki. If it's so important that a page with this name never be created, then I'm sure someone will be able to code up a feature which allows this. But creating an article saying that the article was deleted <b>defeats the purpose of deleting the article in the first place</b>. <i>I am against the promotionalist efforts to present a student organisation as an advisor of global importance, with powerful spamming wherever possible in wikipedia.</i> Well, then the best solution is to create a neutral page on the topic. Page protection can be used to ensure neutrality, if necessary. Maybe I'm wrong, and you can explain to me what purpose this serves beyond that provided by the solution of protecting an actual article rather than a policy-violating self-reference. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> Ë≠¶Âëä 00:25, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: I honestly don't know. Without the ability to verify, I have to work on the presumptive principle. I know a fellow who runs the Spenser Society (for the study of Edmund Spenser) and therefore automatically became the editor of <i>Spenser Quarterly.</i> That's great stuff, and he's an outstanding scholar, but it's not really a matter of notability: that's high achievement in a specialized field. Professors at leading institutions do that as a par for the course. That makes thousands of people around the world. Something more is needed. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:26, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. The above argument does not make sense. As opposed to the very specialist example of the Spenser expert, this guy seems to be a generalist who is involved in a range of areas from security and politics to business and economics. There is also no automaticity in what he does - he seems to have built it all up from scratch. Hanover.

<li>Comment: <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKellyCoinGuy_f516.html" title="User:KellyCoinGuy">User:KellyCoinGuy</a> I appreciate the courtesy of inviting me to this page Andrewa. Thank you. Courtesy is a good Wiki Community feature. As the original author of the page, I thought at the time it was an interesting idea... the goal was to see if participation in Wikipedia could be promulgated through the approach of a game. It didn't work, and I'm sure that by itself is interesting. Why didn't it catch on? Because nobody saw it, because nobody cared, because it didn't have a champion, or (my favorite) it was just a plain old fashioned STUPID idea.&#160;;-) I won't venture an opinion as to whether the page should be kept or deleted, I am ok with it either way... but it does present an interesting sociological question about how the Wikipedia community is different than say, most chat rooms. I think Tony had the real insight about the significance of this page (if indeed it has ANY AT ALL). I will say this though, the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWiki-Link_Game_de2c.html" title="Wikipedia:Wiki-Link Game">Wikipedia:Wiki-Link Game</a> is far more inane. The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikifun_2ab9.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikifun">Wikipedia:Wikifun</a> game seems fun, but doesn't contribute... maybe if it contributes, then it's not a game? Before deleting the article entirely, why not give it half a chance to succeed by placing it (properly) in the category Wikipedia games and see if it catches on then? 10 Jan 2005</li>
