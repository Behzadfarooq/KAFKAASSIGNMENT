<dd>It doesn't say anything about racism. The ruling states that despite mr. Mathew's violent behaviour -he broke the prison governor's face and threatened prison staff with a self made weapon, according to the Eduardo Mathews article you have written- it was not legal to treat him more harshly than other inmates. It is nowhere stated he was treated that way because of the color of his skin or any other reason. You basically have one man and his family calling for a boycott because he feels he was mistreated because of his race and his remarkable intelligence. This might be true or not, but is it a movement? Is it encyclopedic? The inclusion of this article is in itself POV because it seems to be created with the intention of being linked to from the Natelee Holloway article and support the POV that there is something wrong with the justice system on Aruba. Your article on mister Mathews is fine, but there is no connection with the Holloway case, imo. --<a href="../../../m/z/z/User%7EMzzl_7b96.html" title="User:Mzzl">Mzzl</a> 10:52, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You did not quote the preceeding line in my reason for asking for deletion: <i>... the Natalee Holloway related call for a boycott is already sufficiently covered under the natalee holloway topic.</i> I don't see how the two issues are related, and why a call to boycott Aruba warrants a page of its own.

<dd>The issue is not whether racism exists in the Aruban government. The issue is whether "Boycott Aruba" refers to anything, and whether that thing is notable or encyclopedic. I am not arguing for the deletion of the content, but of the article that tries to connect two events that are only related by a POV. That portion of the above material that is worth including in WP should, in my opinion, appear in other articles. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 17:06, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>... the issue is not "whether the boycott is appropriate", the issue is whether or not this is an encylopedic article that can stand on it's own merit. I'd say it is not. There are vastly more publicized boycotts that don't have articles. Google hits by and large reference <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalee_Holloway_a742.html" title="Natalee Holloway">Natalee Holloway</a> related boycott, which is not even the main thrust of this article.

<li><b>Delete</b>... This topic does not merit its own page. It is a mere footnote to the larger Holloway story, and nothing more. Although I believe that a topic on the Bus Boycott in Montgomery, Alabama would merit its own page rather than being part of a larger article on the civil rights movement because of its accomplishments and scope, this "boycott" has no historical merit, arguably isn't even going on except in the minds of the Twitty family and a few others who cannot let this case go.
