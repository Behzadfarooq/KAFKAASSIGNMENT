<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I know that monarchies (especially modern ones that are mainly ceremonial) seem pointless to many (most?) of us, but generally my criterion is <i>nth in line to the throne</i> where <i>n</i> is a single digit. Barely makes the cutoff here. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 14:30, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm torn on this one. She hasn't done anything of note yet, and I can't find any English-language articles from reliable sources that focus on her. But I suppose that's normal, as she's 11. However, with royalty I tend to agree with Fan-1967; she's born into notability, however scant. Prince Harry has been notable since birth, and the biggest news he ever made was dressing up like a Nazi for Halloween. In my opinion, royal children are notable simply for their close association with truly notable adults. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 15:10, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Personally, I don't believe in the automatic notability of <i>anyone</i> from Belgium.

I could get behind a merge and redirect, but not deleting it completely. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 15:50, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, despite there not being anything much to say about her except who she's related to.

<li>If I may, its a kind of name recognition. For example, you're standing around with a bunch of other people at a party.

Someone says "Oh look its John Jones" and unless there's some reasonably famous person named John Jones, maybe one or two people will look. In this case, if someone says "Oh look its Princess Luisa Maria of the Royal House of Belgium" I believe (being a dumb american with no royal house myself) that there would be a similar, if smaller, reaction to Clint Eastwood.<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 20:10, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ol>
<li>Royalty are intrinsically noteworthy, not because of personal deeds, but because their kinship to monarchs confers upon them national (and sometimes international) position (usually, though not invariably, reflected by title), fame, and constitutional relevance.</li>
<li>Excluding them would be a reversal of encyclopaedic practice, usually defended on relatively recent, egalitarian principles that are inadmissably POV: believing that royalty <i>shouldn't</i> be intrinsically notable seems to be a growing trend, but it does not <i>make</i> them non-notable. Whereas treating royalty as non-notable is ahistorical (not to mention Western-centric): The burden of proof that historical encyclopaedic practice has been overturned due to a sufficiently great change in current standards of notability (rather than due to, e.g. space considerations -- a limitation from which Wiki does not suffer) rests upon the advocate for change.</li>
<li>Thus far no argument has been put forth here that royalty have <i>lost</i> notability -- rather, the chief argument presented here is, implicitly, that they did not deserve it previously, and that Wiki should pro-actively strip them of it. <i>Not</i> Wiki's job.</li>
<li>In this particular case, I also agree with <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Halo</a> that the question of notability would not get serious consideration if the princess in question were a granddaughter of <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom</a> (e.g. <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Beatrice_of_York_88f0.html" title="Princess Beatrice of York">Princess Beatrice of York</a>) rather than of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_II_of_Belgium_db02.html" title="Albert II of Belgium">Albert II of Belgium</a>, although both are current monarchs. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 04:58, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
