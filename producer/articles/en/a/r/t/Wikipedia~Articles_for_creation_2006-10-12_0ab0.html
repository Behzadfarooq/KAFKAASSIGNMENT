<p>Before the year of 1902 in Korea, [Korean theatres] <a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_theatre" class="external autonumber" title="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_theatre" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> are forms of outdoor performance and folk theatres. In that year of 1902, the people of the folk established the first modern indoor theatre called <i>Hy≈èpyul-sa</i> (ÌòëÎ•†ÏÇ¨) theatre (Brandon 184). The theatre was National Theatre and supported by government (Ïú† 33). Later, with strong financial support, it overpowered other private theatres and exercised great influence on other theatres (Ïú† 33).</p>
<p>As the theatre began changing from outdoor to indoor, the style of theatre also transformed to a new style. That change was necessary because the style of outdoor theatre was limited spatially especially when it came into the space surrounded by walls. As the modern theatre built, new types of theatre had come to Korea from its near countries. A new genre of melodrama, <i>shinp‚Äôa</i>(Ïã†Ìåå) in Korea was influenced by the Japanese <i>shinpa</i> (Brandon 184). During [the period of Japanese rule] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_of_Japanese_Rule" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_of_Japanese_Rule" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, [Japanese government] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_government" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_government" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> brought <i>shinpa</i> under the name of "new play." The ‚Äúnew play‚Äù was the opposite concept of ‚Äúold play,‚Äù and it aimed for enlightening and educating people (ÏÑú 79). Korean also experienced Qing‚Äôs (Chinese) <i>kungu drama</i> ([Beijing Opera or Peiking Opera] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_opera" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_opera" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>). Those influences from Japan and Qing brought Korean people to contact indirectly Western culture and triggered a sensational change in history of theatre in Korea (You 32).</p>

<p>Edmund Anscombe (1873-1948) was the New Zealand architect responsible for the New Zealand and South Seas International Exhibition, Logan Park, Dunedin, 1925 and the New Zealand Centennial Exhibition, Rongatai, Wellington, 1940. His work spans across many architectural types - both in terms of function and style. He was the architect for the University of Otago before moving from Dunedin to Wellington in 1928. In addition to many projects in Wellington, including multi-storey apartments and Government Projects (such as the Post and Telegraph Building in Herd St), Anscombe was involved in projects following the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake - particularly in Hastings. He designed the first atmospheric cinema in New Zealand (the Empire Deluxe, Dunedin) and many of his works have been recognised as of historic significance by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.</p>

<p>A "Comprehensive Annual Financial Report" or "CAFR" as a government book keeping practice started in the post WWII economic boom and replaced what was regularly a "off-the-books" practice called the "general fixed asset account group" . The various levels of government "general government" or the federal United States, individual state governments and government agencies each began producing a CAFR in the late 1940's to early 1950's to catalog an accurate picture of institutional funds, or financial holdings, assets and total investment incomes for those government and nongovernmental entities using the report, which is above and beyond the budget process. In 1945, the Government Corporation Control Act, began the auditing of wholly owned government corporations and mixed ownership corporations,( those that government may have controlling holdings in but operate as private corporations) all of which may come under the term "enterprise funds". Accounting principles for government entities are set by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB)</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-12_0ab0.html" title="Edit section: CAFR vs. Budget">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">CAFR vs. Budget</span></h3>
<p>The CAFR shows accounting entries budget reports do not, and should not be confused with "rainy day funds" that are included in government budgetary reports and process. A budget is for a select grouping ("general fund") of accounts showing only the more commonly known revenue income from taxes, fees, licenses, fines and a select few revenue sources. The common government budget report also includes, expenses such as salaries, police, and entitlements will be shown along with required holdings to fund pensions, insurance and bonds.</p>
<p>The CAFR shows not only selectively presented budget items, but also government "enterprise operations" or "enterprise funds", investments, and the return on them (or loss). These funds include but are not limited to assets and holdings to back pension and retirment obligation reserves as required by law.</p>

<p>While a budget might indicate that the government or agency has financial trouble and debt, (because of excess spending within the select grouping of "general fund" accounts presented), the CAFR will normally indicate that government possesses large holdings considerably over what is shown in a budget report or "general fund" alone. Examples from receint history include, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessie_Ventura_1847.html" title="Jessie Ventura">Jessie Ventura</a>'s career, puncuated by his returning some of the government surplusses to voters first as mayor of Minneappolis and then as govenor of Minnesota. Other rare news events have highlighted the off-the-budget holdings of government. In one widely reported example in the late 1990's (Los Angeles) Orange County California lost $1-Billion on investments in the <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derivatives.html" title="Derivatives">derivatives</a> market.</p>
<p>A former US Air Force Accountant, Gerald R. Klatt and a former commodities broker Walter Burien, have made contoversial claims about the CAFR or "2nd set of books", with their assesments of government assets holdings. In recient years (1999) changes have been made to the GASB rules and claims have been made that such changes are attempts to hide assets and "enterprise funds" from the public after some scant media attention.</p>

He received his BA in Sociology and <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_Studies_8549.html" title="African American Studies">African American Studies</a> from <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_University_c8f9.html" title="Duke University">Duke University</a>.</p>
<p>Jones is originally from <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selma%2C_North_Carolina_2891.html" title="Selma, North Carolina">Selma, North Carolina</a>. He moved to <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durham%2C_North_Carolina_32ae.html" title="Durham, North Carolina">Durham, North Carolina</a> in 2000 to attain his baccalaureate degree at Duke University. After completing his undergraduate studies, he then moved to <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maumee%2C_Ohio_e6cd.html" title="Maumee, Ohio">Maumee, Ohio</a> (a suburb of <a href="../../../t/o/l/Toledo%2C_OH_6929.html" title="Toledo, OH">Toledo, OH</a>) in 2004 to pursue graduate education. There, he received a fellowship in his first year at the university.</p>
<p>Jones is noted as the first graduate student in the Department of Sociology at Bowling Green State University that was published in a peer-reviewed journal in his first year. His 2006 article, <i>Race and the "I Have a Dream" Legacy: Exploring Predictors of Positive Civil Rights Attitudes</i> was published in the <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_of_Black_Studies_110f.html" title="Journal of Black Studies">Journal of Black Studies</a>. The article explored the relationship between attitudes toward African Americans and attitudes toward <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a>. He found that ideological proximity and attitudes towards Blacks are positively associated with favorable civil rights attitudes.</p>
<p>In a co-authored paper presentation at the annual meeting of the <a href="http://www.popassoc.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.popassoc.org/" rel="nofollow">Population Association of America</a>, <a href="http://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/people/profile.html?ID=60" class="external text" title="http://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/people/profile.html?ID=60" rel="nofollow">Wendy Manning</a> and Antwan Jones (2005) found that couples who <a href="../../../c/o/h/Cohabit.html" title="Cohabit">cohabit</a> and are committed to marrying one another (e.g., get engaged before cohabiting) do not experience higher rates of divorce, but couples who cohabit before intending to marry divorce at higher rates. In addition, they found that that women who had a sexual partner besides their future spouse were significantly more likely to divorce than women who did not have a sexual partner besides their future spouse. Indeed, the association between cohabitation and divorce disappeared once they controlled for the sexual history of the woman.</p>
<p>In another paper that won an award from <a href="http://http://sssp1.org/" class="external text" title="http://http://sssp1.org/" rel="nofollow">Society for the Study of Social Problems</a>, Jones (2005) found that there is pan-Latino variation in homeownership that is primarily due to the variation in income, not wealth, among different Latino ethnicities. In addition, the extent to which an area resembles an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Enclave.html" title="Enclave">enclave</a> or a <a href="../../../s/e/g/Segregated.html" title="Segregated">segregated</a> area dictates which Latino group is more likely to own a home in that area. These results suggest that there are divergent consequences of U.S Latino <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assimilation.html" title="Assimilation">assimilation</a>. Depending on the ethnic group, income and the extent to which an area is segregated or an ethnic community, the likelihood of a Latino owning a home could either be enhanced or lowered.</p>
<p>For his qualifying paper at Bowling Green State University, Jones (2005) tested an analytical framework for analyzing African American <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morbidity.html" title="Morbidity">morbidity</a> in <a href="http://www.bsos.umd.edu/socy/jiceland/resseg1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bsos.umd.edu/socy/jiceland/resseg1.html" rel="nofollow">hypersegregated</a> areas. Focusing on <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypertension.html" title="Hypertension">hypertension</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronary_heart_disease.html" title="Coronary heart disease">coronary heart disease</a> (CHD), he found that both race and residing in a hypersegregated area are consistent predictors of developing both diseases. Controlling for health status decreased the racial gap in CHD but increased the gap in hypertension. This result provided some evidence that health plays a positive role in narrowing disparities in hypertension, but a negative role in narrowing disparities in CHD.</p>
<p>Jones is primarily interested in race/ethnic/cultural studies, social <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epidemiology.html" title="Epidemiology">epidemiology</a>/health, spatial demography and <a href="../../../m/i/g/Migration.html" title="Migration">migration</a>.</p>

<p>Quirk is the informal literary magazine from the students of Bangalore‚Äôs National Law School of India University (Law School in less imposing terms). Collaborative space, and monthly pulpit, there‚Äôs a lot that Quirk aims to be. The magazine, that comes out every fortnight was born because it was felt that Law School (and Indian education in general) was lacking in adequate spaces for creative literary expression. The volume of unpublished literature that inhabited computer storage spaces and wrinkling notebooks, stood testimony to this.</p>
<p>Quirk has now been in publication for over a year and a new team of enthusiastic editors is behind it. It is published once every three months and reflects a wide range of literary styles and topics.</p>

<p>Charles Taylor McDowell is professor emeritus, former director of the Center for Post-Soviet and Eastern European Studies at the University of Texas at Arlington, and a member of the Military Science Hall of Honor. Prior to becoming director of the Center for Post Soviet and Eastern European Studies, McDowell served as Assistant to the President and Dean of Student Life at the University during the late 1960's, which saw the Rebel Theme Controversy and attempts by the Students for a Democratic Society to establish a chapter on campus. He was the first chair of the UT Arlington Faculty Senate, a position to which he was re-elected six times.</p>
<p>At UT Arlington, McDowell has been regularly cited as one of the most popular professors among students and has been the recipient of numerous teaching awards.</p>
<p>Prior to his academic career, McDowell led a long and distinguished career with the United States Army and various government agencies. After graduating from the Agricultural and Mechanical college of Texas and the Officers Candidate School at Fort Benning, Georgia, he was commissioned Second Lieutenant of Infantry in the U. S. Army. He then attended the Basic Airborne Course at Fort Benning, and, after completion, was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division and the 11th airborne Division. He also served with the 97th Infantry Division in Europe. His early assignments included command positions from Platoon Leader to Battalion Commander. During later assignments McDowell was a Professor at Tokyo Army College (1946-1948) and was Commandant and Director of the College (1947-1948). From 1947 to 1949, he was Information and Education Officer for the Eighth U. S. Army and later the 82nd Airborne Division. From 1955 to 1958 he was a Professor of Russian language, history, economics, geography, and political science in a classified joint military/civilian intelligence agency and Chief of the research division from 1956 to 1958. In 1959, McDowell was an Instructor for the Command and General Staff College in Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and Hawaii.</p>
<p>McDowell is a graduate of the Defense Language Institute, the Foreign Area Specialist Program, the Defense Intelligence Course, the Armed Forces Staff College and a two year Soviet-East Europe Advanced Foreign Area Studies Program at the doctoral level. He received an MA Degree from Columbia University in 1953 and in 1956 a PHD from Texas A&amp;M.</p>
<p>McDowell joined the University of Texas at Arlington (then Arlington State College) in 1959 as Assistant Professor of Military Science and Tactics. After being promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, he left the University to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where he was Intelligence Officer of the Airborne Command Post, a job that often involved flying with the President of the United States and his staff.</p>
<p>McDowell is a Master Parachutist and has been awarded the Combat Infantry Badge. Other decorations include the Bronze Star Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster and Army Commendation Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, the American Defense Service, American Campaign, European Campaign, and Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medals, the WWII Victory, Army of Occupation Medals, the Korean Service, and the United Nations Medals. McDowell has served as a Diplomatic Courier and USSR Specialist, as well as a Foreign Service Officer for the State Department in the former Soviet Union, Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>He was Senior Area Administrator for Lyndon Johnson's Job Corps program, which entailed supervision of all centers in the United States between the Mississippi River and Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>At the request of President Jack Woolf of UT Arlington, McDowell returned to the University in 1966 to serve as Assistant to the President. He later became the director of the Center for Post-Soviet and Eastern European Studies and the Chair of the Department of Foreign Languages and Linguistics.</p>
<p>During the past quarter century, McDowell has made numerous contributions to print and televised media concerning the Soviet Union, People's Republic of China, and subjects related to Eastern Europe. Dr. McDowell is an author and co-author of many articles, documents, and books, including classified government documents concerning the Soviet Union. He is also author of numerous book reviews published by the Dallas Morning News. He has served as either chief translator or as editor on projects conducting non-classified technical, industrial, and scientific translation both from English to Russian and from Russian to English.</p>

<p>Cyrus was born 1989, November 20 in The Castro district of San Francisco. As a child, he enjoyed consuming insects and dead pigeons. When he was ten he moved to the Ozarks and hunted "coons" with his two faithful dogs. He won a raccoon hunting competition at the age of eleven and used the money to move his parents out of their rotting trailer. They moved back to California with young Cyrus's winnings. Some say that the shock of moving from the backcountry mountains was too much for his young mind to handle. He attended Petaluma Junior High until he was kicked out for drawing a penis on the principal's forehead. He then attended Sonoma Academy. He became a fine, upstanding, well adjusted student there. He led the popular gay straight alliance for three years and will run for the presidental position next year. He has applied to Oxford university and hopes to be accepted.</p>

Allman Brothers Band:</span></h2>
<p><br />
<b>Gregg Allman</b> (vocals, organ)<br />
<b>Duane Allman</b> (electric guitar, slide guitar)<br />
<b>Dickey Betts</b> (guitar)<br />
<b>Berry Oakley</b> (bass)<br />

<b>Jai Johanny Johanson</b> (drums, percussion)</p>
<p><br />
www.allmanbrothersband.com states that the show was <b>Saturday April 4th, 1970.</b><br />
Receipts ledger shows they played Saturday April 4th and Sunday April 5th.</p>
<p>Recorded live at Ludlow Garage, Cincinnati, Ohio on April 11, 1970. (Incorrect?)<br />
Includes liner notes by Ben Sandmel.</p>
<p><br />
<b>From a review at Bestprices.com</b><br />
"Recorded a year before their legendary Fillmore shows, this documents the Brothers' stand at a Cincinnati psychedelic ballroom of the period, ("We're going to have some electric wine," Gregg Allman comments at the end of the first set), and it's very much Gregg and Duane Allman's show. At this point, second guitarist Dickie Betts played mostly rhythm, sang hardly at all, and had yet to provide the country influence on their sound that would culminate in the signature "Rambling Man."<br />
<br />
The Allmans heard here are (merely) a brilliant blues band; if you need proof, check out their world-class version of "Hootchie Cootchie Man." As for the rest, Duane's slide guitar is as fiery and otherworldly as you'd expect throughout, and Gregg' vocals are both impassioned and subtle." (Bestprices.com)<br />

<p>Epicore is a melodic subgenre of hardcore punk music coined by the Longbeach, California band I AM GHOST. It is characterized by having a "rock opera" feel and lyrics that tell an epic story plot, while blending melodic hardcore punk and post-hardcore guitar rhythms with gothic rock symphonics and choral support vocals. Drummer of I AM GHOST, Ryan Seaman describes it in his own words here:</p>
<p>"[It] entails a lot of crazy guitar leads, vocal choirs, orchestras and things that sound really big." "We want to sound different and set ourselves apart from other bands. A lot of bands now are trying to take risks and we wanted to bring something new to the table. We want to inspire and change the face of music."</p>

<p>Molded pulp is the product produced when water is mixed with paper and the solution is allowed to dry in a <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molding_%28process%29.html" title="Molding (process)">mold</a>. The result is used in many applications from gardening pots to packaging tools.</p>

<p>Molded pulp began with a man named Andrew Keiding. He was a scientist who experimented with drying wet paper into molds. The molds were first used in churches and in local events. The molds grew more popular in demand and Keiding acquired a patent. Keiding Inc. was the first molded pulp production company and is still a leader in the manufacturing of molded pulp in America today. Since then many companies have started that specialize in the design and manufacture of molded pulp products and the use of these products is increasing throughout many industries.</p>

<p>Molded pulp can be stored by stacking the products together so that the molds take up less space. Like cups, most molded pulp products are produced to fit inside of each other. When a product is made out of molded pulp, it is highly shock absorbent. Because of this, it is used for packaging items inside a box. The products are kept safe inside the box because the molded pulp absorbs any shock that occurs in the shipping process. Molded pulp is lightweight and does not add significant weight to the shipping process. Because it is a mold, it can be specifically designed to package a particular product. It can be formed in any design possible. This enables the manufacturer to simply adjust the mold and produce molded pulp products to snugly fit anything that it is designed to protect during the shipping process. When the molded pulp products arrive at the shipping area, they are ready to used and no assembly is required by packaging workers. Because of this, many businesses are switching to molded pulp designs to replace the Styrofoam molds in current use.</p>
<p>Another benefit of molded pulp products is that they are very recyclable. They are made out of recycled paper and water. This makes the product cheap, it also helps to reduce waste and increase <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recycling.html" title="Recycling">recycling</a>. The entire product of molded pulp can also be recycled afterwards and used to make other recycled products.</p>

<p>There are three major types of molded pulp designs. The thick wall design usually has a wall thickness of 3/16 to 1/2 inch. It is used for support in heavier packaging requirements such as televisions and auto parts as well as in crates. The thicker walls give the molds great strength to protect virtually anything while moving it. The transfer mold is a thin walled design that has wall thickness between 1/16 and 3/16 inches. This design is the most prevalent, usually made out of recycled newspaper. This design can be seen in egg cartons, electronic packages and drink cartons. These molds are strong enough to protect delicate eggs and yet very light weight and inexpensive. Thermoformed <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fiber.html" title="Fiber">Fiber</a> molds are the new to the development of molded pulp designs. These forms are much smoother to the touch. This is because the molds are cooked in ovens instead of just drying them like the previous designs. These molds are used when appearance is an important issue. They appear as if they are made of plastic and have a relative strength to the transfer mold design.</p>

<p>Molded pulp is used in a number of industries and in a number of different products. Hospitals are a big user of molded pulp. The use molded pulp as biodegradable waste receptacles. These can be implemented in onetime use only receptacles to dispose of human waste. Bedpans and Specimen Vessels are two of many different uses that hospitals have for molded pulp. Molded pulp can also be used for flowerpots and baskets. The material is light and non-breakable making it easy to transport and safe to move. Molded pulp baskets are better for suspending in the air because of its lightweight compared to something made of clay or ceramic. Another use of molded pulp is in art. Masks for costumes can be form fitted to one‚Äôs face. It is not uncommon for artists to use molded pulp as a canvas for art. The three-dimensional quality of the product is used by many artists who make extravagant decorations such as Christmas tree decorations and other ornaments including small yard statues. Paper machete also is a common form of art and is often overlooked as being molded pulp. In fact, paper machete is a perfect example of molded pulp being that it is simply made out of paper mixed with water and the additive flour. Finally, one of the most common uses for molded pulp is in packaging. Molded pulp can be used inside of boxes as a shock support for electronics and other fragile objects. It is very important that fragile objects to be shipped are protected from outside abuse. Packing peanuts and other Styrofoam bracing is another common product used in shipping but because of the ability to be recycled on a large scale, molded pulp is becoming more popular. These molded designs absorb the shock that would otherwise be transferred to the product. Molded pulp products are also found in new shoes as the shoe lining that helps to keep the form of the shoe while it is on the shelf or in the box.</p>

<p>Producing molded pulp products is a simple and inexpensive process. First the raw ingredients of water and paper are mixed to form a water-paper paste. The paste is put into a mold that is designed for a specific task. The paste is allowed to dry and in some cases, the mold is cooked in ovens until the entire mold is in a cured state. The pulp is then extracted from the mold and is stacked, packaged, and shipped to other manufactures who put the product to use.</p>
