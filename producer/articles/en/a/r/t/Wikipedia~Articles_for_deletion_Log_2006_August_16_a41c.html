<li>I've been trying to figure out what to do with something like this. I found it patrolling new pages. I don't know why people do this, but I wish they wouldn't. It is true that in most cultures showing one's genitals is a means of showing disrespect. That's obvious, at least to me, an educated man. There could be an excellent article on the practise of showing the genital area as a way of showing contempt, but it would require experts from several fields, anthropology, classics, sociology, psychology, art history just to name a few. There could be an article here, and there probably are several out there. The problem is that this is a lowbrow thing made up in school one day that happens to strike a chord with cross-cultural human behaviour. I should have just let it be speedily deleted at once, and I regret putting up a hangon sign. <b>Delete,</b>please.<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Blythe_7728.html" title="User:Billy Blythe">Billy Blythe</a> 01:57, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>FWIW, I was one of the keep voters on the AfD for "List of dictators", and one of the main editors who shaped up the criteria and annotations there. So I think the general list is OK, albeit requiring active monitoring to prevent POV-creep. I simply don't see any advantage to this "digest" of the larger list, since the highlights I added to the larger list make reading the "currently in power" feature quite easy (I used boldface for years "-present"; but some other convention would be fine). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 04:43, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> this is a better and more interesting list than List of dictators. Dictators currently in power is a notable list in itself and deserving of a wikipedia article. If there are disputes over whether a particular person in power is a dictator, that can be dealt with as part of the article rather than by deleting the entire article. Merging would diminish this as not only would a notable list be removed but it would be much harder to pick out the current dictators in the larger list. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 10:52, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article is inherently biased. In order for neutrality to exist, we must discuss the controversy surrounding the allegations, including opposing viewpoints; however, this is impossible to do in a list entitled "List of dictators", as the title necessarily and erroneously implies that every leader within it is incontrovertibly a dictator. Let the leaders' policies and actions, which are outlined in their respective articles, serve as a neutral indication of their alleged dictatorial nature; do not try to make unconditional assertions based on the idiosyncratic inferences of editors (i.e., original research). In addition, reigning dictators are already discussed in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_dictators.html" title="List of dictators">List of dictators</a>, thereby making this article superfluous and a POV fork. If organization or "usefulness" is your concern, create a separate section in the original article, at the most; do not create a separate article to surreptitiously promote a POV. Thus, since it is impossible to objectively and incontrovertibly categorize a group of leaders as "dictators", and because this article is a POV fork, List of dictators currently in power should be deleted. -- <a href="../../../w/g/e/User%7EWGee_01b0.html" title="User:WGee">WGee</a> 03:20, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Retain</b>: Wikipedia serves as a valuable tool for looking up unfamiliar acronyms and phrases, to learn what they refer to. FTFF serves as a unifying mantra for a large number of Mac users, some of whom have a great deal of influence in the Mac technical community, and the rallying cry has taken on a life of its own, beyond mere "finder criticism", a term which doesn't begin to capture the emotion evoked by "FTFF". It is something of an umbrella term, encompassing many areas of concern with the current finder, and so the article could stand to be expanded and clarified. But there's no reason to remove it altogether --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacobolus_a4a3.html" title="User:Jacobolus">jacobolus</a> <a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacobolus_e323.html" title="User talk:Jacobolus">(t)</a> 07:22, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, it does not. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia. What you are looking for, for looking up the meanings of words and phrases, is a dictionary. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>.

<li>Yes, it does. FTFF perhaps deserves an entry at Wiktionary giving the definition alone, but it should be <b>pretty blatantly obvious</b> that there's more to FTFF than just a definition. It is thus worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. <b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacobolus_a4a3.html" title="User:Jacobolus">User:jacobolus</a> and User:Horbal.

<li>Wrong. Again: The tool for looking up the meanings of words and phrases is a dictionary. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia. Our articles are about people, places, concepts, events, and things. Encyclopaedic content about the Macintosh Finder, including a discussion of user requests for its improvement, belongs in <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macintosh_Finder_c8bb.html" title="Macintosh Finder">Macintosh Finder</a> (broken out in <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a> into a sub-article if it becomes too long).

<ul>
<li>FTFF is not just a phrase, it is also a concept. It represents the idea that a large group of users of a particular product who have a common criticism of it can coin a phrase/acronym that espouses said criticism in the hopes that their request - however rudely put - will be heard. FTFF is damn near a movement in parts of the Mac community, and is separated from being purely a simplistic word or phrase by this fact (not to mention it is a cry that has remained apparently unheard by Apple for years now, but one day will be addressed, and as such will make up an interesting aspect of the development of the Mac OS X operating system, and maybe the FTFF page will end up with a happy ending).

<li>I think you misunderstand me. There is always some overlap between defining a term and explaining it. But a dictionary is unlikely to provide the information I'm looking for when I search for "FTFF". FTFF is a term understood by most members of the Macintosh technical community. It explains a common sentiment among a large cross section of that community, and has become more than mere criticism of a product. As others have said, FTFF is something more of a subculture than anything, and is well-enough known to be notable. <i>This is distinct</i> from mere Finder criticism, and merging it with that page would prevent further explanation of the term. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacobolus_a4a3.html" title="User:Jacobolus">jacobolus</a> <a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacobolus_e323.html" title="User talk:Jacobolus">(t)</a> 20:14, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The primary source is a web forum. It just is; I'm sorry if that doesn't fit into Wikipedia's rules about sources. The secondary sources also include a lot of web forums and blogs. Most are not "wholly independent of those users" because that's the nature of blogs and forums--people expressing their opinions directly. The existence of these sources is quite easily demonstrated with a quick web search. I don't see the point in linking each one to somehow "prove" that FTFF exists as a notable term in the Mac community. In fact, I don't see this information even being challenged. Instead, I see a series of "procedural" arguments. If someone really thinks this entry should be removed because FTFF doesn't exist or is not actually a grassroots, three-year-old, organic movement, then say so plainly, and be prepared to support your contention. All existing evidence and testimony from those in the Mac community, however "inadequate" it may be according to Wikipedia's guidelines for sources, says otherwise. -- <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiracusa_883e.html" title="User:Siracusa">Siracusa</a> 15:04, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>An encycplopaedia is a catalog of articles dealing with a wide range of human knowledge. Obviously defintions belong in a dictionary, but FTFF is a statement that defines a group (or perhaps a sub-group). As any Sociology dictionary will tell you, a subgroup is often defined by shared opinions and shared slang. FTFF is a page describing the slang that defines a subgroup.

<li><b>Retain</b>: This may not appear in a generic "jargon file" or "urban dictionary" because it's so specific to a particular subculture. Merging it with another related page has the disadvantage of decreasing the visibility of the information. As an individual page and search result, it's succinct and to the point. I often google for "wikipedia mysearchterm" these days because the wikipedia page is usually the most concise and straightforward information source. If I had to wade through an already large "Finder" page scanning for occurrences of "FTFF," it'd be a less efficient and less pleasant experience. Retain and cross-link, not merge.

<li><b>Retain</b>: "FTFF" is more than an acronym or mere neologism, it encompasses and accurately identifies a particular sub-cultural movement.

<li>I also contributed to a lot of stuff before running into a contentious entry (which is when I registered and quickly soured on the experience). Regardless, the notion that edit counts somehow lend more credence to a user's opinion is flawed, at best. Arguments should be considered on their merits, not based on that user's past contributions to other threads. For all I know from seeing the edit counts you're posting on this page, the bulk of your 3000 edits are about your friend's indie rock band. Meanwhile, you're discounting the opinions of people who are essentially experts on this particular topic, simply because they weren't motivated to contribute before. If those opinions are based on a flawed understanding of Wikipedia's guidelines, that's one thing.

<li>I think the "notability" of this term is well-established. It is practically a term of art in the Mac world. It has existed for over three years. It is well-known and often used, and debated among Mac users across the entire net.

<li>Wikipedia describes "astroturfing" as "formal public relations projects which deliberately seek to engineer the impression of spontaneous, grassroots behavior." FTFF had entirely informal origins. The proliferation off FTFF was not caused by one person or an organized cabal. It was hard to even track down the person who originally coined the term. FTFF did not even appear in a "formal" article on the site whose forums spawned it until over two years after it was coined.

The Google searchs are really only used to back up a statement, not as a stand-alone basis for a vote though this is abused sometimes. No, the real problem with this article is that it doesn't follow the three pillars of wikipedia. An article must be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiable</a> through multiple, reliable, reputable, independent, third-party sources. It must not be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, which means there are no sources to back up the claims of the author(s). It must also have a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point-of-view</a> and not show bias. As a guideline for the above rules, an article must <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite it's notability</a> with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and be must be <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">encyclopaedic</a>.

The biggest violation beyond not citing reliable sources, is <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a>. <i>The first is that Wikipedia is not a dictionary, and so articles simply attempting to define a neologism are inappropriate</i> and <i>The second reason is that articles on neologisms frequently attempt to track the emergence and use of the term as observed in communities of interest or on the internet — without attributing these claims to reliable secondary sources. If the article is not verifiable (see Reliable sources for neologisms, below) then it constitutes analysis, synthesis and original research and consequently cannot be accepted by Wikipedia. This is true even though there may be many examples of the term in use.</i>. Following this, <i>Support for article contents, including the use and meaning of neologisms, must come from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Wikipedia is a tertiary source that includes material on the basis of <b>verifiability, not truth.</b> To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers <b>about the term — not books and papers that use the term</b>.</i>. So far no one has shown that there are reliable secondary sources that fit this criteria for this article. More over <i>Neologisms that are in wide use — but for which there are no treatments in secondary sources — are not yet ready for use and coverage in Wikipedia. They may be in time, but not yet. The term does not need to be in Wikipedia in order to be a "true" term, and when secondary sources become available it will be appropriate to create an article on the topic or use the term within other articles.</i> So when the time comes that this term does have citations that rely on books and papers that have articles/sections about the term, then the article can be recreate. As far as personal thoughts, <i>An editor's personal observations and research (e.g. finding blogs and books that use the term) are insufficient to support use of (or articles on) neologisms because this is analysis and synthesis of primary source material (which is explicitly prohibited by the original research policy). To paraphrase <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Wikipedia:No original research</a>: If you have research to support the inclusion of a term in the corpus of knowledge that is Wikipedia, the best approach is to arrange to have your results published in a peer-reviewed journal or reputable news outlet and then document your work in an appropriately non-partisan manner.</i> I hope this helps understand my take on this discussion. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 19:05, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>FTFF is not original research. It was in use for a significant period of time before this Wikipedia article existed. There are a large number of blogs and other sources which reference the term. You may say that these are not reliable, but this is a silly argument; different areas of human thought are discussed different fora: many scientific terms are not discussed by major international newspapers, but are nonetheless notable, because they are used in scientific publications. Recently, a <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> character was Wikipedia's featured article. This one minor character almost assuredly has no books or papers written about it, or major news outlets explaining its various statistics; Wikipedia's article itself is the most complete and comprehensive source about the subject, synthesizing information from many other sources. All of which is to say, Wiki is not Paper. If this article is useful to Wikipedians, and helps them to understand a term and a movement in the Macintosh technical community, then the article should stay. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacobolus_a4a3.html" title="User:Jacobolus">jacobolus</a> <a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacobolus_e323.html" title="User talk:Jacobolus">(t)</a> 20:14, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>While the <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a> article is a large synthesis of information, it does not put forward any position about the Pokemon, and all of the facts presented are thoroughly documented with citations from the anime, major magazines, gaming guides, well-known gaming websites, books, comics, etc. The two are not comparable. That page features over 33 separate, verifiable references. What information in the FTFF article is verifiable fact? The part with the subjective list of gripes or the part that speculates about Apple's <i>future</i> plans for the Finder? <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebuskjt_3ae6.html" title="User:Debuskjt">Debuskjt</a> 22:35, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You completely miss my point, which is not that Bulbosaur doesn't deserve an article in Wikipedia. Rather, its sources are things like the "pokemon yellow walkthrough", some random fansite which explains to newbies how to play the pokemon games. This type of Pokemon information cannot be learned from <i>Newsweek</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, or <i>Science</i>, because those publications are not in the business of providing guides to pokemon video game players. Instead, the information comes from the source, the pokemon walkthroughs. That does not render such information useless, however, and the case here is similar: information about FTFF comes from blogs and technical websites, rather than from the so-called "reliable" sources <a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Brian</a> referred to in the parent post. This is perfectly legitimate as far as I'm concerned, even though Ars Technica isn't peer-reviewed. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacobolus_a4a3.html" title="User:Jacobolus">jacobolus</a> <a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacobolus_e323.html" title="User talk:Jacobolus">(t)</a> 22:48, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK Let's set the record straight. A decision was made to find the most rediculous, far-fetched article that still had some 'notability' tie in and use it as a flag to wave and say "Look, this one doesn't meet all the requirements as you have put them so this article shouldn't need it either". The problem with that arguement is...you are right! That article most likely violates the rules and should ALSO be in AfD! The thing that quite a few of theses AfD arguements boil down to is editors that understand the process and that not everything follows the rules, and when those articles are caught, they are cleaned up or deleted...and editors that do not understand the process and flag wave other articles that are in volation of the rules. (This is not a comment about Jacobolus, but a comment on the history of AfD's) We all know there are articles out there that deserve AfDs...all an editor has to do is look at the AfD logs day by day to see this. We know that Wikipedia is a work in process. That doesn't make it ok for articles to disregard the rules. This arguement is an end run on the rules, trying to explain why the article shouldn't have to follow them, which isn't going to win the discussion. Blogs and technical websites are not acceptable per Wikipedia's process. If anyone believes this to be wrong, then by all means fight the rules in place, but All articles must follow <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and no wikipedia rules or consensus by editors can change this. Instead of providing weak arguements about other articles' failings (which will most likely be AfD'd now that you mentioned them) provide arguements on how this article meets all the rules I have stated in that long post. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 05:41, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree with your arguments except for the Bulbasaur part. Please read Debuskgt comment as to why Bulbasaur cannot be compared to this article. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 05:52, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>jacobolus, you are knowingly misconstruing another article to bait Brian into unwittingly making an argument about Wiki policy that isn't true. Wiki policy specifically excludes blogs (except for special circumstances) as verifiable sources. Deal with it. Also, arguing that another, unrelated article, has problematic sources doesn't fix the inherent issues in the FTFF article. For instance, Wiki policy on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Criticism#Separate_articles_devoted_to_criticism.2C_trivia_or_reception_.28history.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Criticism#Separate_articles_devoted_to_criticism.2C_trivia_or_reception_.28history.29" rel="nofollow">content forking</a>. And whether you want to hear it or not, FTFF isn't a social movement of the masses. It is a blanket neologism to criticize the Finder. The articles inherent problems are peripheral to the fact that the very idea of the stand alone article breaking with Wiki policy on several points, including criticism, neologisms, and NPOV. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebuskjt_3ae6.html" title="User:Debuskjt">Debuskjt</a> 16:58, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> The fact that he worked on ROTT does not make him notable. There were probably hundreds of other individuals who played some role in the development of Apogee's games. The article seems to me to be more of a resume than a biographical article on a notable individual.

<li><b>No Delete</b> - While the live airing has finished for the West Coast, it can be confirmed that Katie Blair is the new winner. However, I believe that it is still too early to consider this article for deletion. A Miss Teen USA term is for one year. She has literally just become Miss Teen USA, there has been insufficient time to gauge her importance and impact to both American and other international societies. I think that we should keep this article until her Miss Teen USA term comes to an end where we can at least revisit her tenure. In addition, it is important to point out that most of her predecessors have Wikipedia articles as well. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuckyluke_155b.html" title="User:Luckyluke">Luke</a> 03:03, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

How about also being in a band with Joe Stump, a notable electric guitarist.

<li>Seems like the HellHole, oops <a href="../../../h/o/l/HolyHell_64e5.html" title="HolyHell">HolyHell</a> entry redirects to Tom Hess. Not sure why that's the case. He doesn't even seem to be the primary member. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 19:23, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For what it's worth, there'd been a seperate article on HolyHell, but Zoe speedy deleted it for not being significant enough. Since this guy has two major bands, Hess and HolyHell, it seems sensible to me for him to have an article. If seperate articles on the specific bands are also warranted, so be it. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:46, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm far from convinced of TH's notability (2 self-released CD's?), and I'm also far from convinced that opening slots count towards notability, but if the tour is the deciding factor, the article should probably be about HolyHell and Tom Hess should redirect to it. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 20:02, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Doesn't being part of a notable band warrant it's own article about that person? I mean, a guy like Jeff Campitelli has done nothing notable except being part of Joe Satriani's band. This warrants him his own article. shouldn't this 'spin off' effect apply as well to Tom Hess, if his band Holyhell is deemed notable? <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinmeister_cfe3.html" title="User:Justinmeister">Justinmeister</a> 21:15, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Afaict, they aren't. And also afaict the "better covered in the main article" standard applies to band members who have no notability of their own. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 21:54, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How do you pick and choose which band members are anymore notable than the others than? Each member is an integral part. Especially in bands without a member that stands out from the rest (as opposed to Van Halen, Cream, Led Zeppelin etc.) By that logic, most articles about bass players and drummers should be "better covered in the main article". Is it fair to discriminate against bands that aren't well known by only allowing one article for the whole band as opposed to articles for all the members. Why does <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Bello_b003.html" title="Frank Bello">Frank Bello's</a> article exist? <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinmeister_cfe3.html" title="User:Justinmeister">Justinmeister</a> 07:22, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree strongly - considering she's featured in some of his (Eminem's) songs and videos, surely it's not a bad thing that an article on her exists. I thought that the idea of Wikipedia was to provide people with as much information on everything as possible - there's hardly anything wrong with this article. Also, people such as Frances Bean Cobain have very decent articles as well.</li>

<p>I think that this article should be kept - as I say, there's nothing much wrong with it, and it's definitely NOT valid for deletion.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>; I agree a celebrity child does not deserve their own article for being a celebrity's child.

<li>Frances Cobain, from what I read of that article, is at least living "under" her father's name in that she is actively engaging in interviews, etc. with magazines, if that makes any sense. She, herself, is deciding to use her father's notability and using it to enter the public eye. Haile, as far as I can tell, is not in the public eye except when mentioned in her father's songs, as a result of her father writing the lyrics, because he loves her and is a caring father. Haile isn't going out and giving interviews on Eminem or how his rapper lifestyle has affected her. She is only 10! Giving every celebrity's child an article based soley on their parents fame would begin a sad precedence. But I've only been really active on Wikipedia these past 3 days. Maybe the precedent already exists...<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 05:49, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're right. I was expecting those hands to be the top of a statue of a person similar to Lady Liberty. In fact, they are just a scaled mock up of the full statue.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I did more research on this statue. The website is very impressive, as is their movie that you can watch. However, they are still calling for "$300 million in donations" on thier website; their website has not been updated in over a year now; and frankly, I couldn't find any credible sources that say that this statue is becoming a reality. The article has two external links, one of which is to the foundation site, and the other is to an interview conducted almost a year ago. The article has no references to any of its claims to being notable. I searched for some, but came up empty. I did not see any information confirming that there are any cities bidding for it, much less four. I did read one of the articles which stated that there were four cities "being considered". This is much different than cities actually bidding/competing for the statue. The latest article, published a year ago, states that a site would be secured in the next 12 months. I don't see any updates. <span style="font-family: serif"><i><a href="../../../f/o/p/User%7EFopkins_79f0.html" title="User:Fopkins">Fopkins</a> | <a href="../../../f/o/p/User_talk%7EFopkins_e814.html" title="User talk:Fopkins">Talk</a></i></span> 18:05, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but change the article's wording to indicate that it might not materialise.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Just as the next Olympics (2008? I can't keep track of years) are notable because there is press coverage on the plans, this statue is notable. I agree with Garrepi, however, that the wording should be changed to reflect the possibility that the statue will not be built. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 18:56, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> - seems to be enough verifiable information out there to establish this as a real plan and not a crystal ball prediction. There also seems to be some historic context behind it as well, but would prefer to see more flesh to the article if anyone knowledgable enough on the subject can help it. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 19:02, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> for failing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> - article states four cities are "competing" to be the site of the statue; point of fact, the statute's own <a href="http://www.sorfoundation.org/faqs_index.php?section=faqs" class="external text" title="http://www.sorfoundation.org/faqs_index.php?section=faqs" rel="nofollow">website</a> says four sites are being <i>reviewed</i> for the statue, and that after the statue is built on private property, it will be offered to the nearest municipality. WP is also not a newspaper, and this article appears to pander to the fundraising efforts for the statue. And the bottomline remains, the statue isn't built yet, and unlike the Olympics which seems to have a rich and confirmed history of occurring every so often, the statue is still just a vision in my crystal ball.

<dd>If one were to stick to the wording of the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">Criteria for Speedy Deletion</a>, with regard to A7's statement of, "real person, group of people, band, or club", it's not speediable as a company is not exactly a "group of people" or a "club". There's a lot of leeway in tagging things speedy under the various criteria. For instance, G4 specifically states "This clause does not apply if the only prior deletions were speedy or proposed deletions...", but I see it used for to tag things that were speedy deleted, but, I don't really care and leave it there. Some other people do care and the tag vanishes.

<li>Well all of the first aid articles are like that for some reason. We just started a wikiproject to fix it.

<dd>If you start advancing thru those 55,200 results, you'll see that the listing hits a dead end <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Invisible+pink+unicorn%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=720&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Invisible+pink+unicorn%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=720&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">here</a>, after 715 <i>unique</i> hits (It was 682 earlier). In other words, the other 54,000+ hits are <i>from these same sources</i>. Therefore, the IPU has only 715 different sources mentioning it on Google (and it's far less than 715 when you subtract the many mirrors of the Wikipedia article itself). <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 05:31, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You misunderstand how Google unique hits works. First google finds roughly how many pages contain the term (55,200). Then it takes the first thousand and runs the uniqueness filter <i>on those thousand pages</i>. So of the first one thousand hits 715 are unique. The other 54,200 pages contain <i>more</i> unique pages. For a very rough guesstimate of all unique pages calculate thusly: 55200 * (715 / 1000) =~ 39,000 unique pages (i.e. assume that 71,5% of those 55,200 are unique). <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 08:48, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Try to find any other Assyrian musician with that amount of Google hits. Just try and see what happens. See if anybody else comes close to 3,200. You ask "is he the most famous" - well buddy you would not know if you weren't part of our community. This is what ticks me about wiki. People take actions on things they dont know about. Instead of going for a delete, dont you think it would make sence asking one of us if indeed he is one of the famous?

<dd>Please put just a <i>little</i> more effort into your nominations. Actually writing a <i>reason for deletion</i>, rather than just spitting forth the epithet "vanity" (autobiographical articles, while unfortunate, need not be deleted), would be a definite plus here.

<dd>It is Romanian, but rather odd Romanian: there don't seem to be any diacritics at all. I don't know enough to be sure where they should go, but I'm certain that in that amount of text there should be some î, ş or ţ. In other words, it's Romanian in ASCII - which suggests to me that it's just been dumped in WP from somewhere else. Also, though it does contain a history of the station, it looks rather like an ad. It's even got the full daily schedules. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColinFine_20a8.html" title="User:ColinFine">ColinFine</a> 23:30, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It doesn't exist on ro.wikipedia.org (as far as I could find), but as Colinfine says above, it's an odd form of Romanian, so I'm presuming that it's incorrect and so wouldn't be accepted at ro.wikipedia.org for being badly written (if it even makes sense in Romanian). If the article is valid Romanian, then it <i>should</i> be transwikied, but I'm not convinced. <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23"><font color="blue">M</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_Esperanza_4562.html" title="User:Martinp23/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23"><font color="blue">rtinp23</font></a></strong> 11:18, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Is this a notable epic book series (really one book)? Reads like an ad for a self-published book ("Lulu" press which prints books on demand).

<li>If you google "tirlannon" alone, you'll yield more results. I can see debating neutrality on this entry. It is a problem in which editing can rectify, but deletion is not warranted. The series exists. The author would prefer to not seek traditional publication at this time for a multitude of reasons, none of which include rejection by publishers. <a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESage_Tuvitor_fa6f.html" title="User:Sage Tuvitor">Sage Tuvitor</a> 10:24, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Limiting articles and not including independently ("indie") published work doesn't make much sense. I fail to see how this is any different than allowing a message board entry on Wikipedia or anything else that only returns such results from Google. The novel has a fairly substantial fanbase along the West Coast of North America as well as the south-eastern edge of North America. With appearances at conventions such as Dragon*Con and the like from the author himself, I fail to see why this article should be deleted. If a synopsis of the story would help the article, that can easily be expanded upon. There's also been a D&amp;D game story around the "series" for nearly a decade. I don't see how it isn't noteable - it may not be as widely known as Tolkien's work or even Kevin J. Anderson's, but it is notable. kimopupule 6:25am, 16 August 2006 (EST)</li>

<li>I fail to see how the deletion of this article contributes to the overall goal of Wikipedia. The Legacy of Tirlannon not just one book, but rather an entire project based on a constructed universe written by the author, Patrick Reid. Additionally, this project has already seen contributions from several artists, performers and musicians. True, to date there is just one published book, but that is far from the end of the story. Fact is, the fictional realm Tirlannon is filled with as much history and detail as Narnia or Middle-Earth. The construction, writing, publication and collaboration that have taken place since the project began nearly a decade ago is most certainly of worth to others who may be interested in undertaking similar projects of their own. That goes for the distribution process as well (which seems to be the main objection to the article). Instead of being critical of an article because the book series is being independently published, why not stop and ask why such a decision is being made? The promotional process of Tirlannon, again, may be of interest to authors who do not want to sacrifice full rights to their work, purely to be published as soon as possible.
<p>Bottom line: There is much to learn about the process that brought Tirlannon to the public, the process in which Tirlannon is being marketed independently -- as well as the fictional realm itself. Deleting this article would be fundamentally against the entire purpose of Wikipedia.

<li><b>No Delete</b> I am an author of sorts myself, and I find the journey of this author and his creative process to be invaluable to someone who is walking in his footsteps. Just because there is no big corporate backing, doesn't make the story or novel any less a work of art worthy of discussion. In fact I would challenge most "published" authors to come up with half the details Patrick Read has developed in this project. With a west coast book tour, and an upcoming east coast tour, I believe this is definitely worthwhile reading.

<dd>I'm sorry, but being a delegate to a leadership convention makes someone politically active, not a "political figure." Nor do any of the other activities of these two individuals. They are minor players who do not merit their own entry. As for the Paulsen article, you may have a point. She has also been a candidate for the House of Commons, many of whom garnered their own entries on that basis alone. PoliSciMaster 05:39, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete both</b> Calling them "political figures" is a bit of a stretch. Just because they are party members and active within the Liberal party does not make them notable.

<p>Was listed for speedy deletion as a repost because of an earlier speedy deletion. I would prefer a dicussion over this article, so I bring it here.

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually I believe the profession of his parents contributes greatly to the reason he was homeschooled and the combination of the two is the direct reason why he was featured in the ESPN documentary.

<p>This is a page I have looked at a couple of times, and I have now decided to nominate it for deletion. It is completely unsourced, which I know is not grounds for deletion at all, but on a google search, I could not turn up a single referance that Wikipedia would allow as a source actually trying to define the genre. I found a few references to an album called 'Dark Pop' by The Colour Guard, and a couple of rather obscure artists claiming to be Dark Pop, but often this seemed, rather than being a different genre, to be pop, that happened to be quite dark. There were also a few very small online stores that grouped artists together as 'Dark pop', and none of the artists mentioned on these were on the list in this article. Furthermore, when I had a look through this list, <i>none</i> of the bands that were claimed to be 'Dark Pop' mentioned the fact that they were on their own respective articles, and some of them had very long lists of genres that the artist could fall under. I feel that 'Dark Pop' is either Pop that happens to be rather dark, or one specific album of the same title, and not a stand alone genre. I can see where the authors are coming from with their article, and this also happens to be not so far from music that I personally like, but, as it stands, I believe this to be original research. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 12:40, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

And of course, Romania is a republic, so being in line for the throne isn't notable as it is unlikely to be inherited by anyone. And being 88th in line to the UK throne is highly non-notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> - well, this is a pretty good point. But I did find there's still a "monarchy in exile" for Romania, so we ought to afford some standard of notability to the position. Still, if the succession is not for ladies, then there's not much here. As far as I can tell, 88th is too far down the British line to get auto-notability - which cuts off at 39th. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:46, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - okay, so if we can find a more authoritative source that women can inherit the throne, I'm pretty sure she's a keep - if not, I'm pretty sure she's a delete (or merge somewhere?).

<li><b>Comment</b> - although the Romanian throne was, <i>per</i> the Romanian monarchical constitution, only open to males, and thus King Michael's heir under the official law would be the Prince of Hohenzollern or some close relative of the Prince of Hohenzollern, King Michael has declared his eldest daughter Margarita (the subject of this article's aunt) to be his heir. I'm not sure if he's officially altered the order of succession further than this, and of course it's dubious whether he has the right to declare his daughter to be the heir. It seems likely, though, that at least some (if not most) Romanian monarchists will recognize Margarita as head of house when the King dies. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 15:24, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks - I was mistakenly reading your 100 as as a lower bound rather than an approximate limit and was trying to find some upper bound to at least give a range for discussion.

<li><b>Comment</b>
<ol>
<li>The British Constitution does not distinguish between persons who are the first or 900th in the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_of_succession_to_the_British_Throne_8a29.html" title="Line of succession to the British Throne">Line of succession to the British Throne</a>: if called to the throne, whether by the death of one or 899 persons, whether titled or not, rich or poor, the heir automatically and inescapably becomes Monarch. That is one of several laws that apply to and render notable those in the British succession: one may not unilaterally decline the honor without passage of a specific Parliamentary law excusing one from the duty of reigning. Other laws applicable to some in the line of succession restrict who, how old, and where these persons are allowed to marry (and ignoring the law doesn't just void one's place in line -- rather, it voids the marriage!) When <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caroline%2C_Princess_of_Hanover_5bc5.html" title="Caroline, Princess of Hanover">Princess Caroline of Monaco</a> married <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernst_August_V%2C_Prince_of_Hanover_9069.html" title="Ernst August V, Prince of Hanover">Prince Ernst August of Hanover</a> in 1999, both of them required the permission of two of the modern world's historical "Great Powers": France had to signal its official acquiescence to her marriage, and <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom</a> had to issue an <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order-in-Council_6258.html" title="Order-in-Council">Order-in-Council</a> authorizing him to marry her. She was second in the line of succession to Monaco's throne, and he was about 360th in line to the UK's. Yet the moment they were married the groom permanently dropped out of the UK's succession order because his bride is a Roman Catholic. But their six year-old daughter is in line to succeed to the crowns of both Monaco and the UK, and is subject to both realms' laws governing royalty -- would that make <i>her</i> notable? Only those of the blood royal are subject to these kinds of obscure but fascinating and very real restrictions -- and how near or distant they are to the throne is immaterial.</li>
<li>No, Angelica isn't anywhere in the line of succession to the defunct Romanian crown, but is that the criterion? Suppose Prince William of Wales marries a Roman Catholic this year and has a daughter by this time next year: she will not be in the UK's line of succession. But will she be notable? Absolutely. Not because of her succession rights, but because of her kinship to the British royal family.</li>
<li>Notability is not the same as distinction: One distinguishes oneself, but notability is something that is attributed to one <i>by others</i>. Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie of York get somewhat more media coverage than Peter and Zara Phillips, but the difference is not huge: Coverage of their lives does not derive from royal titles or succession rights, but from the fact that all four are grandchildren of Queen Elizabeth II -- two in the male, and two in the female line. Ergo, virtually any relative of a reigning monarch is inherently notable, because many people are curious about the lives and lifestyles of that rare and endangered species: royalty.</li>
<li>How notable deposed monarchs' families are will depend greatly on the time elapsed since deposition. King Michael of Romania's grandchildren draw little media coverage because he lost his throne half a century ago. Much more interest is shown in the grandchildren of King Constantine II of the Hellenes because he only lost his throne in the 1970s. More interest is also shown in the grandchildren of ex-King Simeon of Bulgaria because, although he lost his throne before King Michael, he returned to Bulgaria in the 21st century as President. That brings up another relevant criterion: historically, exiled monarchs or their issue often return to national sovereignty or influence and, history noting that pattern, an encyclopedia should not be as short-memoried as a newspaper. I'd suggest that all children, all dynastic descendants and/or the heir of living ex-monarchs be deemed notable. Angelica Kreuger, as it happens, doesn't qualify because she is not a <i>dynastic</i> grand-daughter of a living ex-king -- daughters of daughters did not belong to Romania's royal family when enthroned, so they need not be considered royal on WP. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 04:17, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>She is most certainly <i>not</i> fifth in line to the Romanian throne under the old monarchical constitution. She is not in line for the throne at all. Her grandfather may have "amended" the laws of succession to declare her in line for the pretendership, but I'm not sure - somebody would have to look this up. Of course the old king has no authority to do under the old monarchical constitution, but the old monarchical constitution is a dead letter anyway - and if, by some fluke, the Romanian monarchy got restored (it is actually quite possible it might have been restored shortly after the fall of communism, if things had gone differently), it is unlikely that the old constitution would be restored, so I'm not sure how to consider this. Her mother is, however, a princess. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 20:05, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> verifiable grandchildren of monarchs (this seems reasonable, right?).

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm pretty sure most of us would vote keep if she was fifth in line to the Romanian throne, but merely "child of famous person X" isn't enough, she needs some criterion of her own (like holding a position in line to the throne), since she doesn't, she doesn't make the cut.

<li><b>Comment</b> Ardric47- I don't think being the verifiable grandchild of a deposed king is enough to confer notability. In fact, I would only regard the child of a deposed monarch as notable if they were a prince/princess at the time of their parents' deposition/abdication. I would change my vote only if it was shown there was a realistic chance of this royal house regaining the throne. <i>Then</i> someone in succession would be notable, as someone with a real chance of becoming a future monarch <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker"><span style="background-color:lightblue;color:black">Lurker</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker"><font color="red"><i>oi!</i></font></a></sup> 13:57, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If we adopt the exceedingly narrow proposals for notability, Lindley would qualify at birth by being 5th in line - can people genuinely become "unencyclopaedic" - this seems like a fairly strange claim, if we're trying to being an encyclopaedia for the ages, rather than just a news source. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:37, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Linley is frequently discussed in the British press, as far as I can gather. A google news search turns up <a href="http://property.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14052-2287285,00.html" class="external text" title="http://property.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14052-2287285,00.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> from <i>The Times</i>, from a couple of weeks ago. One would imagine that a Lexis-Nexis search would probably turn up considerable press coverage of Linley. I think if you look into it you'll discover that even more distant people get a fair amount of coverage in the British press - there was press coverage when <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Helen_Taylor_2662.html" title="Lady Helen Taylor">Lady Helen Taylor</a>, the Duke of Kent's daughter, had her children, for instance, and coverage (and criticism, of course) of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marina_Ogilvy_0e03.html" title="Marina Ogilvy">Marina Ogilvy</a>, Princess Alexandra's daughter, when she was on public assistance.

<li>I dunno, I'm not convinced about the source thing.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Strong disagree</b> with the proposed merging. The compilation is a Beatles/McCartney collector item, more relevant to Beatles and McCartney collectors than it is to Fidelity Investments. The page had previously been linked by <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_discography_cc26.html" title="Paul McCartney discography">Paul McCartney discography</a>, but not by Fidelity Investments. People following the compilations link from the discography article will be understandibly jarred and confused by the redirect to Fidelity, as the entry in the discography list makes no mention of Fidelity's involvement. I believe the article should be kept as is. It includes a track listing which will be of interest to collectors, yet a merge with Fidelity that includes the track listing will be beyond the scope of that particular article. I also believe the innovative marketing section added during this discussion's temporary closure ought to be retained at the Fidelity article. Thanks to CrazyRussian for reopening this discussion for me (I was in the middle of typing when it was closed). I hope this makes sense to you all. <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 19:16, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The discography could make mention of Fidelity in the entry for this, that seems an easily overcomeable objection, but it is not the crux if I understand you. The merge has been done, right? I think we need a case made that this is notable in its own right for folk to change their minds about this merge being a good idea. DO we have any significant media references to this? That usually seals the deal. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 19:57, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The ad campaign is documented in <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2126568/" class="external text" title="http://www.slate.com/id/2126568/" rel="nofollow">a Slate column</a>, though it makes no mention of the associated compilation CD. The CD itself is briefly discussed by the campaign's main creator in <a href="http://promomagazine.com/agencies/marketing_talking_shop/" class="external text" title="http://promomagazine.com/agencies/marketing_talking_shop/" rel="nofollow">an advertising industry publication</a>. I think people have resisted the notion that this compilation deserves its own article within the McCartney discography because it is little more than a lame advertising gimmick (hence the merge with Fidelity). And they're right, of course--the CD is part of a sad, synergistic sales strategy. But it is also now a highly sought-after fan collectible, mentioned on Beatles/McCartney fansites <a href="http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/news/newslinks.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/news/newslinks.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> <a href="http://www.cyber-beatles.com/2005_Year_End_Review.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cyber-beatles.com/2005_Year_End_Review.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> and sold online at a greatly inflated price.<a href="http://eil.com/artist/bestsellers.asp?artist=APE:BTL:DNY:GOM:LMC:MCC:O:PCY:SZY:TFR:WIN&amp;artistcode=MCC&amp;artistname=Paul-McCartney" class="external autonumber" title="http://eil.com/artist/bestsellers.asp?artist=APE:BTL:DNY:GOM:LMC:MCC:O:PCY:SZY:TFR:WIN&amp;artistcode=MCC&amp;artistname=Paul-McCartney" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> It thus has significance beyond its use as a marketing freebie. The people who will be most interested in this information won't be the ones reading Fidelity's article--they'll be the fans and collectors interested in McCartney and the albums and compilations which he's had a hand in producing. What began as a marketing trinket has become a fan collectible, and is more notable as such. That's why I think the disk deserves its own article in the McCartney discography, complete with track listing. <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 21:07, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> At the very least, the second article you cite above was created by an active editor with many edits to unrelated pages. I see no evidence that he's a principal in the company in question. The first one may very well be a vanity article, but it should be noted that the existence of one article doesn't justify the existence of any others.

<li><b>Comment</b> Wow... I really thought that WA007 was noteworthy and tried to bring up as much web material as I could find. As I am not an expert on the company. Interestingly enough within the web community of designers WA007 is well known. The real shame as I mentioned before is that there are other companies that do not have citations are allowed to be kept in Wiki. The reference stated above about 2advanced, after this conversation was slated for deletion as well. And now magically its not. I'm a fan of WA007's work and their influence on popular web design can be seen everywhere. And for the person that states they cannot see the flash sites cited as references, download the plugin. It's easier than bashing everything that i write on this article. These are my last two cents. If WA007 is not wiki material then cut to the chase and delete it.. but I request of you all to reference the term "web design agency" and mark all the infidels for deletion. Because if a company WA007 has good work then others with less need to be stricken.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - "Traditional veil of secrecy". my foot. Go to Amazon, or EBay, or do a search online. I think you'll find plenty of rituals. I certainly did - they're not really very secret at all. That's a misconception, and the simple fact is, if Freemason editors weren't here to make sure what was written in the Freemasonry-related articles was accurate, every article would be full of conspiracy theories and uniinformed statements, such as "Anti-Masonic ritual", which doesn't exist, and actually popped up in <a href="../../../j/a/h/Jahbulon.html" title="Jahbulon">Jahbulon</a> just recently, or "veil of secrecy" for that matter. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 10:16, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>JASpencer's comment goes right to the heart of the matter... Almost all of the "controversy" surounding Jahbulon can and has been removed because it comes from unreliable sources and fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Without that "controversy" there is nothing notable or encyclopedic about the existance of the word. This is why the time has come to re-nominate it for deletion. If those who wish to keep the article could locate reliable sources to back their claims, I would agree that it would be worth keeping. Since they can not, it should be deleted. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 17:56, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I apologise for being unclear but this is not what I said. Small but substantial changes have been made to the article giving it some context as to why it is notable. We are also in the middle of a discussion as to whether Church websites are reliable sources for hosting other church's documents and wheter <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is being used to remove valid information.

<dd>Basicly what you are saying is that we are destined to keep going in circles... someone will insert the "controversy" material with citing yet another unreliable source, someone else will delete that material per WP:RS, the article will then be renomimated for yet another AFD, and then someone will insert the "controversy" using a different unreliable source and say that the article isn't stable so should be given a third, fourth, fifth chance ... etc. etc. etc. I really don't think we should be waisting everyones time like that. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 20:22, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well no. The question is not whether the Jahbulon claims are <b>true</b> but whether they are notable.</dd>
<dd>There is reliable material saying that people believe that Jahbulon is a Masonic deity - Knight and deHoyos for two. They may be wrong (and I have been outed already on this page in my scepticism) but the concept is still there. This was made <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jahbulon_fcd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jahbulon">first time around</a>:

</dd>
<dd>Knight and Hannah have both had an effect - including in church reports. Many Christians believe that Jahbulon is either the name of a Masonic deity or else a very dubious theological construct (or in the Baptist's case both). For this reason it is notable. And for once I'd love to agree with you.</dd>

<dd>Note that when I posted this AFD, there <i>was</i> no accusation mentioned in the article. The material about accusations had been deleted due to the lack of reliable sources to back the accusation up. In essence all the article consisted of was "Royal Arch Masons may use a word called Jahbulon and Rev. Tydeman thinks it means such and such". The article had been that way for over a month with no objections or edits. In fact, the only other editor who participated in discussion on the deletions agreed that, without the accusation, the article should be deleted. Without the accusation the word Jahbulon is not notable the article is not encyclopedic. I do find it strange that no-one seemed to care about this article until an AFD nomination was made.</dd>
<dd>That said, I agree that <i>with</i> the accusation material included the topic is notable... if only for the existance of the controversy surrounding it. IF someone can find reliable sources to back the accusation materials, I am willing to drop the AFD nomination. And I am willing to postpone it to give you time to try and find those reliable sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> I wrote the article and I will do the best job I can to find the problems with the page and edit them so that it can stay on the site. I feel that the Fox deal to buy New World and Burnham stations is of such magnitude that it deserves its own page. Without the NFL deal, there are no station upgrades, and without the upgrades, Fox is not in the same league as ABC, CBS and NBC. Frankly, I am very surprised that someone wants to delete the page.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As for the WP:NOR, OK, TV Newser has a point. However, I have decided to unify what was already here onto a single page, so people don't have to click around from place to place. As for WP:NPOV, I simply thought it was a consensus that the deals lifted Fox to its current level. Many things back up this opinion, including the ratings of <i>American Idol</i>. Even 10 years ago, to have the top-rated show on American TV on a network other than ABC, CBS or NBC would have been inconceivable.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Lack of sources? I tried to make up for them by including some "see also" links. Just about the only way to access newspaper articles from 1994 is to use a paid archive service.

I'm not familiar with the subject and don't feel qualified to make a decision on it's status, thought you might have some insight into the title though.

<dd>I'm changing my vote to <b>keep.</b> This article is decidedly not-notable in its present state. It needs to be expanded upon so as not to be anything other than an advertisement for the Baal Teshuva wing's website. At present, it should be deleted. However, Wikipedia policy (though I imagine it didn't have Yeshivot in contemplation when it wrote its rules) supports keeping articles about post-high school educational institutions. In a way, a Yeshiva is just that. I state my objection to the blanket rule that Wikipedia has adopted.

<li><b>Comment</b>, make what judgments you will on my redirect, but the point still stands: This article is not verified and thus should be deleted. Besides, if you read the closer's notes, it was recognized that there was little to no consensus to keep this article in its current form.

<li><b>Redirect.</b> Not sure why it's been accused of being unverifiable (I would assume any Biblical scholar could provide resources to verify it), but it nevertheless looks like a duplication of what already appears in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_the_Bible_908a.html" title="Books of the Bible">Books of the Bible</a>. --<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_66a1.html" title="User:Ginkgo100">Ginkgo100</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/i/n/User_talk%7EGinkgo100_02a2.html" title="User talk:Ginkgo100"><i>talk</i></a> · <a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinkgo100_Esperanza_6689.html" title="User:Ginkgo100/Esperanza"><font color="green"><i>e@</i></font></a></sup> 20:48, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I didn't call it unverifiable... I called it unverified. I guess that begs the question, how long do we leave an article sitting unverified with the idea that some person may someday come along and verify it? Personally, I have a very low threshold for allowing unverified material to sit in articles unchecked; that is they type of thing that tends to get Wikipedia into trouble. Some of it could be verified by copying over the references from <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_the_Bible_908a.html" title="Books of the Bible">Books of the Bible</a>, but I don't see the purpose in this as it is redundant. The concept that Pseudepigrapha is Judeo-Christian scripture would be much harder to verify as, with a couple of exceptions, the Pseudepigrapha listed here is not (to the best of my knowledge) considered scriptural by any currently exisiting church. The Apocrypha is already at <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_the_Bible_908a.html" title="Books of the Bible">Books of the Bible</a>. That just leaves the Restorationist column, which is a misnomer because Restorationist is a much wider canopy than the Mormon books listed here. Not all groups that would be classified as Restortationist accept the books listed here, so it is a not factually correct. The "Traditional Author" section could be merged to <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_the_Bible_908a.html" title="Books of the Bible">Books of the Bible</a> if (and only if) it gets sourced.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 12:55, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, right finally a list that doesn't look like original research and that actually does provide some information besides being a list of things.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- this is useful information. It shouldn't take too long to come up with references, and it would be prefereable for someone to add references rather than deleting it.

<li><strike><b>Delete</b></strike> similiar to the above list of genius, how can you define what a child prodigy is? I may think a child prodigy is some 13 year old who is in medical school.

Just because the article lists people that are famous and notable does not justify the overall existance of such a list. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 22:57, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The "definition" in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_prodigy.html" title="Child prodigy">Child prodigy</a> is not a definition, it's a heuristic, which makes this whole thing list POV.

<li>Are there any legitimate arguments for maintaining this list? It seems like the reasons against it are stronger than the arguments for it. First, the entire list is of itself completely subjective with it being impossible to create an objective definition of what a child prodigy is. Second, even if such an unsubjective definition existed (which it cannot possibly), the sources cited do not even seem to mention that these individuals are of themselves child prodigies. Just because each person has a wikipedia article, and just because each person happens to have been notable enough to be cited on a website, does not justify the complete and total lack of NPOV that this article has. I restate my stance for this article to be <strike><b>deleted</b></strike>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 02:54, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Could easily become a POV mess. In fact, given the difficulty of defining what a child prodigy is, and in some cases only limited information about their childhood activities, I would say it is already too POV. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 04:54, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I created this because there was already a list of child prodigies in the article <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_prodigy.html" title="Child prodigy">Child prodigy</a>. I felt it was distracting from the article and others agreed. Since then the list has been heavily worked on to conform to standards in that article on the subject and, despite occasional backsliding, it remains strictly defined and well-sourced. There is even a bibliography on the topic listed at the end of the article so those interested in the topic can study it in more depth. It provides information a category can't and that a category won't because the category for this topic was deleted.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<dd>Re-reading and re-thinking about this and the history of the article, I change my opinion to <b>weak keep.</b> The wording of the definitions for each category, although fairly subjective, still I think are narrow enough to prove useful in determining who could be a child prodigy. Ensuring that individuals listed are truly child prodigies is going to be a long-term project. Once the stringency of who is considered a prodigy decreases, there goes the article. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 06:16, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I originally tagged this with a db-band, but <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> came along and de-speedied it with the note “Removed CSD: probably notable” and then moved it from “True MetaPhase” to this page. Sadly, the user didn’t leave any indication of notability in his wake. That’s okay, I’m off deadline, so can do some research.</p>
<p>Google turns up quite a few references to MetaPhase, but mostly to the biological term. ‘“MetaPhase” drum’n’bass’ turned up about 2000 hits, but a cursory wander through the first few pages suggested that the artist is referred to on a number of forums now and again as well as on his own pages without anything resembling a notable, reliable source. Thus, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> appears to be missing. And then there’s <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, under which the artist completely fails. No charted hits, no indication of international tours, no records certified gold. Several self-released albums for download, and one through FoulPlay Records, which got about ten Google hits and no outside reference at all. I would suggest this indicates a lack of notability for the label.</p>
<p>All in all, I can not find any indication of notability for this artist. <b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b> I believe she should have some fame outside of who she is related to. As far as the reference to June Carter Cash singing the song about her that could be put as a footnote in a June Carter Cash discography article. If anything it appears on google that the song may be more well known than the actual individual. Results for <a href="../../../t/i/f/Tiffany_Anastasia_Lowe_7d5c.html" title="Tiffany Anastasia Lowe">TAL</a> herself are links to her father-in-law's webpage and her myspace page. Finally if she is a notable singer, etc. where is her discography? If this article isn't deleted it severely needs to be rewritten to the point that half of the article doesn't contain her lineage.

<li>If this article is merged it might be most appropriate in the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlene_Carter_5d3b.html" title="Carlene Carter">Carlene Carter</a> article since she is biologically the closest person to <a href="../../../t/i/f/Tiffany_Anastasia_Lowe_7d5c.html" title="Tiffany Anastasia Lowe">TAL</a>. The way it reads is that <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Lowe_19aa.html" title="Nick Lowe">Nick Lowe</a> adopted TAL and is not her biological father. I think it would be a great idea and I would be willing to research the family life of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlene_Carter_5d3b.html" title="Carlene Carter">Carlene Carter</a>. According to the bio that is on the aformeantioned page she had two children of which TAL must be one of them.

<li><b>Delete</b> Appears in its current form to be just a generalisation about how millions of people live- unless this can be shown to be a specific term used in a specific way in some documents, rather than just a stereotype, there's no more need for this article than for an article generalising about what it's like to live in the countryside. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 05:05, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>A small amount of research using Google Scholar turns up plenty of source material on the subject of an urban lifestyle, including studies of its medical impact and the travel behaviour of people with that lifestyle. The further reading section of the article contains just a few of them. The article requires significant improvement, but the sources exist, and <i>this is why it is a stub</i>. Deletion is not the way to fix a stub such as this. See our <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>.

<dd>You might misunderstand me. I am sure there is a huge amount of published material on what might be termed the "urban lifestyle", just as there is a whole pile of material on what might be termed "country living". The question is whether the term refers to a generalisable phenomenon in the way that the article currently suggests it does. To add an article in which one says everything possible about what it's like to live in a city is perhaps a bit of a stretch- I would say that it either drags us into the "random collection of information" zone or, otherwise, would simply be a statement of a stereotype- for which there is no place on WP. However, if this refers to a specific term used in a specific way (I haven't yet seen any evidence that it does), then that is a different matter. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 20:18, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I hardly think the description reads like an advertisement, and with the site holding 135,000 member profiles and counting, it seems to advertise itself just fine. Stereokiller is my personal resource for all things music, including news, band profiles and downloads. Not to mention a massive online community I can share my love of music with.

<li>ALEXA IS TRASH. It is the worst way possible to rank websites. When I installed their crap toolbar ages ago, i watched my site go to the top 10,000 within days. Go by our statistics - 5,000,000 message board posts, 130,000 members, and 350,000 sessions a day. Perhaps you should take some time to do some research before you make an ass out of yourself again. ALSO - the site uses two domain names - so search for both on alexa and you will see that it's a completely different story. Search for pahardcore.com AND stereokiller.com and do some averaging. <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrickhouse_b540.html" title="User:Cbrickhouse">Cbrickhouse</a> 13:45, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Edit-conflicted comment</b> First of all, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">no personal attacks</a>. NawlinWiki was stating a very rational viewpoint, which is quite different than "mak[ing] an ass out of [him]self". Second of all, pahardcore.com has an Alexa rank of 297,961; thus, on average, these two sites would have a ranking of around 290,000, and even if you put them together, their rank would probably be around 270,000.

<li>The fact that you're basing your opinions on alexa's ranking system is completely retarded. Seriously. If everyone that used my message boards downloaded their toolbar, we would see both domains rise to the top 10,000, which is where it once was. And alexa doesn't even support Firefox... which about 20% of my users use. <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrickhouse_b540.html" title="User:Cbrickhouse">Cbrickhouse</a> 13:53, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

This was because I had all my users download a personalised toolbar. A lot of the people stopped using the toolbar because they use BETTER toolbars, like googles. If google ranked websites I guarantee that we would have great rankings.
<p>And as for our "unique google hits" - you're basing that on the domain name stereokiller.com, which has only been active for a few years. Search in google for pahardcore.com and you will have much different results.</p>
<p>Your math/reasoning skills are not very good. It would *not* be an actual average of the two divided by the total of both. It would be much lower if the site used one domain name. Probably around 100,000. Because it's tracking both as seperate websites, it lowers the rankings of both instead of as one site.</p>
<ul>
<li>First off, I mentioned above that if you combined the rankings, they still wouldn't be much higher; as I stated, "if you put them together, their rank would probably be around 270,000." Second, and <i>once again</i>, please try to conform to <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. Finally, I actually got a laugh out of your claim that my math skills are subpar, seeing as I had perfect scores on the math SAT I and SAT IIc. But that's irrelevant; as someone mentions below, I'd be all for sprotecting this discussion, or simply speedying the article right now (as all 8 registered users who have made their opinions known have moved for deletion anyway, while only <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose accounts</a> have argued for keeping the article). -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 16:13, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Before I go into my reasoning for deletion, let me say this: saying incivil and rude things ("your math/reasoning skills are not very good", "completely retarded", etc) will <i>not</i> help your case in the least and may in fact result in a block or ban. I believe this article should be deleted because it does not satisfy the guideline of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and because it's apparently not very well known - I can find no news article or non-trivial publications on this website. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 14:17, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Of course I'm going to be un-civil - you people have not listened to a word I've said. Our google pagerank for pahardcore.com is 5/10 and stereokiller.com 4/10 - which is just as good as some other sites I've seen listed here. If you're going to ban me then just do it already. I've done nothing other than to try and get a simple page for my site here, not an advertisement, but because it is an important resource for music and IS widely used, despite what you have illogically deducted. But I ask that if you delete my then delete the like sites as well. Then at least you would have done something right today. <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrickhouse_b540.html" title="User:Cbrickhouse">Cbrickhouse</a> 14:22, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I realize that this website has certain guidelines/ways to decide whether or not a website is allowed to be listed on Wikipedia and that Stereokiller doesn't currently meet the Alexa rating standard. I also realize that Brickhouse may have offended/upset more than a few people on here, making everyone even more biased against the site. However, that was merely because he doesn't understand why a website that has so many users and so many bands isn't eligible for this website. Have all of you checked the site out yourself? It isn't just a message board. There are thousands of CD reviews on there, mp3s, and listings for shows all around the country, as well as, over a million users. Maybe when it was started in 97, it was just a bunch of our friends messing around on a website, but it has grown and has become ridiculously widespread over the past 10 years. Brickhouse could no longer even keep the old name (PaHardcore), because it was more than obvious that it wasn't just us southeastern PA kids anymore. The users on Stereokiller are from all over the world. The website helps up and coming bands get wide exposure, much like MySpace does. I hope you can at least take that into consideration. Thanks. -Jessclancy 19:01, 17 August 2006 (UTC)Jess.

<li>'Jess, while I can respect that completely, the fact of the matter is that this AfD is not about censorship or picking favorites. It isn't about if a site has a huge following or not. It is about if the Article can pass all of Wikipedia's rules. Let me help out a bit so you understand. The Alexia rating isn't really used as a guideline (and is often cited for it's inaccuracy. I personally believe it should be done away with), and the Google searchs are really only used to back up a statement, not as a basis for a vote though this is abused sometimes. No, the real problem with this article is that it doesn't follow the three pillars of wikipedia. An article must be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiable</a> through multiple, reliable, reputable, independent, third-party sources. It must not be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, which means there are no sources to back up the claims. It must also have a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point-of-view</a> and not show bias. As a guideline for the above rules, an article must <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite it's notability</a> with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and be must be <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">encyclopaedic</a>. This article falls into <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">being an advertisment</a> per a statement made by a forum member.

<li>First of all, I would like to say that I understand and respect why you have these guidelines and this screening process. I neglected to mention that in my previous post. Although I just created my account today, I frequent this website quite often when researching my college term papers (and of course, I cite the information and give credit where it is due). Therefore, I completely understand that it is important to your credibility as a website and information provider to make sure that your hosted websites are legitimate. I also appreciate the time you took to be very specific when replying to my first post even though you already did it multiple times on this page and are probably tired of doing it. With that being said (I know, there is always a but), I think that with the variety of different services/information that different sites have to offer, maybe some of the guidelines should be different for certain types of websites. Stereokiller is much different than a site where, for example, someone has dedicated to American History. Obviously, if you are hosting that man's website, you must be sure that it is legit and the information is accurate, and that it is not just some wierdo posting from his basement who decides he wants to rewrite American History and see what internet sucker believes it. Stereokiller, on the other hand, really helps give new and up and coming bands exposure. The mp3s that are hosted are provided to the user for free, so Brickhouse is not doing this in order to have more people paying him for downloads of songs. Also, I understand why you are looking for notable sources/articles to verify that Stereokiller is a credible website for reasons that I mentioned earlier. However, I think that is a little less important than it is for the american history type website I described above, because the bands choose to host themselves. Brickhouse can't be falsely representing the bands, because they put the information about them up themselves. Also, I doubt there are many articles, if any at all, written about Stereokiller, not because it is a non-credible website, but because it represents the underground hardcore scene, which is much less popular than a website that is centered around huge pop-stars like Justin Timberlake or Kelly Clarkson. As far as not wanting to host a website with biased information, I understand that as well. The only information that I could see to be considered biased on the website would be the reviews, but that's to be expected, right? A review is simply one person giving their opinion about what they are reviewing. If they don't like the music, it gets a bad review, much like if Roger Ebert doesn't like a movie, it gets a bad review. That does not mean that Ebert is not a credible source for movie reviews, nor that the movie is techinically awful, it is just his opinion. As far as the article Brickhouse posted about it sounding like an advertisement, I read Pure Volume's post and found them to be quite similar. I realize that PureVolume probably meets the credible article requirement because it is a much bigger website, but it had to start somewhere, right? I realize this was quite a long-winded post, and I'm not sure if you are even going to bother reading it. I also realize that you probably could care less about bending the rules for me because, like I said before, I understand why you have the rules to begin with, and also because I'm sure you just think that I am some random girl on the internet defending her friend and his website. Haha, but I've never been one to not voice my opinion, so you got it whether you care to read it or not. Once again, thanks for taking the time to at least read my response, and also thank you for the countless amount of term papers this website has helped me with. -Jess.

<li>Thank you for that. You are on the way to understanding our purpose here. It isn't to write an article about every web site in existence. Projects such as <a href="http://www.wikidweb.com./" class="external text" title="http://www.wikidweb.com./" rel="nofollow">Wikidweb</a> have that goal. Our goal is to write an encyclopaedia, that readers can trust because they can independently verify everything in it should they choose to, that does not contain original research (i.e. completely idiosyncratic viewpoints or new ideas, syntheses, and analyses that haven't been through a process of publication, fact checking, and peer review outside of Wikipedia), and that espouses no point of view in any debates. Our inclusion criteria such as <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> exist, in large part, so that Wikipedia remains an encyclopaedia and doesn't turn into a World Wide Web directory. This is why arguments such as "Web site X has an article. We should, too!" will always fail. We also don't include and exclude subjects based upon their personal importance to individual Wikipedia editors. If we used subjective criteria like that, Wikipedia would be a complete mess. We don't include or exclude web sites from having articles based upon thier credibility (although we most definitely <i>do</i> exclude external links to web sites based upon their credibility, see <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a>). We include or exclude web sites according to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. The way to argue that a subject should have an encyclopaedia article is to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a> showing that it has been the subject of serious, independent, fact-checked, and peer-reviewed discussion outside of Wikipedia.
<p>Remember when writing your term papers that it is poor work to cite an encyclopaedia. An encyclopaedia is merely a tool that condenses and summarizes the knowledge, and shows readers where the <i>actual</i> reading material is. If there is no actual reading material about a web site, then there shouldn't be an encyclopaedia article on it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:01, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> per guidelines at <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. A single list of characters for a game is perfectly acceptable, and many CVG good and featured articles (primarily the Final Fantasy games) use lists of characters (as well as separate articles for individual main characters) to keep the main article from growing too large. --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 05:26, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per the above: a great example of fans who have managed to avoid the cruft trap by collecting less significant material into a single article. In its Wikipedia incarnation, this article needs pruning to remove trivia, the parts written in an unencyclopedic style need tightening up, and sources need to be added, but I can't see that it inherently fails to meet the current consensus for inclusion. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 09:00, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> reccomends creating lists for minor characters and major characters being given seperate articles if they do not fit within the main article.
