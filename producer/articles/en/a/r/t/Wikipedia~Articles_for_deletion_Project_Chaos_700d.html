The article itself is abysmal (and I don't feel anyone has any right to be offended by my saying such--it can't be described any other way). An infobox is not an article, and an article containing only "More information forthcoming" makes Wikipedia itself look bad. I'm fine with this article existing at some later date, but at the moment it is no cause for notice. <a href="../../../v/a/g/Vague.html" title="Vague">Vague</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/g/User_talk%7EVague_Rant_b959.html" title="User talk:Vague Rant">Rant</a> 10:54, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - While I did not start these articles, and would not have done so until the actual albums/projects were near completion, I have basically written all of the articles and provided all of the information for the existing and close-to-completion albums done by OverClocked ReMix (i.e. Relics of the Chozo, Kong in Concert, Hedgehog Heaven, Repercussions of Fowl Lamentation, Rise of the Star, The Dark Side of Phobos &amp; Chrono Symphonic), as well as other popular fan and licensed game arrangement albums (e.g. Bound Together, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_American_Album_6cd2.html" title="The American Album">The American Album</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Very_Best_of_SEGA_5c22.html" title="The Very Best of SEGA">The Very Best of SEGA</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_OneUps_Volume_1_75f1.html" title="The OneUps Volume 1">The OneUps Volume 1</a> &amp; <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenogears_Light_7ec7.html" title="Xenogears Light">Xenogears Light</a>). These AfD nominations are all substantially in-progress arrangement albums of popular video games and video game series and, IMO, are not merely cruft. I can assure you that those articles will have full information on them, and obviously will have to work to build these AfD noms into suitable stubs now while the albums are still in progress, much like the Summoning of Spirits album which was in this group of articles but not nominated. - <a href="../../../l/i/o/User%7ELiontamer_20aa.html" title="User:Liontamer">Liontamer</a> 22:06, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>At present, each of these projects exists as a few work-in-progress remixes between people who meet in a single topic on the OCR boards and probably over IRC. At the moment, they are cruft, they are advertising. There's nothing to these articles but the same template text you've applied to the other articles (I don't mean that as an insult, I just think that substituting "Sonic the Hedgehog enthusiasts" into already formulated text used for other articles does not itself create new articles). At present, there is nothing at all unique about these articles. The released/close to release albums each have their own backgrounds--these projects have no backgrounds. They are not sufficiently developed to have them. They're just carbon copies of one another. - <a href="../../../v/a/g/Vague.html" title="Vague">Vague</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/g/User_talk%7EVague_Rant_b959.html" title="User talk:Vague Rant">Rant</a> 07:46, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, I have used a template of which I have written other articles regarding these types of projects. The resulting information is no less genuine, because these projects are all created under the same circumstances. There's no reason to come up with synonyms for 10 different articles simply because using a template isn't unique. I don't think that's necessarily a requirement for articles that are clearly presented as stubs until they can be expanded with even more information and specifics.<br />
As for "not having their own backgrounds", each of these albums have different backgrounds/concepts of what they aim to accomplish that I'll be more than happy to add in the coming days. Again, these are stubs and are not gonna have all of the information presented immediately/at once. Basically I'm arguing that there's enough substance that is simply not yet presented that justifies leaving these to actually develop. Personally, I'd say that these stubs should remain and be allowed to expand. - <a href="../../../l/i/o/User%7ELiontamer_20aa.html" title="User:Liontamer">Liontamer</a> 08:32, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not debating whether the template makes the information genuine or not--I'm debating whether there's any information here at all. There are what, six unique words in the entire article? And even if there is information, who is it here for? No one who is not already following the project has an interest in these proto-albums. It is here solely to appease the fans who want it here. And that's no reason for an article. - <a href="../../../v/a/g/User%7EVague_Rant_9ae6.html" title="User:Vague Rant">Vague</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/g/User_talk%7EVague_Rant_b959.html" title="User talk:Vague Rant">Rant</a> 10:54, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'm not sure if OCRemix albums really need their own entires anyway, but entries for albums that haven't even been released yet? Just stupid, probably the most these albums should get at the moment is a mention in the appropriate section of the main OCRemix article. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredOrAlive_8809.html" title="User:FredOrAlive">FredOrAlive</a> 10:11, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Just a quick extra note - there are even more of these stupid articles: Summoning of Spirits, Chrono Symphonic. They're all kinda hard to find as none of the "in progress" ones are actually linked from the main <a href="../../../o/v/e/OverClocked_ReMix_d57a.html" title="OverClocked ReMix">OverClocked ReMix</a> page (although there is a template on the induvidual album pages). <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredOrAlive_8809.html" title="User:FredOrAlive">FredOrAlive</a> 11:15, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - OCR projects that aren't completed yet don't need to have Wikipedia articles. The people in charge of those projects can make the articles after they've finished and released their albums. The only one that I'd like to keep around is the Chrono Symphonic one, because that's due for release in just a few days, but even if it does get deleted, the entire raw form of the article (with all the markup) can be copied into a text file to be posted at a later date, when the album is released.&#160;;) I'm in agreement that articles about unreleased albums that have little substance to them are pointless advertisements; and this is coming from the guy in charge of projects at OCR. In any case, I've posted about this at OCR to try and curb any future abuse. Darkesword 18:02, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
