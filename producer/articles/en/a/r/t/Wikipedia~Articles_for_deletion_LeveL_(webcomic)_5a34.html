<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Alexa rank really isn't the best measure of notability. Consider:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Ashdown_d4a6.html" title="Pete Ashdown">Pete Ashdown</a>'s US Senate campaign site has an Alexa rank of 2,530,023. Steve Urquhart's rank is 2,910,251. Nobody's suggesting deleting them -- especially if one of them actually manages to beat <a href="../../../o/r/r/Orrin_Hatch_751f.html" title="Orrin Hatch">Orrin Hatch</a> in next year's election (please, please, please). Orrin's site, BTW, ranks 1,490,351.
<ul>
<li>Those people are known for their political activity outside the internet. webcomics only have their internet presence to show. If that can't be verified through Google, Alexa or any other means, that means it doesn't have that presence. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:32, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>And I would add that <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Ashdown_d4a6.html" title="Pete Ashdown">Pete Ashdown</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/r/Orrin_Hatch_751f.html" title="Orrin Hatch">Orrin Hatch</a>'s websites don't have their own wikipedia article...--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 21:02, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On a more webcomic-related note, it appears that all Keenspace comics get a single ranking of 5,395. That means that a comic like [<a href="http://saturnalia.keenspace.com" class="external text" title="http://saturnalia.keenspace.com" rel="nofollow">Saturnalia</a>], that never had a very large reader base and that hasn't updated in a year and a half, ranks more than twice as high as <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a> (13,920) or User Friendly (12,251). (Nothing against Saturnalia, BTW: Space Coyote is a great artist and the story was good, too. After this long, though, it's pretty well dead.)</li>
<li>Also on webcomics, even <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_%28webcomic%29_73fc.html" title="Penny Arcade (webcomic)">Penny Arcade</a>, one of the originals, only ranks 404,199.</li>
<li>Alexa does list a few other sites that link to leveL. The best I found there was <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a>.--12.160.33.128 15:39, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. (Well, can also be transwikied; I have no objection to that at all, but my primary thought is that I'd like to remove this from Wikipedia.) Doesn't appear to be notable; frankly, any webcomic where a Google search for "&lt;webcomic's name&gt; &lt;creator's name&gt;" returns ~50 hits is non-notable in the grand scale of things, and possibly also in the webcomics scale of things.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'd like to correct the earlier assertion that the Penny Arcade webcomic has an Alexa ranking of 404,199; it's ranking is in fact 4,520<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Further comparing the Alexa ranking of webcomics (which are by definition read primarily on the web) to those of Senators (who relay their information through mainstream news media coverage, talk shows, etc.) is a bit of apples to oranges.

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../w/e/b/Wikipedia%7EWeb_comics_ef7e.html" title="Wikipedia:Web comics">Wikipedia:Web comics</a> lists several possible criteria for webcomic notablility. This doesn't meet any of them. I'd also point out that User:12.160.33.128's understanding of the Alexa ranking system is limited. For example, Penny arcade ranks in at 4500, not 400,000. This comic ranks at 2 million, which even taking into account Alexa's margin for error, is pretty bad. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 220.238.34.168 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_220.238.34.168_366a.html" title="Special:Contributions/220.238.34.168">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b><span style="color:red">Okay, I don't understand this "Bryan and Flare" thing.</span></b> What point did Bryan make that you agree with? Was it (1) that the article was extensive and all long articles are notable or (2) that you don't understand why people are voting Delete? What argument of Flare are you agreeing with? Do you agree that (3) any website with 600 visitors/day is notable or (4) notability may be asserted in ways that do not need to be described?

<li><b>Comment</b> The point of me mentioning the visits a day was to show that it is obviously known aside from the 40 people in the forum, since some of the voters for deletion used 'forum has 40 members, noone reads this thing' as an argument. It's not like this site DOESN'T generate tens of thousands of visitors a month. I was also referencing the guy that brought up points against Alexa rating, but he didn't have a user name, so it was probably easier to refer back to me. As for the ways that need not be described, it's obvious I'm a reader of the comic and thus have a bias, which is why mentioning any points about the actual quality of the comic over the quantity of activity around it would be putting myself on display to be torn apart. When I looked at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> before suggesting the article, it still had the alternate proposal that included longevity, a certain number of existant strips/pages and some other things that I can't remember right now but that were all met. Now that it's pretty much popularity only, any such argument has become void- I can't argue against the fact that it doesn't have an audience of millions. -Flare- 13:23, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I am probably going to hate myself for saying this, but I'm all for frankness: <b>This is still only a proposed guideline.</b> It's referred to as a pointer for what the current suggested direction for this guideline is according to those who have taken part, but that is it. Don't let it deter you from making a pitch for its inclusion based upon longevity or something else. And anyone who's wavering in ther recomendation, don't be swayed by the pseudo-official nature of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> which I've had lots to do with shaping. Feel free to make your own decision, but please be ready to state your reasoning clearly. Thanks.<br />

<li>Delete: Fails every guideline we've ever had for "notability," and the fervor of its fans in voting is not any argument against that. For those who wish a "reason why" it shouldn't be here, even though there is no reason why it <i>should</i> be here, I'll simply say that encyclopedias cover that which is referred to in alien context and which needs explanation and contextualizing. This forum/comic/game is known by its fans and referred to by none else. Those who wish to know, know. Those who do not know, will not hear of it and need to know. Since Wikipedia is <b>not</b> a place to satisfy the fan's obsession nor a place for people to advertise, the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:22, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I was the original nominator, so please don't count my vote twice. I wasn't too happy with the no-consensus of the first vote. I did not have a chance to reply to the erronomous and misleading comments above. Dragonfiend has already established that a popular webcomic like <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_%28webcomic%29_73fc.html" title="Penny Arcade (webcomic)">Penny Arcade</a> has a respectable Alexa rank. The comparisons to <a href="../../../o/r/r/Orrin_Hatch_751f.html" title="Orrin Hatch">Orrin Hatch</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Ashdown_d4a6.html" title="Pete Ashdown">Pete Ashdown</a> are totally irrelevent, these are people who have had major press attention, something which this comic lacks, even in the webcomic community. I would however, either redirect an article on Orrin Hatch's website to Orrin Hatch, or even move to delete. Just because a site links to it, does not mean it is notable. Heck, some blogs even link to my wikipedia page. This comic has no assertion of notability, a low readership and almost empty forums. Other arguments above, saying that "keep - long archive", I just don't agree with. One of my main points against the no defunct original WP:COMIC was the, longevity = notability" clause. Would you keep an article for a person who's only claim to notability was living up to retirement age? - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 18:55, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, just in case previous votes aren't being re-counted (I voted before). Why is this being re-listed?

<ul>
<li>Thanks for that it's not actually been "re-listed", I mispoke before and have corrected it. It has been extended as is common for AfD discussions that do not reach a clear consensus. For example, a 50/50 split with strong arguments presented by each side is a "no consensus" and thus no action is taken. In <i>this</i> example, neither the numbers nor the arguments clearly indicated the "will of the people", and extendind the discussion appears to have made things clear. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 00:37, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Based on the discussion, I am reinstating my delete vote. Even though it is not the webcomic I originally thought it was, this webcomic appears to miserably fail the proposed guidelines at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a>.
