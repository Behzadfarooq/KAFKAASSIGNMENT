<p><b>Handjob</b> - <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> states that <u>all article claims must be sourced to reliable secondary sources. If the article is not verifiable (see Reliable sources for neologisms, below) then it constitutes analysis, synthesis and original research and consequently cannot be accepted by Wikipedia. This is true even though there may be many examples of the term in use.</u> Moreover, per the section "Reliable sources for neologism" mentioned, <u>To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term — not books and papers that use the term</u>. In evaluating the references in in <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">Handjob</a>, #1, #2, and #3 which is all 3 of the references in the article, they are not books or articles about "Handjob" but are only articles that use the term trivially as a neologism and without discussing it as such. All of these references thus fail <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. In the External links section, a link is posted to a Usenet posting, which not only fails the heightened reference criteria of <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> but the general criteria for all Wikipedia articles at <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Bulletin_boards.2C_wikis_and_posts_to_Usenet" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources#Bulletin_boards.2C wikis and posts to Usenet</a> which states Usenet posts may not be used as references. The second External link points to a website that uses the word "handjob" to describe sexual technique but it is not a reliable secondary source. Therefore, and "even though there may be many examples of the term in use", this article must be deleted per <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> and any pertinent content placed into <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreplay.html" title="Foreplay">Foreplay</a> / <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_petting.html" title="Heavy petting">Heavy petting</a> where it belongs. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 01:54, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Fingering (sexual act)</b> - is a slang term for Manual-genital stimulation and/or <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a>. As such, this article should be about the etymology and history of the term "fingering", a neologism. The article has been tagged since Sept. 2006 as not citing it sources, and has had dozens of edits since then, none of which have introduced sources.

<li>As I was adding the reliably sourced content it did seem to me that a merger to <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a> was in order, given what the sources were actually saying about hand jobs. However, there have been two proposed mergers discussed on the article's talk page, both of which were opposed. I suggest that all of the above editors review the several arguments already made against merger on <a href="../../../h/a/n/Talk%7EHandjob_c98e.html" title="Talk:Handjob">Talk:Handjob</a> and comment on them, because they have yet to be addressed and countered by any editor in this discussion.
<p>Incidentally: <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> is missing the point of <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> in the nomination. If this were an article about a neologism, then we would need sources that discuss the word. But it isn't. ("<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hand_job" class="extiw" title="wikt:hand_job">hand job</a>" isn't even a neologism, as the fact that one of the sources dates from 1975 should clearly imply.) It's an article about <i>the actual thing that the phrase denotes</i>, a hand job. So the fact that the sources simply <i>use</i> the phrase in their discussions of hand jobs is entirely proper. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:43, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, re the recent discussions about merging that have gone on previously, they got bogged down in who was doing what to who.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Dhartungh stated that <i>handjob</i> "is longstanding sexual slang" yet he uses a reference <i>in which it is used to describe a slang term, a neologism at the time,</i> <u>in an article that is not about its use as slang but treats it like some scholarly encyclopedic term for Manual stimulation (sexual).</u> It falls under neologism, therefore. Again, why not rename <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">Sexual intercourse</a> to <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fucking.html" title="Fucking">Fucking</a>? Because it is not the scholarly encyclopedic term for the act. Any article titled <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fucking.html" title="Fucking">Fucking</a> would need to be about the etymology and history of usage of the word "fuck". Same with this article <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">handjob</a>. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 05:33, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I have no idea what your first sentence means. You seem to be confusing a deletion discussion with an article. Please try to make more sense.

<li>This is obviously pointless. You're proceeding from a completely unsupported contention that the word falls under our definition of neologism, and saying that it fails to meet the guidelines, but you have not presented any credible evidence that it is a neologism. Obviously we can continue going around in "is! is not!" circles. If you had a better rationale for deletion -- and you obviously don't, you think the topic is valid and should be given a different name -- you would have put it in the nomination.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The article is not about mutual masturbation, it is about masturbation of a male as a primary sexual activity, often in the context of commercial sex. I know of no better term for this--and the apparent attempts of others to find one show their similar inability. it is not "mutual" anything, it is much more specific than "sexual stimulation", and more specific than "masturbation", and much more specific than petting, and not necessarily or even usually part of foreplay. it is much too old to be a neologism. It refers to an activity--it is not just about the word. RANorton &amp; Edison have it right.

<li><b>Comment</b> - To clarify: <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">Handjob</a> is a colloquial term for Manual-Genital Stimulation, the term the consensus of scholarship uses to describe the act. The yet uncreated article Manual-Genital Stimulation should mention that one of several colloquial terms for the act is "handjob". Therefore, since handjob is a colloquial term for Manual-Genital Stimulation, an article titled Handjob needs to be about the term as a colloquialism. Does that clear things up? <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 09:06, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, because it's wrong, being based upon an incorrect idea of what the article should be about. An article entitled <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">handjob</a> should be about hand jobs. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, not a dictionary</a>. An article about the <i>word</i> (more properly, the phrase) is a dictionary article. As previously mentioned, the dictionary already has a stub article about the phrase at <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hand_job" class="extiw" title="wikt:hand_job">hand job</a>. Encyclopaedia articles are not about the words or phrases but about the people, concepts, events, places, or things that the words or phrases denote.
<p>If, as you assert, manual-genital stimulation and <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">handjob</a> are the same thing (which requires evidence that females can be given hand jobs, given that the literature talks about manual-genital stimulation of females), then the one should redirect to the other, since two articles about a single concept are <a href="../../../d/u/p/Wikipedia%7EDuplicate_articles_da79.html" title="Wikipedia:Duplicate articles">Wikipedia:Duplicate articles</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - If, as UncleG says, a handjob is different from Manual-Genital Stimulation, then <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">handjob</a> needs to be about the term as such. <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a> is one reason why.

We use the common scholarly name. A dictionary entry and an article like <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a> that covers the etymology and history of a word are very different matters. Both male and female manual-genital stimulation can be covered in Manual-genital stimulation, and colloquialisms such as "handjob" and "third base" can be cited as colloquialisms for the act. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 00:18, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Putting all of these topics at <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a> would be confusing.

<li><b>Keep or merge</b> Possible merge to <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutual_masturbation.html" title="Mutual masturbation">mutual masturbation</a>, but the term 'fingering' is NOT a neologism, it's been used in numerous publications (any 'about your body' book ever written that covers masturbations I'd guess), and it's a distinct act. Saying this all belongs in mutual masturbation is something of a transitive error of logic, just because fingering is a kind of manual stimulation and often used in mutual masturbation play doesn't mean it's not a distinct act. I would only caution that it should be careful to avoid wp:NOT a how-to guide, there are enough sites for that as it is. I see nothing in WP:not that would preclude this article, it is a notable concept, verifiable, researched (Kinsey study, various studies of female sexual response, ect.) and discussed, performed in bedrooms across the world on a nightly basis and in no way unencyclopedic. I hesitate to call it such, but I think there might be a possible combined WP:point and WP:not censored issue here. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 04:16, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - For defenders of this article "as is", instead of wasting your energy here, I suggest you expend it making the article worthy to keep as titled <i>Fingering</i>. "A topic is notable if and only "if it has been <u>the subject of</u> multiple, non-trivial published works with sources independent of the subject itself and each other." "The subject of" <u>does not</u> equal <u>merely mentioned in</u>. Right now, the cold hard facts mean the article does not meet that criteria. <b>Note:</b> Culling together sources that merely mention or use <i>Fingering</i> <u>as a colloquialism or slang term</u> only asserts that the article is, in fact, Synthesis and Original Research. I suggest if you want to keep this article, you best expend your efforts finding sources where <i>Fingering</i> *AS A SPECIFIC TERM* "has been <u>the subject of</u> multiple, non-trivial published works with sources independent of the subject itself and each other", or else concede that any adequately sourced material belongs in Manual-genital stimulation. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability is not subjective</a>.

<li><b>comment</b> I disagree. It is the subject of the article (the act or concept variously called "fingering", or a particular kind of "manual genital stimulation") that needs to satisfy the quotes you emphasize ("... multiple, non-trivial published works"). It is not the case that someone needs to publish a work <i>about</i> "fingering AS A SPECIFIC TERM".

<li><b>comment to all the above</b> Please don't take this the wrong way, it's hard to say this without sounding a bit terse, but if you're going to argue for deletion, a valid argument is vital. Neologism is a valid argument, one I dissagree with, but a valid argument; "disgusting" (so are many things, subjective criteria and violates wp:not censored)"unlikely to be searched for" (so are a lot of things, that isn't a deletion criterion) are not valid deletion arguments founded in wiki policy. Wikilawyering the exact definition of "subject of a non-trivial work" is unessesary and serves no purpose. A merge would eliminate the uniqueness of the two articles. Renames with redirects would be a suitable compromise, to me, creating Manual Genital Stimulation (male) and Manual Genital Stimulation (female). <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a></li>

<li><b>merge</b> and redirect. Both are informal usage not formal phrases for this, and the reuslt is duplication. The first major section in hand job seems to be a piece of local nonsense that has no obvious relevance outside of that one town.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Per the <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> arguments, that page says neologisms are "words and terms that have recently been coined, generally do not appear in any dictionary, but may be used widely or within certain communities." One has been in use for at least 35 years and the other at least 15, and both appear in dictionaries. The merge suggestions ignore the fact that the two articles examine two completely different acts.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Unfortunately I feel that this AfD has been horrifically tainted with inappropriate comments on several sides of the debate. I'm afraid my original intention of closing the Fingering AfD was misapplied, it should have been closed <b>not</b> merged. We should have slowed down and waited for the Handjob AfD to reach a consensus, then use it as a precedent to apply to other articles. Instead we're running into another cluster-fuck discussion where it will be impossible to reach a clear consensus. Let's all calm down and make intelligent arguments that are backed up by wikipedia policy. Articles that attract vandalism (<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W_Bush_83e6.html" title="George W Bush">George W Bush</a>) or some deem as "<i>inappropriate</i>" (<a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">Homosexuality</a>) are not valid arguments for deletion, and neither is it a valid argument to keep an article because you heard of it before. There are policy backed arguments to use on either side of the table, let's try to debate guidelines instead of morality. -- <a href="../../../w/t/f/User%7EWtfunkymonkey_476f.html" title="User:Wtfunkymonkey">wtfunkymonkey</a> 22:48, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. As I see it, there are two separate issues: (a) Is manual masturbation sufficiently distinct from masturbation in general to deserve its own article?

I would answer "No" to both questions, and support a merge of both disputed articles into <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">Masturbation</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> unless sourced. Fingering can be a form of masturbation, but is not always. The term <i>fingering</i> also has some sociolinguistic significance.

<p>Someone above said, "Who could possibly write a whole work about the name of something?"</p>
<p>Fact is, articles constantly appear in various journals of linguistics (and related disciplines) that trace the origins, usages, and meanings of slang words, neologisms, and the like.</p>
<p>An entire book was written about the word "Fuck", <i>as a word</i>. See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/F-Word-Random-House/dp/0679764275/sr=8-1/qid=1167890142/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-3657703-4961632?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/F-Word-Random-House/dp/0679764275/sr=8-1/qid=1167890142/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-3657703-4961632?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">Jesse Sheidlower, The F Word ISBN 0-375-70634-8</a>. The WP article <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a> is a nice example of an article about the word "Fuck" as a word, although it is duplicated in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_word__fuck__cf34.html" title="History of the word &quot;fuck&quot;">History of the word "fuck"</a>.</p>
<p>Do research with a University library's databases.</p>
<p>I searched with <a href="../../../e/b/s/EBSCO_9f27.html" title="EBSCO">EBSCO</a> with &lt;- handjob -&gt; and found two articles - both about <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">Punk rock</a> that mentioned the band <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Morris_c626.html" title="Keith Morris">Midget Handjob</a>.</p>
<p>I then searched EBSCO with &lt;- fingering AND sexual -&gt; and then &lt;- fingering AND sex -&gt;. Nothing came up.</p>
<p>I then searched it with &lt;- genital stimulation NOT self-stimulation NOT masturbation -&gt;. 17 articles.</p>
<p>I then did with <a href="../../../j/s/t/JSTOR_27a2.html" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a> what I did with EBSCO above. Keep in mind these are two of the most major databases of academic journals in English in the world.</p>
<p>&lt;- handjob -&gt; brought 2 results. Article #1 was about college student behaviors. It quoted a student using the word "handjob" as a slang term. Article #2 was a study of prostitutes. It quoted a prostitute using the word "handjob" as a slang term.</p>
<p>&lt;- genital stimulation -&gt; brought 275 articles.</p>
<p>The references cited in <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">Handjob</a> are from articles with prostitution as their subject, and in that context the slang word <i>handjob</i> would of course appear. No additional comment needed here.</p>
<p>Actually, I will. The references are themselves an argument for treating <i>handjob</i> as a neologism, a slang word, in an article about it as such, because that is exactly how it is treated in the references.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/i/n/Fingering_%28sexual_act%29.html" title="Fingering (sexual act)">Fingering (sexual act)</a> does not have any references.</p>
<p>Miriam-Webster Dictionary is considered by Wikipedia policy, along with the Oxford dictionary, to be the most authoritative.</p>
<p><i>Handjob</i> does not appear in the Miriam-Webster Dictionary, <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/handjob" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/handjob" rel="nofollow">see here</a>. Neither does <i>hand job</i>, <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/hand%20job" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/hand%20job" rel="nofollow">see here</a>.</p>
<p><i>Handjob</i> or <i>hand job</i> does appear in other non-slang dictionaries. The definitions all say "<i>a slang word</i> for masturbation." And it appears in every slang dictionary I checked.</p>
<p><i>Fingering</i> turns up no specific sexual definition in Miriam-Webster, <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/fingering" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/fingering" rel="nofollow">see here</a>, nor any other one I checked.</p>
<p><i>Fingering</i> as a sexual act appeared in several slang dictionaries I checked.</p>
<p>"Neologisms are words and terms that have recently been coined, generally do not appear in any dictionary, but may be used widely or within certain communities" (<a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>).</p>
<p>Yes indeed, <i>handjob</i> and <i>fingering</i> are certainly "used widely or within certain communities". The policy says that is not enough.</p>
<p>It might be argued, however, that <i>handjob</i> and <i>fingering</i> have been around for 20 - 40 years, so that is not "recent'. The objection is irrelevant. Neither are in any dictionary <i>except as a slang word</i>. This means they have not been around long enough to move from the slang to regular lexicon of any reliable source.</p>
<p>Articles titled "Fingering (sexual)" and "Handjob" need to be like <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a>, i.e., <i>about the word</i>, its etymology, history, etc.</p>
<p>The <i>acts</i> the slang terms denote should be covered in Genital stimulation. <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">Oral sex</a>, manual-genital stimulation, and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a> should all have coverage in that one article.</p>
<p>Specifically, Genital stimulation needs to be created. Material in <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">Handjob</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/n/Fingering_%28sexual_act%29.html" title="Fingering (sexual act)">Fingering (sexual act)</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">oral sex</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a> needs to be incorporated there, and then Handjob and Fingering (sexual act) deleted for the reasons outlined above.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> CyberAnth: creating one singular topic for ALL genital stimulation isn't a viable solution in my opinion. That would lump sex, oral sex, masturbation, mutual masturbation, electro-gential stimulation and more that I probably can't think of right now into a topic that would get so big it'd need to be spun off into seperate topics immediately or shortly after creation. I think that 'manual genital stimulation (female) and' 'manual genital stimulation (male)' might be more appropriate topics, but the use of a clinical neologism invented as a pure function of wiki categorization isn't for me as valid as using the common colloquial term. For reasons described above, mutual masturbation is not equivilent to manual genital stimulation (fingering and handjobs if you will&#160;:P) or masturbation, they are distinct acts. Masturbation is self-induced sexual arousal and climax, whether it's manual or not (IE it is possible to masturbate without actual manual stimulation, IE by shower head or vibrator) and mutual masturbation is not equivilent to genital stimulation in that it involves both partners masturbating each other simultainiously (in the same way the 69 position is distinct in meaning from oral sex). In response to the first AfD, a handjob is identical in meaning to male manual genital stimulation, but "fingering" is a distinct activity, seperated from other methods of female manual genital stimulation. Lumping dissimular articles into a single polyglot whole serves no identifiable purpose in my opinion, and would be akin to combining sex, anal sex and oral sex into a single topic in terms of the dissolution of unique articles for distinct acts. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 17:25, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If the articles were just stubs I could see merging them, but when medium sized articles get merged it creates more problems than it solves. I get redirected to a page and have to search the page until I find what I am looking for, never sure if I am at the correct page until I find (or don't find) what I came for. Header redirects: <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex.html#Masturbation" title="Sex">Sex#Masturbation</a> work only as long as the header names remain unchanged, which isn't long. Each of these articles already has its own set of external links and usage sections. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 02:12, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. CyberAnth writes: "The acts the slang terms denote should be covered in Genital stimulation. Oral sex, manual-genital stimulation, and masturbation should all have coverage in that one article." This really sums up the entire argument, doesn't it? You want to roll everything into one article. <i>You are <b>not</b> arguing that the topics are not valid. You <b>are</b> arguing for a move or a merge.</i> This is not what AFD is for; this is a bad-faith nomination, and should be treated accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<dd>On a more diplomatic note, it is very disappointing that you did not look at this problem and think in a collaborative manner. An appropriate way to handle the problem that you see would be to start at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Sexuality_0186.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Sexuality">Wikipedia:WikiProject Sexuality</a> and ask, "Is there any way we can improve these articles? I have some ideas about reorganizing them." You didn't do that, you came up with an argument based entirely on the articles' <i>titles</i> and not their <i>content</i>, and now you're trying to reach consensus on the basis of that wholly inappropriate argument, not giving an inch, even though you have long since conceded that the content belongs on Wikipedia. <i>You just don't like the article name.</i> Please don't waste people's time like this in the future. It's very frustrating to deal with the articles that truly do not belong. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:01, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not have a problem with an article entitled "handjob", but an article as such needs to be about the slang term, as with <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a>. Obviously, some people are not willing to give an inch to concede this and are highly connected to <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">Handjob</a> as presently constituted. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 00:48, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That simply makes no sense whatsoever and has absolutely no basis in policy. If the topic itself exists and meets WP:V and WP:RS, which <i>hand jobs</i> -- manual manipulation of the penis -- certainly does, then naming should be per <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">naming conventions</a> and at the "most common name", not at some made-up supercategory. Again, you are arguing that the article should be written such that it must be deleted, which is ridiculous, and basically bad faith. With your newest batch of noms, well, you're showing that collaborative processes are not in your kitbag. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 05:45, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
