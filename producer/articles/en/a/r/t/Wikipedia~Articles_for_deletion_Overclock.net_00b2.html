<p>Overclock.net has a massive online user-base, as described in the article. The forum has been sponsored by Nvidia, Newegg.com, Tankguys.com, and Maximum PC. Deleting this on basis of non-notability is ridiculous. Feel free to say that I am only here to support Overclock.net, but the truth would be that this is the first article I feel knowledgeable enough about to edit.

<p>As a member I'm obviously biased, but this fact also gives me more insight than your average Joe. A few years ago I was motivated to learn about overclocking and quickly found the forum on google. I have been a member in SO many forums, but Overclock.net differs in that its members are leagues above other forums in both intelligence and kindness. This was obvious from the beginning, when no one complained about the frequency of my questions (many of which had been answered numerous times before). Were it simply a nice forum, it might not be notable, but the aforementioned truths have caused the community to explode from around 7,500 members (when I joined in March of 2005) to over 32,000. That's about a 425% increase in under 2 years. It certainly deserves a spot on Wikipedia.TheInformationator 02:25, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It really is an awesome thing, to be part of a community that shares one's interests, and one that is kind and tolerant. I'm not entirely sure that size or growth of a community is a criterion, though, to keep an article. There are many communities with many, many people, but are not notable. Check out <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html#Criteria" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB#Criteria</a> - if your community does meet one of the criterion listed there, feel free to mention it, but otherwise, this article merits deletion. You might want to check out <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikia.html" title="Wikia">Wikia</a>, which is a wiki that can be created for a specific subject. Your community can create a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a> just about the subject of overclocking, and edit it. However, unless a criterion on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> can be found,</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Notability has been established multiple times throughout this discussion, via webpage hits, mentions in mass publications, multiple sources of sponsorship, and a verifiable large member base. By Wiki's own criteria in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> notability has been established. Quote: "1. The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." Unquote. Maxim Magazine and The Chicago Tribune cover that handily. Also, having hosted segments for <a href="../../../t/e/c/Tech_TV_bfcb.html" title="Tech TV">Tech TV</a> multiple times should establish notability, seeing as <a href="../../../t/e/c/Tech_TV_bfcb.html" title="Tech TV">Tech TV</a> is considered 'notable' enough to have an existing entry in Wikipedia Witchfire 08:12, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think just the fact that at one point I was looking for the article on Wiki makes it viable to make this article stay on Wiki. Added to this, it's the second link given in google for search word&#160;: overclock. The forum has been referred by many sites, and it has a very big userbase. Why would you delete it&#160;? <a href="../../../f/2/0/User%7EF2002yann_45e4.html" title="User:F2002yann">User:F2002yann</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm trying to link the notable sources including Chicago Tribune article(s) but they are archived. I understand the initial Prod for delete but I believe the credible `non-cyber` references, if I can get them linked, as well as the statements made herein from members of the community of Overclock.net clearly fits the Notable clause.</li>

<li><b>Abstain</b> but lean towards <b>delete</b>. I don't see this as an article which is likely to grow into an article meeting wikipedia's standards. Right now most of the facts in the article don't tell us much about the site (for example, that overclock.net got a press mention is great for them, but a mere mention is different from a secondary source which tells us about overclock.net). The article also has severe problems with tone (along the lines of <a href="../../../a/d/v/Template%7EAdvert_8bb0.html" title="Template:Advert">Template:Advert</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>), which could be an argument for <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_89e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup">Wikipedia:Cleanup</a>, but that's going to be hard unless there are more sources to work from than we've seen so far. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingdon_81dc.html" title="User:Kingdon">Kingdon</a> 22:45, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - While the article <i>does</i> mention the website, it is just that, a mention, as the focus is more on modders, not on the forum itself. From what I see, the source would seem to indicate a mention in the <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overclocking.html" title="Overclocking">Overclocking</a> article is merited, not have its own article; the passing mention the article gives does not seem to satisfy the non-triviality portion of the primary notability criterion.

<li><b>Keep</b> (<small>marked as duplicate vote</small>) Your argument Gracenotes, with all due respect, is like claiming Dunkin Donuts belongs in the context of Donut Shops and therefore should only be mentioned in an article on Donut Shops. Doesn't add up. Overclock.net had 3 million page view in January 2007. A year ago it was averaging 206 thousand unique visits a month. IT IS WELL KNOWN TO BE ONE OF THE LEADING OVER-CLOCKING FORUMS if not currently THE leading forum on Overclocking, just as Dunkin Donuts is well known to be a leading Donut shop seller among donut shops. Overclock.net probably receives more visitors than all the Dunkin donuts do in the state of Delaware per month. Ask any donut eater if they've heard of Dunkin donuts, most will say yes. Ask any Computer enthusiast &amp; Overclocker if they've heard of Overclock.net, and they will likely say yes as well. Why? Because Overclock.net is a notable site - especially to the 200+ thousand people who visit it per month. This is well known by some very large online sellers such as Newegg, Tankguys &amp; Easypckits who realize just how notable the forum is, and how valuable and specialized. Perhaps the current article needs upgrading to Wikipedia standards - you have a much better argument there, but in regards to notability, as was mentioned earlier - notability requirements have been met as listed by WP:WEB standards. Jamenta 05:05, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I can tell you for a fact that Overclock.net gets more people than Dunkin' Donuts does in state of California. That has no bearing on the notability of Dunkin' Donuts or anything else. Dunkin' Donuts is notable for being a very large global business that has been around for 60 years that everyone and thier mother writes about. One can't say the same for overclock.net. Please go read <a href="../../../a/a/d/WP%7EAADD_43fd.html" title="WP:AADD">WP:AADD</a>, the number of people that visit isn't an indicator of notability. Expecially when there's nothing to back up that number besides what the site says. This is very, very simple: Find an independent source <i>about the site itself</i>, and then you have a much better case against these guys.

<li><b>Comment</b> Just a note, overclock.net is dedicated more in to performance, rather than simple overclocking. ALthough yes, it's main function is to provide users to refine their overclocking ability, it is a general computer's and electronics reference site. Not only overclocking is discussed, but other ways to enhance performance. Please, keep it. F2002yann</li>

<dd>Wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia. As an encyclopedia, it is then a bunch of other things - 1) not paper 2) one that anybody can edit (until they prove that they can't play well with others or aren't interested in creating an encyclopedia), and others. #1 argues for keeping lots of stuff that your average encyclopedia wouldn't keep. #2 means that we get a lot of stuff that isn't ready for an encyclopedia yet. So we have discussions about where some things fall, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notability guidelines</a> about what we have found in the past to normally be sufficiently noticed to keep an encyclopedia article in good shape.</dd>
<dd>Policy requires that all content be 1) verifi<b>able</b> (not necessarily <a href="../../../c/t/t/WP%7ECTT_ba6c.html" title="WP:CTT">cited</a>, not necessarily online) <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, 2) written from a neutral point of view <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and 3) not original research <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. We've found through experience that what it takes to have an article that complies with policy is a sufficient number of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">reliable sources</a> that are primarily about the article's topic. (They provide a body of data to work from and an indication that we will probably have enough interested editors to keep the article from being hijacked into spam or an attack page.) <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> each indicate some other criteria that we take as indicator variables - if they are present, we are willing to bet that the sources exist. (Like smoke coming from the computer is an indicator of a need to buy a replacement part.) Any website or business is a reliable source when self describing, but maintaing a neutral point of view tends not to be a high priority, so we assume that their publications exist, and focus on looking for other sources. We need reliable publications by independent authors that have the article's topic as the primary subject. These need to be non-trivial, which is a discussable interpretation - directory listings are always trivial, full length books are always non-trivial, and in between we are evaluating the amount of content available for having a good encyclopedia article.</dd>
<dd>As to the village comparison, experience has shown that when someone goes looking, print sources exist. More generally, see the essay <a href="../../../i/n/c/Wikipedia%7EInclusion_is_not_an_indicator_of_notability_abaa.html" title="Wikipedia:Inclusion is not an indicator of notability">Wikipedia:Inclusion is not an indicator of notability</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:44, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - massive meatpuppetry aside, the non-trivial mentions are enough. If it were only one, I would say get rid of it, but several mentions, plus large # of ghits (I know, I shouldn't use those as sole criteria, but they do mean <i>something</i>) seem to indicate some sort of notability. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPart_Deux_5572.html" title="User:Part Deux">Part Deux</a> 11:25, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
