<li>Sure looks like vanity to me. Talking about a group she started in <i>high school</i>?? Come on now. However, if she wins the election, possibly there will be verifiable information about her. Can anyone comment on how important a politician she would be, if she won?

<li><b>Delete</b> for now. Smart young lady with an impressive CV (all the claims in the article are repeated in her bio on the linked site, so I assume we could verify them if we tried), but I'm not sure she's achieved anything that meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> yet. Let's come back in five or ten years when she's started her career properly and see whether there's anything to write about then. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 23:07, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Doubt this is vanity. This is in the news because the current MP recently quit the NDP caucus over her repudiation due to the same sex marriage bill (see <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2005/10/18/desjarlais-independent051018.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2005/10/18/desjarlais-independent051018.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). If she wins, keep her, but for now I suspect she and Desjarlais will split the NDP vote and the Grits or (possibly) Tories will come through. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 23:22, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

She is running for the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_House_of_Commons_f3ab.html" title="Canadian House of Commons">House of Commons</a> for the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Churchill_%28electoral_district%29.html" title="Churchill (electoral district)">Churchill Riding</a> against the incumbent and at least one other. The House of Commons has 308 members - making it similar to the US House of Representatives. The electoral district itself has only 48k voters making it, I believe, one of the smallest districts in Canada. According to our own article, it can take as few as 50 signatures to run for this office. Taken together, those factors indicate to me that merely being a candidate for this office is not sufficient. Niki Ashton is already mentioned (in greater detail) in the section on elections in the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Churchill_%28electoral_district%29.html" title="Churchill (electoral district)">Churchill (electoral district)</a> article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I realize she's up for a serious office. The reason I suspected vanity (and still do) is the mention of some group she started in high school.

<dd>I am not sure if any of the keep votes come from Canadians, but I have to doubt it. The NDP is a national party, but let's be honest: in the VAST majority of ridings, they are no-hopers and should not be considered notable, per WP:BIO or anything else. The notability of this story comes from the same-sex marriage issue and the expulsion of <a href="../../../b/e/v/Bev_Desjarlais_d34d.html" title="Bev Desjarlais">Bev Desjarlais</a> from caucus. Since the Liberals have recruited star candidate <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tina_Keeper_2a04.html" title="Tina Keeper">Tina Keeper</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0444796/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0444796/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (from <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_of_60.html" title="North of 60">North of 60</a> blech), the likelihood of Ms. Ashton's winning, what with Desjarlais committed to stand again, is roughly, although not precisely, nil. A redirect to her father <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Ashton_3339.html" title="Steve Ashton">Steve Ashton</a>, who is a provincial cabinet minister (and which may be related to how she managed to secure nomination form the riding association in the first place), might work if one is really bent on retaining something. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 17:52, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a>. There is so little to go on about her, that people have included such mundane information as her extra-curricular activities while in school and portions of her election platform from her website. If people want to know about that stuff, they can go to her website, rather then wasting an article on her that does nothing more then parrot what she has already said about herself. Perhaps an article listing all the federal ridings in Canada, plus each ridings party candidates coupled with links to their respective campaign websites would be in order. That sounds fair and unbiased for the other party candidates who have achieved the 'noteworthy accomplishment' of winning their nomination bids. <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESub-Arctic_8e51.html" title="User:Sub-Arctic">Sub-Arctic</a> 00:57, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
