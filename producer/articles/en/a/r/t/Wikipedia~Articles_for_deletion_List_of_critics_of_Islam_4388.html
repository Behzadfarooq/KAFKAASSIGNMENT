<dd><b>Addendum</b>: I guess my original motivation for submitting this article was a bit brief - but to me it seemed like a clear-cut case that only needed a brief notice, but obviously it does need some more explanation:</dd>
<dd>While this list may be "interesting" and "timely", that alone does not justify inclusion here. The main hurdles it has to overcome are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No Original Research</a>.
<ul>
<li>Verifiability: Classifying a person as a critic is very hard to prove. First of all, what is a "critic"? Does he have to reject Islam altogether? Does he have to <i>hate</i> it? Or is it enough to just be dissatisfied with certain aspects? Then - even if a clear definition could be agreed upon, how will inclusion in this list be determined? A brief quote might be helpful, but what if it's taken out of context? What if that person later changed his mind? What if the person approves <i>some</i> parts of Islam, but rejects <i>other</i> parts? Which gets us to the next hurdle:</li>
<li>No Original Research: Who will decide who fits the criteria of being a critic? The WP editors? That will be a lot of judgement calls to make, and will probably only end up in an edit war. Islam-opponents will try to classify <i>everybody</i> as a critic, and Islam-proponents will try their best to achieve the opposite. Unless we have a third-party source that did the classification already, these are too fundamental a judgement to make for editors.</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> No criteria for inclusion, and I can't see one that wouldn't be original research. However, a category can work, as the guidance on assigning categories is to keep the number minimal and to use only the ones most associated with the subject - so the only people in it would be those highly known for criticizing Islam as a major portion of their (encyclopedically relevant) life work. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:59, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Lowered (to the extent it matters) my opinion to Weak Delete. The List has improved since nomination by addition of reasons some are deemed critical. This material would not be replicable in a category. There seems, however, to be no coherent criteria for inclusion yet, so that concern still needs to be addressed.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> because this list is worthless unless we attempt to define critical first. Just about every Muslim scholar has had a problem with something the academic community would call Islamic. Amina Wadud doesn't like many salafi tendencies Ibn Wahhab doesn't like Sufis. They are all critics in some sense. We could narrow this down to non-Muslim critics but then we have to figure out who is Muslim and who isn't--which, I think we should be able to agree that self-identification is the important aspect but it will inevitably lead to vandalism with people removing Amina Wadud and Rashid Khalifa because they "aren't Muslims". As it stands now this list is completely anecdotal. Does it matter that Dante had a few lines critical of Islam? It seems to me that's about the same as putting Mel Gibson into critics of Judaism. I think we should agree that critics applies to people who have made actually critically studied Islam. Wansbrough and Crone (as far as I know) don't get into moral judgments about Islam but they question the typical assumptions of Qur'anic origins. The main issue we need to deal with is Muslim critics of various aspects within Islam. To call them "reformers" is rather aggrandizing and just about every Muslims author I can think of fits this category in some way. How do we deal with that? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 11:44, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I could be misunderstanding those who worked in it, but I think this list means people who are critical of Islam in any form rather than a particular element of it. The most obvious being people who think the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> are morally repugnant, but I imagine it could also mean something less severe. Like people who feel that the Qur'an and the basis of Islam is based on false notions or write about why they feel Islam is inferior to other religious or philosophical positions. Some of this could dovetail into general critics of religion, but I think they're wanting people known for focussing on Islam. (Or if not they should want names of people who focussed their harshest criticism on Islam)--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<li><b>Weak provisional keep</b>. The nominator's argument for deletion is essentially "oh no, there could be a content dispute about inclusion", which is unpersuasive. This is one of the few lists that could be a valuable encyclopedic resource. But the article as it stands - just a list of names without comment - is very unhelpful and reeks of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. I'd support deleting it in a later AfD unless all entries are individually referenced and sourced, e.g. "<a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Schmoe_cfb1.html" title="Joe Schmoe">Joe Schmoevich</a> - Bozarkian Member of Parliament who sponsored a bill in 1985 to outlaw the sale of the Koran, source: Bozarkian Chronicle of 12 June 1985". <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 17:16, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It pretty sad how even here the contributions are done clearly in accordance to the "party-line".<br />
The <i>pro-Islamists</i> would like nothing more than having this list disappear as quickly as possible, and the <i>anti-Islamists</i> (as well as, of course, the authors/contributors) are vehemently against its deletion. And, just like in the articles, arguments are twisted to suit each one's purpose...<br />
One positive surprise that came out of this though, was the discovery that there <i>are</i> some truly independent and neutral editors out there, who aren't attached to <i>any</i> fixed POV, and who work to defend WP, not their own propaganda. Perhaps there <i>is</i> still hope...;) --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrescard_9f22.html" title="User:Frescard">Frescard</a> 20:58, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't quite see what the fact that the list was started by a Muslim has to do with anything. Perhaps the original motivation behind creating this list was different from its current use. But I'm talking about <i>now</i>. And if you look at the contributions of the voters there is a 100% correlation between their attitude towards Islam and how they voted.<br />
Of course, as I said, there are <i>some</i> editors where it's impossible to tell from their history what their personal POV is. <i>That's</i> how it should be. But as soon as an editor's contributions and votes become predictable, he has most likely become an opinion pusher. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrescard_9f22.html" title="User:Frescard">Frescard</a> 06:19, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My concern is not really whether reformist Muslims are critics of Islam or not. It is that whether a consensus would be possible in which one is considered a critic of Islam if he/she identified himself/herself clearly and unambiguously as critics of Islam as a whole (rather than being critics of certain practices or traditions). I don't think so, since this would mean that almost all of the people listed there should go away. --<a href="../../../r/e/z/User%7EReza1_9735.html" title="User:Reza1">Reza1</a> 01:44, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> per norm. I would have supported this article if there was a definitive criteria for considering someone a "critic" --<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirbytime_cc43.html" title="User:Kirbytime"><font color="red">Ķĩřβȳ</font></a><a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam"><font color="green">♥</font></a><a href="../../../k/i/r/User_talk%7EKirbytime_d8cd.html" title="User talk:Kirbytime"><font color="pink">Ťįɱé</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kirbytime_b7f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kirbytime"><font color="blue">Ø</font></a> 01:58, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. If particular editors are having trouble acertaining what constitutes a "critic", that's a problem with the editors in question, and not with the article concept itself.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike18xx_f1c0.html" title="User:Mike18xx">Mike18xx</a> 02:18, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
