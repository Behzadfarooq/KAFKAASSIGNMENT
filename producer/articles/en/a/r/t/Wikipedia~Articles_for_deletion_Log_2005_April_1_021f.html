<li><b>Keep</b>, but it sure needs work. I would bet that this term is a neoligism of sorts; the notion that knowledge is required to bridge disparate semantic systems of differing granularities is long established in the areas of linguistics and information science, though I don't know the specific jargon used in those disciplines for this concept. As an informatics scientist, I tend to refer to this as the "semantic mapping problem", which rears it's head practically every time you want to have two databases communicate with one another or two datasources of different origins but overlapping content reside in the same queriable space. <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> 05:50, 2005 Apr 6 (UTC)</li>

<li>The ball is (at least occasionally) kicked in every kind of football.

<li><b>Delete</b>, unnecessary. Football already has an existing dab page. I don't think a redirect is necessary - I can't imagine anyone bothering to type in "Football (disambiguation)" just to find "Football". <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 13:27, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That's probably because in those cases (a) the disambiguation article was merged into the top article, and thus has to exist as a redirect to satisfy the GFDL; (b) the disambiguation page was moved (back) to the top article and the resultant redirect simply not deleted; or (c) the other pages use the {{otheruses}} template, which doesn't work with equal weight (type 2) <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">disambiguations</a> without such a trick being employed.

<li>It's a pointless disambiguation page that nothing links to (apart from some 2003 talk pages where this idea was mooted and rejected) and that no-one will use. <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">Football</a> <i>already is</i> the disambiguation. The 2003 talk page arguments on this very subject (<a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_footballers_%28archive_1%29_4832.html" title="Talk:List of footballers (archive 1)">Talk:List of footballers (archive 1)</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_footballers_%28soccer%29_%28archive_2%29_7167.html" title="Talk:List of footballers (soccer) (archive 2)">Talk:List of footballers (soccer) (archive 2)</a>) are worth reading, as is the name change discussion at <a href="../../../f/o/o/Talk%7EFootball_91b5.html" title="Talk:Football">Talk:Football</a>; and the resulting development of <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">Football</a> over the intervening two years indicates a clear consensus. No merge is required. No redirect is required, except perhaps to stop someone doing this in another 2 years' time, which is unlikely given that the dangling redlinks only exist in archived talk pages, there's plenty of prior talk page discussion on the subject, and a disambiguation structure <i>is already in place</i>. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:58, 2005 Apr 1 (UTC)

<li>This page was only created on March 29 2005, long after the consensus on <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">Football</a> had been reached, and despite the existing disambiguation page as you outlined; it has been plainly demonstrated that in the absence of anything, a user can create this page despite the existing consensus.

<p>I've proposed this article for deletion on two grounds. One, it duplicates the entry on <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boudicca.html" title="Boudicca">Boudicca</a>, and two, although the identification of the battle site as <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watling_Street_4797.html" title="Watling Street">Watling Street</a> seems likely, it's conjecture. I've never heard Boudicca's last stand refered to as the "Battle of Watling Street" before, so I can't imagine anyone looking for information on it would look it up under that title. If there's a good reason keeping this entry and not, say, expanding the report of the battle under Boudicca, please speak up. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicknack009_6084.html" title="User:Nicknack009">Nicknack009</a> 08:50, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>So... this page was created by a rather angry user after a dispute at <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-semitism.html" title="Anti-semitism">Anti-semitism</a> over citations and such. The article essentially says nothing and I doubt there is sufficient material for it to stand alone rather than just as a sub-part of the primary anti-semitism page (I'm willing to be proven wrong here, but I doubt I will be). Also appears to be in violation of the proposed <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_8268.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point</a> policy (which, while still merely proposed claims to have support of AbCom members). See the edit history, especially the first post, to see this. In short, this article isn't doing Wikipedia any good.

I am really angry not so that I created the article, but at the reaction that this article has received or the idea that this article is just to prove a point and that it is not about a real phenoma. I think its sick and sad that people would rather be ignorant to face up to a real phenomon which is very likely at the heart of the whole <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-semitism.html" title="Anti-semitism">anti-semitism</a> issue. In fact I am so disenchanted that I may delete my wikipedia account permanently. I feel that I have been treated worse than a vandal for my contribution and research that I did as a favour to this community and is totally unappreciated. Don't expect me to shed any tears of the Jews or other groups come to suffer because they choose to turn a blind eye to the real value of this article that I wrote very much for their benefit on many levels. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> 01:51, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b>If this is a real phenomenon and as you say "very likely at the heart of the whole anti-semitism issue" then there should be an abundance of citations you could provide for people expressing this view <i>which is all the community requested of you to begin with</i>. I see that you have now provided a link on this page up for deletion, but the thoughts of just one speaker do not show evidence for your case that it is at the heart of the issue. Does a discussion of this merit inclusion? Probably, yes, but <i>with appropriate citation</i>. The proper way to work with other editors is to discuss controvertial edits in talk and come to consensus, not to create new pages with disputed content because it was rejected by other editors on an established page. That the other editors disagreed that there was sufficient evidence to present your views on the subject as factual does not mean that they are persecuting you as if you were a vandal, just that they are doing what they think best to preserve the factual integrity of Wikipedia. Again: Should Wikipedia say "Some people think Antisemitism has to do with circumsision" with some links to several people and groups that claim that? Yes. Should it state that or any other greater claim without evidence? No. Learn to work with the community, not to create POV-based forks because you're upset over other editor's views on the evidentiary-support of your claim. -<a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocratesJedi_4545.html" title="User:SocratesJedi">SocratesJedi</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/c/User_talk%7ESocratesJedi_9c57.html" title="User talk:SocratesJedi">Talk</a> 02:30, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I have posted two long comments on the article talk page, going over two different versions of the article in detail, and explaining why every single sentence should be deleted. The article is really a personal essay by a contributor who explicitly wants to use Wikipedia as a soapbox, and it comes dangerously close to being anti-Semitic (the contributor's justification for the article is anti-Semitic). It addresses something that is at best a minor interest of a small number of people, and it has no scholarly sources (for scholarly claims) and no scholarly validity. <i>On this very page</i> the creator of this so-called article writes "<b>Don't expect me to shed any tears of the Jews or other groups come to suffer because they choose to turn a blind eye to the real value of this article that I wrote very much for their benefit</b>" â the kind of sentence, simultaneously patronizing, contemptuous, and threatening, that <i>exemplifies</i> a major form of anti-Semitism. It is arrogant for someone who is fundamentally ignorant to think that an entire race of people needs his help, and the veiled threat that Jews will suffer for ignoring him only reveals the hatred at the core of his heart. It is offensive. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 21:29, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Okay, lets go with the hypothesis that I am anti-semitic? Does this beg an interesting question? Why? Can you give me a non-religious answer to this question does that not involve the Jews and other groups insistence on circumcision as the source of this hatred? If circumcision has made me anti-semitic as you suggest than expalin how it can be that there is no need for this article? And if I am anti-semitic for a non-circumcision related reason, how can it be that I am focused on the circumcision issue when the result of this communities analysis of this issue is that "real" anti-semits do not use this argument: If they did, another good reason for this article. So how can it be that I am antisemitic? And how is the wish to help a race of people arrogant and in what way am I ignorant? Is it not you that is ignorant to the fact that circumcision is sexual assualt? Is it not you that is the blind to the fact that it is causing greif to this society in so many ways? Is it not you that are discouraging anyone from doing any real work on the anti-semitism issue by giving very hurting accusations? And why is it my responsibility to not be patronizing, contemptuous or threatening when that all I recieve from other people. I cannot give what I haven't receieved? Do you think I was somehow born with hatred in my heart? Is that the best explaination you can give for me? You don't know me and you don't know what you are talking about. Not one person has every acknowledged that I am part of a whole society, culture and religious ideology that promotes sexual anorexia and as a result I am a victim of sexual abuse. What right do you have to say those things about me? <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> 03:53, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I've explained gently to the original author why such an article is offensive; "simultaneously patronizing, contemptuous, and threatening" as you say, but that explanation unfortunately didn't seem to register.

<dd>Yes, Fire Star. Sirkumsize -- I never daid that you were anti-Semitic <i>because</i> of circumicision. I have given no reason for "why" you are anti-Semitic. I do not care. That you are anti-Semitic is your problem, and not mine. If you do not want to be anti-Semitic, then you are the one who must figure out why and how you became that way. But I can give you this piece of advice -- if the reason you became anti-Semitic has anything to do with Jews or Jewish practice, then you have not discovered the reason (for the reason lies within you), you have only reenforced your own anti-Semitism. Circumcision is not sexual abuse. You do not understand why Jews circumcise their sons. If you want to know why, I suggest you read <i>Carnal Israel</i> by Daniel Boyarin. But even if after learning why Jews circumcise themselves, you still think it is wrong -- well, who cares? We think it is right, and that is all that matters. You write "why is it my responsibility to not be patronizing, contemptuous or threatening?" But I never said it is your responsibility not to be these things. All I said is that you are, which is indication of your anti-Semitism. Whether it is your responsibility to change is entirely up to you. As to your own victimization -- I cannot speak to that. I do not know you or anything about you, and Wikipedia is not dedicated to exploring individuals' personal trauma -- it is an encyclopedia, not a computerized psychoanalyst. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 18:00, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Once again a person that charges me with arrogants thinks they know more about me than I know about myself. I am not anti-semitic. If you read my last message you will see that I say let go with the "hypothesis" that I am. Only I know what I am. As for the reasons that Jews circumcise it does not matter to me anymore than whether or not Jews advocate circumcising Christians. I see circumcision as abuse and I do not want it to happen to anyone, Muslim, Christian, Hindu, Jew. It is about the rights of the child. If I have to live in a society where I can spend my life in prison for having a photograph of a 10 year old playing naked on the beach, I don't want to live in that society along with people that commit serious sexual abuse with impunity. I have to live with laws that I may not like because they are the majority rule. Why is it fair to me if the Jews do not have to live up to the same standard - or the Muslims, or any other group. The direction that my research for this site is very disturbing. I'm running across article after article implying academic bias in favour of circumcision because of professionals and organizations that fear the accusation of anti-semitism or bias against other circumcising cultures. How can parents make informed decisions on behalf of their children if this information is distorted? By deleting this article all of you endorse this bias and its your sons that will have to pay the price.

<dd>I have to agree with <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a>, and tried a different approach with the original author. It should be noted that I am the sole author (not <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a>) of the current version, which I rewrote because the then-current version didn't even accurately reflect its cited sources. Even though I wrote it, though, it's still not worth keeping. At best, a sentence should be added to the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genital_Integrity_1e09.html" title="Genital Integrity">Genital Integrity</a> page reflecting the insistence of anti-circ folk that they are opposing the procedure and not anti-Semitic. From what I could gather though, it's not even worth mentioning on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a> because the anti-Semites don't even use it that much to attack Jews and Judaism.

<li><b>Comment</b>. "If she changes her mind I'll change my vote", "if Angela wants it gone", "not fair to keep it if she doesn't want it". Not fair to Wikipedia to use that kind of argument.

I certainly wouldn't do anything <i>solely</i> on what Angela wanted, though; I hope you all mean "if Angela doesn't want it throw it away, because it's not notable enough to begin with", not "we delete personal articles of Foundation members if they want us to".

<li>This has many signs of a prank. The article was originally created by a probable sockpuppet from the same IP as a known vandal. The subject is self-referential to Wikipedia. It was created on April Fool's Day. The article has since been cleaned up but we would not keep a random business person of the same stature from some other corporation. Angela has taught me a lot and been a wonderful influence. One of the things she taught me is that we have standards for a reason. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 04:17, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. As written, the article is not encyclopedic, and despite Angela's many contributions to Wikipedia she thus far does not have the sort of public presence that would justify even a comprehensive and well-written article.

<li><b>Keep/Comment</b> I think this VFD brings up a larger question about wikipedia then just this article.

But how much should the fact that Angela herself wants it deleted account for? Ie. how much respect for an article subjects wishes should wikipedia have? Is there some policy on this?

<li>(Comments): [1] I think we need to establish consistent rules here. Have a look at the Category:Wikipedians with article "Wikipedians with article" category (linked at the bottom of this page) and think for yourselves how many of the names WE, let alone the public, would recognize. There's an article (self-promotional, in my opinion) on <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonja_Elen_Kisa_8914.html" title="Sonja Elen Kisa">Sonja Elen Kisa</a>. Who's she? If she's here, why not Angela? At least Angela has a public presence outside of Wikipedia (i.e., on CNN and the BBC). [2] I really like Angela as a person, and in normal circumstances would comply with her wishes. To do so this time, however, would create a precedent which would not, in my view, be helpful. If Angela can ask for her bio to be nuked, why not Queen Elizabeth, George W. Bush, or Osama bin Laden? (I'm not saying these individuals would make any such request, I'm just making a point). The credibility of Wikipedia would be seriously undermined if we had people asking for their biographies, or for information they do not want published, to be deleted. If we're going to take a stand against articles being deleted at the whim of their subject, let's not make any exception, not even for someone who considers herself "non-notable." (Please don't take this personally, Angela. This is only a matter of principle). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 22:25, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay, I believe Aranae that this is a genuine discovery. Yesterday Google found zero hits for either "Fruitafossor" or "Windscheffel", now the story is in dozens of news sites.

<li>Excuse me, but I think that's a mistake. I just registered a few days ago, and this is one of my first articles. Another thing is that I can <b>spot</b> hoaxes but I can't <b>create</b> them. I'm a very concrete person, see. I think someone better clear this matter up. I testify that this is my one and only account in Wikipedia. I really wonder how you get these ideas. Have you ever heard of a thing called <b>coincidence</b>? Personally, I think it's all nonsense, but repeated occasions have led me to believe that it's possible. I would have thought that you would be a bit nicer to newcomers, after all, I was only doing my business. And now, you have the gall to include me in this vandalism business. Shame on you.

<li>I just want to ask if you're always like this to newcomers. I mean, a newbie writes something, the oldies pounce on him and try to delete his article, and in the end, when it's verified, the very same person who accused him doesn't give him credit, and even ties him up to an master hoax creator of some sort, thus damaging his reputation further. Because if you are like this, then Wikipedia is a whole lot of ****.

<li>Well that's funny, because my Concise Oxford Dictionary defines <b>knowledge</b> as <i>1. awareness or familiarity gained by experience, 2. a person's range of information, 2a. a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject, 2b the sum of what is known, and 3. certain understanding as opposed to opinion</i> - while <b>information</b> is defuined as <i>1a. something told; knowledge, 1b. items of knowledge</i> - so it seems that the personal distinction you make between "knowledge" and information" doesn't really accord with extablished definitions.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 23:30, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not all schools are automatically notable. "More than half the school's students speak English as a second language" is a bit unusual but certainly not unique for an urban school in a big city. No evidence presented that this is more than an average school. Based on their test scores (page 4 of the pdf link), they're below average. And I'll go back to the argument about numbers for why we can't defend articles on every little school article from vandalism. We must make choices. I do not believe this makes the cut. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 04:37, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm beginning to think a) many people have too high of expectations for fast enhancement of articles and b) many people believe a place is not important unless someone important is associated with it, and that because almost noone (%-wise) is important enough to be encyclopedic almost no places (%-wise) are important enough for inclusion. I've seen enough vicious elitist sniping to turn my stomach in the past few hours on here and this just happens to be the crust that broke my tooth and made me say 'enough already!'. It's sooo much easier to tear down than to construct, and many of you (yes, getting personal here) are so darned self-satisfied about how much "junk" you've cut out that you fail to think critically any more; it's just delete this - it's cruft, toss that - it's silly, can that - it's pointless.

<dd>Please re-read <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_perfect_stub_article_271a.html" title="Wikipedia:The perfect stub article">the perfect stub</a>. Stubs are supposed to be <i>short-term.</i> People who just <i>want</i> an article and don't plan to do much serious work on it should make it a <i>requested article,</i> not drop in a stub. <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_perfect_stub_article_271a.html" title="Wikipedia:The perfect stub article">the perfect stub</a> makes the following points:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>the value of a stub is primarily in what it will become.</li>
<li>"Don't assume that additions and improvements will immediately pour in of themselves" (some school inclusionists <b>do</b> seem to assume this);</li>
<li>The time frame cited is "a few weeks," as in "If nobody contributes to your stub for a few weeks, roll up your sleeves and expand it yourself."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>People who just drop in a stub and never come back to do more work on it are being irresponsible. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:39, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>
<ul>
<li>It's ironic that you should endeavor to educate me on the role of stubs and their "life cycle"; I've been part of the stub-sorting Project and the ref and fact checking Project for a while now. As usual, there are disagreements on the role of stubs ... and the role of articles in general, in fact. <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> 17:21, 2005 Apr 6 (UTC)</li>

</dd>
<dd>The improvements might not just roll in like a tidal wave, but some of us school-inclusionists do more than just vote; I can see that, on this page, <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/c/User%7EYuckfoo_5ab6.html" title="User:Yuckfoo">Yuckfoo</a>, GRider and <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">myself</a> have progressively been improving it.

I hate Phish, and know very little about them, so if this song is particluarly noteworthy it would be nice if this little stub explained why.

<dd><i>So, in case you genuinely don't understand, and not just playing dumb</i> I've noticed that bad writers often try to shift the blame for the confusion, ambiguity, and mystery they cause by insulting their readers. But you wouldn't know about that, would you?</dd>
<dd><i>Do you understand how this is can be interpreted as malice?</i> Sure -- if you <i>start off</i> assuming malice.</dd>
<dd>Quitting in disgust and coming back is proof of what? Well, that he got over it. If this is suspicious behaviour, I'll work up a (long) list for you of shady characters for you to watch, including <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">User:Ta bu shi da yu</a></dd>
<dd>I like the reasoning, though: he's nominating this for deletion for a <s>third</s> fourth time because he has a vendetta. The proof he has a vendetta? The fact that he's nominating it for a third time. Why is he nominating it for a <s>third</s> fourth time? Because he has a vendetta. Rinse, lather, repeat.</dd>
<dd>And the fact that he nominated this and not others proves what, exactly? It's a slight variation of the bogus rationale offered by hundreds of voters in past AfDs: namely, the whine "if the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a>/one-horse town/trivial-in-my-opinion-subject article stays, so should mine": the appropriateness of this nomination has bugger all to do with other lack of nominations. If this (in your view) double standard upsets you, give me a list of other candidate articles, those running on the No-Hope Party ticket in the Riding of BFN that, gosh darn it, Spinboy <i>should</i> have nominated for deletion and I'll do the job myself: I've got some time to kill right and I can get right on it. Though be quick, I'm leaving in half-an-hour.</dd>
<dd>Maybe Spinboy has nominated this article for deletion because he thinks Neufeld doesn't rate an encyclopedia article? Yes, standards in an encyclopedia -- that's just crazy talk! As far as I'm concerned, if Mr. Neufeld wants free publicity for himself, he ought to check out MySpace or Geocities.</dd>

<li>It's obvious that I disagree with that view. I think that folks with direct knowledge of a subject should be contributing to the articles here. I'd see a serious problem if they were the only ones working on the articles, but the presence of "many eyes" on Wikipedia balances off any POV issues that such contributors may create. I've contributed to a lot of articles on Wikipedia where I'm not "at arms length" (such as the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Party_of_Alberta_41f1.html" title="Green Party of Alberta">Green Party of Alberta</a>), and provided detailed references when questions have been raised (such as <a href="../../../g/r/a/Talk%7EGrant_Neufeld_d6b9.html#Documenting_References_-_Not_Original_Research" title="Talk:Grant Neufeld">on the article</a> being debated here). In any case, the previous two votes on this article have not found my auto-biographical contributions to be sufficient cause for deletion. As to the imposibility of auto-biographical NPOV, I encourage you to review the comments from Earl Andrew, Kevintoronto and gord on <a href="../../../g/r/a/Talk%7EGrant_Neufeld_d6b9.html" title="Talk:Grant Neufeld">the article's talk page</a> as counterpoints to that view. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrantNeufeld_99cc.html" title="User:GrantNeufeld">GrantNeufeld</a> 07:04, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> That is because there is no such policy. In fact during the recent debacle regarding Mr. Seigenthaler many people were critical of him because he did not simply change the innaccuracy himself and instead made a big deal out of it. It seems people desire to have it both ways on the autobiographical issue.

<li><b>Keep</b>, <i>President of Alberta Greens, candidate in Alberta general election, 2004) and founder (in 2000) of the first Revolutionary Knitting Circle (now an international activist movement).</i> are claims which make this individual notable in my view. People are allowed to edit articles about themselves as long as they remain neutral and while starting your own article is frowned upon, there's nothing forbidding you to do so. Anyway, neither of these are reason to delete an article. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:41, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. That this has survived earlier discussion is astonishing: execrable self-promoting vanity page of an insignificant that heavily exaggerates asserted notbaility. The organisation which the subject has founded, <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutionary_Knitting_Circle_04d7.html" title="Revolutionary Knitting Circle">Revolutionary Knitting Circle</a> should also be brought to AfD as inherently unnotable as well. Perhaps other Canadians here can chime in on having heard of it or not, but so far my running tally is 0. I find maclean's suggestion that this is a bad faith nomination hard to fathom. A badly self-authored page that is nothing more than a funnel for an out-of-control ego should not be on WP; bringing it up for nomination is a perfectly good thing to do. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 12:49, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Jim Harris isn't the president of the party either. Perhaps you misunderstand Canadian political party structures. "President" is a position within the political party's <i>internal</i> structure, who's responsible for running the organization.

<li><b>Keep'</b> I don't see it as POV (although it is a bit heavy on the vanity front). I also think that the repeated nominations for deletion will eventually cause it to be deleted, if only because the ones seeking to have it deleted will keep coming back, but the people voting keep will eventually move on assuming that once the vote was settled, it was settled. I don't see how an article can be nominated for deletion after passing an AfD vote and the article not changing significantly.

<li>I have revised the article to remove the vanity aspect and make it more encyclopedic. In previous communications that I have had with Grant Neufeld, he has indicated that he understands and accepts that other editors will revise the article. This is no longer a "vanity article". As far as future attempts to delete this, if this attempt fails, it will be clear that future attempts will be bad faith nominations. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 16:33, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Mildly notable politician. The last AFD was a keep, and the precident stands. The only time a keep should be overturned, is if it was based on information that turned out to be false and/or unverifiable; or else if there was some kind of failure in process. The nominator shouldn't just keep redoing AFD's till they get what they want. Far to many articles and AFDs go without attention, because AFDs are clogged with these unfounded nominations. Note: if this article hadn't survived a prior AFD, it would have been entirely justified to nominate as this is a "week keep" level person. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 16:17, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Tentative Keep</b>. I sharply disagree with the presumption made in this nomination. Surnames that are shared by a significant number of people and that derive from a historical basis are inherently notable. My vote in this case is tentative because I do not know the popularity of this surname, which only gets about 9,000 google hits compared with over 70 million for Johnson, 5.4 million for Lorenzo, over 3 million for Alvarez, and over 2.2 million for Callahan. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">gab</font></sup></a> 22:20, 2005 Apr 1 (UTC)

<li>Upon further research, I concede that this article refers to a surname that lacks notability, and change my vote to <b>delete</b> - however, I maintain that any surname reaching into the hundreds of thousands is notable and encyclopedic. Also, I'd point out that an article on a single surname can cover many smaller branches (e.g. Smith, which also covers Smithson, Smythe, Schmidt, Goldsmith, etc.). If Melheim is one of many branches of a more popular surname, I'll write an article on that surname and note this as a branch. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">gab</font></sup></a> 04:05, 2005 Apr 5 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An article on Norwegian onomastics (which would be completely legitimate) could include more on what I mentioned above (on this being a common type of name). It <i>could</i> obviously use Melheim as an example, except that it is a non-notable one; I am sure better known names of the same type could be dug up to examplify. Generally speaking, the origin of <i>many</i> names is self-explanatory: Abramson for instance, presumably comes from some ancestor named <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham.html" title="Abraham">Abra[ha]m</a> and would be more suitable as one example in an article on surnames derived from <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patronymic.html" title="Patronymic">patronymics</a>, rather than as object of an article in itself. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 05:21, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Avram the grocer, actually - in Tsibili, about 300 years ago - which then became Avramovitch, and then Avramovitz before turning into Abramson when they got to the other side of the Atlantic. I note, however, that even patronymics have a history, since the father's name must have originated from somewhere (and even Biblical names have prior etymology). But I agree that a general article would cover it, and would suggest a single article pointing out all the name variations that derive from words identifying a farm. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">gab</font></sup></a> 08:09, 2005 Apr 6 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's easy for those who are not involved in gambling, casino protection, cheating, advantage play, sleight of hand etc. to say the entry is a matter of vanity, but then again, those who don't know about the subject shouldn't have a say anyway. The reality is that to those who are familiar with the subject Steve Forte is a legend. That having been said, the statement that he is without a doubt the best, could be an exaggeration or argued due to the broad subject matter involved. Thus, the page should be expanded, but also revised slightly in order to better reflect reality. A statement such as "he is definately one of the best in the world" would be more appropriate and very true.
<ul>
<li>Even though an anon vote, isn't given much weight. I urge the admins to consider this vote.

Also, this info will date quickly, and I'm sure we can't count on it being updated. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:35, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Scott Haggerty is a twice relected supervisor in one of the most populous (2002 pop. 1,444,656) and fast growing counties in California. This is noteworthy.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. In his favor, Scott has 11 unique hits in Google news. If one or two had been about him, I would have made a case to keep.
