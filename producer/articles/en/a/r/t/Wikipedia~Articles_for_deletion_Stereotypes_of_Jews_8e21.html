<li><b>Delete contents but Keep page</b> I apologize to everyone who took offense from this page. I didn't create it as an attack page, nor do I endorse or take responsibility for the contents. I agree that the contents are extremely problematic and subjective, and I do not agree with them. It was simply copy/pasted directly from the article <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_stereotypes_in_American_media_08be.html" title="Ethnic stereotypes in American media">Ethnic stereotypes in American media</a>, where it has a subheading (I was making independent articles for all the subheadings in the article). I was hoping to create a page where portrayals of Jews in media, literature, news, society (etc). could be explored in a thorough and scholarly way, and where all the pages like <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_american_princess.html" title="Jewish american princess">jewish american princess</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_mother_stereotype.html" title="Jewish mother stereotype">jewish mother stereotype</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nice_Jewish_boy_45a9.html" title="Nice Jewish boy">Nice Jewish boy</a> (etc.) could be organized and/or linked to in one place. Would it be possible instead to keep this page as a placeholder but delete all the contents, leaving only links to related articles until better content can be created? Thanks. --<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrenched_2204.html" title="User:Drenched">Drenched</a> 21:36, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> No, this is technically impossible. What would be the point? Anyone can create an article with any name at any time, so there is no difference between having a "placeholder" and not having an article at all. —<a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaesura_ad40.html" title="User:Caesura">Caesura</a><a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaesura_b24c.html" title="User talk:Caesura"><sup>(t)</sup></a> 21:52, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Addendum:</b> I know this article will probably get deleted anyway, but here are some examples of more developed comparable sites (although these are also flawed and need a lot of work too) for a better idea of where this was going: <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotypes_of_Asians_417e.html" title="Stereotypes of Asians">Stereotypes of Asians</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotypes_of_Africans_Blacks_f7fc.html" title="Stereotypes of Africans/Blacks">Stereotypes of Africans/Blacks</a> --<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrenched_2204.html" title="User:Drenched">Drenched</a> 01:11, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> the current content as original research, but keep in mind as a good topic for an article someday. As per the talk page, this was a cut and paste from <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_stereotypes_in_American_media_08be.html" title="Ethnic stereotypes in American media">Ethnic stereotypes in American media</a>. That page has an original research/unverified warning box at the top for a while. It's had cleanup/NPOV/NOR problems for a while, and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ethnic_stereotypes_in_American_media_8c0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ethnic stereotypes in American media">survived an AFD</a> that closed July 6th. There was a <a href="../../../e/t/h/Talk%7EEthnic_stereotypes_in_American_media_023a.html#Splitting_the_article" title="Talk:Ethnic stereotypes in American media">short discussion</a> on its talk page with low participation about splitting, and this is one of seven split pages that were started. I think the nominator should have read those explanations before nominating. (Timestamps show they were already there.) Had that been done, the nomination would have been worded differently. Splitting was also suggested by at least one contributor to the AFD of the originating article. As that AFD concluded, stereotypes can be a worthy subject for an encyclopedia article. This content is using "<a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotype.html" title="Stereotype">stereotype</a>" primarily in its use as "a form of dramatic shorthand for '<a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_character.html" title="Stock character">stock character</a>'." Natural given where the text came from, but not what we expect to see first. I conclude that it is <i><b>not</b></i> an attack page. It is original research, and not the topic people expect to be seeing under this title. I haven't looked at the other six pages split out to know what should be done with them, someone with time on their hands could go do that. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 21:56, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b>, this really does qualify for <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> at the moment, and the current content should be wiped away. However, I find it hard to believe that there aren't neutral, well-conducted studies and articles on this topic that could be referenced in a good WP article. I only vote "delete" because I think the page, as Drenched's intentions indicate, would be better-handled under another title (perhaps "Jewish Stereotypes in American Media" or something of the like, if it doesn't already exist). It would be a POV magnet to be sure, but it's still a valid subject of interest, and what is Wikipedia <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">if not bold?</a> -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 23:39, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> without prejudice against a sourced, neutral article. Good idea, poor execution this time around. Usually I'd say just to stub it and take out all the problem material, but that might just encourage malicious reverts. -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 17:13, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Question: What does it mean to userfy an article? I think stubbing it and removing the current contents minus the intro explanation &amp; links might be a good idea. Of course, people might vandalize the article or just add their own POV/OR content to it (which will always be a problem for any article about a topic of this nature), but it would also give actual scholars a place to add valid researched content as well. I don't think there would be any malicious reverts though; I certainly wouldn't revert it (and at the moment it looks like no one else has contributed to actual content of this article), and the original authors of this content from the mother page are probably fully aware of OR/citing sources problems. Also, if you look at the original page <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_stereotypes_in_American_media_08be.html" title="Ethnic stereotypes in American media">Ethnic stereotypes in American media</a>, you'll see in the introduction paragraph that people were writing about stereotypes with a tone of exposing racial stereotyping in the media, rather than one of maliciously attacking each of the ethnicities, so I doubt anyone would revert an article that sounds racist out of context. --<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrenched_2204.html" title="User:Drenched">Drenched</a> 17:37, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Userfying just means that the artcle's contens were transferred to your userspace, as they will likely be deleted from mainspace. I userfied the contents as a good faith effort that you'll try to address the issue from a scholarly and NPOV perspective. <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 22:23, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay. Thanks for the good faith effort, but there's no need to keep this page in my userspace if you all want to delete it. I am not very invested in this page; like I said before, I have nothing to do with the contents; I just happen to be the person moving preexisting content, and I have no intention of personally researching this topic further to create scholarly content. I do think that the topic itself is valid and researchable and should have its own article, but I have no interest in writing it. So if you all want to delete it and not have an article until someone comes up with scholarly content, that's fine with me. That being said, can someone please tell me how to delete things from my userspace? --<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrenched_2204.html" title="User:Drenched">Drenched</a> 22:43, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
