<li>First problem I have with this article is that the current incarnation is not an encyclopdic article, it is a blub about the blog and then some random poem. Not a deletable offense, but poorly written. Looking back at the history, it was more POV to start. Again, not a deletable offense... just a bad article. I'm not convinced this is vanity per se as it looks like others edited and added some of the material. It is however an article about a blog. It's not notable in the least and that is deletable in my book. There is no good reason that a blog by a physicist of dubious notability needs it's own wiki entry. It's already listed on his wiki page; no reason to spam wikipedia with more useless blog articles. <b>Delete</b>.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:19, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hi, please note Guardian article link was added by me (Nigel Cook), because the article said "YOU CAN HELP BY EXPANDING THIS STUB" or some such. Just trying to help!!! Since I've already been suppressed by Wikipedia on the gravity entry for requesting an update on something of my own, it is just weird if I can't contribute the Guardian newspaper link to this page which was created by Dr Lubos Motl, a string theorist - for proof see <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=271" class="external free" title="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=271" rel="nofollow">http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=271</a> . Therefore, the arguments - all of them - about vanity below look a bit bogus. So many people can't all be wrong? So string theory and the majority must be right? Anyone below feeling a touch paranoid? I don't have more than a few moments access to the edit now and then so haven't had a chance to join wikipedia as a 'User' yet. Best wishes, Nigel. <i>-- unsigned comment by 62.253.48.69 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.253.48.69_a57a.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.253.48.69">contribs</a>), whose only edit this is.</i>

<li>Nigel: This discussion isn't about the guardian link (which actually works in the article's favor, so thank you for adding it), but whether a Wikipedia article about this blog meets the encyclopedia's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">standards for inclusion</a>. It also isn't about quashing controversy over string theory—we want to provide information from a neutral point of view, which often means reporting multiple perspectives. You'll notice that the article on <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">string theory</a> already contains a large section on the theory's problems and criticisms. If you'd like to expand the discussion, that might be a good place to start. Thanks for trying to help! <font size="-2">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><font style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</font></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</font> 15:24, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's not blog vanity, as it was created by someone (Dr Motl) who is on the other side to the moderator Woit, who has nothing to do with this page. I don't know why my view was deleted, but this entry is essential to establishing an independent index of the blog pages by people excluding Woit. The blog itself is not self-promotion, it includes valuable discussions but these are scattered around and hard to locate on Google, so Wikipedia should have a user-friendly index. The string theory discussions elsewhere are always bogged down with technical trivia, and this is the one blog which distinguishes the wood from the trees. ALL of these 'objections' say 'vanity' which is a lie, unless you think Dr Motl and Dr Woit are one and the same, like Dr Jekyl and Mr Hyde!

<li>In regards to your contention that "this entry is essential to establishing an independent index of the blog pages by people excluding Woit", I would argue that the last thing wikipedia needs is articles about people's blogs regardless of what the subject matter is.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:33, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No notability established for the blog. Slightly more notability for the meme but not to the point where the claims made for it here can be verified (compare "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Considered_harmful.html" title="Considered harmful">considered harmful</a>" for a meme which did reach that level.) <s><b>Delete</b></s>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:39, 4 October 2005 (UTC) Vote changed to <b>Abstain</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> and improve, though I agree the un-encyclopedic puffery should go. This blog, despite its provocative title, is not just string-bashing. It's a well-respected source for interesting science bloggery. Its posts often get chosen for <a href="http://www.physcomments.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.physcomments.org/" rel="nofollow">Physics Comments</a>, and a Google search for <i>woit blog</i> gives 35,000 results. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 20:48, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> A lot of people are worried about this entry being on a Blog. While this is a concern I think we should be willing to include some under very special circumstances. I am a philosophy graduate student and on more than one occasion I have heard a particular philosopher's blog mentioned <i>during a professional talk</i>. In fact a recent paper by a professor at Berkeley was inspired by a comment on said blog. I think this means that blogs are becoming part of academic life, and notable ones are as worthy of an entry here as a book (and probably more worthy). With respect to this case, I count 125 references in at the site provided by betsy <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Y4I&amp;hl=xx-elmer&amp;c2coff=1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22woit%27s+not+even+wrong%22+site%3Aphyscomments.org&amp;btnG=Seawch" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Y4I&amp;hl=xx-elmer&amp;c2coff=1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22woit%27s+not+even+wrong%22+site%3Aphyscomments.org&amp;btnG=Seawch" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li>I entirely agree that it's deletable (I already voted so above), but I think it's problematic to use "but I can't find it on the map" as the primary grounds for a deletion vote; it potentially opens the door to somebody pointing out its map location as <i>a priori</i> grounds for a keep vote.

<li><b>Delete</b> It's not so much whether or not this is a real community. It's whether or not the encyclopedia gains anything from this article. I could write an article about every tiny town in West Texas, but that doesn't mean that I should. If an article's topic is not important in some way, then why keep a stub when you can go pick up an atlas and get more information. If someone has some more information regarding this place, then please, add more information.

<li><b>Reply.</b> OK, you obviously don't have a clue what commandN is. They are one of the biggest and most popular technology vidcasts on the web. They have approximately 50,000 downloads of their video per week. The hosts have featured on many other popular technology shows such as <a href="../../../c/a/l/Call_For_Help_bfe2.html" title="Call For Help">Call For Help</a> and have also featured on the extremely popular podcast <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_Week_in_Tech_caa3.html" title="This Week in Tech">This Week in Tech</a>. Google, Google Groups and Usenet have nothing to do with determining if a wikipedia article should be deleted. btw, I posted almost this entire article and I have no affiliation with commandN at all (considering I'm actually from Australia). Yes the article currently does sound a little promotitive, but over time others will/can edit it and it will become less so. btw, do you know what a backlink is? As if you have a look <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=link%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fcommandn.typepad.com&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=link%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fcommandn.typepad.com&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=link%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fcommandn.tv&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=link%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fcommandn.tv&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">here</a>, you will see that many other sites have linked to the commandN site as they are very popular. cheers, <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreelovinhippie_0367.html" title="User:Treelovinhippie">Treelovinhippie</a> 02:47, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Of course I don't have a clue as to what commandN is, so I'm trying to do due diligence by checking it out for myself. Wikipedia is based on the whole idea that you do not need credentials in a specific field in order to apply basic scholarship. You're saying that it is fantastically popular... but not one single person on USENET has ever seen fit to mention it? Something does not jibe here. You need to give me something I can accept as neutral and check out for myself. The sort of links you mention are unimpressive, because sites link to each other all the time in attempts to mutually raise their Google pageranks, and because there are sites that are just trying track every podcast or whatnot. OK, I'm going to propose three tests. I don't know the outcome of any of them yet. You tell me which you think I should try.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would agree that a weekly audience of 50,000 would be notable for a downloadable videocast, but I would like to see some sort of independent verification of that.

<li>Now as I have stated before, it is often difficult to state exact figures on the number of downloads per podcast, as often these are distributed via bittorrent (which is very difficult to track) and the podcasts end up all over the net with various other sources distributing it.</li>
<li>As I have said, also, the host/s of this show have featured on <a href="../../../t/w/i/TWiT_94b2.html" title="TWiT">TWiT</a> at least once (and in most cases more). TWiT is the number one podcast on the internet and has been at the top of the iTunes charts for a long time. They are a technology podcast and only feature people who are interesting and are well-known (i.e. this podcasts' host). That in itself should be enough to justify its popularity.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - The fact that the hosts of CommandN have featured on <a href="../../../t/w/i/TWiT_94b2.html" title="TWiT">TWiT</a> is meaningless. Because they have appeared on a more notable podcast and were previously featured on a cable show that automatically confers notability on their current project? That's specious logic. In my opinion a podcast is like a blog; there has to be excellent evidence of overwhelming popularity before it can be considered notable enough to merit a standalone article. At this point simply referencing CommandN in the hosts own wiki articles would be sufficient. For due dilligence sake, I followed the links provided as evidence. <a href="http://www.digg.com/technology/commandN_Episode_10_Up" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.digg.com/technology/commandN_Episode_10_Up" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> came up with a "That item was not found" message. I went to <a href="http://www.digg.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.digg.com" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and did a search on CommandN. Average "diggs" for an episode were around 450 with a max of 510 for ep10. So 510 people voted for it, compared to 1900+ for a story on Google Office that has been there for a mere 14 hours. That's not overwhelming evidence of the popularity/notability of CommmandN. Looking around <a href="http://www.digg.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.digg.com" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> I can't find any information on how they tally votes. Do they only count unique votes or is every click counted?

<li><b>Keep</b> - CommandN is in the top 100 in the podcast section of the canadian iTunes music store and it's one of the first canadian vidcast.</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Having just said not convinced I now find 55,000 hits on Yahoo. (OK, so I know it's not Google but 55,000!). How many of these are more than repeat directory entries or the like I don't know. Don't like the article either.

<ul>
<li>First, what did you search on? commandN by itself is a problem, because it gets hundreds of irrelevant hits due to its frequent use in programs, e.g. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.unix.shell/browse_thread/thread/88db2aa24955b77c/e060e55d11f4f998?lnk=st&amp;q=commandN&amp;rnum=4&amp;hl=en#e060e55d11f4f998" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.unix.shell/browse_thread/thread/88db2aa24955b77c/e060e55d11f4f998?lnk=st&amp;q=commandN&amp;rnum=4&amp;hl=en#e060e55d11f4f998" rel="nofollow">here</a>. When I try "commandN vidcast" on Yahoo I get less than 400 hits. How would you interpret <i>commandN vidcast</i> getting ZERO hits in Google Groups (USENET?) (Come to think of it, I'm a little surprised that nobody advocating for keeping this article has bothered to make a USENET posting about it just to prove me wrong). <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:33, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hi Dpb. The Yahoo search was just a straight search for CommandN. As the greater part of the hits seem to include reference to vidcasting - but by no means all! - I left it at that. 55,000 is an impressive figure but I am by no means convinced. Hence the weak bit of the keep. As to USENET, I have no idea about that. (ie. I have no idea about USENET). You are right, however, that "CommandN vidcast" draws less than 400 hits. And Google offers no lifeline! <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 12:12, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - commandN offers a unique view on technology from 3 hosts who know there tech. While the article may need improving it should be kept. Vidcast aside the two main host work on a technology TV show and sometimes have an inside line on what is new and notable in the tech world. Other podcasts such as TWIT www.twit.tv and diggnation www.diggnation.com have a wikipedia pages and are same type of podcast as commandN.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - First of all, you guys seem unusually bent on deleting this page. Secondly, Google is a suitable test if you use it properly. If you've ever taken Statistics, you'll learn that survey results can easily be biased by the wording of the question. Your criteria include the term "vidcast", which doesn't appear anywhere on the CommandN wiki, nor anywhere on commandn.tv, the official website. Biased, don't you think? If a simple search for "CommandN" doesn't satisfy you because the popularity of commandn.net (an artist group in Tokyo) is interfering with results, all you need to do is include conventional terms--"commandn podcast OR vidcast OR videoblogging" returns 53,400 hits. If you're *still* not convinced, a simple paging through the results to view contexts should help. It has only 2 Google Groups hits, but if you know anything about the unquestionably popular podcast This Week In Tech (or TWiT), that podcast gets only 44 hits, with the benefit of a dozen former US television personalities.</li>

<li><b>Evidence</b>. For those of you people who don't have a clue as to the popularity of Open Alpha....
<ul>
<li>Now as I have stated before, it is often difficult to state exact figures on the number of downloads per podcast, as often these are distributed via bittorrent (which is very difficult to track) and the podcasts end up all over the net with various other sources distributing it.</li>
<li>As I have said, also, the host of this show has featured on <a href="../../../t/w/i/TWiT_94b2.html" title="TWiT">TWiT</a> at least once (and in most cases more). TWiT is the number one podcast on the internet and has been at the top of the iTunes charts for a long time. They are a technology podcast and only feature people who are interesting and are well-known (i.e. this podcasts' host). That in itself should be enough to justify its popularity.</li>
<li>Another thing I'll post is a link to a post on <a href="http://www.digg.com" class="external free" title="http://www.digg.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.digg.com</a> (a social bookmarking site). Basically the number of 'diggs' is how many people have clicked to 'digg' it and is an indication of its popularity. See an example of a digg article posted for this podcast here: <a href="http://www.digg.com/technology/OpenAlpha.tv_Episode_1" class="external free" title="http://www.digg.com/technology/OpenAlpha.tv_Episode_1" rel="nofollow">http://www.digg.com/technology/OpenAlpha.tv_Episode_1</a></li>

<li><b>Reply.</b> techPhile is one of the biggest and most popular technology podcasts on the web. The podcast is very well-known in the technology internet community and receieves many thousands of downloads per episode.

<li><b>Evidence</b>. For those of you people who don't have a clue as to the popularity of techPhile....
<ul>
<li>Now as I have stated before, it is often difficult to state exact figures on the number of downloads per podcast, as often these are distributed via bittorrent (which is very difficult to track) and the podcasts end up all over the net with various other sources distributing it.</li>
<li>Another thing I'll post is a link to a post on <a href="http://www.digg.com" class="external free" title="http://www.digg.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.digg.com</a> (a social bookmarking site). Basically the number of 'diggs' is how many people have clicked to 'digg' it and is an indication of its popularity. See an example of a digg article posted for this podcast here: <a href="http://www.digg.com/technology/Techphile_Episode_11_From_the_TechTV_Meetup_in_Toronto" class="external free" title="http://www.digg.com/technology/Techphile_Episode_11_From_the_TechTV_Meetup_in_Toronto" rel="nofollow">http://www.digg.com/technology/Techphile_Episode_11_From_the_TechTV_Meetup_in_Toronto</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, very notable podcast. It's a quality podcast that's updated on a regular basis. Which is more than I can say for most of the podcasts today. Even <a href="http://www.macgeekradio.com" class="external text" title="http://www.macgeekradio.com" rel="nofollow">my own</a>. Not to mention the work Frank has done for the Canadian podcasting community. <a href="../../../f/p/a/User%7EFpatten_7a4d.html" title="User:Fpatten">MacGeek</a> 17:54, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> yet another non-notable podcast. As before, in reference to the evidence provided, "diggs" are around 500. The biggest hit on the provided site is 1000 and that is only because that particular episode was about diggs.com. There are blogs out there that get that many hits a day... and I don't consider them notable.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:41, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The number of 'diggs' is a very, very rough guide as to the popularity of this podcast. digg.com is only one site (out of the many hundreds of other sites this podcast is backlinked from) and many people may not have clicked the digg button, but simply gone straight to the link.
<ul>

<li><b>Keep(with provisions)</b> It is a notable podacast that has been recommended on both professional broadcast and print media. It is an Amateur production, in the sense of for the love of it, and this does initially put off some listeners that are used to and prefer professional or professional grade production. Once you get past that and listen for the quality of the content, it is far greater than the large majority of free podcasts. The only provision I have to keeping it is if the actual entry is improved because of its not quite "ready for prime time" entry. I do not have the time currently to do this myself, or I would.

<li><b>Keep</b> Why is this non-notable? What is the criteria to determine this? I notice that some people write that this podcast doesn't have enough viewers to be notable -- but how many viewers does a podcast need to be notable? And why that number? Please try to come up with substantial reasons for deleting articles. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 00:25, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let me turn this around for a second <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a>... why is it notable? Where is the evidence that this is a popular podcast that is generating alot of buzz? Podcasts are like blogs; inherently non-notable for the simple fact that they are basically vanity projects. Anyone can start a podcast and spam it all over the internet. They can even charge to view it, but that doesn't make it notable or important. I would strongly argue that in reference to any non-traditional media of this sort the burden of proof is on those arguing keep as there is not as clear and concise of a method of establishing notability as exists with traditional media. One could certainly argue that this is simply an example of "old media" like magazines, television, etc. ignoring the "new media" of podcasts, but the complete lack of ANY coverage of techPhile by independant, 3rd party sources makes it impossible to verify any of the claims of popularity. I would therefore turn this around and ask you and those voting keep to come up with substantial reasons to retain this article beyond it being listed in some podcast guides and the contention of the random wiki user that it is indeed "notable".--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:52, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So are you saying that podcasts &amp; blogs should both be considered non-notable on the basis of vanity? I disagree: while many blogs are obviously vanity projects, it requires only a little work to determine whether their notability is "yes" "no" or "maybe". I would think that the same could be said of podcasting; I assume that there are notable podcasts out there that are not connected with established broadcasting companies. I freely admit that you could write a book for O'Reilly on what I don't know about podcasting, <i>however</i>, instead of providing the information needed by those of us who are ignorant about podcasting, all Brenneman said above is "not notable. Delete." Some kind of comparative information on audience size &amp; reach is one possible argument for his opinion, but so far from what I've seen I could easily conclude he wants to delete this article out of animosity for this podcast -- not that I do here, but more information than those three words would not only make his intent clear, it would be a kindness to the contributor, who must wonder if such a terse criticism is indended to make him stop contributing. And until it can be shown that this article <i>is</i> non notable, we should keep it. <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Assume good faith</a>. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:19, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not saying all blogs and podcasts are non-notable... what I'm saying is that due to the nature of podcasting (and blogging) they are intristically in a weaker position of notability than more established media, primarily because there is a lack of verifiable data out there to support their claims of notibility if nobody from established media sources is paying any mind to these podcasts &amp; blogs. There are notable podcasts out there. <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Source_Code_d3ae.html" title="Daily Source Code">Daily Source Code</a> is a good example based on it's "trailblazing" status. But here is where it we get into a philosophical debate that could go on ad infinitum: you want the burden of proof on the nominator... I put it on the author. I assume good faith in the creation of this article, but that doesn't mean the author has in any way indicated notability. Based on my own research, I've seen nothing that would indicate that TechPhile is in any way notable. the evidence posted for keeping it is unconvincing. As way of evidence for deletion, I can offer you in the complete lack of any coverage of TechPhile on any major IT media outlets, be it web, magazine, etc. It's primary return in a Google search is numerous podcast list sites where it is one of 100 other non-notable casts; not that I think that will convince you... Point is that in the end <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a>, you and I have a completely different viewpoint of where the burden of proof is... which would explain our differing votes.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:37, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, Isotope, you &amp; I agree at least that we disagree; I'm satisfied to leave the matter there. I would like to point out (at the risk of repeating myself), that had Brennerman originally wrote a more satisfactory &amp; detailed nomination &amp; touched on some of the points you had done, we would not be having this conversation -- a thought for everyone who found this discussion more tedious than informative, &amp; would want to avoid repeating the exercise. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 17:52, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Diggnation (one of their weekly podcasts) is currently #12 on iTunes - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Itunes_screen_digg.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Itunes_screen_digg.jpg" rel="nofollow">screenshot</a></li>
<li>Now as I have stated before, it is often difficult to state exact figures on the number of downloads per podcast, as often these are distributed via bittorrent (which is very difficult to track) and the podcasts end up all over the net with various other sources distributing it.</li>
<li>As I have said, also, the host/s of this show have featured on <a href="../../../t/w/i/TWiT_94b2.html" title="TWiT">TWiT</a> at least once (and in most cases more). TWiT is the number one podcast on the internet and has been at the top of the iTunes charts for a long time. They are a technology podcast and only feature people who are interesting and are well-known (i.e. this podcasts' host). That in itself should be enough to justify its popularity.</li>
<li>Another thing I'll post is a link to a post on <a href="http://www.digg.com" class="external free" title="http://www.digg.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.digg.com</a> (a social bookmarking site). Basically the number of 'diggs' is how many people have clicked to 'digg' it and is an indication of its popularity. See an example of a digg article posted for this podcast here: <a href="http://www.digg.com/links/Diggnation_Episode_12_-_September_15,_2005" class="external free" title="http://www.digg.com/links/Diggnation_Episode_12_-_September_15,_2005" rel="nofollow">http://www.digg.com/links/Diggnation_Episode_12_-_September_15,_2005</a></li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable. I have yet to see good evidence of notability posted here. Diggs.com "diggs" should be discounted here <s>as it is Revision3's site</s> and can't be taken as impartial. The fact that some of the principles on this site have been featured on <a href="../../../t/w/i/TWiT_94b2.html" title="TWiT">TWiT</a> is totally irrelevant. Looking at the google hits, by and large the results returned are either mentions on sites owned and run by Revision3 or various blogs and message boards. A mention of an ABC news story on a website run by a Revision3 affiliated person isn't very compelling evidence either. I listened to a whole segment about <a href="../../../4/1/9/419eater.com.html" title="419eater.com">419eater.com</a> on <a href="../../../n/p/r/NPR_8c1a.html" title="NPR">NPR</a> one morning but I don't see anyone citing that as a reason for them to have their own wiki article. Kevin Roses' blog entry is just that... a blog entry. Not good evidence of notability. The CNET article is the only piece of decent evidence that has been provided showing anyone in technology is independently writing about this company... but one article does not establish notability. Diggnation seems to have a moderate level of popularity, but are you trying to argue that the notability of the product confers notability back on the company, everyone involved, and the company's other auxillary products? I think that is a rather tenuous argument and that doesn't support inclusion of 90% of the material in the article, even if one accepts it. Looking back at the previous AfD, it appears there were quite a few first time voters who have not been very active outside of that vote. Rather than vote on this based on the previous AfD, I'd ask editors to look at this AfD based on the merits of the arguments and evidence for and against deletion.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:19, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It should be noted that digg.com is not a Revision3 site, although to make it clear, Kevin Rose is a common party involved in both some running of the digg website as well as some running of Revision3. He is not a whole part of either. "Diggs" are an indicator of popularity voted by internet users, rather than the people who run the site.</li>
<li>Mentions on 'various blogs and noticeboards' immediately serve to show the popularity of the company in the eyes of the internet public, which is what is being measured here.</li>
<li>Diggnation, Systm and thebroken all have a large amount of popularity. If they are all produced by the same group of people under the same umbrella, it makes sense to post them under the one umbrella on wikipedia rather than clutter the namespace unnecessarily. --<a href="../../../k/y/e/User%7EKyelewis_5db9.html" title="User:Kyelewis">Kyelewis</a> 07:22, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Digg.com isn't owned by Revision3, so I've stricken that part of my statement above. It still can't be seen as totally impartial though as KR is involved in both. I understand that how the voting works, but there is an obvious potential for conflict of interest via cross promotion, vote stuffing, etc. I'm not saying these things have happened, but the potential is there and it is enough that I'd discount this as a piece of evidence.</li>

<dd>I don't accept your argument that mentions on various blogs and notice boards serve to show the popularity of the company in the eyes of the internet public. It simply shows the popularity among a subset of people that frequent these particular message boards and blogs. Scanning through google hits it appeared that where the result was relevent to this actual company, many entries were repeats of threads from the same message board. There are lots of topics that get this sort of chatter among a subset of the internet, but that doesn't make them notable to the general public or even to the larger subculture.</dd>
<dd>Finally, are you suggesting then that the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebroken.html" title="Thebroken">thebroken</a> article should be deleted and replaced with a redirect to the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revision3.html" title="Revision3">Revision3</a> article so it appears under the same umbrella? I would disagree with that. In fact, I would argue that <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebroken.html" title="Thebroken">thebroken</a> is the only article that should stay (as it is the only product that appears to have a true level of notability and Revision3 should be contained to a one sentence mention in that article as the producing company.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:30, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Which is interesting, because I would probably see thebroken as the least notable of the Revision3 in terms of overall internet popularity, given it's limited run of 3 episodes and slightly more niche programming content. I'm going to have to leave my argument there, because I unfortunately don't have time to continue to find more evidence and arguments. At one point, people didn't think of "Revision3" or "Rev3", they instead thought about the specific content, "Systm", "thebroken" and later "diggnation". It probably was not until Revision3 started taking major sponsors and memberships that people were thinking about the company name itself. You can't buy a "systm" or "thebroken" membership, you buy a "Revision3" membership to see early content. Obviously, I have no numbers to confirm quite how many people have done so. In this way, I would see Revision3 as popular for systm and thebroken in the same way I would see <a href="../../../r/o/o/Rooster_Teeth_Productions_5d51.html" title="Rooster Teeth Productions">Rooster Teeth Productions</a> as popular for <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_vs_Blue_4af2.html" title="Red vs Blue">Red Vs Blue</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Strangerhood_5c4e.html" title="The Strangerhood">The Strangerhood</a> --<a href="../../../k/y/e/User%7EKyelewis_5db9.html" title="User:Kyelewis">Kyelewis</a> 20:44, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>In order to verify the iTunes ranking you'll have to see it for yourself in the iTunes program. There doesn't appear to be an offical apple listing of podcast rankings. However, some more popular podcast sites rate diggnation as <a href="http://odeo.com/listen/top-40" class="external text" title="http://odeo.com/listen/top-40" rel="nofollow">#2 on Odeo</a> and <a href="http://www.podcastalley.com/top_podcasts.php?num=50" class="external text" title="http://www.podcastalley.com/top_podcasts.php?num=50" rel="nofollow">#19 on podcastalley</a>.

<li>I'm From Buffalo, Olean is a rural suburb, and I've never heard of this company.

<li>Research turns up exactly one independently sourced news article (now listed in the article) that mentions the company. Everything else is corporate directory or employment directory listings. The company thus just barely satisfies the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> criteria, although it is a borderline case and I would have preferred at least two separate sources. The bigger problem with this article is that <i>it doesn't cite any sources whatsoever</i>. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECastAStone_9a4a.html" title="User:CastAStone">CastAStone</a> is, ironically, right about the company not having a web page of its own. Not only has no-one else written a corporate biography, but the company <i>itself</i> doesn't have an <i>auto</i>biography as far as I can tell. This article thus has a distinct <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a> problem, as there are no sources cited for its content, and no sources to be found. The lack of sources and the other contributions by the original author strongly indicate that this article is primary source material supplied by someone directly associated with the company itself, and is in fact not stuff that humans already know, but <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, a corporate history being first published on Wikipedia. However, because there are (a scant few) sources to be had, and becase the WP:CORP criteria are (just barely) satisfied, this is a matter for cleanup, to cite sources and to excise the unverifiable content leaving the (far smaller amount of) content that is verifiable. <b>Weak Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:20, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I think that this should just be struck down as not notable and unverifiable. Also, I was reading WP:CORP criteria, and I don't see how this could be said to be even close to allowable for entry. I was under the understanding that original research is not allowed on here. So if this is a primary source based on someone who is directly involved with the company, then it would not be allowed because it violates the first WP:CORP guideline. As for the newly added source, it does prove the company exists, but it states little else, and none of the other information in the article is cited. The guidelines call for "multiple" independent sources. One source is hardly "multiple." It obviously does not meet any of the other guildlines, so I call for deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 02:47, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Multiple sources is good journalism. It is good encyclopaedism, too. I'm currently at "weak keep" because I'm allowing for the remote possibility that this content <i>might not be</i> original research, but simply sourced from a source that my research didn't turn up. It's unlikely, but it <i>might</i> have been sourced from a printed book written about the history of the company, for example. If the original author comes along and cites such a book, then the article isn't original research.
<p>On the other hand: In the (more probable) event that no such source is cited, we don't have to delete the article to fix the problem that the sources that we <i>can</i> find don't cover the article content as it currently stands. We can (and should) heavily modify the article, in the way that I outlined above, getting rid of the original research whilst keeping the article.</p>
<p>On the gripping hand: I don't predict there being much more than two sentences that can be sourced about this company, though. That, and the lack of multiple sources, are other reasons that I'm at "weak keep". It could be argued that this article, in verifiable form, would be a perpetual {{corp-stub}} with no possibility for expansion, given the paucity of the sources. A perpetual stub with no possibility for expansion is deletable. As I said, this is a borderline case. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:24, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

The WP:CORP criterion doesn't restrict itself to specific, explicitly denoted, forms of published works as the other criteria do. The WP:CORP criterion includes newspapers, magazines, <i>and</i> books, under a single umbrella of "published works". (There's a case to be made that WP:BIO, WP:MUSIC, and WP:WEB should in fact be this general, too.) <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:24, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think it's a good idea to merge all Mao's poems to a seperate page. And I will do it. But please don't delete it just because you " never heard of it". I am sure there are huge amount of poetry in the world you never heard of. Again, copyright is not a problem.</li>

</ul>
<p><br />
Well, it's your opinion that Mao's poem doesn't deserve an article, but your never heard of it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. This only means you lack basic knowledge of Chinese history and literture. As I have said in the article, it's considered by many Chinese to be a first-rated classic in literature. The copyright has no problem, since all Mao's work's translation are done by Chinese government and has no copyright.</p>
<p>By the way, I think your deletion of this article is too arbitrary. Please tell me where I can complain about this kind of behavior.</p>

<li>A couple of things, since it isn't copyvio, it should probably be over at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikisource.html" title="Wikisource">Wikisource</a> rather in an encyclopedia, also, it hasn't been deleted yet, I am not completely for deletion in fact and I even said that I would rather them be merged. And I never said it didn't exist and I read plenty of Chinese literature because <b>I am Chinese</b> but we also have some policy on Wikipedia that should be followed. Again, source material should not be on Wikipedia and should be transwikied and these stubs should be merged into a general article about Mao's poetry or in the very least moved to the proper naming conventions. If you truly wish to complain, you can do so here, on the talk page of the pages you created, but I doubt you'll find that people will be that much against me. <b><a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch"><font color="#89CF19">Sasquatch</font></a></b><span style="background-color:#C1FF5F"><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">c</a></span> 03:24, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Better idea: move to Wikisource under the main banner of Poetry of Mao Zedong, then create an article detailing Mao's Poetry at <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry_of_Mao_Zedong_13c4.html" title="Poetry of Mao Zedong">Poetry of Mao Zedong</a> then link to the source poems. Best of both worlds, you have the article detailing his style and influence then you have source documents that are linked to. How does that sound?

<p>I agree it could be better that I move all Mao's works to Wikisource and create a link under Mao's entry. But it just amazes me each movie, or TV series, no matter how trashy it is, can have an entry in Wikipedia, while a piece of poem with huge influences cannot. What's the guideline for you do deal with movies, and poems, or novels, differently?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the difference is that the articles for movies and TV series are articles <i>about</i> the movie or show. This article is basically just the text of the poem. (Possible because the text of a poem is much shorter than the script of a movie or even the text of an entire book.) I think if the article instead consisted of a discussion of the poem and why it is important, it would not have been nominated to be moved to Wikisource.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, a poem which is far more notable than "<a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungry%2C_Hungry_Homer_dd1f.html" title="Hungry, Hungry Homer">Hungry, Hungry Homer</a>" for example. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 06:26, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><b>I did a cursory search on Wikipedia and find these poems having full texts</b>: <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charge_of_the_Light_Brigade_aec9.html" title="Charge of the Light Brigade">Charge of the Light Brigade</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariana.html" title="Mariana">Mariana</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/Ame_ni_mo_Makezu_9697.html" title="Ame ni mo Makezu">Ame ni mo Makezu</a>, this is just a small sample and I believe there are much more. Now I wonder what the policy is. In my opinion, you justification of deleting my entry on Mao's poetry can only be one of the following four:</p>
<p>1) The rule is no full text of poems can be entered into Wikipedia, this has been proved false by above examples.<br />
2) You think Mao's poetry have no high literature value, but this is just your personal opinion and is very arbitrary. The fact is Mao's poems are highly regarded by millions of Chinese people like me, and his quotes are often cited in daily conversations and in many other novels, poems, movies, etc. The truth is ordinary Chinese people enjoy his poetry very much, and trust me, they don't have to.<br />
3) You don't like Mao, again, this is just your personal opinion, and it should has nothing with the literature value of his poetry.<br />
4) You are afraid it will be a violation of copyright, for this as I have said, Mao's works has no copyright. It's available everywhere on the internet.<br /></p>
<p>For above reasons, though transfering all Mao's poems to Wikisource may be a better idea, I don't think it's a violation of Wikipedia policy to create individual entries for some of Mao's best poems.</p>

<ul>
<li>Well, actually, the rule <i>is</i> "no full text of poems, please". If you do find an article that has the full text of a poem, it shouldn't (and, in fact, of the three you mentioned, two of them actually don't, and I'm going to look into the problem of the third). Wikipedia is managed by volunteers who are always trying to make it better; but sometimes we don't know about a problem until someone mentions it. That said, I too support a) the <b>move to Wikisource</b>, and b) the creation of <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry_of_Mao_Zedong_13c4.html" title="Poetry of Mao Zedong">Poetry of Mao Zedong</a>. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 11:56, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ok, I will <b>move</b> Mao's poems to Wikisource as you suggested and create <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry_of_Mao_Zedong_13c4.html" title="Poetry of Mao Zedong">Poetry of Mao Zedong</a>. Thank you all for the kind suggestions and sorry for the trouble.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> But I doubt people will be typing "Rail gauges and power supply of Hong Kong rails" to get this information. Articles like these are usually helper articles which need to be split off either because the main article is too long, or this suplementary info is too detailed to fit into the main page. This article do not fit into either scenario. While I agree redirecting to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_in_Hong_Kong_51ee.html" title="Transport in Hong Kong">Transport in Hong Kong</a> may be far too general, having this information incorporated into <a href="../../../m/t/r/MTR_7c6f.html" title="MTR">MTR</a>, <a href="../../../k/r/c/KRC_9c09.html" title="KRC">KRC</a> and/or <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trains_on_the_MTR_9a7c.html" title="Trains on the MTR">Trains on the MTR</a> should be specific and relevant enough, expecially when it all takes is an additional paragraph or even a single line in those articles.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 14:47, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>If I was looking for this information (which I'll admit is unlikely) I would probably start with <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_transport_in_Hong_Kong_fa8c.html" title="Rail transport in Hong Kong">Rail transport in Hong Kong</a>. At the current state of that article, a merge wouldn't hurt, but if it grows into a full article these technical details will be clutter. I would certainly not appreciate having to load all of <a href="../../../m/t/r/MTR_7c6f.html" title="MTR">MTR</a>, KTC <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_Tram_c723.html" title="Peak Tram">Peak Tram</a> etc if the information was split into single sentences. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 15:09, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then merging the whole article into <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_transport_in_Hong_Kong_fa8c.html" title="Rail transport in Hong Kong">Rail transport in Hong Kong</a> seems like the best solution. I didnt notice the existance of this page earlier.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 08:10, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The difficulty with proving the legitimacy of this is that any combination of "cup" with "play" or "game" turns up hundreds of pages on soccer and rugby, which are obviously more popular games. --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImagist_a511.html" title="User:Imagist">Imagist</a> 04:11, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Mikexstudios, I believe you. Clearly this game exists. But as it stands now, this whole topic fails to meet <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_Original_Research_6a12.html" title="Wikipedia:No Original Research">Wikipedia:No Original Research</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. Without citations to reasonable sources, there is no way I or other editors can ever know whether the descriptions in the article are accurate or not. As it stands, the Wikipedia page on Cup (game) may well be the single most authoritative source on this game in the world. Unintuitively, that is <i>not</i> a good thing - it means someone, probably, has put together some nice, well-meaning original research. Which needs to be published somewhere other than Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> 18:00, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> let me make a friendly clarification of what Bunch said. Its fine for wikipedia to be the single most authoritative source, if it is by combining single bits of information from many different sources. The problem is if the page is the single most authoritative source because it contains information not found anywhere else in the world. Sorry if this was obvious, I didn't want Mike to get the wrong impression.&#160;:) --best, kevin <font color="#BBBBBB">·</font><font color="#666666">·</font>·<small><a href="../../../k/z/o/User%7EKzollman_a660.html" title="User:Kzollman">Kzollman</a> | <a href="../../../k/z/o/User_talk%7EKzollman_107b.html" title="User talk:Kzollman">Talk</a></small>·<font color="#666666">·</font><font color="#BBBBBB">·</font> 20:23, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>It will not break Wikipedia policy. If I reintroduce an article that cannot be considered original research, because it is published in a peer-reviewed journal, it cannot be deleted or speedy deleted. I suggest you familiarize yourself with WP policy. Besides, the decision to launch a new AfD on this article only two weeks after the first one was closed, clearly is a violation of policy.

<li>What Ryan means is that he is defending the non-NPOV in the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">autism</a> article. At the talk page I've challenged why historical and illogical autism theories are still kept there. I've also challenged why the opinion of many people in the autistic community has been placed in the sociology section, and isn't mentioned at all in central parts like causes, models etc. Obviously, Ryan wants this article to go so he can continue the POV in the autism article without any challenges. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 09:26, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In that case a bad example. The article clearly doesn't agree with the stereotypical picture of Neanderthals. It in fact sees Neanderthals as superior to modern humans on various accounts.

<li>The social system is only privileged if there is <i>something it can spread</i>. Innovations and creativity is the domain of Neanderthals and autistics. Without these traits, 'modern humans' wouldn't be very modern at all. So, with your reasoning, all the social types would also be deficient in innovative &amp; persistence abilities, no?

<li>Dude, I love isnt.autistics.com. I've been there myself. My whole point is: <i>no one</i> is/should be considered "deficient," in either direction. And by the way, I don't fall on the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_spectrum.html" title="Autistic spectrum">autistic spectrum</a>, and I resent the implication that "innovation and creativity" can't be my domain too. (By the way, I won't call myself <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurotypical.html" title="Neurotypical">neurotypical</a> because I am not: I have an autonomic disorder, so my nervous system is anything but typical.) --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler">Jacquelyn Marie</a> 15:12, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>You probably wouldn't enjoy isnt.autistics.com if it weren't explicitly telling you it is a parody. The "research" presented about autism is not a parody AFAIK, and thus must be dealt with as severe discrimination. You were earlier very concerned with blacks being called Neanderthals, so I guess you would be concerned by discrimination issues? Why then aren't you concerned about discrimination of autistics? --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 15:34, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. See also my comments on the article’s talkpage. As far as Wikipedia protocol goes: this is classic OR, and sets a dangerous precedent: one passionate individual attempting to use Wikipedia and its various mirrors, and private newsgroups, in order to create an illusory buzz about a personal theory. This theory is unknown in the scientific community, it is unknown to anyone who has not come across Rdos' own writing on the topic here on Wikipedia, on his webpage or on newsgroups. Rdos has all but admitted that he is trying to use wikipedia to propogate his personal theory. Perhaps he hopes that if he continues stirring things up on wikipedia and the mirrors, his theory will no longer be unknown. If Rdos can cite the buzz he himself has created as support for his claim that this is a significant theory, what's to stop any other devoted individual from promoting their pet theory in likewise fashion? Also please note that at the same time Rdos has been attempting to eliminate a well-established theory on Autism that he personally disagrees with; see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sensory_Integration_Dysfunction_f2e9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sensory Integration Dysfunction">Rdos’ RfD for Sensory Integration Dysfunction</a>, and his attempted changes to the main article on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">Autism</a>.

<li>So Sensory Integration Disorder is a well established theory? Among whom, and who supports it? In the VfD discussion nobody could prove it was "well-established". It wasn't part of DSM, it had no support in MEDLINE and so on. It did have some backing up in a book by a professional. However, the question is if we should accept that professionals with a clear agenda to make money on drugs, treatments and group-homes should be allowed to monopolize the truhth about autism? --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 13:41, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b>: It is difficult to reconcile the many delete votes above with the basic idea that the Wiki should further the advance of knowledge. Given the substantial amount of discussion and acceptance of the Neanderthal theory (especially within the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_community.html" title="Autism community">autism community</a>), it is impossible to conclude the article is irrelevant or unworthy. The real question begging to be answered here is just why is there so much visceral antipathy toward the subject? Perhaps it is because, for generations, the term Neanderthal has been used deliberately (often by the media) to promote bigotry, intolerance and hostility? Or perhaps the VfD process has attracted a disproportionate number of deletionists, bent on advancing thought stopping objectives? A new article stub was being prepared for the Neanderthal theory of autism, which then seemed unnecessary with a redirect to this article; in light of the above, however, perhaps it'd be best to submit it anyhow, rather than leaving a redirect to this mess. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 23:17, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Vanity and lack of verifiable sources. This is an article written by <a href="../../../n/i/r/User%7ENirav.maurya_8352.html" title="User:Nirav.maurya">User:Nirav.maurya</a> about his grandmother, as he pointed out at <a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhadani_d9c4.html#Your_Father.27s_Page" title="User talk:Bhadani">User_talk:Bhadani#Your_Father's_Page</a>. Not too surprisingly, it goes on at unnecessary length about Mrs. Mehta's family life. Moreover, the name "Madhuri Mehta" gets only 52 hits on google and 8 on Yahoo!search, the vast majority of which, maybe all of them, do not refer to the same person described in this article. Her maiden name gets one hit on google and none on Yahoo!. <s>A request for sources on the article's talk page went unanswered, and it seems likely the source is simply Nirav Maurya's personal knowledge of his family, which would be original research.</s> Actually, I had failed to notice that, while the request for cites was not answered on the talk page itself, an anon account added one source to the article: "Mid-Day article Is This What We Fought For by Vrunda Rahatekar and Suresh K.K. (1997)" In addition to the difficulty of checking an eight-year-old Indian newspaper article, it's not clear which pieces of information are sourced there and which are not. In any event, the article is still vanity, and so I'm leaving it up for deletion. - <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Kraus</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">e</a> 06:16, 4 October 2005 (UTC</p>

<p>It is a duplicate of <a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_My_Life_ef7f.html" title="It's My Life">It's My Life</a>. A Wikipedian did a cut and paste move from the original article to a new location. There is another controversy, too. Should "It's My Life" be about that album, or a disambiguation page between the album and a No Doubt song? The another Wikipedian wants it to be a disambiguation page, I think it should be for the album. Come on, No Doubt did just a cover version! And the original version isn't totally unknown.

<li>The 1965 classic "It's My Life" by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Animals_0e4d.html" title="The Animals">The Animals</a> is more notable than the 1984 album or song of the same name by <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_Talk_8d0e.html" title="Talk Talk">Talk Talk</a> or the cover by <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Doubt_c58c.html" title="No Doubt">No Doubt</a>.

<li>Thanks for the info. I was looking for such, when I told about the problem here. So <a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_My_Life_ef7f.html" title="It's My Life">It's My Life</a> should be a disambiguation page. Then there should be pages like "It's My Life (x album)". But the song pages are trickier to order. There can't be "It's My Life (song)", because there are several such songs. If the No Doubt version and the original song had the same article, what could be an appropriate, intuitive name for it? I don't know. Does it make sense to divide all the song articles by performer? -<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHapsiainen_6f9e.html" title="User:Hapsiainen">Hapsiainen</a> 11:12, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If it's the same song, then I think that there should be one article, with details of different recordings. If it's just the same name name, then the usual approach is to name them Song Title (Jane Smith song), Song Title (The Musical Group song), etc. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 11:36, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Evan Greenspoon, Round Two</b> This article has been recreated, still non-notably; a request to have it speedied was declined, so I'm reposting it here.

<dd>I originaly rejected this as a speedy - the article states that he's the co-editor of a magazine and stared in a film.

<dd>I guess I'd argue that without any explanation of why this magazine or film is notable, there's still no explanation of notability; many of us have worked on small college publications or starred in a friend's film for a local film festival, and that's really not notability. Still, since I suspect you know the guidelines better than me, I've followed your advice and am perfectly happy to wait it out here.

<li><b>Keep</b> Information would be of an encyclopedic nature and comes from multiple, verifiable sources. Does need to be worked on to update accuracy.

It should be noted that to overcome the "substantially identical copy" clause of G4, a recreation must address <i>those features of the original that were felt to be in contravention of WP policies and guidelines</i> in the first place. The original version of this article was validly deleted via <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Systemwars.com_aae2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Systemwars.com">VfD</a> principally because it so lacked notability (to use that much-maligned word) that it did not have independent sources that would adequately meet the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> requirements of this encyclopedia. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, the heart and soul of an encyclopedia and one of WP's great trinity, regretably also appears to be the most ignored WP policy. To quote from that repository of good sense:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they should refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments <b>that have already been published by a reputable publisher</b>...</i></dd>
<dd><i>For an encyclopedia, sources should be unimpeachable. An encyclopedia is not primary source material. Its authors do not conduct interviews or perform original research. Therefore, anything we include should have been published in the records, reportage, research, or studies of other reputable sources...</i></dd>
<dd><i>Subjects which have never been written about in published sources, or which have only been written about in sources of doubtful credibility <b>should not be included in Wikipedia</b>. One of the reasons for this policy is the difficulty of verifying the information.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Not only does this article lack any such sources, no reason is given for us to believe that such sources might be available. It is useful to ask the following questions whenever one contemplates writing a WP article. Has someone written a paper on this subject (ie. in this case, the website "Systemwars.com")? Has it been the focus of a thesis or newspaper or journal or magazine report (even an online one)? Is it the subject of a book or a book chapter? If it is, the source should be provided and the contents of the article should state (only) what is verifiable per that source. But, if there are no sources, the article <i>goes</i>. <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a> a receptacle for unverified claims. It is not a collection of weblinks appended to blurbs. It is not the place for original research and claims. It is an <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">encyclopedia</a>.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">enceph</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#666699">alon</font></a> 18:17, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>NB</i>. It has sometimes been suggested to me that linking a website which is <i>the subject of the article</i> will suffice for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. This represents a profound misunderstanding of WP:V and WP:NOR. The reason that one is required to have independent, reputable sources for WP articles is that these sources represent the primary research and peer review that WP simply cannot do on its own. WP cannot conduct interviews. It cannot perform investigations to determine whether the claims people make on websites are true. It has no body of professional experts to peer-review and endorse its articles. It relies for all this on what is <i>already published</i> by organizations that can do all this. One cannot write the claim "<i>Systemwars.com quickly grew its board to include 1000 members</i>, and provide no source for it except a link to that very website. That would be like me claiming "<i>My pet dog is the smartest dog on earth</i>", and providing a link to my website which says "my pet dog is the smartest dog on earth." Now it may very well be true that the website has 1000 members and that my pet dog really is the smartest dog on earth, but to determine that without independent sources, WP would have to engage in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>—which we cannot do. That is why we need independent sources, whether we're writing about <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asthma.html" title="Asthma">asthma</a>, or <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>.

<li>So if I, as a "respected user" and administrator create an article on My Sock Collection, you would judge its notability differently than you would an article on an anonymous user's sock collection?

The contributor's status has nothing to do with the article in question being 1) currently discussed on VfU 2) a recreation of content deleted by consensus on VfD and 3) not notable in its own right.

<p>To me, this looks like a common sense speedy. This is a POV rant who's purpose is to disparage a couple of books. However it's been tagged a couple times as such, and not yet been deleted.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This <i>is</i> actually speedyable as patent nonsense: there is no such place as "Forestnbushes, Ontario", and there is no such institution as "Low-Grade Carleton University"; both of those are sarcastic putdowns of the actual locations. This part is skirting the edge of reading like an attack: "He admires the wonders of communism and collectivism and at the same time he refuses to give up his pro-capitalism job at the second largest national bank or to move to a country that supports such ideology."

<dd>Yes, the article is rubbish, and should be deleted. But it is not even close to the patent nonsense criterion (and I'm not adverse to interpreting CSD <i>fairly</i> liberaly). Is this article one of <i>no meaningful content or history, text unsalvageably incoherent (e.g., random characters)</i>? No! 'Patent' means 'blindingly obvious' - not 'obvious to somone with some knowledge of the subject/area' or 'obvious after a little googling'. (And attack criteron requires <i>short articles that serve no purpose but to disparage their subject</i>, it is hardly that. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 21:37, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

And neither is the article an attempt to draw attention to the comic, it is simply contributing to the store of information that is Wikipedia.

<dd>Now, why is it that one comic creator can do this and have no wikipedian backlash while another cannot? I'm going to propose a few thoughts:
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>both these AfDs prove the utter uselessness of Alexa in determining a comic's popularity.</li>
<li>both of these comics have been around for a long time and have rather huge archives. They both unquestioningly meet proposal B and their non-compliance with the <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">regular proposal</a> is questionable at best.</li>
<li>I'm not going to use this page to refight <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Built_for_Comfort_79ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Built for Comfort">another comic's AfD</a>, but I will say this: <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a>, why don't you just lay off with the deletion votes? You obviously don't really know what you're talking about. Both this comic and the previous one have connections with Dayfree Press which, if you are unaware, is a rather large comic-publishing page. Both have readers who have been <i>spamming</i> their votes for deletion pages. But guess what? That means that they're both well-read. What's next?</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - "This webcomic is good!" is <i>not</i> an argument to keep. These webcomics are not being nominated for deletion because anyone thinks they suck or because of any other judgement call based on quality; they are being nominated for deletion because they are not encyclopedic subjects. If you're coming here because of a link from Jamie or this webcomic's creator (hey, Josh, surprised to see you here), instead of "voting" (and I assure you, this isn't a democratic election) I suggest you please establish newsworthiness or notability, or become resigned to the fact that this article is probably going to be transfered from Wikipedia to Comixpedia, where this sort of article belongs in the first place. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 03:34, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> 1) Jamie did not send people here. This is not Jamie's comic so the above comment is unwarrented. 2) Why does this article belong on Comixpedia and not Wikipedia?

Case and Point: Let me show you how flawed Alexa rankings are!!!</li>

<dd>My own comic, "8 1/2 by Eleven" publishes at <a href="http://www.lucastds.com/webcomic" class="external free" title="http://www.lucastds.com/webcomic" rel="nofollow">http://www.lucastds.com/webcomic</a>. According to Alexa, my site ranking is 334,578. That's actually pretty close to my comic being accepted as a noteworthy article by Wikipedia!! How deceiving is that ranking? Hmm... let's see! I'd venture to guess that Most People have not even ever <i>heard</i> of my comic. I've got about 500 readers a <i>week</i>. I'd bet anything that Able and Baker, which is WAY more respected in the webcartooning community than I am and is a member of <i>Dayfree Press</i> for goodness sake (which most people admit they must have heard of) has more readers than me. And yet, with a few more American Internet Explorer users reading my comic, I could warrant an entry in Wikipedia while Able and Baker can't. Able and Baker is SOMEHOW <b>way</b> farther down on the Alexa rankings. Who knows why? And you're wondering why this system is absurd to me? Please, someone create an encyclopedia entry about my comic!! The AfD would be hard to prove on that one, even though no one in the webcomic community has even <i>heard</i> of my comic. If my unknown comic could make it into Wikipedia, and <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> couldn't pull a delete on it because my glorious-all-bow-to-the-worshipfullness-Alexa-rating... oh man, that would make my day. *shakes head in disgust and walks away* --<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedzsee_8440.html" title="User:Tedzsee">Tedzsee</a> 04:41, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Establishing Notability</b>... just reread <b>A Man in Black</b>s "comment"... which in fact wasn't a comment at all, but a derisive note about how much he thinks this comic is non-notable. He might as well have placed a vote against the comic with that comment. Apparently, being a Dayfree Press member isn't notable enough for him... just as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Built_for_Comfort_79ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Built for Comfort">Built for Comfort</a> wasn't notable despite being mentioned on <a href="http://justsaying.biscuitpress.com" class="external text" title="http://justsaying.biscuitpress.com" rel="nofollow">Phil Kahn's</a> reading list etc etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>What counts as <b>notability</b> in the case of Able and Baker, then? Just an Alexa rating? Does being mentioned on <a href="http://www.comixpedia.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2011" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2011" rel="nofollow">Comixpedia's List of 25 people in webcomics 2004</a> give Able and Baker <b>notability</b>? Who knows. Apparently Alexa is the only thing that counts for notability around here. But then again, apparently Wikipedia editors don't consider rational arguments at all, and instead make derisive comments about comics despite a huge public outpour against deletion and several repeated comments establishing the notability of these comics that <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> seems to enjoy putting up for deletion so much.

<li>A one line mention by the dayfree press creator in a list of 25 people in 2004 is not notable. Huge public outpoor, how many websites out there cannot manage a "huge" public outpoor. Any forum with what 30 active members could contribute to a huge public outpoor. And a reply to some other posts made about me above, since when have any of my arguments been, this webcomic is rubbish, let's delete it because I don't like it. The reason for the my nomination is lack of notability, I don't just nominate randomly. For example, I didn't nominate <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venus_Envy_c4aa.html" title="Venus Envy">Venus Envy</a> a keenspace comic, because Google shows up some mention in the outside world. But in my eyes, just being part of a online comics group just isn't notable enough. And I've been accused of an over reliance on Alexa. You're right Tedzsee, I wouldn't nominate a comic with your ranking, because I know Alexa to be inaccurate. But I also know, that a reasonably popular website, no matter what kind, would have an Alexa ranking less than 1 million. I wouldn't put it past me, for some lame webcomic readers to install Alexa just to rank up their comic now&#160;:( - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 17:42, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChickendude_1ae3.html" title="User:Chickendude">Chickendude</a>. I figured out what was going on only after I did all the sorting. The trouble is that many fans, sent to personally secure the future of their webcomic's article, are impossible to tell from a bunch of sock puppets. Since we are <i>editing an encyclopedia</i>, we usually require people to have a general involvement in Wikipedia (as evidenced by having made edits aside from narrow, recent interest in one article) in order to make decisions about what is and isn't encyclopediac.

<p><b>Reply</b> "A one line mention by the dayfree press creator in a list of 25 people in 2004 is not notable" &lt;-- How is it not notable? Do you realize the source I am quoting is Comixpedia? Comixpedia is one of the most respected SOURCES of webcomic's journalism... Along with Digital Strips, Phil Kahn, the Webcomics Examiner and Websnark, it is basically the pillar of webcomics journalism. If you don't know that, and don't realize that being mentioned in an article by them is enough to make the comic notable, than I suggest you don't even bother voting in debates like this! As for <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a>'s remark that an article about my comic wouldn't be deleted because my Alexa number is respectable, I can only laugh now! Someone please create an article about my comic. What a riot!

<dd>Today, Able and Baker was linked to by <a href="../../../q/u/e/Questionable_Content_a910.html" title="Questionable Content">Questionable Content</a> in a completely unrelated-to-this-deletion-debate link. I still don't understand what constitutes this mysterious "notability" in the eyes of Wikipedia editors...
<ol>
<li>This comic has a dedicated fan base.</li>
<li>This comic is mentioned by a top webcomic journal.</li>
<li>This comic has huge archives and has been updating for several years.</li>
<li>This comic is a member of Dayfree Press, which is represented at every major webcomic convention.</li>
<li>This comic is linked to by a site with an Alexa rating of under 20,000.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>However, because this comic does not have an Alexa rating of under 200,000 itself, it is seen as non-notable. I don't understand the logic!! <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedzsee_8440.html" title="User:Tedzsee">Tedzsee</a> 05:43, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some possible responses to think about:
<ol>
<li>Doesn't it matter how big the fan base is? How can we tell that? (I'm asking the latter literally--can you suggest a good way to tell, besides Alexa?)</li>
<li>Top webcomic journal? That's not quite a newspaper, is it? It's about webcomics, so of course it will discuss many webcomics; more even, perhaps, than Wikipedia should have.</li>
<li>Lots of people have been doing lots of things for several years. I respect all of them, especially those who do things like writing a comic that require skills I'll never have. But still, is this notable in and of itself?</li>
<li>Dayfree Press might be notable on its own; that doesn't necessarily mean all its members should have separate articles.</li>
<li>Again, having a link from a notable site doesn't mean notability. It ought to depend on context, I think?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>To use an analogy, let me talk about something that doesn't deserve a Wikipedia article: <i>me</i>. However, I can say:
<ol>
<li>My name appears on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Science_Foundation_f301.html" title="National Science Foundation">National Science Foundation</a> website, and the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annals_of_Improbable_Research_2f3e.html" title="Annals of Improbable Research">Annals of Improbable Research</a> website, both of which I'm confident have excellent webtraffic ratings.</li>
<li>I have done physics research, day in and day out, for a number of years. All of this is documented and verifiable.</li>
<li>I am a member of the <a href="../../../a/_/t/A_Toroidal_LHC_ApparatuS_2b4c.html" title="A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS">A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS</a> collaboration, which is funded by several dozen countries to the tune of at least $500 Million.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>But still, I'm not notable at all! Should the standards for inclusion of webcomics be more lenient than those for people? Or <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">those for music</a>?</dd>
<dd>Perhaps the issue is that "notable for a webcomic" is a different standard than "notable for a general encyclopedia"--which is why there's a wiki site just for comics now. Please understand none of this is an attack on this comic in particular, it is part of a larger discussion on how many webcomics should be documented in the encyclopedia. (See <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a>.) -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 06:03, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>See, this is part of the problem. Being NOTABLE FOR A WEBCOMIC doesn't require that much. Webcomicking is a pretty small community. And, unfortunately for staunch Wikipedians, as their popularity picks up, I think that Wikipedia is going to face an increasing challenge regarding what sort of comics are seen as noteworthy. The main problem, however, is that Wikipedia's policy concerning webcomics is REALLY REALLY REALLY iffy. <a href="../../../a/b/l/Able_and_Baker_a7be.html" title="Able and Baker">Able and Baker</a> definitely meets both Alternate Proposals no prob. By association and notability in the webcomics community, it could be argued that the comic meets Proposal A as well, in a way. Really, the problem is with Wikipedia's policy. And I figure, until the policy gets sorted out in a firm manner, a campaign to simply oust every webcomic article deemed to be hangnails should be stopped. I'm not saying that you're attacking any particular comic, but I am saying that what is going on here really, in a way, contravenes the spirit of Wikipedia. As found on the <a href="../../../w/e/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EWeb_comics_f741.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Web comics">talk page</a> of webcomics, inclusion in NOTABLE collectives such as Dayfree Press and winners of awards and such are probably a good place to start with expanding Notability to something "based on something other than popularity or longevity". In the meantime, deleting possibly-notable comics while such bickering is going on seems to be rather sketch.</dd>
<dd>Also, it should be noted that mention in Websnark or Digital Strips or Comixpedia.com is rather like being mentioned in a top music mag in comparison. In terms of webcomic notability, it definitely a big plus. Whether this counts for anything in a "general encyclopedia" is what is in question. However, as I said, if this encyclopedia is going to include webcomics at all, then it should include webcomics that are deemed noteworthy by the webcomicking community. And I think there's no question that this one is. --<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedzsee_8440.html" title="User:Tedzsee">Tedzsee</a> 07:17, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>One other thing... the argument about YOU being non-notable is an interesting one. See the above discussion with <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> comparing MY comic to the <a href="../../../a/b/l/Able_and_Baker_a7be.html" title="Able and Baker">Able and Baker</a> article to see the futility of using an Alexa-based system to verify the importance of a webcomic. According to <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a>, an article on my comic would be difficult to delete because of its Alexa ranking despite my comic not being notable at all in the webcomic community. It should be noted that if enough people undertook to write an article about your scientific research and work, and could back it up and connect you to the top names in the scientific community and you were working with those top names in some sort of collective, you might very well be notable if you had an effect on the small area of study that you were researching. Certainly, if you were cited by a top scientist (the way, say <a href="../../../a/b/l/Able_and_Baker_a7be.html" title="Able and Baker">Able and Baker</a> was linked to today by <a href="../../../q/u/e/Questionable_Content_a910.html" title="Questionable Content">QC</a> and mentioned in a list of 25 notables last year on Comixpedia and working with a collective such as <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayfree_Press_6295.html" title="Dayfree Press">Dayfree</a>, I'm sure the argument could be made that you were notable in your community. This is essentially the argument that I am making. If that makes sense... --<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedzsee_8440.html" title="User:Tedzsee">Tedzsee</a> 07:24, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps it isn't obvious, but the criteria at <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> are <i>proposed</i>, and the "alternate proposals" are not generally recognized as being workable by the community as a whole--see, for comparison, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. The main proposal is no good either, because of problems with Alexa, but it aknowledges the important fact that a webcomic must have a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiably</a> exceptional readership base (if no other verifiable assertion of notability is given). Anyway, there are some regular wikipedia editors who feel that the most lenient proposals are appropriate, and they're the ones who work (and write their views) on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_eab2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics</a>. Consensus on this issue is still being built, though, so you can't take what anyone says as authority.</dd>
<dd>I do have to say that being in the top webcomic mag is a very different thing from being in a top music mag, based on basic things like total readership--my point is precisely that only the <i>most</i> notable webcomics meet the general Wikipedia notability criteria.</dd>
<dd>As for criteria based on things other than popularity or longevity, I'd love to hear them!

<li>Yes, amazing isn't it. Tedszee mentioned it up above, but one of <a href="../../../a/b/l/Able_and_Baker_a7be.html" title="Able and Baker">Able and Baker</a>'s claim to fame is being mentioned in a top 25 list. Can I clarify that it was mentioned once in passing, and the actual top 25 list was referring to the founder of the <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayfree_Press_6295.html" title="Dayfree Press">Dayfree Press</a>, who just said that Able and Baker was a new cartoon. It has been compared to being mentioned in a music magazine, that does not make it notable. How many bands have been mentioned in music magazines that no one will ever hear about, and no one will be influenced by? How many bands have had their recordings played once or twice on the late John Peel's show at 1am in the morning? What about all the unsigned bands which get a song or 2 onto XFM? Being a member of the Dayfree Press does not mean instant notability, the comics should be assessed one by one, and assert it's own notability. Just as a band on the same record label as <a href="../../../m/o/b/Moby.html" title="Moby">Moby</a> doesn't mean it's instantly notable, and a book published by the same company which publishes <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> isn't notable. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 14:10, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hanchen's attempt to get another point in nonwithstanding, what happened is that the comic in question linked directly to this AfD page, and told everyone to "come tell them what you think." Thus we had a bunch of newbies who looked like sockpuppets to me, so I noted them. Then, when I realized my "mistake" (I still think the info is useful), I tried to explain what was going on to the newbies actively editing the page.

<p>I am renominating this page for deletion, asking editors to reconsider whether they kept it before partly based on the rudeness of the subject. The fact that he doesn't want the article is not enough reason to keep it.</p>
<p>Additionally, I should note that the article seems entirely and completely unverifiable. We say that he's a controversial martial artist, but is he? Does he even exist? Is there a newspaper article or any credible source? Those who are complaining against him, do they exist? Is there a newspaper article or any credible source?</p>
<p>What I see here is a fight from elsewhere which has spilled over into Wikipedia. None of the participants seem at all notable by any external measure.

<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Jimbo, I am a little confused by your blanket assertion of "unverifiable". Are you claiming that we can know nothing at all about Ashida Kim? Yes, he is a fictitious Internet persona. But he has given his name to many, many things, and this has made him quite well-known; most of the facts on the page right now are verifiable. He has published books, for instance; I can probably look up the ISBN numbers. How is that not verifiable? I myself knew of Ashida Kim well before I had ever heard of Bullshido.</li>
<li>The article has <i>just</i> been through a VfD, which ended in a <b>keep</b> consensus by a rather large margin. I don't think it's a good idea to re-nominate it so soon, and--regardless of any other considerations--I would vote keep on principle, just based on this.</li>
<li>The same reason I gave in the original VfD. Ashida Kim is <i>very</i> notable in martial arts communities; not just Bullshido. Like it or not, he has made a name for himself, and he should have an article on Wikipedia. I agree that the article is not ideal, and needs a healthy injection of facts and NPOV. I do <i>not</i> consider that a valid reason for deleting it, however. Wikipedia is about improving imperfect articles, not deleting them. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshenai_68df.html" title="User talk:Ashenai">talk</a>) 18:10, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I see no real sense in which he has made a name for himself. If he's so notable in martial arts circles, where are the articles about him in mainstream martial arts magazines?

<li>Let's refresh what just happened over the past few weeks. The <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashida_Kim_6a74.html" title="Ashida Kim">Ashida Kim</a> article goes up. Much screaming ensues. The article gets nominated for deletion, and is kept. In a fit of pique, Ashida Kim threatens Jimbo, and posts Jimbo's name, home address, and other personal details on his message board. And then, Jimbo comes along one week after the decision to keep is made, and nominates it for deletion again? Jimbo, I'm absolutely certain that you didn't do this because of Kim's threats, but honestly, this was the worst possible timing <b>imaginable</b>. Can you imagine what it would look like if we ended up deleting the article now? For the next six months, every POV warrior with an axe to grind would post your personal details in the hope of getting you to knuckle under and intercede on their behalf. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshenai_68df.html" title="User talk:Ashenai">talk</a>) 18:10, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm sympathetic to what you're saying, but frankly, threats to me are completely irrelevant to keeping or deleting the article. If we keep it because I'm mad at him and concerned that other POV warriors will stoop to his dishonorable tactics, we're not being NPOV. All I ask is that we not do the opposite, either. Let's consider the evidence: is he notable? Do we have anything to say about him that doesn't come from his own silly website or that of 'bullshido' or a random flamewar?--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 21:06, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I quite agree, and I was myself dismayed at the number of votes that essentially boiled down to "keep because we'll never give in!" in the last AfD. But while Ashida Kim is not notable as a martial artist (perhaps the reason why he's not in any martial arts magazines), he certainly is notable as a crackpot, a neo-ninja, and a fraud (excuse the POV, please). I don't know how much verifiable information there is on him; I don't frequesnt Bullshido, and I'm not an expert on Ashida Kim at all. But the man has written, what, 16 books? Books that received wide circulation, and have had independent reviews written. That <b>alone</b> would, I think, be a strong argument for keeping the article.</dd>
<dd>I don't know what can be verified, and what can't. I'm quite ready to help rewrite the entire article as needed; Ashida Kim's a very colourful personality, and perhaps the flashy flamewars have skewed the article's focus. But I am convinced that <b>he deserves an article</b>, as a known author of ninja books, if nothing else. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshenai_68df.html" title="User talk:Ashenai">talk</a>) 21:44, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Why haven't we deleted <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> yet? Is it just that the Church of Scientology hasn't made enough threats yet?

<li><b>Keep</b> though I doubt my vote will count for much. To portray this as a feud between "Ashida Kim" and Bullshido is a gross misunderstanding of the situation. Bullshido's investigation into this individual was done simply to determine the facts involved, and the facts can easily be verified by anyone wishing to check the sources. I understood Wikipedia to be a repository for information, so I'm confused as to why it would seek to censor information simply because it is controversial. Is it possible that the thinly-veiled threats against certain people are being taken seriously? It's the only explanation I can fathom. --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhrost_6b8d.html" title="User:Phrost">Phrost</a> 21:23, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Martial arts is practiced by a large percentage of people, both in America and abroad. This guy has probably made more money off Ninjitsu than anyone else in the United States.

<dd>Thank you for your vote, 141.131.3.22! However, it appears that this is only your second edit here at Wikipedia. Unfortunately, you have to be an established editor before we can count your vote.

<dd>That was very polite, and thus I'm sorry to say that it's wrong to start although it ends correctly. This isn't a <i>vote</i> per se, it's a <i>discussion</i>. Anyone, even new or anonymous editors can join the discussion. It's more correct to say that points of view expressed without supporting rational are likely to be given less weight by the closing admin if they are from new or unknown editors. Pedantic?

<dd>Had the Anon merely contributed something like "Keep, per Ashenai", I would expect that this contribution would be ignored because all it added to the process was one vote -- &amp; there's no way that it could be proven that it <i>wasn't</i> a sockpuppet.

The articles are available to anyone with access to a Nexis news/media search engine. He is clearly a notable figure within the martial arts community. I find it odd that many who are not a part of this community seem to be expressing a contrary opinion without much justification for doing so.

<li>"Ashida Kim" has been a topic of discussion and controversy on the internet since at least 1991. Definately not notable yet</li>
<li>He's a crackpot claiming to have mystical powers. Fine - but the question is here can he really claim the amount of notariety we have for our threshold? The article does not seem to back this up with references, other than a link <a href="http://www.bullshido.net/modules.php?name=Reviews&amp;file=viewreview&amp;id=160" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bullshido.net/modules.php?name=Reviews&amp;file=viewreview&amp;id=160" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> - which means that basically he notariety consists of being debunked by bullshido.net which in and of itself does not merit notability.</li>
<li>As O^O mentions, he has mentions in "The Believer" and a daily austrialian newspaper/periodical (speaking of which, was it an article about him in the newspaper/periodical?) . This is definately the point that might merit his inclusion. However, it is no "slam dunk", and one would think that if he really has attained such notariety he would a lot more than this - so I'd argue that while he might need a mention somewhere, he doesn't merit his own article (maybe in "List of martial arts crackpots"&#160;:)).</li>

<dd>Well, that's why we're arguing about whether they're <i>notable</i> books or not. They have had significant circulation; why would you say they are not notable? Arguments against, so far, were "if they really were truly notable they'd already have articles here", "the books here are very similar in verifiability to [a DVD film that was deleted]", and "at least one of the books wasn't even a book" (based, I assume, on its binding). I just don't find any of those three arguments very convincing. The argument for is simply that the books have achieved considerable circulation, which, to me, seems enough. But I'm very willing to consider further arguments against, of course. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshenai_68df.html" title="User talk:Ashenai">talk</a>) 23:31, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I respect Jimbo, but don't necessarily agree 100% with him. We should apply the same criteria to Ashida Kim as anyone else, and the published books, the wealth of Internet interest and opinion about this guy, etc., clearly establish him as notable and a public figure. I don't even think it's a close call. And, this was all hashed out recently in an AfD, and it's not like that AfD didn't bring out all the arguments pro and con, so I can't see bringing it up again mere days/weeks later. If there are POV problems with the article, they can &amp; should be fixed in the time-honored manner. I hate to say it, but this new AfD seems more based on Wikipedia politics than on actual merit of the article's existence.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Just because the truth seems to be particularly unfavorable towards Mr. "Kim" doesn't mean we should delete the article because he whines about it. If he can contest any of the article's veracity and back up his claims with proof then let him do so. Plus, I think it would set a terrible precedent for Wikipedia to delete an article under a hailstorm of criticism. Additionally, he does own his own business and is proven to be the author of many books and at the very least appears on his website&#160;; keep in mind that we have articles for Shmorky, <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lowtax.html" title="Lowtax">Lowtax</a>, Fragmaster and other internet personalities as well. <a href="../../../w/e/l/User%7EWellsLaRivi%C3%A8re_dec4.html" title="User:WellsLaRivière">WellsLaRivière</a> 23:07, 5 October 2005</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Voted on negative precedent potential. First, to take away possibly valuable information regarding internet personalities who are significant to large circles (<a href="../../../l/o/w/Lowtax.html" title="Lowtax">Lowtax</a>, Shmorky, Fragmaster etc. Second, to allow for complaints from the subjects of fact-based criticism to destroy articles. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshwinr_347a.html" title="User:Ashwinr">Ashwinr</a></li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I don't see any reason to remove this article. He's pretty definitively a personality of sufficient note to have an article and if nothing else the article should stay on the basis of truth. Wikipedia keeps to NPOV to show the unbiased truth, and if the unbiased truth is that somebody is a liar who steals people's money via confidence games, then removing a page showing evidence of his fraudulent claims would be de facto support. --Talain 00:30, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't really like going against our Glorious Leader on this, but the subject <i>does</i> seem to have achieved a degree of notability -- in a fairly specialized community, granted, but that is no bar to inclusion. His books (whether self-published or not; the ownership of the publishing company hasn't really been established here) are, by statement of several editors, available widely in both online and "real-world" book stores (I'll take their word for it; I haven't gone looking for them myself).

<li><b>No vote, and Objection</b>. This is a completely improper and specious re-listing for AfD. If Jimbo wishes to delete this article, he should simply do so as a part of his prerogative. Our time is being wasted with a 2nd AfD following so closely on the heels of another where there was overwhelming consensus to keep. Like many others above, I am also concerned by the <b>appearance</b> of Jimbo's actions here.

You can't have an encyclopedia that anyone can edit and then suggest that every fact needs to be recorded in a peer-reviewed journal edited by Nobel prize winners. The notability of Ashida Kim simply isn't in question: he gets 18,800 google hits and he is the author of numerous books on the martial arts. If he wasn't a Wikipedia trouble-maker, his <b>verifiability</b> would never be in question, but because he starts blanking his own article and attacking user pages, suddenly we need to prove his very existence with the most unreasonable of standards for the kind of subject he is. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func">Func</a>( <a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func">t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Func_dbc4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Func">c</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Func_6e40.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Func">@</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;user=Func" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;user=Func" rel="nofollow">&#160;</a>) 14:37, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In this case, I took 'vote' in its common WikiVernaculear term to mean "the expression of an opinion in a consensus-seeking context." I think this was a fairly light breach of strict termonological correctness but nothing really heinous. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 01:28, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>My concern is that this is reductionist. This makes User:Ring Foo's "Delete, crap" count exatcly the same as User:Fing Roo's "Keep, as per seven published works, here are the ISBN's...". Or maybe I should just get off my high horse and kill the bug up my bum, eh? ^_^<br />

<li>I find that a reasonable concern, yeah, and there's no doubt it's not a good word, but I've learned to live with it just because it's so immediately what comes to mind. Anybody who's been here for very long has heard this very discussion about nine trillion times anyway.&#160;:P <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 01:43, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Meh. Let's not argue about the nomenclature, that never gets anyone anywhere. Substitute "discussing" for "voting" in my original message, above; it changes nothing.</li>
<li>This <b>is</b> reductionist; I collated some stats that I think may be useful. I'd certainly advise anyone against only looking at the lists, and ignoring the debate. Again, I just provided data. If the admin closing this debate finds any of this data useful, great! If not, he or she is free to ignore it. But for instance, if the admin sees an argument from, say, me, and wants to know how much experience I have with Wikipedia, I've made the information easier to find. That's really all I wanted to do.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshenai_68df.html" title="User talk:Ashenai">talk</a>) 22:43, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>[Regarding Marksell incorrectly being given 663 edits] Actually <b>2100+</b> edits. If mine is wrong I don't know about the others; don't mean to disparage the work but I think this is a bad idea.</p>

<li>Mine was fine, maybe a one off? --<a href="../../../j/i/f/User%7EJiFish_180b.html" title="User:JiFish">JiFish</a>(<a href="../../../j/i/f/User_talk%7EJiFish_ceec.html" title="User talk:JiFish">Talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JiFish_b9a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JiFish">Contrib</a>) 00:24, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As long as the vote counts for relatively new users are correct, it doesn't matter. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:41, 7 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wha?! If you look at yours and find it wrong you naturally distrust the others. Of course it matters. I'd love to say I'm going to check all of these myself but it's late on my end so I have to assume it was done properly. It wasn't done properly on mine so I can't assume that!</li>
<li>In general what's the implication: that 10 000 matters more than 1000? One hundred matters more than one but two orders of magnitude beyond that I think it irrelevant. List the users who have under a dozen, particularly those who have <i>only</i> voted on this (and discount them when keeping/deleting) and save yourself the rest of work . <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 00:58, 7 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My apologies for the error; it's been fixed. I accidentally used the "distinct pages edited" count for you instead of the "total edits" stat. I double-checked everyone, and found that I made the same mistake for Tony Sidaway and Nickptar; both are now fixed. Everyone else seems fine, and I can guarantee the correctness of the numbers to +/- 5%, at worst.&#160;:)</li>
<li>As to its implication: like I said above, I am not trying to imply anything. I listed what I believed to be pertinent stats. What to infer (if anything) from these stats is up to the admin(s). --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshenai_68df.html" title="User talk:Ashenai">talk</a>) 22:37, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This is definitely a neologism, and the internal references like "hollywood stop" are neologisms -- or at least they're generic across geographic areas (I might characterize Michigan drivers or Atlanta drivers in the same way).

<p>I object. Ostensible Magazine is a real magazine with a distribution of over 2,000. It has featured interviews with prominent musicians, scholars and artists. It has a website and it has even won the Aiko Underground Press award for best new publication in Tokyo in 2004. Though it is a sort of "vanity" to put in entries linking it's creators to it's main entry, certainly they all have a purpose together and certainly Ostensible deserves it's own page.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> The web 2.1 concept is interesting, and the conference is a great idea, but Wikipedia is not the place for proposals or speculation.

<li><b>Keep</b> Without a widely accepted definition of what Web 2.0 was/is, that entry has existed quite a long time. I think the 65 or so people who will be attending the event and the sponsors who have put up thousands of dollars might think this was worthwhile of an entry. It allows for the domain experts to create a definitive place for the material on this subject matter. It may one day read that this was an idea whose time was soon eclipsed by Web 3.0, but for now it is the center of the discussion on what is next. Who decides when it becomes a generally accepted term?

<dd>Most of what you list are articles about slang, and thus they belong, even if they include examples - the articles have meat beyond their lists. Drug slang and Hip hop slang are double redirects and should be fixed. Of the ones that are not articles, but are simply <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" title="WP:NOT">lists of slang terms</a>, none have been up more than 7 months, and only Boston slang and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_gay_terminology.html" title="Singapore gay terminology">Singapore gay terminology</a> have been up more than 3 months - this leads me to believe that they simply have not <i>yet</i> been AfD'd. The latter I will AfD myself, since it wouldn't belong in an English language encyclopedia even if there was no list-of-slang policy. Of the remainder, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Street_slang_aa31.html" title="Catholic Street slang">Catholic Street slang</a> (which, if kept, should be moved to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_street_slang.html" title="Catholic street slang">Catholic street slang</a> unless it is the slang used on Catholic Street), <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_slang.html" title="Baseball slang">Baseball slang</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_slang.html" title="Military slang">Military slang</a>, and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_slang.html" title="Professional wrestling slang">Professional wrestling slang</a> are the ones with short article histories that could conceivably be cleaned up enough to salvage as articles; there should be numerous sources on each of the last three, and a potential sociological angle on the first (remains to be seen if that can be done without violating <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_slang.html" title="Canadian slang">Canadian slang</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_slang.html" title="Gay slang">Gay slang</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_slang.html" title="Sexual slang">Sexual slang</a> (redir to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sexual_slang.html" title="List of sexual slang">List of sexual slang</a>), and <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_parts_slang.html" title="Body parts slang">Body parts slang</a> are all less than 2 months old, and should not live to see 3.</dd>
<dd>In short, for these reasons, I don't think your examples support your argument, especially given your stated position on list cruft. The existence of violations of policy does not negate the policy, any more than the continued existence of criminality negates the law. This seems particularly applicable in this case given the probability that the "police" have simply not caught wind of the "crimes" in question yet. For this list, IMHO, even if the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> issues can be cleaned (assuming anyone is even interested in doing the work) it will still fail <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. --<a href="../../../k/g/f/User%7EKgf0_e092.html" title="User:Kgf0">Kgf0</a> 23:57, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Article could be improved, certainly: NPOV, it's a bit too Melbourne-centric at the moment (the reference to the Megabar is just too obscure), a better introductory paragraph explaining the derisory nature of many terms, better references (there are plenty of books which could be used - see main <a href="../../../g/o/t/Goth.html" title="Goth">Goth</a> article, forum logs just won't do).

<li><s><b>Keep</b>. I will assert that he was a notable philosopher. That his obituary contains description of being "the most intense person that I have ever met," written by notable thinker and commentator on society and technology, <a href="../../../l/a/n/Langdon_Winner_ea65.html" title="Langdon Winner">Langdon Winner</a>, lends credence to this. Jerzy's comments regarding "unorginal works" do not add anything constructive to this discussion. That Gibson's only item listed under Original Works--since changed to Publications-- was published posthumously is irrelevant. Chris Gibson was an important figure on the modern American literary and philosophical scene. A walking encyclopedia in his own right, meeting the definition of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polyhistor.html" title="Polyhistor">polyhistor</a> if not <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">polymath</a>, he certainly belongs in wikipedia. The "notability" of his life is already attested to by the numerous external links, containing references to his life and work from publications in New York, Chicago, Portland, OR and San Luis Obispo, CA. I also do not understand how copyvio now only mostly resolved, as the original publisher granted permission on the articles talk page. And in any case, although the initial template for this article was based on his obituary, significant revisions have already been undertaken. Granted, it may require further additions and clarifications. That Google does not produce many hits on his full name could be due to the fact that he often did not go by his full name.<br />

<li>I risk distraction by several red herrings, in addressing them:
<dl>
<dd>_ _ To quote without the misspelling you introduced, and with relevant context, i said, parenthetically, "... unoriginal works, but nevermind]", bcz i thot the point too minor to make in a way that would invite effort to respond to it; as to "[nothing] constructive", i suppose you are free to regard anything you disagree with as unconstructive. Since you have taken issue with that throw-away thot, i point out its relevance to the air of vagueness and the bizarre that pervades the assertions of Gibson's notability. You quote "the most intense person that I [the eulogist] have ever met", and i have two reactions. One is to recall the description of Spinal Tap's status among the English heavy-metal bands: "certainly the [skipped beat] <i>loudest</i>", and to wonder whether the eulogist was conscious of damning with faint praise. The other is to wonder whether the eulogist was deficient in experience with under-medicated schizophrenics, or whether Gibson, who ended arguements by screaming obscenities, said he wanted to die, and did so by drowning in the dark, perhaps <i>was</i> an under-medicated schizophrenic. I hasten to add that schizophrenia, even under-medicated, doesn't preclude notability; still, it can interfere with attaining it, and a brilliant schizophrenic IMO can attract a sympathy that makes it hard to keep clear the distinction between achieving notability and being brilliant enough to deserve a notability that the schizophrenia denies them.</dd>
<dd>_ _ Your being non-plussed by my other parenthetical (tho i would hope it made clear that the subject as not germane to the purpose of this page) is understandable, as i was intentionally terse. I needed to mention it as being no longer germane, since an unresolved Copyvio problem precludes consideration under AfD; i thought this one might still be technically unresolved, since i had read an instruction earlier this week that permissions (i.e., placings of works under GFDL by a copyright holder who did not perform the relevant edit) should be directed to the WP publicity dept, rather than e.g. being placed on the talk page. I did not feel at liberty to give the impression that everything was taken care of, when there was no indication of that step being taken. (FWIW, i've since seen suggestions to put permissions on the corresponding talk pages, without mention of Pub Dept., so my scruple may have been unnecessary. [shrug]).<br />

<dd><s>In addition, Jerzy's references regarding the events which kept Chris Gibson's work from being published before his death are misleading, if not inaccurate. Reviewing the available information in the refereces shows that the article was not lost, but the publisher's computer crashed and all files were unreachable. Gibson was approached prior to his death for an additional copy, but stated "I don't save things because it increases my natural tendency towards self-deleteriousness." This is very much in keeping with his philosophy revealed on even a superficial reading of his text Wages of Insomnia, which coins the phrase "Profligate Metaphysic." The text was later recovered using software that could salvage material on the hard-drive. Admittedly this article is overly detailed. However deletion is too harsh a penalty for the long-windedness of the submitter.<br />

<dd>_ _ (It's time for me to risk rubbing salt in a wound by calling a spade a spade: If he ever published anything else, one of you should have bloody well said so before now. I assume he did not. ... Yet, you also should have been gracious enough to say explicitly "While it's true that he never published anything, ...", and i may be trusting something obvious but false. But the first full calendar day is almost half gone, so time is a-wasting. Onward.)</dd>
<dd>_ _ Well. I actually made a fool of myself by consulting my dictionary to be sure that <i>lost</i> has verifiable senses like "ruined or destroyed" and "no longer possessed", <i>before</i> re-reading <a href="http://www.contrarymagazine.com/ChrisGibson.html" class="external text" title="http://www.contrarymagazine.com/ChrisGibson.html" rel="nofollow">Chris Gibson, philosopher, 1954-2005</a>. Congratulations, you sucker-punched me: he says "I <i>lost</i> [emphasis added by <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a>•<a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">t</a>] the file when I transferred data from the old computer on which I'd received his essay to the new one on which we built the magazine." Now, i'm not going to beat you up with a technical discussion about what it takes to lose sectors without scraping the oxide off the platter, and the claims that Apple software protects you against what MS carelessly doesn't, and how i've read and altered raw sectors on an IBM PC long before this file got lost. Our <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spotlight_%28software%29.html" title="Spotlight (software)">Spotlight (software)</a> feature list may be out of date, and i admit "unindexed bowels of the hard drive" would be more accurately used to mean "lost sectors" than (what i inferred at my first reading) "cryptically named files that you can only locate in a content search". Nor do we need the missing <i>contemporaneous</i> accounts of whether he "grimaced for three years at the loss."</dd>
<dd>_ _ That's bcz we have what we need at hand: There was a time when he had no way of recovering the essay. Then there came a time when he had "the penetrating vision of a new search technology", but did not use it. Then, the day he got word, "suppos[ing] the irony appropriate" would no longer wash, and the same day, it stopped being lost. If your belief is that the period of not using the available technology was insignificant in length compared to a day, you should cite something more convincing than this eulogy as evidence.</dd>
<dd>_ _ Because here's the picture i find most plausible: [Repeat N times, on N visits:] "Gibson, you should really write some of this down." "- - - ". [Visit N+1:] " ... and now I can be your publisher." "OK, you asked for it." "Oop, send another copy." "Sorry, no gots." [Some selection from the following:] "It was good, give me more of whatever catches your fancy." "Why don't i publish me interviewing you on the same subject?" "I wish i'd read more than the first and the final 'graphs, so i could interview you on the same subject." "Why don't i publish me interviewing you on the another subject of your choosing?" "Here's a tape recorder, do some raconting and i'll be your editor." [One selection from the following, for each of the preceding:] "No." "Maybe." "Not now." [Repetition of these exchanges, with decreasing frequency.] "Grimace." [Once only:] "Regret to inform you..." [Whatever:] "Gosh, he's dead, why him and not me?" "Could I have been more helpful in pulling together something publishable?" "Could I have made his death less likely?" "Well, at least i can get off my ass and try to recover the file again." In a line, there's been no evidence that his intellect was stunning enuf to produce another essay, or a fistful of aphorisms, or to motivate recovery of the essay a week, a month, or a year before grief or survivor guilt had an opportunity to change the subjective situation, where the objective situation was on a clear track toward him either dying, in a "timely" or untimely fashion, but in any case unpublished.</dd>
<dd>_ _ So it appears he impressed a bunch of first-hand acquaintances -- something loads of physicians, and pastors, and community-theater actors, and really cool mail carriers do, without becoming notable -- and produced an essay that has not yet had a chance to get evaluated in the cold light of day. In the unlikely event that a single essay is compelling enough to develop him a following, or that one of the first-hand acquaintances can produce a memoir that develops him (rather than the memoirist) a following, that will not be clear until others, less willing than i to speak ill of the recently dead, have their chance to mull and then speak. In a world where a million people amount to small change, the claim that acquaintances can make you notable does little more than impeach the credibility of those who present it.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b>. First of all, he went by "Chris Gibson." Try googling ["Chris Gibson" philosopher]. He was more than simply a philosopher. Raconteur is a title he wore just as well. It is true that Mr. Gibson is not yet widely known nor widely published, but the same facts were true of Vincent van Gogh when he died. It is a consequence of Mr. Gibson's embodiment of his philosophy that he did not participate in the culture nor the orthodoxies of philosophy, academia, publishing, nor much else in society. Nonetheless, the brilliance and originality of his mind is recognized by a select few and by all accounts an increasing number. Check with Langdon Winner, professor of humanities at Rensselaer University. <a href="http://www.langdonwinner.org/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.langdonwinner.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.langdonwinner.org/index.html</a> This is a good opportunity for Wikipedia to rise above the tyranny of the mundane order that decides who gets famous, instead of appealing to it as a justification for reproducing it.

<li><b>Point Taken</b>, and it's your encyclopedia after all. I'm sorry to be a "meat puppet," if that's what I am; I only entered the conversation because I was asked to clear the copyright, which I was happy to do for Wikipedia. And I confess to misunderstanding the mission of Wikipedia. I thought it meant to be larger and more inclusive and not necessarily to conform to the confines of the standard paper versions. Because it would be easier to just scan in the Brittanica after all. I'll mind my own business. Jeff McMahon<br />
<ul>
<li><s><b>I like this...</b>I suppose it forces me to take a step back and consider whether or not I should have any interest whatsoever in Wikipedia's mission. Apparently, this place is unwilling to admit anything that is not already widely accepted. What is its purpose then, really, other than to satisfy the needs of amateurs and hobbyists who find pleasure in cataloging and arranging articles and facts? I put up another couple of articles, out of boredom one evening (just that hobbyist's inclination to catalog something). I stuck in an article on <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Brombaugh_b1a9.html" title="John Brombaugh">John Brombaugh</a> and another organ builder (<a href="../../../h/e/n/Hendrik_Niehoff_0905.html" title="Hendrik Niehoff">Hendrik Niehoff</a>, 16th century Dutch) than I learned about by studying Chris Gibson's life and work. I stuck in another couple of articles as well: one on an artist whose works I admire and another on an interesting, but somewhat unknown song by Woody Guthrie. But truthfully, if Wikipedia is stictly the province of mirroring accepted dogma, my time may well be best spent pursuing other, more fruitful endeavors.<br />

<li>_ _ At the risk of rudely appearing to respond to two people as if i thot they were of one mind, i'm going to address some common threads between DL &amp; JM'M. And worse yet, compare their situation to my own, vaguely similar, initial response.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>_ _ My reaction was "Nice that i found what i needed, but i <i>don't</i> need a WiccaPedia." -- falsely assuming that "Wiki" was just a cognate of "wicca" and "witchcraft". I had to stumble on WP a few more times before i realized <i>anything</i> about what it is, and edit for months before beginning to suspect its significance.</dd>
<dd>_ _ The WP issues that you each are raising are ripples on an ocean. While such numbers <i>prove</i> nothing important, something about that ocean is hinted at by Alexa rankings: IMDb <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=3m&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=wikipedia.org&amp;y=t&amp;url=http://www.imdb.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=3m&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=wikipedia.org&amp;y=t&amp;url=http://www.imdb.com" rel="nofollow">tied WP on only 3 days</a> in the last 3 weeks, and can be expected to drop increasingly far behind; WP's starting to <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=3m&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=wikipedia.org&amp;y=t&amp;url=http://www.craigslist.org" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=3m&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=wikipedia.org&amp;y=t&amp;url=http://www.craigslist.org" rel="nofollow">contend w/ Craigslist</a>. Those are (depending on the timescale you look at) 40th to 43rd and 32 to 34 on the whole Web, and 23 and 18 among English-language sites. (Compare with caution: WP is 40% foreign languages.) I usually can stop myself before i say "a new force of nature", but WP is certainly a phenomenon sui generis; while i have only suspicions about what it means, i feel confident that you two have so far almost nothing but misconceptions about it; my guess is that even if you walk away at this point, it's going to tap you on the shoulder sooner rather than later.</dd>
<dd>_ _ I'm gonna shut up quickly, but the last things i need to say are
<ol>
<li>the issues you are raising are so far from central that if WP's approach started changing in that respect tomorrow (<i>started</i>, bcz WP changes course like a supertanker), i'd go "tsk; too bad", shrug, and carry on with my work here;</li>
<li>almost <i>no</i> decision affects the big picture, except the choice of MediaWiki as infrastructure, GFDL, and NPoV;</li>
<li>this all has to have a lot to do with information "wanting" to be true and free (tho i am no expert on those theories).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>And IMO explaining in any detail why i believe that would be an arrogant waste of our time. I dunno if they get it in Peoria, but the points you raise convince me you're going discover it for yourself before too long, with &gt;90% probability.<br />

<ul>
<li>BTW, abt the "meatpuppet" thing (mentioned in JM'M's first sentence, above), the term itself is IMO a more offensive one than "sock puppet", applied to a less offensive behavior, and i wish i had promptly objected to an editor raising their "annoy[ance]" (below) as being contrary to our policy of "not biting the newcomers" (whether or not i may have strayed into that as well). It suppose it annoys me somewhat too, but i'm opposed to complaining about it, bcz it's part of the "cost of doing business" rather than being the result of bad behavior, and there's no point in complaining about it as if the newcomers were in the wrong.<br />
