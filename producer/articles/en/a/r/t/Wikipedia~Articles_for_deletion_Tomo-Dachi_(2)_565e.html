<p>Event has only achieved less than 500 attendants last year, has not been updated to its best since the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tomo-Dachi_47cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tomo-Dachi">last AfD</a>, and doesn't appear that much content is available for the article.&#160;:: <em><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Keigher_bca8.html" title="User:Colin Keigher">Colin Keigher</a></em> <font color="red"><b>(<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_Keigher_2a62.html" title="User talk:Colin Keigher">Talk</a>)</b></font> 08:30, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Previous AFD: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tomo-Dachi_47cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tomo-Dachi">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tomo-Dachi</a> — result: <b>keep</b></dd>

<dl>
<dd><b>Keep</b> I would like to protest the decision to suggest this article for deletion for a second time. Since its last proposal, the article has improved tremendously; it has achieved a 'B' rating from the 'WikiProject Anime and manga' and has been edited and added to by at least a dozen people.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The convention is small, but so are most conventions in the United Kingdom, most of which have their own articles which have never been prompted for deletion. This is also the largest and first convention on the island of Ireland and is recognized for that fact across the British Isles and beyond. I have put a lot of work into this article, as a lot of other people have so please forgive me for sounding more than a little upset here. I vote <b>no</b>, however I don’t know if my vote can count. <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButch-cassidy_450c.html" title="User:Butch-cassidy">Butch-cassidy</a> 11:11, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I stand corrected, I see you have gone through most of the UK's conventions and proposed most of them for deletion. <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButch-cassidy_450c.html" title="User:Butch-cassidy">Butch-cassidy</a> 11:32, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The previous AfD was put up for deletion in suspected bad faith. However, even if it is Northern Ireland's only anime con, it still doesn't establish notoriety because it has less than 500 attendants and is only had one year. I have only put up a handful of UK events, because if you take a look at <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minami_Con_3270.html" title="Minami Con">Minami Con</a>, you'll notice that it has less than 500 attendants, but because it is the oldest in the country, I ignored it.</dd>
<dd>Also, there is no bias here just in case--I am an Irish citizen as well as Canadian. Any UK or Irish con is being put up due to its notoriety. Being the first convention on the isle doesn't establish notoriety simply because it is not the first UK con, which Northern Ireland is a part of. If this convention was say in Cork or Dublin, then I'd be leaving it alone.&#160;:: <em><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Keigher_bca8.html" title="User:Colin Keigher">Colin Keigher</a></em> <font color="red"><b>(<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_Keigher_2a62.html" title="User talk:Colin Keigher">Talk</a>)</b></font> 18:16, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have to completely disagree with you. Tomo-Dachi was the first anime convention to ever be held on the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island_of_Ireland_ae49.html" title="Island of Ireland">Island of Ireland</a> which is a separate entity to any political borders; even Wikipedia has its own article on the Island as well as the countries that are on it. By your logic a convention could never claim to be the first on <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> because one side is Turkish controlled and the other Greek.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I did not mean to suggest that you were bias but I feel that you are wrong to nominate this convention based on a numbers game as you clearly stated in your deletion reason. And to correct you, Tomo-Dachi has run twice, and a third time due this summer. This is not a one off con but an established one and the largest in Ireland. <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButch-cassidy_450c.html" title="User:Butch-cassidy">Butch-cassidy</a></dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Convention's status as the first convention in Ireland gives it notability. Attendance should be expected to be low in the early years, and I don't see how that's a fair metric in an expanding fandom anyway. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAniki21_c4e4.html" title="User:Aniki21">aniki21</a> 11:36, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> it's not the first in the United Kingdom, which Northern Ireland is a part of. Northern Ireland may be on the Isle of Eire, but it is not a part of the Republic of Ireland. If this was in Dublin with the same statistics, I'd be leaving it alone.&#160;:: <em><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Keigher_bca8.html" title="User:Colin Keigher">Colin Keigher</a></em> <font color="red"><b>(<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_Keigher_2a62.html" title="User talk:Colin Keigher">Talk</a>)</b></font> 18:23, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Northern Ireland is <i>also</i> a part of the <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">island of Ireland</a>, and Tomo-Dachi was the first anime convention to take place on the land mass. It was started before any conventions in the Republic of Ireland, so bringing Dublin into the discussion is confusing the issue. I can see no strong argument for removing this article, and you've certainly done nothing to provide one. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAniki21_c4e4.html" title="User:Aniki21">aniki21</a> 15:00, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I haven't yet decided on this one. However, I do want to say that attendance figures aren't the sole measure of notability. Since this is the first and only convention in Northern Ireland, it is notable. But the biggest problem I have with the article is lack of references to reliable third-party sources. If I do decide for delete, it would be for that reason alone. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 13:31, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It may lack references, but so do most convention articles at this time. I don't think that that should be a reason for deletion. --<a href="../../../p/d/e/User%7EPDelahanty_5985.html" title="User:PDelahanty">PatrickD</a> 18:49, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. That it's the first anime con on the island of Ireland makes it notable (regardless of where on the island). I've also added another external reference. ···<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe"><font color="darkblue">日本穣</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese">?</a> · <small><a href="../../../n/i/h/User_talk%7ENihonjoe_488b.html" title="User talk:Nihonjoe"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a> <font color="darkblue">to</font> <a href="../../../j/a/_/WP%7EJA_dc61.html" title="WP:JA">Nihon</a><a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html" title="WP:MOS-JA"><font color="darkgreen">joe</font></a></small></sup> 20:22, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> while the number of people in attendance is one way to show notability, it should not be seen as the <i>only</i> way to show notability. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 03:38, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>: I really want to be nice and just say keep, but I really can't see <i>any</i> anime convention really being notable enough to warrent its own article. In all honesty, how much can you right about an anime convention without coming off sounding like an advertisement? I mean, most cons don't really contribute anything to history. And seriously, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winslow%2C_Arkansas_7745.html" title="Winslow, Arkansas">my hometown</a> with a population 399 has held bigger musical festivals than this (I know we got <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trout_Fishing_in_America_%28band%29_0ff9.html" title="Trout Fishing in America (band)">Trout Fishing in America</a> one year, seems like some other famous artist too once...).--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 13:26, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> appears to meet notability criteria <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 15:50, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> agree with <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> on the criteria, however if more notability sources are needed, I will trace them down for the article. Mystcb 16:51, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> Just because it doesnt have alot of 3rd party sites? thats not a good reason to delete. less then 500 members? thats also not a good reason to delete. some conventions start off small and then get bigger as the years go by. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaverick423_0974.html" title="User:Maverick423">Maverick423</a> 18:51, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> from what i just read <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third-party_developer.html" title="Third-party developer">Third-party developer</a> or just simply <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_party.html" title="Third party">third party</a> are more like a bunch of wanna bes. they are people that live off the recongnition of more successful companys because they cant get to that level by themselvs. so tell me why should we even want 3rd party sites if we can go straight to <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_party.html" title="First party">First party</a> or <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_party.html" title="Second party">second party</a> ones? i dont know but thats just me <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaverick423_0974.html" title="User:Maverick423">Maverick423</a> 18:59, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
