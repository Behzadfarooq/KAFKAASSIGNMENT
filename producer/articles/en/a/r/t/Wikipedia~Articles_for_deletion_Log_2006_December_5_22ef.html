<li><b>Response</b> -- You found one link to a site which requires a log on. It is my understanding such links aren't usable as sources.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Hu, did I not get the memo? The article was created only 2006-12-05T00:45:08&#160;! It needs to be marked as stub and allowed to grow! Is there now some policy that article must be full-length, fully referenced from day 0&#160;? <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValters_f0ad.html" title="User:Valters">Valters</a> 09:09, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Apparently you didn't. You couldn't be bothered to even do so little as to stub it. I did. I also moved some material from its talk page into the article. Articles don't need to be "full-length, fully referenced from day 0" (though it <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_write_a_great_article_687a.html" title="Wikipedia:How to write a great article">is recommended</a> and has been done), but <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">biographical articles</a> <b>do</b> need to clearly indicate the notability of the subject. That is the main part of the memo you seem to have missed. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 09:26, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Apparently I didn't. I don't care about Amy per se (I apologize for this discussion here), but I am at loss why Wikipedia should not to allow articles to incubate for a few days before nominating for deletion. Now only content of stub articles is going to be why that person is notable, and of little meaning (who that person is). <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValters_f0ad.html" title="User:Valters">Valters</a> 10:32, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep:</b> After Morven thoughtfully added notability information to the article, I have changed my "vote" to "keep" because now the notability is properly asserted and referenced. So ironic that the deletionists saved the article and the inclusionists made no edits on it (see earlier discussion, which is posted below). <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 23:31, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> and <b>Cleanup</b> Notable enough, but this looks like it'll need a complete rewrite from the ground up. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 00:57, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment:</b> So many advocates for the article and yet not a single one has enhanced it, not even the "Strong Keep" or the article's creator, despite being notified.

<dd>I'm sorry, Hateless, but your argument doesn't hold water. Claiming Hu is being disrespectful by point out <b>fact</b> is not very civil either. The <b>fact</b> is there are people who will vote keep for an unsourced, non-notable, unwikified stub and yet will not fix it, expand it, or source it. It's not an accusation of hypocracy, it's a statement of fact. If someone thinks this article should be expanded, they should expand it, not expect others to do so. Otherwise, the keep vote is merely an empty gesture that should be discounted since it relies neither on policy nor on the intent to bring the article up to the standards that would meet policy. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 22:39, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't subscribe that there is a moral impetus to expand an article (afterall, we're all volunteers), and the idea that there should be social pressure that force people to do so is repugnant to me.

Your tolerance of inflammatory language is also not something I agree on.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Voting for keeping an article in no way obligates one to work towards fixing and enhancing that article. We should vote keep if the given article covers a subject that is notable and verifiable, which apparently this is, although the article may be poorly written and poorly sources.

<p>This article makes no attempt at making an assertion of notability other than it has been around since 1853. The label is also privately held, &amp; I think it may be a COI article, but I can't be sure. Other than the label's own site, I don't see any refs or sources. So because of this, I'm listing it here for deletion... Thanks, <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 00:10, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Aigle is a pretty common brand. However, I don't think the company (which should be named Aigle S.A.) meets (or met) <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. Ten minutes playing with the Euronext site is quite enough, and I couldn't find that AGL was ever a part of any of the Euronext/CAC indexes. It is ultimately owned by <a href="../../../../de/m/a/u/Maus_Fr%C3%A8res_Holding_000c.html" class="extiw" title="de:Maus_Frères_Holding">de:Maus Frères Holding</a> (<a href="../../../../fr/m/a/u/Maus_Fr%C3%A8res_Holding_000c.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Maus_Frères_Holding">fr:Maus Frères Holding</a> is spammy: "En avant vers demain!" and perhaps a copyvio, although Google says not), a notablish private holding company, majority owners of Aigle, <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lacoste_%28company%29.html" title="Lacoste (company)">Lacoste</a>, and other well-known brands. On the whole, I'd be happier with a smerge with Maus Frères Holding, only that's not written yet.

<dd>See <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Nothing there says that a member of a notable band is inherently notable! My opinion is that <i>most</i> members of notable bands <i>would be</i> notable themselves for having participated in a band's notable accomplishments. That goes beyond what the guideline actually says, but I think it's a reasonable interpretation, and a good compromise between deletionist and inclusionist stances. However, in <i>this</i> case, we have a musician who, according to the band, did <i>not</i> participate in any of their albums or singles. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 20:27, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Except that the articles aren't about <i>him</i>; they're about the <i>lawsuit</i>, which is notable because it involves a notable band. Suing a famous person does not magically confer notability. (Especially not in the lawsuit-happy land of the USA.)

<li>And yet I don't think breaking up with a band is reason enough to have an article about him. Also the comment that 'Brent is ...forming a band ... with his brother' is cited... but when i look at the citation i don't see one word about this potential band.

<p>The first edit of this page contained a link to squaremouth.com after its entry—a quite obscure site (see <i>infra</i>). I prodded as <i>advertizing disguised as an article/disambiguation page</i>. Prod was removed by creator who stated as his basis that he had removed the external link, thus apparently removing the advert. I still think this is disguised advertising and remains so with the text still listing the site. Since we do not have articles for either of the other two squaremouth definitions (which I think are pretextual), I do not think we need a disambiguation page for this at all. In any event, even if kept, the website should not be listed as it fails to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. The website returns 4 hits for a Google link search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=link%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.squaremouth.com%2F&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=link%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.squaremouth.com%2F&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and has an Alexa rank of 501,921 <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.squaremouth.com%2F" class="external autonumber" title="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.squaremouth.com%2F" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 00:47, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

This page is only biased toward some of the most famous battles. Also, this page now includes many non-battles (sieges, etc..).

<li><b>Comment</b> It may just need cleanup. Obviously, there are thousands of battles, but only the notable ones make it onto Wikipedia, so I don't think it would be too impossible to maintain. Of course, there is the problem of deciding which name of a battle to use when placing it on this list.

<li><b>Comment</b> - some lists in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_battles.html" title="List of battles">List of battles</a> are very good. The page <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_battles.html" title="List of battles">List of battles</a> does need expansion however. Some lists of battles will be impossible to maintain and should be deleted. I work with Wikiproject Military History and it is our goal to add every single battle in human history to Wikipedia, no matter how big or small it is. All battle are inherently notable (as historical events). Creating a list of The Most Important Battles would violate <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>. A list of battles with the most casualties already exists. If this list of battles is deleted, I will consider nominating other obsolete lists for deletion. Categories work well for many of the battles. Lists are only required for Battles of certain characteristics (casualties, certain event, etc.) --<a href="../../../i/n/e/User%7EIneffable3000_f9fb.html" title="User:Ineffable3000">Ineffable3000</a> 02:01, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am hoping that this AfD would bring a new test which determines what battle list is necessary (and good) and which is just impossible to maintain and obsolete. Please give opinions on the matter. In my opinion, such a test would help idealize the Lists of Battles. I am acting in Good Faith and do not wish to cause any harm to Wikipedia by doing this AfD.

<dd>dude, the "list of battles 1200-1300" is just a subheading in a "list of battles chronologiocally" page. It divides it up and allows you to jump to a particular time period. You can have them all in 1 big list with no divisions if you like, or you can dividde them by war, or into centuries, or by war, as well as by century. It just serves to make it more manageble. Some battles weren't really part of a major war, or perhaps a war only had one battle, so you'd only give the title of the war where there were an appreciable number of battles in it. Others would be group together.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I have put a link to this AfD page on the Wikiproject talk page. Hopefully some experts will come and speak. But either way, in my opinion, a list of ALL BATTLES, should not exist. --<a href="../../../i/n/e/User%7EIneffable3000_f9fb.html" title="User:Ineffable3000">Ineffable3000</a> 02:33, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't see an alphabetical listing as a particularly useful axis for navigation, especially when there are lists/categories that organize the material much more effectively. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarom_7c23.html" title="User:Carom">Carom</a> 02:44, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The alphabetical list is, admittedly, pretty useless, as it's redundant to the categories (which already follow alphabetical sorting) in the local sense and to Wikipedia's search function in the global one. As it's additionally fairly difficult to maintain, I don't see a problem with deleting it.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>More generally, the intent of lists is to provide a form of navigation that categories and templates do not. For battles, navigation by country (via <a href="../../../b/a/t/Category%7EBattles_by_country_14a5.html" title="Category:Battles by country">Category:Battles by country</a>) and war (via <a href="../../../b/a/t/Category%7EBattles_by_war_f606.html" title="Category:Battles by war">Category:Battles by war</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/m/WP%7ECAMPAIGN_9407.html" title="WP:CAMPAIGN">campaignbox templates</a>) are done fairly well without lists; the lists of battles for each country and war are thus often redundant (although they may still be useful, in some circumstances). The major—and very obvious—form of navigation that categories do <i>not</i> provide, however, is the chronological; categories are sorted alphabetically, which makes it quite difficult to arrange battles in order when browsing them. Here, lists—in particular, the lists of battles split into centuries (which are really just chunks of a single timeline of battles that has been broken apart due to size constraints)—really excel; I think that this application of lists is the primary one that ought to be retained.</dd>
<dd>Which is not to say that the current form of these lists is the most useful, of course. In the long term, I think it would be best to combine these with the corresponding chronological list of wars to create a grand Timeline of military conflicts (which may need to be split into chunks) that would list, for each year, the wars and corresponding battles that took place. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 02:47, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that it is a good idea in the long run. But for now, why not create categories for conflict during each time period? --<a href="../../../i/n/e/User%7EIneffable3000_f9fb.html" title="User:Ineffable3000">Ineffable3000</a> 02:50, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Um, because the articles <i>within</i> the categories would still be sorted alphabetically? The point is not to have the set of battles in the Xth century, in other words; but to have a listing of battles in precise chronological order (the century part merely being a convenient way of producing readably-sized pages, nothing more). <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 02:54, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Lists by country or by war - some of these may be useful; others are redundant with the categories and campaignboxes</li>
<li>Lists by period (battles and wars) - combine into a single timeline, as I suggested above</li>
<li>Lists of routs/raids/etc. - delete, pretty much impossible to determine neutrally what goes into these</li>
<li>Lists by casualties - possibly combine into the timeline through the new sortable table option; alternately, rework into articles dealing with the rich historiography of these topics <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 03:07, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'd like to pinpoint the existence of new MediaWiki feature, <code>class="sortable"</code> tables, which you can see in operation e.g. <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_Reports_ArbComElections_4cb8.html" title="User:Gurch/Reports/ArbComElections">here</a>. While it should be used with judgment, it makes a lot of List of X (sorted by Y) lists redundant, as the user is now offered a database-like view of long lists that can be sorted at will. Perhaps converting/merging some of those lists to this format would keep the best of both worlds—maintainability and clarity on one side, and comprehensiveness and easy navigation on the other. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 12:00, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. An alphabetical list is really no better than a combination of categories and a search engine, unless the list is expanded to include a brief summary of the battles, which I am not recommending here. The other problem with this list is its potentially huge size. There are many hundreds of battle articles simply in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> space.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Any kind of battle categorizations would be unfeasible or biased (e.g., should absolute number of casualties be used as a yardstick, or should the proportion as a percentage of the army be used. Or perhaps as a percentage of the country?). <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> 22:08, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> My main concern is that this topic is so staggeringly broad as to preclude it being ever completed or maintainable. Listing battles under their individual wars makes far more sense, trying to list what could be literally thousands of entries in a single category would make it an immediate candidate for subcategorization anyway. As it stands the list seems like an indiscriminate collection because it's just 'battles' coallated without context. Also, it begs the question as to what a 'battle' is in this context: only a pitched military engagement? What about longer engagements called 'battles' such as the Ardennes? What about the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Mods_and_rockers.html#Second_Battle_of_Hastings_.281964.29" title="Mods and rockers">second battle of hastings</a>? Also: I think this will invite inevitable POV battles over what events should properly be called 'battles', with POV pushers one way fighting for something to be called a battle and POV pushers the other way trying to get them reclassified as 'insurrections' or 'attacks' or 'massacres' or something simularly biased. It's unmaintainable, vauge, unworkably large, and bound to invite division and editor conflict. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 22:10, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - per Mark "Mr. X" Delfs &amp; Just Julie Delfs--Jawbone was one of the very first Podcasts I listened to and actually enjoyed. They are the epitome of Podcasting and should be kept on Wikipedia. Not many shows out there have done the sheer amount and breadth of shows that Len and Nora have done. Futhermore, Len took the time to actually do sketches and drawings of the major Podcasters for FREE, for them to use as their artwork in iTunes. Please give them the satisfaction of having a Wikipedia article which really is a very simple thing to ask for!

You cannot judge podcasts by hits from any search engine or static source when determining notability. Podcasts, by definition, rely on RSS feeds. If you're going to criticize an entry in Wikipedia, at least be familiar and educated with the entry's background and source. If Jawbone isn't notable, then neither is any podcast or new media venue. It's absurd that this discussion is even being made. People that believe this podcast shouldn't be part of Wikipedia are simply showing their ignorance, and the editors shouldn't fold to ignorance. ----charleyw 05:47, 6 December 2006 (UTC)charleyw

<li><b>Keep</b> - Len Peralta, one half of the couple behind Jawbone, was an early presence in the visual side of podcasting, creating many of the logos and images used by podcasters in the ID3 tags of their shows, and on their websites. Jawbone is hugely influential; a page on the podcast directory, Podcast Pickle, shows their influences in the world of podcasting and lists many podcasters that were inspired by Jawbone. And throughout numerous interviews and affiliations with singer Jonathan Coulton, and writer/comedian John Hodgeman, Jawbone is a significant contributor to the pop culture of podcasting. bibbott <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.33.154.117 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.33.154.117_1de5.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.33.154.117">contribs</a>).</small>

Would including that link (as stated by the quailifications) be enough?

<dd>Honestly, whether or not any music is written about me is entirely irrelevant to this discussion. Creative commons music would seem both trivial and non-published.

<dd>I wonder if all the Creative Commons musicians and authors would feel the same way about your assessment of their work being trivial. I assert that simply because a piece of music isn't backed by SONY or Time Warner, that it is still a published work under Creative Commons, thusly fulfilling criteria 1.

<p><i><b>Holy sockpuppets and meatpuppets, Batman!</b></i> Now that I've said that, at this point in time, <i>no</i> podcast is by itself sufficient enough to satisfy <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. It doesn't matter if it has its own theme song (or Christmas Song) unless the song itself meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Of the sources that are cited, only <i>one</i> is independent of the podcast (thus not qualifying for "multiple non-trivial published works that are independent of the site itself). While it can be argued that the BBC citation would qualify under guideline #2 of WP:WEB, a look at the linked article clearly shows otherwise: it is not one describing any awards but an article recommending six podcasts "worth listening to" (in the same sense of recommending six restaurants for a festive Friday). As for guideline #3, since the Newhouse News Service is redlinked, I cannot conclude that it (NNS) satisfies <i>"The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.</i> Thus it fails under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> - <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 00:52, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>Followup</i> - Newhouse News Service does appear to be notable by itself, but I have found no evidence independent of the podcast (which actually originates from blogspot.com) supporting the article's assertion that NNS was actually distributing it (I did find an article discussing Jawbone without mentioning any relationship between the two entities). The last paragraph of the article indicates that Jawbone is self-distributed (via its own Trypod Network). Thus my position is unchanged. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 00:52, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The host of Jawbone Radio was invited to speak on a panel at a Comics Symposium at Lakeland Community College in April 2006 on the above mentioned Calvin and Hobbes podcast <a href="http://www.academicventures.com/comics/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.academicventures.com/comics/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> on the Watterson podcast. On the panel was former Watterson editor and current VP of Universal Press Syndicate, Lee Salem.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> Patent nonsense. Firstly "voidism" is not a Buddhist belief. A Google search of "Buddhism Voidism" (ommiting wikipedia.org) brings about 532 hits. A look through a World Religions textbook (Schmidt, R, Sager G, Carney G, et al. (2005). <i>Patterns of Religion</i>. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning.) gives nothing. A tenuously similar Buddhist concept, <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shunyata.html" title="Shunyata">Shunyata</a>, meaning "emptiness" or "voidness", which yields 50,400 Google hits (again, ommiting wikipedia.org) and is located in aforementioned textbook. It seems to be used in a Buddhist sense by those who don't know the Sanskrit term.</li>

<dd>Of the two citations found in the Voidism article itself, the hyperlink reference is stated in the Voidism article to be "academically well-known" is a link to a GeoCities cite. While the author does appear to have some connection to [ <a href="http://www2.creighton.edu/Creighton" class="external free" title="http://www2.creighton.edu/Creighton" rel="nofollow">http://www2.creighton.edu/Creighton</a> University], I find it odd that it is hosted on a GeoCities rather than the University's website. Furthermore, it seems to be an academic essay, but the essay itself cites no other work. Spelling mistakes and made-up terms do not lend to its credibility, either. The second citation appears to have been copied from the citations from Buddhism. As I stated above, I did not find voidism used in a Buddhist religious context in <i>Patterns of Religion</i>, and I doubt that it will be found in the cited book, though I have no way of making sure.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The "shunya" is a Sanskrit term literally meaning "void", and is a synonym for "zero" - you may consult Georges Ifrah's "Universal History of Numbers" or simply google define it, or look it up anywhere. In that particular book, which rests upon much original research into the history of numerical concepts, and 0 itself - the most important of all - Buddhism is inextricably linked as the most prominent of early mystical philosophies of the void. Mahayana Buddhism, specifically through Nagarjuna, espouses the void to be all that can exist, and that form of Buddhism leans extremely towards nihilism in its solely-void belief. Shunyavadin (voidists) is a validly wide-used term to describe Buddhists, of every existing sect - as is shunyavada, which literally translates as "voidism" - and Nirvana is defined as the void, which is asserted as Buddhism's ultimate reality, the "true world", in Nagarjuna's terms; thus its Buddhist connection with shunya/shunyata, void/voidness is entirely accurate, from whatever reference; in fact, it seems a lesser known - yet well-established - connection, thus justifying such an article's creation. As for the connections with 0 and mathematics, they seem entirely valid, and I'd presume since Creighton is a catholic institution, they probably would be less inclined to host a voidist essay on a university website; the essay seems entirely valid as well. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by HelloThere1 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HelloThere1_7bfc.html" title="Special:Contributions/HelloThere1">contribs</a>).</small></li>

If it was about void as a Buddhist concept, I would have simply said delete and redirect to Shunyata. However, it is not. It appears, as I said above, to be patent nonsense. Furthermore, there is aboslutely no reason why a Catholic, or any religiously affiliated institution cannot publish a scholarly paper that talks about other religions. The paper itself, as I pointed out above, cites no other work and is not of the greatest quality.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The philosophy is entirely valid; the connection to Buddhism has been entirely established. Obviously the subject is a larger extension of the concept of voidism as an ontology superseding its limit to Buddhism, although that particular philosophy is cited as a prominent example . . . the void is a universal concept, the same as 0 - 0 being equivalent to the void even in Buddhism, yet of course not nihilistic - and philosophies have been developed of it around the world outside of Buddhism - see Plotinus, who is cited in the article - this article clearly represents an elucidation of voidism beyond a view of nihilism, to which the notion of 0 has been erroneously inextricably linked in western thought; that purpose alone justifies the article. It is also concerned in connecting epistemological thought around the basis of 0, thus transcending a purely religious or metaphysical connection with Buddhism, and validating its independence. The essay seems of amply sufficient quality; a reason a catholic institution wouldn't officially endorse its stance is due to the certainty asserted towards the ideas in the essay, and perhaps it was a personal wish of the author to have no such official connection with the institution. --HelloThere1 22:17, 5 December 2006 (UTC) <small>— HelloThere1 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HelloThere1_7bfc.html" title="Special:Contributions/HelloThere1">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm quoting an article from Wikipedia on Cosmology (Metaphysics): "Acosmism is the belief that neither the self nor the universe has ever existed. This is held by some forms of strict Advaita Vedanta, a Hindu philosophy. The Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna, whose beliefs are called voidism, or nihilism (in the Eastern, rather than the Western sense), believed that the world neither exists, nor does it not exist." This clearly confirms and validates not only definitively the use of the term "voidism" in the aforementioned proper context, but it represents a branching beyond Buddhism alone in its Avaita Vedanta reference to identical views - that is, selfless (void) philosophies the void clearly applying to all philosophies avowing an absence or a falsification of any notions of static identity or attachment (justifying a generalized voidism category to include all such views not limited to Buddhism or even the East, as are referenced in the article), the primarily singular sense of application of the void, even in Buddhism (another Wikiquote): "The Suñña Sutta, part of the Pali Canon, relates that the monk Ananda, the attendant to Gautama Buddha asked, "It is said that the world is empty [void], the world is empty, lord. In what respect is it said that the world is empty?" The Buddha replied, "Insofar as it is empty of a self or of anything pertaining to a self: Thus it is said, Ananda, that the world is empty."" Voidism is the general term for this universal phenomenon, requiring elucidation. --HelloThere1 01:11, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Nagarjuna refined <i>shunyata</i>, which I stated above as translating to "emptiness" or "voidness", not "voidism". And there is no "Eastern" meaning to nihilism that I'm aware of, especially if the term was invented by <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Heinrich_Jacobi_f922.html" title="Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi">Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi</a> in the 18th century. The article you gave should be using a link to <i>shunyata</i>, not the translation of "voidism". <i>Shunyata</i> does not prove that the voidism theory, as presented in the article is universal in any sense. In fact, only using Buddhist philosophy limits it, because if it is Buddhist, or based on Buddhist thought, it is not universal. Again, I would like to point out that adding Buddhism into this discussion is confusing the issue.</li>

<dd>The article has two reliable, but not nessecarily relevant sources. The first is a World Religions textbook made to back up the use of <i>shunyata</i> in the article, but it appears that it may have simply been copied from the Buddhism article. The other reliable source is a book attempting of cover, as the publisher calls it, "every aspect of nothingness." While this is a vaild source, from the quick look I gave it, it seems to be talking more about nihilism than this article's theory, voidism. The theory that the article is written about is covered in an unreliable source, namely a self-published webiste which was written by a non-notable author. According to both <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, this is not a valid source. --<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimetom_df69.html" title="User:Limetom">Lim</a><a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimetom_Esperanza_b9a2.html" title="User:Limetom/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b><i>e</i></b></font></a><a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimetom_df69.html" title="User:Limetom">tom</a> 02:40, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Not only have you successfully failed to refute anything previously mentioned in the slightest, you haven't brought up a single valid point. The widely referencable term "shunyavadin" (shunya = void; vadin = ists) and its application to Nagarjuna's "middle-way system" sufficiently validates beyond further necessity the translatable (and widely-used) term "voidism". You seem to be emphasizing "shunyata" (meaning "voidness") while entirely displaying your ignorance of its root, the term "SHUNYA" (literally meaning only "void", no -ness or emptiness), a literal synonym for zero whose etymology is in fact in the extremely reputable source John D. Barrow's popular "Book of Nothing", which also links the concept to Buddhism. So, that totally cancels all your hopes to dismiss the connection of Voidism - a specific philosophy of the "void" - as it is established with Buddhism. As previously established, since this voidism pertains specifically entirely to the denial of multiplicity, duality, or the concept of a static aggregate, egoistic sort of "self", it is a universal philosophy of monism in its purest form which is to be found the world over and is an alternative indeed to an erroneous perception of voidist nihilism which you've also confirmed, which itself again justifies a specification in its own article for enlightenment.

<li>Can't you read what I have written? "Horilka" means <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodka.html" title="Vodka">vodka</a>. Even your linked article says so; quoting for lazy readers: <i>I could never understand why people drink horilka (horilka is Ukrainian for vodka)</i>. Of course, vodka is a notable and verifiable cultural drink in Poland (called wódka or gorzałka there), Belarus (водка, гарэлка ), Russia (водка), and Lithuania (degtine). `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 03:39, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I quote from the reference: "a story of horilka, Ukrainian vodka". It may mean generic vodka, but in the Ukranian language and context it refers to the Ukranian vodka; even the WP <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodka.html" title="Vodka">vodka</a> article mentions the Ukranian variety. Hence it is not just a translation but part of the Ukranian culture, per the reference, which does a good job of putting it in perpective. If there are equivalent sources describing local beverage varieties in other countries, they would be includable also. I guess the issue is whether it merits its own article vs. being merged into <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodka.html" title="Vodka">vodka</a>, which is of course an option. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 03:48, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is a fairly common trick to slip in some national words to add some national flavor. Even in "brotherly" Russian language sometimes Ukrainian words are used, eg. "divchina" (a <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl.html" title="Girl">girl</a>), to stress that we are speaking about an Ukrainian maiden, as, eg in the song "Chernobrovaya divchina" ("Black-eyebrowed Girl"). But of course I hope no one will come up with a crazy idea to write an article "divchina", despite 42,700(!) google hits and despite the fact that divchinas are a quite distinctive subclass of <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl.html" title="Girl">girls</a>&#160;:-).`'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 09:46, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The "journalism bullshit" is from a tourism and cultural journal with an editorial board that fact-checks articles (that's what a journal's editorial board does).

Calling it "journalism bullshit" is much like calling the New York Times' webpages, editorials, or articles bullshit.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I think ridiculing or belittling a national custom is contrary to WP rules. The source clearly mentions Horilka as part of the Wedding tradition. It doesn't say 'Vodka'. Someone reading that article, who is not sure what Horilka is, could then click on 'Horilka' in WP and learn all about it. This is WP's mission. Remember the only issue for us to decide at an AfD is "is the subject's notability well sourced". IMO there is little doubt that Horilka is notable as the Ukranian variety of Vodka. And per above, lumping all Vodka varieties inside one <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodka.html" title="Vodka">Vodka</a> article because it is an Eastern European drink, while all Whiskey variants get their own articles because they are Western, runs counter to WP's mission to inform all people about all cultures, not just focus on Western culture. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 22:25, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

Label pictures, the cultural connections, the Taras Bulba quote, the various peppers and spices that are added for taste, the reference articles, etc. IOW, once that person reads our article s/he would become educated as to what Horilka means, much more (and easier) than searching some Ukranian dictionary which will never have this potential wealth of information.

<li>all reasonable articles say that "horilka is ukrainian word for vodka". Cultural connections about drinking vodka during various feasts is laughable to present as "national ukrainian tradition".

<li>Source #2 says: "The Scots drink Scotch whisky; the French drink wine; the Germans drink beer, and the Arabs drink coffee — to provide just a few obvious examples. For the Ukrainians horilka is probably the most widely consumed liquor and it sort of gives it the status of “a national drink.”". You say it's the same as the Russian vodka, just a different word. If so, it would not be a "national" drink. It also says "Ukrainian horilka for quite the wrong reasons is often referred to in the west as “Russian vodka.”". Again, there is a distinction made. All I am saying is that Horilka can stand on its own feet in its own article, without getting lumped into a common <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodka.html" title="Vodka">Vodka</a> article, just like the Western <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whiskey.html" title="Whiskey">Whiskey</a> varieties have their own individual articles, per <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" rel="nofollow">WP is not paper</a>, as we noted above. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 03:00, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My point was not to show there is scientific statistical proof that Horilka labeled bottles are consumed more than others in the Ukraine, although I suspect it's true. My point was simply to show that we have a source saying that Ukrainians consider Horilka, not 'vodka', their national drink. We also know that Horlika (as a bottle label) typically contains various spices that make it 'stronger and spicier' than Russian vodka. Bottom line: Ukranians consider Horilka, not vodka, their national drink, and Horilka is typically stronger and spicier than Russian vodka, hence it deserves its own article, just like the Western national varieties of Whiskey have theirs. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 03:40, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Delete'</i> As per my nomination on 'list of battles' I think this is far too large a topic to be one category, in addition, it invites POV warring with the use of imprecise terms and/or terms with no working definition in this context.

<li><b>comment</b>: Norseman, the reason that I voted 'delete' without considering how the article might be improved is that it contained what I felt to be a fatal and inevitable POV problem with the term 'rout', and the massive size any list on the topic would have to have to do the topic a modicum of justice. per WP:not, wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, therefore I feel that any list cannot simply address part of the topic without reason for disinclusion. Because of that, I feel this list is doomed to forever be indiscriminate, because undertaking a total and comprehensive list of the last six thousand years of military history I worry is beyond the scope of what could be done with this page. Subcategorization and conversion might solve those problems, and I would not vote 'delete' on, say, 'list of routs in the trojan war' or even 'list of routs in WWII' provided the criteria for inclusion were specific enough to preclude POV issues. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 20:31, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> To my knowledge, this article already contains every raid on wikipedia. Even if somehow the number of raids on wikipedia quadrupled suddenly, or more, it would be very easy to just split off the raids into subsections by era, century, or major conflict. Lists are inherently pretty low maintenance, so there's no reason it couldn't be maintained as needed indefinitely. If you have any current issue with its state of maintenance, you need only place a cleanup tag and state what you wanted fixed. If it gets to a point where maintainability becomes an actual concern, I would suggest first using the cleanup tag to find out if people are willing and capable of cleaning it up. If not, <i>then</i> I might consider replacing it with a category.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, it should be noted that there is no raid category, so, at the moment, there is no alternative source of this information. Even with a raid category, you don't get sorting by date which is much more useful for historical analysis than alphabetical sorting. If it were a list of pokemon, I could see a category being more appropriate. However, alphabetically sorted history is about as helpful as a dictionary sorted by the approximate order the words came into use. They are different kinds of categorization specialized for sorting different kinds of information. This isn't just theory either. For example, due to this method of sorting, I was able to spot two identical entries with different names, the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Ocean_raid_1ea9.html" title="Indian Ocean raid">Indian Ocean raid</a>, and the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_Raids_into_Indian_Ocean_e3b8.html" title="Japanese Raids into Indian Ocean">Japanese Raids into Indian Ocean</a> (I added the merger tags to them when I found out). If you put this information in alphabetical format as a category, it becomes <b>more difficult</b> to maintain, thereby making the problem worse. I don't think I can stress enough the importance of using the right type of categorization for the information you're sorting. -<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorsemanII_6314.html" title="User:NorsemanII">NorsemanII</a> 04:46, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How do you define a raid? How is it different from a battle? If a category exists, a person can just visit the page of the raid to learn more about it.

<dd>See <a href="../../../r/a/i/Raid_%28military%29.html" title="Raid (military)">Raid (military)</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle.html" title="Battle">battle</a> for definitions. The category is as useful as the search. If you're looking for something very specific, you don't even need the category, so there's no point bothering with it. If you're checking to see if your new raid article already exists under another name then this is much more useful than sorting through every entry manually. Likewise if you find a raid that isn't on the list yet. If you want to study the progression of raids, or possible influences that raids had on one another, this method of sorting is far more useful. Any time you want to place information into a historical context, particularly with reference to precedents, sorting chronologically makes the task much easier.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The reason for this page is to give an idea of the chronological arrangement of battles, listed often under the title of the war they were a part of. A page of "category - naval battles" is a haphazard listing in no order making it impossible to tell if the "battle of Ecnomus" and the "battle of Cos" had any relation to each other or were even in the same milennium! It is NOT meant to list all naval battles, just all FLEET battles - usually large-scale battles which affected the course of the war or were interesting from some other point of view. As a matter of fact the page has not greatly expanded for a number of months now and is likely almost completed. The only things needed are to write some more battle articles and link them to this page, and perhaps get more precise dates for some of the earlier battles mentioned. I find it strange indeed that the people talking on this talk page are not people who have contributed to the page in question nor to any of its linked pages. Why are you here? You can find much more productive action in deleting all the "list of songs on album X by some obscure band" type pages. List pages are fine. They serve as a better variation on the category pages for the reasons given above. Thankyou. It's not an alphabetical list, either. That would indeed be pointless as it would duplicate the category - battles page. This is like an index page, not a random list. it gives form.<a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpookyMulder_7adb.html" title="User:SpookyMulder">SpookyMulder</a> 12:09, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Lists and categories are not redundant with each other. Lists allow redlinks, and can be sourced. Lists also allow for things like alternate names, confusing names, etc. As <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpookyMulder_7adb.html" title="User:SpookyMulder">SpookyMulder</a> points out, a Cat:Naval Battles page would be quite difficult to navigate and potentially misleading about connections between articles. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 13:28, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This article is only slightly less problematic than the list of battles. If it is practically impossible to develop anything close to a complete list of <i>all</i> naval battles, why not restrict the scope to something feasible? Lists of naval battles for specific wars are feasible, as are lists of <i>major</i> naval battles for a specific time period and region. I think it's foolhardy to create a single article that promises far more than any reference work in existence can offer. Instead of creating lists that are perpetually inadequate by design, we should restrict these lists to a scope where we can deliver what we promise. A substantially incomplete list would be a misleading reference, as it misrepresents the frequency and distribution of naval battles throughout history. <a href="../../../d/j/c/User%7EDjcastel_4413.html" title="User:Djcastel">Djcastel</a> 19:53, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - It appears as though some people have not read the title of the page they want to delete. It says "List of naval fleet battles". That means, battles in which (by my definition) more than 6 ships (ie 3 per side) participated. This distinguishes these battles from the famous "single-ship battles" because in many of those "single-ship" battles there were actually 2 ships on each side. There is a separate page for such single-ship battles, and that page will only list the notable ones, not all ship fighting ever, because that would likely be impossible and very lengthy anyway. But the fleet battle page isn't impossible. If you lok at the no. of ships in all these battles, incidentally, there really is no clear cut-off point. Any number of ships have taken part in battles, from 1vs1 through 3vs20 through 100vs100. And I picked 3vs3 as the cutoff. *shrugs*. And switched anything less than that to the single-ship battles page. I also agree that lists which can't be completed, or which might not be completed for a while are still perfectly OK. They do allow you to link to things which don't yet have an article, making it more likely that those missing articles will be created. You can't do this on a "category" page.<a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpookyMulder_7adb.html" title="User:SpookyMulder">SpookyMulder</a> 10:17, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very strong keep</b> - The nominator's argument that this extensive list should be deleted because it is incomplete is disconcerting. Does this mean he believes we should delete all stub articles as well? (There are hundreds of thousands of them on Wikipedia). Most lists on Wikipedia are incomplete, because they are works in progress. In fact, most articles are incomplete for the same reason. If only complete articles were allowed to be posted on Wikipedia, how would the contributors who add a sentence here and there be able to help this fine project? And how would readers benefit if articles weren't displayed until they were 100% complete? Wikipedia would be a shadow of what it is now. &#160;<i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="purple">Th<font color="blue">e Tr<font color="#9ACD32">ans<font color="#FFCC00">hu<font color="orange">man<font color="red">ist</font> &#160;&#160;</font></font></font></font></font></a></b></i>12:14, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep —</b> Very interesting list. I disagree with the nominator's assertion that it would be impossible to list every naval battle, I believe naval technology has existed for only a small portion of the time that hominids have existed. Furthermoe, even if he were correct about his assertion, we would still be able to list the notable naval battles. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 02:30, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> As per my previous comments, nothing in Mr, Pierce's missive on the other page is notable. Many people have shelves full of minor awards. Many people have contributed on the editorial staff of some small school or local periodical. Many people have kept diaries and influenced others to do the same. Many people have been interviewed by mid-market media for insights on their niche interests. None of the above, even in combination, is notable, and as such neither is Mr. Pierce's bio. <a href="../../../t/f/g/User%7ETfg_2e39.html" title="User:Tfg">Tfg</a> 04:20, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is not a set of guidelines for the notability of people (including bloggers), but a set of guidelines for the notability of web content (including blogs). It should have no bearing on the discussion.
<ul>
<li>If his blog is notable then we should have an article about his blog. What do you know? This would do nicely for it. Whether we have the article at his name or at his blog is a matter of semantics and not a reason to keep or delete. In either case the content should stay.

I would argue that by <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, his blog is not notable, either, but that, again, is not relevant to the discussion.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I agree that the vast majority of the thousands (millions?) of bloggers out there would most certainly fail such a notability requirement. However, as an artist with a large following and recognized <i>numerous</i> times by multiple <i>major</i> media sources, Tony Pierce is an obvious exception. As to your Jeffy Award, keep in mind that most artistic awards—such as the Oscars (a.k.a. the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Awards) and the Bloggies—are given by organizations representing the artistic community producing same said art. While your Jeffy Award might not offer much credibility in terms of representing the larger community, a Bloggie Award IMHO would. --Barneyg 13:04, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The non-trivial sources I have examined make mention to Mr. Pierce as "a blogger" and are not interviewing him explicitly. All of the articles content would remain primarily unchanged if another (I will say popular) blogger were substituted. Wikipedia is not a directory of people who have been interviewed by newspapers. Mr. Pierce does seem to be popular within the blogging community, but it is unclear what he has "contributed" to it outside the existence of his own blog posts. I think perhaps in retrospect, historically, we will be able to determine if he has had an "impact" on some industry. However, being listed as a contemporary, I do not think it is obvious that Mr. Pierce is <i>notable</i>, instead of just <i>popular</i>; thus I vote deleted. There's also the matter that notable people should not mention, and <b>especially not get personally involved in</b> their own listing in an encyclopedia; and while being singularly not evidence of anything, along with other things it slants my opinion in the direction that this is a vanity entry being supported by Pierce and friends. <a href="../../../x/i/p/User%7EXiphoris_85a7.html" title="User:Xiphoris">Xiphoris</a> 16:14, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

The fact is that bloggers <i>are</i> notable in the year 2006, and deleting a subject simply because he/she is a blogger is a very bad idea (I think I hear some people using this argument). These people make major contributions to the web. What, are we going to be deleting bloggers who are getting 100000 hits a day on their blog because they're non-notable?

It continues, "This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles..." etc. Pierce meets that criterion. A quick search of the Dow Jones/Reuters Factiva service shows Pierce has been the subject of articles from the <i>New York Times</i> (27 May 2004) (followed by an echo to the <i>Times</i>-owned <i>Int'l Herald Tribune</i> on 29 May); Reuters (10 July 2004); <i>Straits Times</i> (Singapore) (5 March 2006); <i>Reforma</i> (Mexico City) (2 April 2006); <i>EL PAIS</i> (Madrid) (20 April 2006); <i>Los Angeles Times</i> (16 October 2003, 27 Feb 2003, 12 July 2004, others); <i>Le Monde</i> (25 June 2005); and others. The search string was (Tony Pierce AND blog). Factiva is a proprietary service, and thus articles in it cannot be pointed to easily.

Having been quoted in this or that newspaper, having won an award for knitting given by a community of knitters who do nothing but sit and knit ALL day, this is not the stuff of notability.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 06:01, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Hey look, a <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephanie_Pearl-McPhee_8e75.html" title="Stephanie Pearl-McPhee">knitter in Wikipedia</a>! Pierce is surely more notable than Mrs. Pearl-McPhee. She did write several books about knitting but Pierce wrote several books about blogging. Oh, and according to her article, "Pearl-McPhee’s writing and work is best known through her blog." Actually, the reason we're having this discussion is because Tony <i>is</i> notable, there are many less notable people in Wikipedia, no one would know or care if Pearl-McPhee's page was deleted. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPermanentE_5c9e.html" title="User:PermanentE">PermanentE</a> 08:01, 6 December 2006 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPermanentE_5c9e.html" title="User:PermanentE">PermanentE</a> (<a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPermanentE_8418.html" title="User talk:PermanentE">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PermanentE_8779.html" title="Special:Contributions/PermanentE">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<dd>Yes, it would seem you are not a single-purpose account; However, Your comment leads me to believe that you feel that the existance of one article is enough proof to keep another. That is simply not true. That is to say, this discussion is for the notability of this article, and has no relation to that article whatsoever (which is actually of a somewhat-notable person) <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmax-_a23e.html" title="User:Jmax-">Jmax-</a> 01:18, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Firstly, Being in Wikipedia is <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">not</a> in itself a sign that an article actually meets Wikipedia's notabaility standards. Secondly, Pearl-McPhee is vastly more notable than Pierce; I type her surname into Amazon and get a list of books written by her, one of them with #686 sales rank despite being a special-interest book released 9 months ago. I put in "Tony Pierce" and get... one book by him that they don't even sell, with no sign of his blogging book at all. Pearl-McPhee vs. Pierce is a perfect example of how web-fame and the ability to throw readers at Wikipedia in realtime causes people to vastly overstate the notability of full-time bloggers compared to people who are known for something else, and may or may not have a website. <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBCoates_04d2.html" title="User:BCoates">BCoates</a> 09:05, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Considering the New York Times, LA Weekly, G4TV, and Washington Post have all used him in their pieces on blogging, that SXSW has invited him to speak about blogging, that the country of Amsterdam handpicked him among twenty other bloggers to visit and write about their country, would all indicate that he is, indeed, notable in his field. Timecop and others fail to distinguish the difference between FAME and NOTABLITY. Arguing that someone is not notable because you haven't heard of them defies all logic. A "random article" click on Wikipedia will likely turnup someone or something you've never heard of - this doesn't mean the piece should be excluded. Moreover, Wikipedia isn't catalog of things everyone knows, as Timecop and Deskana seem to be in favor of. --LADude 08:37, 6 December 2006 (UTC) <small>— LADude (<a href="../../../l/a/d/User_talk%7ELADude_dd36.html" title="User talk:LADude">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LADude_8078.html" title="Special:Contributions/LADude">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Why does the fact that I haven't edited since September make mine a Single Purpose Account? I'm sure there are administrators that don't edit for longer periods. I have been a minor contributor for almost 3 years on diverse topics and have always tried to be respectful of Wikipedia. It just so happens that I read Pierce's blog and I've had a long standing Wikipedia account, I think that qualifies me perfectly to participate in this discussion. What is suspicious about that?

<li><b>Comment</b> I have to agree with LADude in this instance. It's extremely common for people to make new accounts, make a page, and have few other contributions. In fact, the good <i>majority</i> of the new pages created come from newly created accounts; and I can tell you, from personal experience, that most of them never return (try going through some of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Wikipedia%7EDead-end_pages_9f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Dead-end pages">Wikipedia:Dead-end pages</a>. Besides, we're bound by policy that, unless it becomes obvious otherwise, we must <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and assume it wasn't Tony; not the other way around (assume it was him until it's not obvious). Secondly, as noted above, he wasn't just on cafepress, he was on several major newspapers. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 10:36, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> There's too many coincidences to not be true. If I may direct you to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tony_Pierce&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=25330577" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tony_Pierce&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=25330577" rel="nofollow">original revision</a>, you'll note several claims that couldn't have been made by just a friend or somebody who reads his blogs:
<ul>
<li>"His writing style is impromptu, frank, respectfully opinionated, humorous, and uniquely careless of capitalization."</li>
<li>"He is patriotic but politically critical, while at the same time charismatic and quite the ladies man."</li>
<li>"He has published much other material online including photo essays, podcasts, and photos. He has completed several books via cafe press including How to Blog in which he discloses some of his blogging secrets, and Stiff, a novella in which he travels to hell, to meet Kurt Cobain."</li>
<li>"He has also been known to converse with such celebrities as Howard Stern, and Matthew Good."</li>
<li>"He ... believes in writing straight from the heart, and encourages others to do the same.</li>

<dd>So here we have somebody who knows about Tony's writing style, in great detail, knows about Tony's political views and behavior around women, his publication and the content of each publication, who he talks with, what he believes in, and what he does. If this were written by anybody other than him, then the police should get involved, as it would clearly be a case of stalking. Also notable is that this first revision is clearly devoid of any negative claims.

<dd>We have to assume good faith on this issue. Regardless of the final decision on Pierce's notability, it has been well established that he is a popular and well-known figure within his field. From my observation, it's highly likely that this article was started by an enthusiastic fan. The problem with this debate is that the irrelevant vanity issue (if vanity was the issue, but the subject is notable, we could do a re-write and be done with this) is muddling the more relevant notability issue. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlowimperial_dfe0.html" title="User:Glowimperial">Glowimperial</a> 13:12, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Cacophony - If you're really serious in your analogy that "raising weasels" or "eating lima beans" are activities comparative in nature to writing blogs then you should probably recluse yourself from this discussion - your bias is showing. If you can't tackle the subject's notability/non-notability without expressing your personal disdain for his field of work, then maybe this isn't a disucssion you should be taking part in. Blogging is no longer an obscure field, it has certainly become a functional part of mass media - accept it. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlowimperial_dfe0.html" title="User:Glowimperial">Glowimperial</a> 15:14, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hasn't it been established time and time again that the number of Google hits is irrelevent? Besides, your logic and evidence is flawed, as 1. Google trends is a Google labs product that only searched some news articles and doesn't give an actual count. 2. You assume that anyone searching for Tony Pierce "the blogger" would make the distinction in a search. 3. Comparing a living person to Looney Tunes characters and arguing notability? A true disservice to Wikipedia that the comparison keeps coming up, regardless of your feelings towards Pierce or the residents of Toon Town. --LADude 09:13, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you go through those 429 results I think you'll see that almost all are still blog sites. The removal of a few major blogging sites removed ~550,000 hits.

<dd><s>Just because someone's a member of a troll community doesn't mean all of their actions are trolling. Certainly members of GNAA have real lives and jobs; so certainly they don't spend 100% of their time trolling. It's possible a member of GNAA might troll other mediums, but not Wikipedia. Unless you have evidence that a user has trolled Wikipedia, it is not just to make such accusations. Please follow the wiki policy of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assume_good_faith.html" title="Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. For example, someone might be a member of the Klu Klux Klan and contribute positively to an article on blogging or electrical engineering.

<dd>I'm all about freedom of speech, but 1) he admitted he was a troll, 2) all people from his organization admit as much. That's not the same as a username mistake. Someone doesn't, by chance, end up stating their allegiance to GNAA, but actually they were mistaken with someone else. If someone goes around downtown New York city, and screams "I'm a member and the founder of al-Qaeda", or "I'm an active member of the local gang that's been guilty of constant murder" - then they would be arrested (especially if other gang members had done the same).

<dd>I think you're right about this user. However, I think you're wrong about people in general. Having trolled in the past or being a member of a troll organization does <i>not</i> mean someone is trolling currently. Admitting being a troll means what? Having trolled in the past? It doesn't mean anything about someone's <b>current</b> actions. That's what we judge them on.

<dd>The world is not black and white. Someone can be a troll one place and also positively contribute some other place. As I mentioned previously, presumably some of these people have jobs, and it's unlikely they troll in real life. Someone might troll Slashdot but not Wikipedia. You can't make assumptions, nor can you characterize someone's entire personality by the word "troll". That's called prejudice, and it's unjustified. In the past it was used to say black people were stupid or that women shouldn't have the right to vote.

<li><b>Keep</b>, and I've practically never even played it. I had been intending on going to bed and was hinting when I deprodded it that I would be willing to go back and add references later, but so it goes. Anyway, the program is somewhat handicapped by the fact that it has a very generic name and, for obvious reasons, Wizards of the Coast's official websites would not want to bring too much attention to it. Additionally, many commercial sites make money selling real cards, and so would downplay a free alternative. Even in spite of all that, it seems that it was fairly important "back in the day," and is even still used today to some extent. It easily satisfies being written about by other sources. To wit:

<dd>WP has articles on plenty of games that no one plays anymore and were utter commericial flops; their only reviews were perfunctory "this game exists and sucks," and even that may be hard to find if the game is old enough.

<dd>I offered some non-SCG links above in my original post; it's just that SCG happens to be easily searchable. As for non-Magic sources... er... how to say this.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The real problem with this software is the whole premise around the software -- its a card game now made into a computer software that emulates game activity. You can't have a review of this type of software. Its like asking someone to review Microsoft Word based on an essay they wrote using it. You can't 'grade' or judge a software like this -- its purely a utility for players of the card game to use.

<li><b>Keep</b> Starcitygames is a reliable source. There are other sites that also mention it.

<dd>You are misinterpreting his argument. He never claimed MTG and politics are equivalent; he merely used an example in which <b>sometimes</b> association is sufficient.

<dd>That said, even though MTG may only be "minor-league" notable, Apprentice is not a fork of unencyclopedic minutiae, and I think MTG is still notable enough to support it.

<dd>Hmm, well, as to whether Magic is the equivalent of any major league sports, I'd say yes, it is somewhat. 6 million players worldwide. Over a million a year in pro-tour prize money (plus who knows how many hundreds of thousands of prizes awarded in other tournaments), who knows how many millions in sales? It may not be a football or a baseball, but it's not something to be ignored. Same reason why people didn't go for deletion of pro-magic players earlier this year. However, as Snowfire said, the primary purpose of my argument was NOT equivalence, but illustration. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 04:42, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Very useful list, organized so as to help find one from a particluar era. The incompleteness complaint is answered by listing all those with Wikipedia articles. If one is redlinked and deserves an article, add it. This is an inportan aspect of world hisotyr, as opposed to cruft, dicdefs, and lists of or articles about randome collections of things. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 00:41, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Addendum</b>. Allow me to expand my case. The crux of the argument for deletion is based on the theory that people would try to clog the list full of every military commander known to man. This argument, however, overlooks the notability requirements on Wikipedia. Instead, the argument assumes the worst without considering concurrent policies that would prevent such an overpopulation. --<a href="../../../h/e/m/User%7EHemlock_Martinis_534d.html" title="User:Hemlock Martinis">Hemlock Martinis</a> 01:12, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The structure of this list and the annotations are very useful. I would suggest sorting within the locations chronologically, but otherwise it's fine as is. A category can't replace this, and can't be chronologically sorted, which is very useful for historical analysis. There's no reason it can't be maintained as needed, and I believe I am the first one to even suggest any maintenance it might need. I can do my suggestion quite easily if this article is going to be kept. Furthermore, as Richard Arthur Norton pointed out, there is presently no category for military commanders. Not being able to fill the list with every military commander ever is not a problem. It doesn't need to be complete, just as complete as wiki contributors can make it. I can see no reason to delete it, and it's a very useful article, so I must recommend strongly that we keep it. -<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorsemanII_6314.html" title="User:NorsemanII">NorsemanII</a> 06:45, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I found this page useful too. As a category, military commanders, would be huge with no indication of who is more important than who. It would be a pain to dig through. A category for famous military commanders couldn't tell you what they were famous for. The biggest benefit to keeping this page is that you can subdivide it into even smaller partitions like famous ancient roman generals for instance and have a short description by the names. I was looking for an ancient Greek general that did a particular deed without knowing his name or date and I was able to use the (rather short) description to find him. It would have been a lot harder trying him down through another method. If anything this article needs a little expansion and concatination with some other famous military commander articles. <a href="../../../s/i/f/User%7ESifaka_87ba.html" title="User:Sifaka"><font color="green"><b>Sifaka</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/i/f/User_talk%7ESifaka_e89b.html" title="User talk:Sifaka"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></a></sup> 07:07, 6 December 2006 (UTC) <i>Additional point to make, there is nothing suitable to replace it as of now.

<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../w/a/r/War.html" title="War">Wars</a> are not necessarily <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invasion.html" title="Invasion">invasions</a>, e.g. the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict_7601.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict">2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</a>. The invasions category sorts the information alphabetically, which, as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_raids_b78e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of raids">I have said before</a> regarding history, is about as useful as a dictionary sorted by the approximate order the words came into use. Furthermore, the invasions category has the exact same controversy issues, so unless we are going to delete all listings of invasions on that justification, we shouldn't delete this. The controversy over whether or not something is an invasion must necessarily be done on a case-by-case basis, not by deleting all listings of invasions in a hope that censorship will somehow alleviate any problems. You'd still need to address whether or not it was an invasion on the actual article, so deleting this fixes nothing. As for calling this useless, it may be to you. However, historians have a lot of use for chronologically listed information. It's like saying that the numerous entries on dinosaurs are useless. If you don't care to learn about or study that information, it will be useless to you. If you're trying to understand history, they have a lot of use. -<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorsemanII_6314.html" title="User:NorsemanII">NorsemanII</a> 00:42, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>thats someone's essay, not a guideline. By that rationale there should be no lists of world leaders or popes. Every year or so there is another one. So logically, if time is infinite, no list will be complete.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The list is well within the realm of possibility for completion, and there are a great many lists on Wikipedia that are far more extensive than this. Check out the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_mathematical_articles.html" title="List of mathematical articles">List of mathematical articles</a>. That list is so gigantic that it has been split into dozens of sublists. Military operations is a tiny subject by comparison. Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia, and therefore, article size is not a consideration here, since this valuable subject matter can be split into sublists when the time comes fairly easily. &#160;<i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="purple">Th<font color="blue">e Tr<font color="#9ACD32">ans<font color="#FFCC00">hu<font color="orange">man<font color="red">ist</font> &#160;&#160;</font></font></font></font></font></a></b></i>09:18, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Having all of this listed by region, and sorted by the date the operation was carried out, with indicators for the country of origin is extremely useful and something a category can't even attempt to replace. It reads well, and the content is very useful. I would suggest splitting it into sub-articles for length, and I can do this myself if we're going to keep it, but otherwise it's perfect.

<li><b>Keep</b> are you also deleting the siege category? Siege seems well defined in the list, and in the article on sieges, and in the articles on individual sieges.

<li><b>Very strong keep</b> - nominator seems to have a bias against lists, even well-crafted ones that are continuously improving. Categories and lists supplement each other. Getting rid of one in favor of the other is not a good idea. This list is structured in ways that a category cannot be, and it presents information about each entry, also something that categories cannot do. A great many seiges are officially referred to as "The Seige of ______". That right there differentiates them from events called "The Battle of ________". Differentiating titles is a useful navigation approach. I agree with Richard that the term "seige" is well defined. &#160;<i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="purple">Th<font color="blue">e Tr<font color="#9ACD32">ans<font color="#FFCC00">hu<font color="orange">man<font color="red">ist</font> &#160;&#160;</font></font></font></font></font></a></b></i>12:48, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The relevance of the list resembling an annotated version of something one might find in a thesaurus? That seems like a clear indication of something that can be categorised rather than listified. Lists can add structure, or information, or allow navigation. This one doesn't add structure, the non-links don't seem to be a way of noting missing article topics, and the need for such a list for navigation purposes isn't obvious. The fact that there's a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_tactics.html" title="Military tactics">military tactics</a> article is a point in its favour, but I don't see that this list supplements the information in that article. Nor is this is a case where adding articles to <a href="../../../m/i/l/Category%7EMilitary_tactics_257e.html" title="Category:Military tactics">Category:Military tactics</a> will be controversial, which would be one very good reason to have a list.

<li><b>Comment</b>. As the original creator of the article, the list had originally been intended to list who who had been charged by an international organization for war crimes. In copiling this list, I used Sheldon Glueck's <i>War Criminals: Their Prosecution and Punishment</i>, <i>Victors' Justice: The Tokyo War Crimes Trial by Richard H. Minear</i> and partial information from <i>Nuremberg and Vietnam: an American Tragedy</i> by Telford Taylor, the latter being U.S. Chief Council at the <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremburg_Trials_cef5.html" title="Nuremburg Trials">Nuremburg Trials</a>. I believe these to be both reliable enough resources to support its encyclopedic value. Unfortunatly, while I've been busy with other projects, I've not had time to go through the list to investigate the inclusion of questionable entries (many of which are listed in Category:War criminals). This issue notwithstanding, the deletion of the list seems a bit extreme given the alternative of simply cleaning up the list. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMax_566e.html" title="User:MadMax">MadMax</a> 20:28, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> -- this is useful tabulation of disparate data, and interesting to many. Lists in general are great article organizing assets, and linked to primary articles are great aids to having nice professional looking articles that pack maximal information while presenting minimal intrusion into the main topic.

<li><b>Transwiki</b>, fine dining is a very commonly used word in the F&amp;B world. Deletion from this wiki will do more harm than good.

<li><b>Delete unless references provided</b> The main problem with the article as it stands right now is that there are no references cited verifying that the definition of "fine dining" provided in the article is an industry standard. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't, but the only way to know is if someone provides a cited reference demonstrating the definition is accurate. Also, note that transwiki faces the same issue. Wiktionary entries are likewise supposed to provide external published references to verify the definition is accurate. So even if you transplant this information to Wikipedia, it would face the same issue and possible deletion there as well. Bottom line: the article needs references to validate its accuracy. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:26, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki</b>. Given the state of the current article, this is about the only choice. The term is well used, so it should be defined someplace. I can see this coming back at some point to cover the history of the topic because the definition has changed over time. So it really is an encylopedic topic, but the current article is not encylopedic. For the record, I did look at about 50 articles that showed up in various google searches hoping to find some good references, but there were none.

<dd>Yes, but "That Adam considers a Copyvio" is implying that others wwouldn't consider it as such. You brought it up, I just said there was one previously (not naming a section), as it does make me worry that the other sections might have hidden copyvio. Also, I was referring to Holobaramin (~649 ghits), monobaramin (649 ghits as well), apobaramin (348 ghits), and polybaramin (218) - that whole section is clearly non-notable, anyway, and other sections, if anything, are *EVEN WORSE*.

They found a strong linear relationship and continuity among the sunflowers, and termed this relationship "biological trajectory." In applying the method of fossil equids, they found a branching relationship in the data, which indicated a divergence in ancestry. The linear relationship corresponded to the known chronological order of the fossils.<a href="http://www.bryancore.org/bsg/opbsg/002.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bryancore.org/bsg/opbsg/002.pdf" rel="nofollow">[46]</a></i> - This is a summary of a SINGLE, NON-NOTABLE PAPER. And I don't think that anything but the sections I put into Created kind does any better. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 21:28, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and expand</b> This is useful information for several reasons. First, it is clearly a major component of creationist pseudoscience. Creationists, and those trying to decipher creationist nonsense and blather will want to have access to this to be able to understand what they are encountering. This is the principle function of an encyclopedia; to provide a ready source of information about some subject. Second, this term will not likely be covered in standard science texts, because it is pseudoscience, but still those trying to defend against this pseudoscience need to understand it to arm themselves. This makes a WP contribution even more relevant. Third, the only other source of this sort of material will be in the copious creationist websites and tracts. None of them of course will identify it as pseudoscience, which it is. They will only talk about how wonderful it is, misleading the naive. So, in the absence of any proper scientific reference, the only information the public will have is badly biased. This is why it is REALLY important for WP to discuss it from a neutral point of view. Is it plagiarism of a single source? Possibly. Is it still pretty scanty? Yes it sure is. So it should be expanded, and fleshed out, so it can form a resource that is balanced, describing what baraminology is, its relevance, history, providing links, etc. This would be a very useful contribution. --<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 21:31, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That isn't a reason to keep it by itself, it might just mean they will all redirect to created kind. As far as I can tell, the notion of baraminology hasn't been discussed in any independent reliable sources. Heck, the TOA which is one of the most prominent pro-evolution/anti-creationist/whatever-term-you-prefer groups has not a single mention of the term. <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?q=Baraminology&amp;sa=Search&amp;sitesearch=www.talkorigins.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/custom?q=Baraminology&amp;sa=Search&amp;sitesearch=www.talkorigins.org" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>. Contrast that to something like <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flood_geology.html" title="Flood geology">Flood geology</a> which has gotten mentioned in major newspapers and other independent sources. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:48, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>keep</b> this is a concept used by a considerable number of people in a definable way, and the use of it is (unfortunately) widespread enough to be notable. I have added some additional distinction to make clear that it is not a science, and that the terminology it uses is not scientifically meaningful. There are different groups of creationists, and they use different terms and have organized their field in various ways. They shouldn't be considered as a homogeneous mass, as the disputes among them make evident. There is a single biological science, biology dealing with testable relationships. This is not true of creationism, as its concepts are derived on other bases. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 07:56, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. Since there a fair number of 'keep' votes (though still a definite minority), I took arguments into consideration, and it seems to me that to use a source as verification for something that is barely brushed on in the source is stretching <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> further than it is meant to be stretched.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Articles such as List of famous people wearing a moustache and List of bald people are kept unquestionably, and I don't see any reason to maintain a double standard. If you want to debate the notability of <i>all</i> of those articles, that's fine. But as long as the precedent is to keep lists of people with any defining physical characteristic, you can't just decide on a whim to delete a perfectly viable article. --<a href="../../../d/l/a/User%7EDLand_35ee.html" title="User:DLand">DLand</a><a href="../../../d/l/a/User_talk%7EDLand_38e8.html" title="User talk:DLand"><font color="green"><sup><small>TALK</small></sup></font></a> 05:26, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I disagree. My comment is backed up by examples. But I will happily clarify. My problem with this list is that choosing the criteria <i>beards</i> to classify people is arbitrary and absurd. One could classify people by all sorts of physical characteristics but what would be the point? The fact that they had beards did not make them better or worse politicians, singers etc. It was just a choice of personal grooming. Having a beard is simply not a remarkable thing and as such there is no reason to list those who have had one. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe">WJBscribe</a> 12:32, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The criteria for inclusion, the entries, and the references cited make clear that merely having a beard and being famous are not sufficient by themselves to be included in the list.--<a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 13:11, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see your point but I'm not sure the fact that a commentator has once remarked on someone's beard is significant. To take an example: you list <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Branson_37a9.html" title="Richard Branson">Richard Branson</a>. He is famous because he founded <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Group_f40e.html" title="Virgin Group">Virgin</a> and is a multi-millionaire. he is not famous in any way because of his beard and would be no less famous were he to never have sported a beard. Someone who has a beard may be identified by it- as may someone with hair of a distinctive colour or style, but it is not an essential element of their fame. As such I do not see how it can be notable in this form. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe">WJBscribe</a> 23:44, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you for your reply. However, it still is not clear as to which Wikipedia policy you are referring. <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#Discussion" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide_to_deletion#Discussion</a> requires a well-argued, fact-based case based upon Wikipedia policy.

Without identifying an item within a particular Wikipedia policy, your reasoning is not explained and it is not possible to determine whether your concerns have been addressed. In regards to your comments, the fact that a commentator has once particularly remarked on someone's beard being notable is Wikipedia significant per Wikipedia policy and guidelines. In particular, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is not item 1.1.7.1</a> expressly permits a list if the entries are famous because they are associated with or significantly contributed to the list topic. Further, <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html#References_for_list_Items" title="WP:LIST">Wikipedia list guideline reference for list items</a> states that articles should contain only material that has been published by reputable sources. I revised the lead paragraph and the article meets all Wikipedia policy and guidelines. Regarding <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Branson_37a9.html" title="Richard Branson">Richard Branson</a>, the reputable source, the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mail_c8b4.html" title="Daily Mail">Daily Mail</a>, identified that Branson is one of England's most famous beard-wearers in the context of Branson firing employees for wearing beards. The widely known event characterized and published by a Wikipedia reputable source brought notoriety to famous person Branson's beard, which is why Branson is on the list. Regarding your concerns about "<i>Where will this end? Famous people with blond hair etc. Famous people with a limp? Famous short people?,</i>" List of famous bearded people may serve as a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">precedent</a> by which all other lists of a similar vain may be judge. If those hypothetical articles maintain the high bar membership entry of List of famous bearded people, then they should be allowed. If not, they may be deleted, citing List of famous bearded people as a standard to which they need to achieve. Deleting List of famous bearded people will not discourage creation of the articles you mention, it will only povide one less basis for you to delete non Wikipedia policy lists.--<a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 20:34, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, I don't think it's POV to say who qualifies as famous (not overly POV anyway, as we are kind of in the business of deciding that here at Wikipedia), but its absolutely POV to say that one's whether one's beard is "the dominant aesthetic trait in the bearer, where the beard further increases the celebrity of that famous person" or not.

<li>Amarkov, I do understand your concerns. However, deleting one list article that complies with Wikipedia policy and guidelines to stem the creation of other potentially non-Wikipedia policy complying lists of this type will have the opposite effect of your intention. List of famous bearded people creates a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia precedent</a> against which all other like articles may be judge. If the article <i>List of people with feet</i> both states that membership entry on list of people with feet list requires that the entry be famous because the entry is associated with notable feet by a <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html#References_for_list_Items" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">reliable published source</a> as defined by <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html#References_for_list_Items" title="WP:LIST">Wikipedia Lists guidlines References for list Items</a>, and the entries in such a list comply with such a high bar requirement, then the list meets Wikipedia policy and guidelines. If you delete List of famous bearded people, then you will not have a solid, easy to use precedent against other similarly typed lists. Thus, deleting List of famous bearded people will work against your goal of stemming the creation of other potentially non-Wikipedia policy complying lists.--<a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 20:34, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, it is not clear as to which Wikipedia policy you are referring. <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#Discussion" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide_to_deletion#Discussion</a> requires a well-argued, fact-based case based upon Wikipedia policy. Without identifying an item within a particular Wikipedia policy, your reasoning is not explained and it is not possible to determine whether your concerns have been addressed. In addition, several people already have showed support for the nominator. As stated at <a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_Arguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions_a4ee.html#Per_nominator" title="User:Daduzi/Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions">Wikipedia arguments to avoid in deletion discussions, <i>Per nominator</i></a>, per nom is an argument without an argument and will not contribute significantly to the conclusion that is made by the administrator closing the discussing. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 20:34, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>OK, I'll try again. 1) A beard is not necessarily a defining characteristic. 2) Any attempt to define "famous" is POV. 3) The list is necessarily incomplete. Most importantly (here's your policy violation): 4) Linking to an internal Wikipedia policy page is blatant disregard for <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">Wikipedia:Avoid self-references</a>. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a><sup><a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User:Spangineer" class="extiw" title="wikisource:User:Spangineer">ws</a></sup>&#160;<small><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer"><font color="brown">(háblame)</font></a></small> 00:30, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A beard is often a defining characteristic of a person's appearance; having a list of people known for their beards is interesting and useful. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntony-22_516d.html" title="User:Antony-22">Antony-22</a> 22:27, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree with you that the list meets <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia List guidline</a> and all other Wikipedia policy and guidelines.

<li>Comon don't get ridiculous. Seriously no one is going to read this article. It's been up for GA for almost a month and no one wants to review it... why? Because its boring and no one, excepting weather people, cares about a hurricane in the middle of nowhere. Lets make it an FA along with every other hurricane in the middle of the Atlantic. Just take each days storm report, make a sentence or three out of it and wallah! It's FA material! I can see that people want to keep it, which is fine, but don't act like its an important article or that I am going to nominate Katrina.

<li>I am sorry if I offended you, the article is boring to me, it may not be to others. AFD isn't about 'respecting work' as far as amount of work done, there are plenty of articles that are deleted that have had hundreds of people hours poured into them, GNAA is a perfect example. This is about whether the article is 'notable' which I honestly do not believe it is. 1 - effected no one, 2- Less than a 1000 google hits. Any band with that many hits would be gone in a second, no matter how well written the article is. I am fine with this being closed because obviously others believe all hurricanes are notable, but DON'T treat me like I wasn't acting in good faith, I truly believe this article is not notable in any way, and the fact that it is languishing in GA was my prompt to place it here. Is there a dialog anywhere on which weather events are notable? Has a weather article ever been deleted? -<a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavedave_48c1.html" title="User:Ravedave">Ravedave</a> <small><sup>(<a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavedave_babyname_1bfa.html" title="User:Ravedave/babyname">help name my baby</a>)</sup></small> 05:59, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> You can't use that fact that people haven't contributed against this article. You don't have to be an avid wikipedia member to know about a subject. Also, a subject does not have to be interesting to have a page on Wikipedia (for example, the colour blue). I understand about the search results, but as is said above, a genre must start somewhere. I personally have only stumbled across Pirate Metal bands this year, and already have found there to be at least half a dozen, many of which have only started to release media in 2006, showing a tremendous initial growth.

<dd>(edit conflict) I'm not holding anything except the lack of <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">notability</a> against the article. Please, click on the link and read. Nobody has suggested that a subject has to be interesting to have a WP article: I've argued that being interesting is not a notability criterion (my research work is interesting, but certainly shouldn't have an article devoted to it). That a 'genre has to start somewhere' is not relevant: it doesn't start here, because this is an encyclopedia. And because it's an encyclopedia, we need <b>multiple, non-trivial, independent sources reporting on a subject</b>.

No <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> cited; borders on original research. Genres may "have to start somewhere", but Wikipedia does not exist to get them (or unsigned garage bands, struggling actor/waiters, or trivial and obscure pieces of shareware) started.

<li><b>Keep</b> Maybe it should be renamed to be "list of people with dwarfism", but not all people classed as "little people" consider themselves to have dwarfism. For example I don't.

<li><b>Keep</b> and rename List of famous men by height through 5 ft 5 in (165 cm).

The list requires the men to be famous - a widely-recognized person who commands a high degree of public and media attention.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Now I'm really confused.

<li><b>Very weak keep</b>. Unlike the bald, moustached and bearded lists, there is precedent for people like <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Barty_3291.html" title="Billy Barty">Billy Barty</a> and even <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mickey_Rooney_7dbd.html" title="Mickey Rooney">Mickey Rooney</a> to be known in part because of their height. However both articles need to be renamed as it requires POV judgement -- what constitutes famous? Also, clearly criteria needs to be set out for inclusion. A 5'6 man isn't necessarily notably short. Someone who is a dwarf or 5'1 could be. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:18, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, list is somehow encyclopedic, this list could be all those who are dwarfs. A criteria needs to be added as what 23skidoo said. T. Anthony made a point, it should be renamed "List of people with dwarfism". If you use the word short, anyone will just add any ordinary person who is just shorter than average.

<dd>It's still POV - there are many people who do not consider 5' 5" as short. At the least, the title needs to be changed to a NPOV name. Note also that Wikipedia is supposed to be global in scope and viewpoint; the list has a strong American bias in its interpretations as to what constitutes as "tall". <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 06:46, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps, but it could be fixable. All you'd need is sourcing that their comparative shortness was significant to their notability.

<li><b>Keep/Rename</b> - Drop "famous". Hmmm, short people. Napoleon instantly comes to mind. It may be useful to browse such a list. Can be used by teachers and parents to provide examples of individuals who overcame that particular limitation. Might also be particularly relevant for short people who want more information on other short people, to learn how they coped with their shortness. Having such a list would also provide a research tool for those studying related issues such as biases, discrimination against, and social attitudes toward short people. &#160;<i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="purple">Th<font color="blue">e Tr<font color="#9ACD32">ans<font color="#FFCC00">hu<font color="orange">man<font color="red">ist</font> &#160;&#160;</font></font></font></font></font></a></b></i>13:19, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

If they were lists of people who became famous substantially <i>because</i> they were tall (or were the first tall person to achieve something etc) there might be a purpose to the list.

<p><b>KEEP</b> Tiki Bar TV is an Internet phenomenon that has been widely covered in the online and print media.

<p><b>KEEP</b> Hear, hear Froese. The assertion that this is blatant advertising for a company, product, group or service is narrow-minded. TBTV is UNCONVENTIONAL and does not benefit from the brands that have been featured in earlier episodes of the podcast.

Successful television and movie actors have appeared on the show (see the article for a list).

<li><b>Weak keep</b> While the Forbes and Business Week sources are somewhat questionable in their trivality (the articles are mainly about podcasting, with Tiki Bar TV used as an example), the National Post article does focus about the show itself, thus counting as non-trivial coverage and passing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<li><b>Neutral</b>. I'm generally disinclined to support articles about podcasts, but this one has received some mainstream press coverage.

The article could stand to be cut down significantly. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:54, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per being the rare video podcast receiving mainstream media coverage. To the question above about db-spam, I don't think this one fits into that category. Looking back at the original article, I don't believe that the author has an affiliation with the podcast. And while the tone of certain parts of the article isn't great (ex. "the show contains seemingly effortless humour", it's not really worded as an advertisement. Certainly nothing that requires a substantial rewrite. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 23:44, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Every professional club has at least one supporters club but I don't think they are notable unless they have done something especially high-profile (some sort of campaign to save the club or something like that) and even that's questionable. Could be mentioned briefly in the main article on the club but as this appears to be a local club that would suggest there are other locally-based supporters clubs so in the interests of fairness they'd need to be mentioned too..... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 13:46, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Before its acquisition in April 2006, the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World66.html" title="World66">World66</a> web site had some biographical info on the founders, but this seems to be gone now.

<p>The article does not contain verifiable information. Rather, it is constituted of fictional (hoax) content, of note, the reference to a "Sweedish [sic] Viking" founder, the presumable intent of which is to further some interest or goal of its only editor who has added substantive content. Correspondingly, all other editors have only made minor edits to grammar, punctuation, etc. The link to source material is associated with the personal homepage of a Virginia, USA academic who states on that page that the family by the name Ruthven was not and is not a clan. There is a historic Ruthven family in Scotland, as there is in Cornwall, however, the origins and history attributed to them on this page are false. The authentic Scottish Ruthven family is described on the article for the <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruthven_%28family%29.html" title="Ruthven (family)">Ruthven (family)</a>. Also, the articles referring to various titles and peerages in Scotland relate to this latter family. There are several other sites on the web that refer to the Clan Ruthven history invented in this article, however, they are also sites with registered member or user-editor created content (e.g., www.scotclans.com, which is mainly an online store for novelty heritage goods). No such clan exists in noteworthy literary sources nor websites of more scholarly content. <a href="../../../d/v/o/User%7EDvonD_6d1e.html" title="User:DvonD">DvonD</a> 11:15, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi MER-C... To add to your argument for deletion: I also looked at ghits, and I think 548 may be exaggerated, due to some of the ghits referintg to another concept, that is, how media consumers can become critical listeners and viewers of advertising. In the context of the article however, "advertising lit" seems to refer to how well advertising techniques work in manipulating the public mind. --<a href="../../../b/h/u/User%7EBhuston_3e3b.html" title="User:Bhuston">Bhuston</a> 12:20, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Because I am agreeing with deleting the article as it currently stands. The article as it currently stands does not meet the required standard. The fact that the company itself may be notable etc. etc. isn't the question being addressed. We should be looking for quality not quantity, we have no need to keep rubbish waiting for someone to make it good. If someone addresses the issues whilst the AFD is running I will likely change my mind, but in it's current state no. I've seen too many AFDs where people jump up and down saying but this is a notable company (or whatever) and 6 months later we still have the same junk article as was put up for deletion. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 13:35, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sourcing should be no problem. They get plenty of press, and seem to be fairly often cited as a case study in business and management books. For example, the book <i>Driving Consumer Equity</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0684864665</a>) gives a case study on them in terms of "value equity", in that consumers are willing to pay considerably more for a durable product built to a high standard of quality. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 13:57, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Red links are just an invitation from one editor to all editors to do the hard work of writing a quality article.

Even RMS could not have done it all by himself, and many of his ideas, strategies, and tactics came from this team. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory</a> 1.7.1 notes: "Of course, there is nothing wrong with having lists if their entries are famous because they are associated with or significantly contributed to the list topic, for example Nixon's Enemies List." - this is one of those cases. These FSF employees all worked at well below industry scale for their job descriptions, and worked well beyond 40 hours a week, to donate to the cause and as a public service. As noted in <a href="../../../w/i/k/WikiPedia_62ce.html#History" title="WikiPedia">WikiPedia#History</a> and <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNUpedia_85e0.html" title="GNUpedia">GNUpedia</a>, this team contributed to the idea that became Wikipedia. This team also created and proved that free software worked -- which caused the creation of the free software that Wikipedia uses. It's unlikely that Wikipedia would exist, if it had to pay companies like Oracle, royalties to use their software. <i>Summary: This team and it's members are notable.</i> <a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELentower_3d21.html" title="User:Lentower">Lentower</a> 01:46, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>if their entries <b>are famous because</b> they are associated with or significantly contributed to</i>. Being associated with the list topic is not enough; the entries have to have achieved some kind of fame or notoriety as a result, and I don't think every single person who has worked for the FSF qualifies.

<li>{Ahh, ignorance of a different kind.&#160;;-} My apologies. None of the FSF Directors have been or are paid. This is true of most non-profits. And the FSF Directors are all active, giving much donated time (rarer among non-profits), and in some cases donated funds.</li>

<li>That would leave it a very short list though. Better to mention those who actually are notable in the FSF article proper (yes, I am aware that the article currently proposed for deletion was split from the FSF in the first place). Preferably with some sort of context or assertion of notability rather than just a list, so it's clearer who to include and who not. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFiggyBee_3e70.html" title="User:FiggyBee">FiggyBee</a> 02:33, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The <i>most</i> significant persons associated with the FSF should be mentioned in the article <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Software_Foundation_6e41.html" title="Free Software Foundation">Free Software Foundation</a>. However, per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>, I can't see why Wikipedia would want to include a list of people just because they are staff/employees/volunteers there. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:44, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete and UNDO</b> the edit to the FSF article that split the list out. There were minimal other changes in that edit which could be redone by hand. I see no reason to have this as a standalone article. Where are the <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">independent</a> sources on the topic of the FSF's staff? I'd be surprised if there are any. Putting the list back in the main article is appropriate; the editors there should evaluate whether they believe each red linked individual is sufficiently notable (per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>) that an encyclopedia article could be written someday - if they are not yet so notable, either unlink or remove completely. For the blue linked folks, the answer is presumably already obvious. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 09:59, 6 December 2006 (UTC) Tweaked bolding per suggestion on my talk. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 16:39, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> the notable members back into the FSF article, as per GRBerry. On the one hand, we don't want the FSF article to get unmanageably long (if its maintainers decide there are many notable members); on the other, having a list full of redlinks is not very useful, or encyclopedic. I believe the best course of action is to merge for now, and if in the future there start to be too many members listed in the FSF article (who have their own articles, meaning there was enough material to write at least a stub about them), *then* split off to a list. "too many" in this case meaning "enough to start a list with, so that it contains a majority of blue links". <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapi_43f5.html" title="User:Capi">Capi</a> 16:32, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I believe this to be an ill-founded opinion and extremely short sighted. With the allowance of this page, clearly a development would be made in making the page more accesible, more biographical, and more notable. Indeed i notice your Canadian; i fail to see how you could understand the interest in Ghionis &amp; McKee when you fall out of their current catchment area.
<p>With a solid base upon Wikipedia surely their interest will grow; and indeed this will create more knowledge of them further afield - perhaps even Canada.</p>
<p>You are applying a usual "deletion" process which i believe does not speak for the general public. You may not be interested; you are after all a bachelor of mathematics; yet you do not speak for the public who will witness this page with cuiosity, interest and acknowledgement.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It <i>isn't</i> only relevant for homebrewers.

To the best of my knowledge, <i>Kid Radd</i> is also the most sophisticated <a href="../../../p/i/x/Pixel_art.html" title="Pixel art">pixel art</a> webcomic in existence, and it is the only one on Wikipedia that incorporates animation, so deletion would create a substantial gap in our coverage of the art form. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 02:09, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep,</b> I personally believe that this article was nominated simply out of bias against sprite based webcomics. The difference between this sprite based web comic and most others is that content is orignal, hand drawn by the author. Not only that, but the author also arranged a clever html setup designed to save bandwidth for slower users, which not only allowed for easy animation in certain strips, it even allowed for the use music and was responcible for the creation of original music made just for the Kid Radd comic inself. As well as those other points, Kid Radd also presented unique story that not only served for a comedy but for emotional drama as well. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETen_Surp_e772.html" title="User:Ten Surp">Ten Surp</a>

<li>What he said. I know how tempers can flare up in a deletion debate, but BradBeattie has concerned himself with inclusion criteria and not showed any kind of sprite comic bias. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 03:21, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Should the criteria listed in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> alone be used to determind whether a web-based article should be deleted or not? If something is popular enough people are going to look for it's information on it and nine times out of ten they going to go to Wikipedia. If the article is deleted, sooner or later someone is going to recreate the article. I apologized if my first comment violated AGF. But a quick question, bias against sprite comics may be what I assumed, but who here thinks the article should be deleted simply because it falls short of a set of rules that prioritizes independent notiblity over popularity to may be attributed to a clut following? --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETen_Surp_e772.html" title="User:Ten Surp">Ten Surp</a>

<li><b>Keep</b>: The problem is this: There are trillions of less notable pages here and they dont get deleted. Why? Because no one cares. But in this case, in case of stuff that is critical of Islam, there are lots of believers who will do anything to get any Islam-critical article deleted. They'll apply all the policies they can to get the stuff out. Thats whats going on. There's a huge opposition to criticism of Islam. Its unfair for material that is anti-Islamic. Obviously Ali Sina is vehemently opposed by Muslims. Maybe the present Islam-critique effort should be focused on Criticms of Islam sections. The big problem there is the Revert wars. Somehow that has to be resolved. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 19:32, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I propose that you go and "care" about the neglected articles, instead of that we treat this article as a neglected article.

<dd>Thats what I'm saying. Usually any other lesser-known XYZ person wouldnt have a problem staying in on Wikipedia, but Ali Sina has a problem because of the large group of people who detest him and his views. Right? The bigger problem though is not the existence of Ali Sina. That can be solved and reliable sources can be found. I have no doubt. The bigger problem is endless revert wars in any controversial article and Wikipedia's inefficiency to deal with this scenario. I'm thinking about what can be done. Even if we focused our efforts on Islam-critical articles, Muslims want to revert every word we add in. They will do it if they can. This is the bigger problem. Its not limited to articles about Islam. It applies to any controversial article. Most of the articles on Wikipedia are not controversial. No one cares about the article <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider.html" title="Spider">Spider</a>. You wont see revert wars going on there. But on topics with strongly different opinions and where editors of different beliefs are editing, thats where the problem lies and currently, Wikipedia doesnt have any policies about how to deal with this effectively. New policies have to be made to deal with this. This is what has to be solved before Criticism of Islam can proceed successfully. I dont know whats a good solution for this. Again, obviously when trillions of other lesser known people exist on Wikipedia, its unfair that Ali Sina was singled out. The policies were applied on him strictly, only because all the Muslims on Wikipedia are opposed to his presense. This is a fact. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 20:46, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I lack a dog in this fight, but I disagree on some points you raise and wanted to comment. First, please don't take this the wrong way, but please know that <a href="../../../t/h/e/There_is_no_cabal.html" title="There is no cabal">there is no cabal</a> against criticism of Islamic thought. Second, the people who comment on AfD typically have <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral points of view</a> about the subjects being considered - no one is out to get a category of articles; we're only interested in notability and appropriateness for the encyclopedia. We're mostly editor geeks - not politicos. Third, I care about <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider.html" title="Spider">spider</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple.html" title="Apple">apple</a>, and all other articles about notable things (and you will, in fact, see some strange revert wars going on in articles like that sometimes. Like I said, editor geeks.) However, wikipedia does have good policies for dealing with editors with different points of view - I'd point you to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. When there's a question of which point of view to include, the answer is simple: neither. If there are disputes, there's a procedure for <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">requesting comment</a>. When there's a question of whether an article should be deleted, the article comes here for outside comment. To my mind, no new policies are needed to address that. And, finally, if there are non-notable articles on wikipedia, it's our goal here to smoke them out regardless of subject - you can help by finding articles about non-notable people and sending them to AfD. With that said, I have no idea whether this particular article is notable, so this is just a <b>comment.</b> --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 22:04, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bob, like I said: there are 100's of articles right now lacking RS. Why was Ali Sina singled out? Because all the Muslims in Wikipedia want him out. You say there's no cabal - do you know of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Islam%7EThe_Muslim_Guild_0890.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Islam:The Muslim Guild">Muslim guild</a>? It existed until recently. What do you think its purpose was? These people are here to kill Criticism of Islam. Sadly, they wont succeed. The only sad thing is like I said: Ali Sina was singled out for deletion when there are 100's of other articles lacking RS, only because Muslims dont want to see Islam being criticized. Thats common sense. As for RFC, here's the thing: there's a dispute on every edit of the Criticms of Islam section (and its related articles as well). Therefore, filing disputes like this is not efficient. What I'm thinking is, some sort of policing should be done to make sure stuff is not reverted without discussion on the Talk page and anyone who does revert like that, should be suspended for some time. This hsould apply for any highly controversial articles. Do you still think RFC can deal with the edit warring that goes on constantly on an hourly basis on Islam-critical sections? --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 23:55, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Someone wiser than me once said that <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wikipedia%7EWords_of_wisdom_e960.html#There_is_only_a_cabal_if_you_want_there_to_be_one" title="Wikipedia:Words of wisdom">there is only ever a cabal if you want there to be one</a>. But even if you want to think that some particular group of editors <b>have</b> "formed a cabal," the fact remains that Wikipedia contains checks against that type of POV-pushing - such as AfD.</dd>
<dd>In any event, I'd ask you to consider the possibility that this article was "singled out" only on the good-faith belief that its subject may be non-notable. In that regard, you may want to review <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">the requirement that we assume good faith</a> - I wouldn't assume that any marking of an article for deletion is based on bad-faith religious bias of some sort.</dd>
<dd>If you think there are 100's of other articles without reliable sources that should also be deleted - bring them here for deletion. It's good for the encyclopedia. That we haven't gotten around to discussing other articles yet doesn't mean that we are "targeting" the article we <i>are</i> discussing.</dd>
<dd>Do I think that RfC and our other processes can deal with edit-warring when dealing with difficult and controversial subjects? Yes - because I assume good faith. Will it always work? Nope. Will it be easy or efficient? Not a chance. But the alternative - assuming bad faith and cutting off editing of the encyclopedia - is far more damaging to the project than any amount of editing warring can ever be. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 00:26, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bob, none of us infidels care about an XYZ obscure Islamic leader having his page. But these people do care about Ali Sina and they'll try all they can to get him out of here. Can I remind you that attempts were made to delete Category:Former Muslims and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_who_left_Islam_6892.html" title="List of people who left Islam">List of people who left Islam</a>? See whats going on there? Thats what they do. Islam won over Wikipedia in this case because <a href="../../../z/a/k/Zakir_Naik_b802.html" title="Zakir Naik">Zakir Naik</a> was allowed to stay and Ali Sina was deleted. Ali Sina cant come out in public and debate, or else he'll be killed. I dont have the time or desire to go and battle pages of obscure Islamic figures into deletion, none of us cares about that. But for muslims Ali Sina is prominent and must go. With 80,000 hits on Google, a high ranking website and debates with famous Islamic figures he's much more notable than so many other folks on Wikipedia i.e. he obviously passes the professer test because he's well more well known than the average college professor. These guys have the guts to say he's non-notable, when infact each one of them knows of his name since a long time. The basic problem is the selective application of the policies. We're getting some good third party sources now. The admin was unfair and did not allow us time to put these sources in. After a good number of sources are in, I will attempt a request for undeletion of this page. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 02:47, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Matt is right. There is definitely a cabal to uproot any criticism of Islam. It is no secret that Muslims do not like their faith critiqued and they have killed those who dare to. So it is shortsighted to believe these very Muslims suddenly become disimpassioned about their religion when they become editors of wikipedia. Show me one Islamic country where the critics of Islam are not in jail. I also agree with Matt, this matter requires some serious consideration; otherwise what suffers is fairness in wikipedia. Furthermore the Ali Sina article was deleted illegally. ‘’’The votes were 18 to 17 in favor of Keep.’’’ As the result that article should be reinstalled. If the result of voting is not going to be respected, why vote at all? Faithfreedom.org has received over four million unique visitors in the last 15 months and it received one million page views per month. This movement of the ex-Muslims is entirely Internet based.

<dd>While I do disagree with your views on that, I know full well that I have zero chance of convincing you that Wikipedia isn't being overwhelmed by a Muslim cabal, so I'll just leave it at that. One note, though - AfD is not a "vote," it's a discussion. If, for example, two people made persuasive delete comments ("This article fails WP:Band"), and 50 people "voted" keep based only on something entirely non-persuasive (e.g. "but we really like our friends' band!") - an article would be properly deleted. It's a discussion, not a vote. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 15:40, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you, Striver. WorldNetDaily only did one story on Ali Sina and FaithFreedom.org (so far). I know other online journals have done stories as well, and some of them, like the WND article, are pointed to as external links at the bottom of the Wikipedia article about FaithFreedom (as discussed at the top of the talk page). I expect more articles will be appearing in secondary sources when Dr. Sina's first book is released publicly this coming year, at which time there will be an even greater need for an article on FaithFreedom.org and/or Dr. Sina here at Wikipedia.org than there has been here already. I'm sorry, Striver, but I do not know the meaning of the abbreviation RS. What is RS? 72.136.43.94 01:57, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you, again, Striver. I consider WorldNetDaily a reliable source. I know they have a point of view, but they are careful about making sure the facts back up their point of view. The editor in chief, Joseph Farah, has over 30 years experience in the mainstream newspaper business, including work as the top editor at a major newspaper. WND sends out independent investigative journalists to places in the world and writes their own copy rather than simply relying on Reuters, etc. As for the previous unsigned commentator in this thread who called it a "right wing propaganda organ" that is true in the objective sense but false in the perjorative sense of the meaning of the word "propaganda" (i.e. "to propagate ideas" vs. "to propagate ideas through lies", respectively). It is thanks to the propagation of certain ideas promoted by the editor in chief at WND that my thinking moved away from knee-jerk liberal responsiveness to thoughtful consideration of all points of view, left, right, center and others. In short, WND is well written independent journalism and no amount of slagging off against it will change that fact. I only wish they would give Ali Sina and FaithFreedom more space on their site. One exclusive article back in September, 2004 is not enough. I'm sure, however, that when Ali Sina's book is published, WND will give it some more coverage, though. Oh, and one more thing. Would people please refrain from referring to WorldNetDaily as a "blog". I know what a "blog" is, and WorldNetDaily is much more than a mere blog. Would you call Al Jazeera or MSNBC blogs?

I am a muslim but I never wrote anti christian or athiesm or any other material. why is this bias only with muslims. plz matt explain me. all the reference comes from either FFI site or sister site why not provide NPOV sites which claim FFI or Ali Sina is notable. Even Ali sina Existence is Disputed how can we have his page and his website page if his existence. I think this site is run by anti muslim bias group. matt57 people like FFI web admins and u are trying to increase the hatred towards islam and muslims fall in this hatred and hate the western world even though there are lot of westerners who are neutral and not bias. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMak82hyd_866c.html" title="User:Mak82hyd">Mak82hyd</a> 02:07, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You seem to be confused about which notability guidelines we are using here. Under <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>, an organization must be verified to have a certain scope (such as "international"). However, we are using <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> here, and there is no such requirement. It doesn't matter if they claim to be international and they aren't really (although obviously any Internet site is "international"). It doesn't matter if they have an office or a snailmail address that you can mail them at. Read WP:WEB very carefully and you will see that geographic scope and mailing address are not mentioned there. This particular concern is irrelevent. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 00:14, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There have been many underground organizations in the history some of them with huge impact. FFI is very much known even though most of its contributors do not use their real name. Only because an anonymous group of people have managed to create so much fear in Muslims it is worth mentioning it. As for Ali Sina’s anonymity, it is only a speculation. He has been silent on that question and maybe because he prefers his enemies think he is not using his real name so they don’t go after him. A man whose existence is disputed and has managed to stir this much emotions makes him notable. We can’t blame him for using a pseudonym when he is constantly under the threat of assassination.

<dd>Okay, well no reply even though I left the same question on your talk page and you made other contributions after that. Let me discuss "rewriting." I'm going to assume that your issue is that the article should be rewritten to be more NPOV since that's what so many other "delete" votes have been, although my argument applies equally to all requests for rewrite-or-delete. <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_not_be_needed" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Problem articles where deletion may not be needed</a> explains that in NPOV cases, deletion is not the answer, but tagging is. The point is that an NPOV problem, unlike a notability problem, can always be solved by better editing and so there's no need to delete. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion#How to discuss an AfD/Wikietiquette</a> says "<i>The argument "non-neutral point of view" (violates WP:NPOV) is often used, but often such articles can be salvaged, so this is not a very strong reason for deletion either.</i>" And at the top of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a> it says "<i>For problems that do not require deletion, including ... POV problems, be bold and fix the problem or tag the article appropriately.</i>" Over and over again we see that if a problem <b>can be fixed by rewriting</b> then there is <b>no argument for deletion</b>. "Rewrite-or-delete" is simply not a valid argument, because it sets up a false dichotomy. The reality is don't-delete-because-rewrite-is-possible. You've said that you want a rewrite, so you feel that rewrite is possible, therefore you don't have any grounds to call for deletion. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 11:14, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No you are mistaken - there was a consensus and the result should have been keep BUT the admin felt the page had too few cites (which I agree with him as a result). This was a technical reason regarding the mechanics of the actual article not actual notability reason.

<dd>lol, i really enjoy this: They have "rational thinking" as their headline, and then quote qur'an 4:78 together with a pic of 911. Wow, i wish i had that kind rational powers! Anyway all thre links provided above are presumably writen by the author of the site, considering that they all are under a special "alisina" sub-directory. I still see only one right blog giving this site notable coverage per WP:WEB, so i am not convinced that this articles fullfills any inclusion criteria. Its also nice that he reiterates the old "Palestinians celebrate" lie. Go Sinai! --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 16:11, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I'm pretty sure that the FFI stuff on Humanists.net is written by Ali Sina. However, that is immaterial to the notability. What matters is that the Institute for Humanist Studies <i>are republishing</i> his FFI work, and that fulfills criterion 3, which says "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators". It doesn't ask for the content to be rewritten in someone else's words. I am also disappointed with the "Palestinians celebrate" stuff, and I think that Sina is unfortunately repeating some nasty far-right talking points there. But whether or not I respect him has nothing to do with the organization's notability, which is clearly established by IHS's republishing, even without regard to others' arguments for notability above. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 16:45, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm. But they say "<i>At Humanists.net we provide free Web hosting and e-mail to organizations and individuals whose Web presence has the potential to contribute to the health of the global secular or humanist movements. We offer this service because we are committed to the cooperative use of innovation and technology in promoting the humanist perspective.</i>"<a href="http://humanists.net/mission.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://humanists.net/mission.html" rel="nofollow">[69]</a> So they approve of the FFI's work. The line is pretty fuzzy here between what would constitute republishing ("We will reprint anything you hand to us") and hosting ("Here, go ahead and use our tools to reprint your work"). In principle the two are no different if the organization providing the tools is in explicit approval of the subsite's contents. And even if it didn't count for criterion 3, then the IHS's inclusion of FFI on their site would reduce to an instance of criterion 1, and would be another cite in addition to the WorldNetDaily cite. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 17:30, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

And regardless of how inclusionist they may be, the statement I quoted above, "...whose Web presence has the potential to contribute to the health of the global secular or humanist movements..." shows that they aren't just hosting, but they are explicitly approving of what they host. That's in principle the same as republishing, so it satisfies criterion 3.

<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> says criterion 1 is: "<i>The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself</i>". This would apply to apologetics sites <a href="http://faith-freedom.org" class="external text" title="http://faith-freedom.org" rel="nofollow">faith-freedom.org</a> and <a href="http://faithfreedom.com/" class="external text" title="http://faithfreedom.com/" rel="nofollow">faithfreedom.com</a>, would it not? The sources (such as the Qur'an) that they use to argue against FFI are independent of FFI itself, and the sites themselves are far too extensive to be called trivial. That would make two more instances of criterion 1. And there's also <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060224081904/http://www.icssa.org/alisinaface.html" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20060224081904/http://www.icssa.org/alisinaface.html" rel="nofollow">this coverage</a> by the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Centre_for_Strategic_Studies_and_Analysis_db46.html" title="Independent Centre for Strategic Studies and Analysis">Independent Centre for Strategic Studies and Analysis</a> (the site is down at the moment so I grabbed the Web Archive). ICSSA is independent and their coverage is also non-trivial, and their site wasn't set up <i>just</i> to counter FFI (although neither was faith-freedom.org which is a redirect to part of a larger site). So these citations, especially ICSSA, seem to be solidly in the camp of WP:WEB criterion 1, making at least five separate non-trivial instances by my count (WorldNetDaily, FrontPageMag, ICSSA, f-f.org, ff.com); did I miss any others? And I'm still convinced that the IHS's hosting with explicit endorsement of content is in principle no different from republishing. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 22:22, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Do you mean the third link I gave? Obviously the first and second reference FF since they named themselves after it. So I will assume you meant the ICSSA link. First of all, let me discuss the two FF-named sites, faith-freedom.org and faithfreedom.com, as I think you misunderstand the WP:WEB requirements. Read criterion 1 again: "<i>The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.</i>" Nowhere does it say that the third-party sources have to be notable enough to have their own Wikipedia articles. It just says they have to be <i>non-trivial.</i> This, itself, is a non-trivial distinction. For example, in an article on a scientific phenomenon, we might use the existence of articles in certain published peer-reviewed journals to establish notability. There are literally thousands of such journals that would be acceptable for this purpose, and they are not all notable enough to bother having Wikipedia articles made for them, but they would still be non-trivial and acceptable to use to justify notability for a scientific phenomenon. This is the difference between notability and non-triviality. They are not the same and one bar is lower. I submit that the FF-named sites are extensive and referenced enough to be considered non-trivial here. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 02:04, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

Anyway, the set of examples at WP:WEB is obviously for the kiddies. It's a very simple "how to" but not at all binding; in the real world we have fuzzy situations and we have to argue the distinctions on their merits. Saying that my links are not like the examples given is not, alone, an argument. My point regarding use of non-notable yet non-trivial citations for other articles, like scientific phenomena, still stands. We can use them in such instances so I see no reason not to here, espcially when the guideline specifically says non-trivial, not non-notable. Faithfreedom.com, for instance, might not be notable enough for its own article, I'll grant you that. But that doesn't automatically mean that it's not a valid citation for something that is more notable, like FFI. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 04:15, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now, regarding the ICSSA link, you say it's all about Ali Sina and not about FF. The link I gave is an article on the ICSSA site that references a debate between Ali Sina and Yamin Zakaria. Perhaps you have forgotten what the early Faith Freedom site was primarily about. It was <b>anti-Islam with an gimmick offer to remove the site</b> (later with $50,000 tacked on to the offer) for anyone who could defeat Sina in a debate about Islam. The first two lines of the front page were: "The movement of ex-Muslim secularists and humanists to lead Muslims out of faith of hate and into the fold of humanity WE WILL REMOVE THIS SITE IF PROVEN WRONG."<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040605193200/www.faithfreedom.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20040605193200/www.faithfreedom.org/" rel="nofollow">[72]</a> Faith Freedom hinged its very existence on the debate offer, became synonymous with the debate offer. Zakaria took up the debate, hoping to take the money and use it for some Muslim charity and to shut down Faith Freedom's website, and then the debate was catalogued on both sites, Faith Freedom<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051130070702/www.faithfreedom.org/debates/YaminZakariaindex.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20051130070702/www.faithfreedom.org/debates/YaminZakariaindex.htm" rel="nofollow">[73]</a> and ICSSA<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060224081852/www.icssa.org/yameendebate.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20060224081852/www.icssa.org/yameendebate.html" rel="nofollow">[74]</a>. The ICSSA copy of the debate even discusses and links to Faith Freedom.<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050406004604/icssa.org/yamindebate8.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20050406004604/icssa.org/yamindebate8.html" rel="nofollow">[75]</a> So if the ICSSA site is discussing and linking to Faith Freedom in the context of the debate, <i>and the debate took place with Zakaria's intent of shutting down Faith Freedom,</i> then it's pretty hard to say that the ICSSA site is all about Sina but not about Faith Freedom. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 02:04, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>So? Even plenty of <i>trivial</i> sources that add up to a nontrivial set of information can be useful. Moreover, the site itself is arguably a good provider of information about itself. Nonetheless, the motives of the person behind it are poorly understood - I take it for granted that he thinks Islam sucks, but don't know much other than what he says. This is where third-party sources might be useful, as well as in calculating its effect. And even numerous trivial sources exploring different facets of the site can add up to a nontrivial source. — <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickyrab_21c2.html" title="User:Rickyrab">Rickyrab</a> | <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickyrab_2fd1.html" title="User talk:Rickyrab">Talk</a> 19:01, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I can never support a site like this and any site which is full of hatred towards innocents. even if a muslim site comes up and suggest all americans be killed wherever they are as they have invaded countries and killed innocent people, 'I will never support it'. killing anybody in the name of religion and in the name of terrorism cannot be justified, unless for self defense in combat situation like war in Iraq and Afghanistan(when Some country just come and attack your country for OIL or Personal agenda, claiming excuses like terrorism, WMD etc. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMak82hyd_866c.html" title="User:Mak82hyd">Mak82hyd</a> 22:34, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Mak82hyd, if you are admitting that your concerns about notability and sourcing have been resolved, and the only reason you have left for voting "Delete" is because you don't like the content of the site, then your vote won't actually be counted. We have plenty of hate sites already, like <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront.org.html" title="Stormfront.org">Stormfront.org</a>. I don't believe that FFI is a "hate site", but in any case it doesn't matter, if it were that still wouldn't count against the FFI article one bit. You don't get to simply have a "vote up or down" here; you have to actually give reasons why the site is or is not notable. If you can't give such a reason (that hasn't already been addressed above) then your vote won't mean anything, sorry. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 23:37, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have replied and replied concerning notability. For the third (fourth?) time, read this: I guess you overlooked the <a href="../../../i/c/s/ICSSA_90e3.html" title="ICSSA">ICSSA</a> source. ICSSA is a Canadian Muslim think tank, and they also covered Faith Freedom. I won't repeat everything, just look at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Faith_Freedom_International_b670.html#ICSSA2" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Faith Freedom International">the earlier discussion</a> of it. So that's another third party source (<i>very</i> third party indeed) and with that alone we now have multiple third party sources (I gave others you overlooked too, but you really only need to acknowledge this one). Multiple third party sources satistfies <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, to put it simply. There, notability per WP:WEB established. Unless you can expain to me how a Muslim thnk tank discussing Faith Freedom International is somehow not sufficient for WP:WEB, then your objection is resolved. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 01:46, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mak82hyd: FFI is not advocating violence. It is a site made by ex-Muslims created to oppose the ideology of Islam. I am afraid you are not being truthful when you say “The author wants all Muslims to be killed”. Plese provide a link. It is clear that you do not like anyone criticizing Islam. What you are doing is character assassination with libel. Assuming what you say is true, which is not, still FFI remains notable and has to have an article in Wikipedia. What we are witnessing here is censorship. Muslims do not tolerate criticism of their religion. They will try to silence anyone who dares to speak against their faith. Why all the Muslims, including their top politicians, were outraged over Pope’s statement on Islam? Some of them even called for his death. Muslims should learn to tolerate criticism. This long discussion jsut shows how intolerant they are of those criticizing their faith. <a href="../../../o/c/e/User%7EOceanSplash_1197.html" title="User:OceanSplash">OceanSplash</a> 3:34 10 Dec. 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Along with other former Muslims such as Ibn Warraq, Sina is spearheading what may be the first organized movement of ex-Muslims in Islamic history, ….It is no exaggeration to say that if the likes of Ali Sina, Ibn Warraq and Wafa Sultan prevail in the face of the traditional death penalty for leaving Islam, then Islam will never again be the same." Obviously both Ali Sina and FFI are notable enough. We might actually be wittnessing the start of a real revolution in Islamic world. This is worth reporting. Obviously Muslims are not very pleased with this situation and will do anything to censor it. <a href="../../../o/c/e/User%7EOceanSplash_1197.html" title="User:OceanSplash">OceanSplash</a> 9:58 11 Dec. 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, some good stuff here. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Ball_7d82.html" title="Jim Ball">Jim Ball</a> is a talk show host on Sydney's <a href="../../../2/g/b/2GB_2883.html" title="2GB">2GB</a> radio station which has been in business for 80 years. His coverage (and he explicitely mentions Faith Freedom) is very notable. <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian.com.html" title="Iranian.com">Iranian.com</a> is also pretty heavy, and they are publishing Sina on there representing Faith Freedom at the link you gave. With these two, plus ICSSA's apologetics, IHS's endorsment, WorldNetDaily's article, and FrontPageMag's symposium, we're safely into notability. I'm still going to be picky and ask you to keep in mind, OceanSplash, that anti-Scientologist and anti-Creationist articles get the same AfD maneuvers pulled on them, so don't overlook the wider scope of the problem. But you were dead on earlier when you said "<i>It is funny that Ali Sina’s article was deleted under the pretext that he was not notable. Now we are told that he is notable, it is FFI that is not notable.</i>" —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 10:58, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>no vote</b> It is strange that there is a lesser notability threshold for websites than for people. Those sources that are provided do not even begin to meet WP:BIO. Not even close... but they are multiple. I have not seen conclusive evidence for more than one of them being non-trivial... so i advice closing admin to take a really close look at the evidence provided and ask himself: <i>"Do we want to include all the websites that can bring fourth an equal un-impresive and borderline list of third party coverage"</i>? "Ali Sinai is the owner/host/random of FFI" is hardly non-trivial. Or is it? Does mutliple occurences of that equal it to one non-trivial coverage? Should a traffic rating of <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.faithfreedom.org%2F" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.faithfreedom.org%2F" rel="nofollow">24,746</a> considered a merit? i don't know. In any case, i don't feel comfortable voting delete to this. But i would like to point out that PrisonPlanet, a site that is infinetly more refered to by third party source and has a rating of <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=prisonplanet.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=prisonplanet.com" rel="nofollow">5,972</a> was deleted as nn. To the closing admin: I will take the result of this afd as setting a precedence. Do we want a bunch of sites with this merit? Remeber that notability is a key issue of WP. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 12:24, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You think even the ICSSA thing is trivial? When the very purpose of the debate was to shut down Faith Freedom? Is the FrontPageMag symposium trivial if Sina was invited solely because of his FFI work? Several of the other Sina/FFI pieces are also of the Sina-is-here-because-of-FFI sort. Two Muslim websites, faith-freedom.org and faithfreedom.com, have been registered just to fight against FFI; is that trivial? I keep seeing people say "trivial, trivial" but there's no explanation of why or how. Nobody's explained to me how ICSSA's coverage is trivial, for instance, and that's been sitting here for a couple of days during which anyone could have responded point by point. And by the way, I just checked WP:BIO and the first criterion is "<i>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.</i>" Which is plainly what we have here, though I've argued that since all the Sina coverage has been because of FFI then it should count as such, yet it was argued elsewhere that such coverage was not notable for Sina and now here somehow it's not notable for FFI either? It's starting to feel like we're just getting the run-around. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 19:31, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The group has notability through size (100+ members? Would be nice if someone with knowledge could provide an exact number) and scale (10+ cities across Ontario). While relatively young, it has existed for three years, long enough to survive the high failure rate of many groups. The <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation_65d3.html" title="Canadian Broadcasting Corporation">Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation</a> apparently considered one of the ITA's member groups noteworthy enough to cover: <a href="http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=-5696129290292273615" class="external autonumber" title="http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=-5696129290292273615" rel="nofollow">[81]</a>. The ITA appears to be a significant group in Canadian LARPing, similar to <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASCRAG_1641.html" title="NASCRAG">NASCRAG</a>, albet smaller and younger. The article should certainly be improved to emphasize why it's notable, but that's grounds for improvement, not deletion. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_De_Smet_d95a.html" title="User:Alan De Smet">Alan De Smet</a> | <a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlan_De_Smet_e320.html" title="User talk:Alan De Smet">Talk</a> 00:07, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>To be clear, the article does assert notability: it's encompasses 13 other organizations across Ontario, making it region-wide group. I've added a line to the article in question trying to call this out more clearly. The ITA has also been subject to independant media coverage (the CBC video). <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_De_Smet_d95a.html" title="User:Alan De Smet">Alan De Smet</a> | <a href="../../../a/l/a/User_talk%7EAlan_De_Smet_e320.html" title="User talk:Alan De Smet">Talk</a> 18:55, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No Need For Deletion</b> - Honestly, I don't think this should be deleted because it IS out there, it has many members and it is getting larger and larger each year. I was first introduced to this a couple years ago when I was living in Oakville, ON and I don't think at the time I was ready for it. Although my buddy was all about it and he loved doing it I never got the hang of the real life stuff. Although I did enjoy the table top it made me think outside of the box I guess you could say. I have saw this grow from a couple friends to many people in real life and in the online world. I have met many people through this and I think it will get bigger and bigger as the years go on. From it being on tv and now online I think it has the potential to get the exposure and reach its targeted audience plus make many people happy as it has been doing to its members for the years it has been alive. I have heard of many groups failing and I think thats right that it has survived all the trials and tribulations of a group such as this. I have no reason to think that this should be deleted. People will continue enjoying the experience that the ITA brings no matter what. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Maclawa (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Maclawa_03cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Maclawa">contribs</a>) 12:49, December 7, 2006 (UTC)</small> <small>— Maclawa (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Maclawa_03cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Maclawa">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>The ITA information is valuble to Wikipedia</b> - Hello, Everybody, I am new to Wikipedia. I am also a member of the Imaginary Theatre Association. After reading the ITA article, i found this to be noteworthy in the spirit of Wikipedia. Throughout the article, it is still new, and given more time, i feel that this article will eventually meet the standards of Wikipedia. This srticle should not be up for deletion. If anyone wishes to discuss this article at length, I will be here.

<dd>I would agree the article does not merit deletion due to its lack of content; it just needs improvement. I nominated solely on notability grounds. Does your assertion that "All members of orchestras of this quality are notable musicians" reflect previous Wikipedia consensus, or is it simply your opinion? I would suggest that <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a> either contradicts it, or fails to address the situation, depending on interpretation.

<li>Well, other than telling me how to make it, there is no other content other than it is <i>a highly alcaholic cocktail drink.</i> So it looks like a how-to guide and nothing else to me. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 18:39, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>So where is the diffrence between this and the entry for B52 other than a dubious clame based on roumer as to the origon of the name? If i put that this drinks name comes from? If this dose not fit the regulations of an article (insidently on the list of what wikipeida is not it dose not mention that it is not a how too guide and i do not see how this article fits any of the other items on that list) If you are to delete this one then you may as well delete every cocktail entry. --Prophesy 21:03, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wikipedia does contain some genealogy, but it is not a database for obscure/especially particular descents. The problem with an article such as this is that it opens up opportunities for nearly infinite other similar articles. Articles of this nature have always been deleted before, for instance, Finnish ancestry of various royals, etc. While the information may be accurate, it is not encyclopedic. It is best deleted or userified. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 18:21, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The connection these articles are giving in each case is not random, but a clearly encyclopedic issue.

They, their supporters and opposers use such things as arguments. (Vlach) ancestry, it is ancestry in Romanian lands, of Romanian royal family presents their attested genealogical connections (and on the other hand, some lacks thereof) to earlier rulers of Romania, such as princes of <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valachia.html" title="Valachia">Valachia</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldavia.html" title="Moldavia">Moldavia</a> in Romania and the <a href="../../../a/s/e/Asen_Empire_8a3d.html" title="Asen Empire">Asen Empire</a> of Bulgarians and Vlachs in Lower Danubian lands.

Genealogical connections of a royal family with hallowed predecessors in same country are also often made <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy_genealogy.html" title="Fantasy genealogy">legends</a> (such as <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Zog_I_deb8.html" title="King Zog I">king Zog I</a> allegedly descending from <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skanderbeg.html" title="Skanderbeg">Skanderbeg</a>) or even fabricated genealogies (<a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_VIII_of_Sweden_29ad.html" title="Charles VIII of Sweden">Charles VIII of Sweden</a> allegedly through lords of <a href="../../../t/o/f/Tofta.html" title="Tofta">Tofta</a> from dynasty of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St.Eric_5162.html" title="St.Eric">St.Eric</a>) whereby our encyclopedic task is justifiably to discriminate truths, attested descents, from mythical or fabricated ones. The genealogical connection of the claimed <a href="../../../l/e/k/Leka_I_of_Albania_6540.html" title="Leka I of Albania">Leka I of Albania</a>, an active pretender, attestedly to earlier rulers in Albania, if those connections are attested (as is this tree through his mother Geraldina) or not attested (such as the alleged descent through his father from <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skanderbeg.html" title="Skanderbeg">Skanderbeg</a> of Albania) are topics that pop up in political discussions, similarly with other analogous cases of royal inheritance/ legacy.

<li>The content of current articles is as itself no grounds for deletion (although there exists reliable, mentioned (in articles) genealogical trees, for example in <i>geneaogics.org</i> but also elsewhere, to back up these pages as they are now), if the topic itself is encyclopedic, and I have above given some grounds why the topics are not random and are justifiably encyclopedic. There is no precedent to delete these, contrary to what is claimed above (if an <a href="../../../a/h/n/Ahnentafel.html" title="Ahnentafel">Ahnentafel</a> has been possibly deleted, it is a different thing than deleting an article giving genealogical lineage of a pretennder/ claimant/ ruler from his/her early predecessors. Besides, even several Ahnentafels have not been deleted here, for example those of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancestry_of_Charles_XIV_Gustav_b005.html" title="Ancestry of Charles XIV Gustav">Charles XIV Gustav of Sweden</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancestry_of_Harald_V_675f.html" title="Ancestry of Harald V">Harald V of Norway</a>, <a href="../../../a/h/n/Ahnentafel_of_Nicholas_II_6eab.html" title="Ahnentafel of Nicholas II">Nicholas II of Russia</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancestry_of_Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_72f5.html" title="Ancestry of Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II</a>), although someone could think they are "random information" and not serving the useful purpose of differencing lies and truths in claims of royal legacy from and within a country. <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaed_5b84.html" title="User:Maed">Maed</a> 02:14, 6 December 2006 (UTC)<br /></li>
<li>At the very least, I want this huge work I made from genealogical sources, to be preserved in my user pages, to be my memoranda for future checking when I need to edit royalist articles, to assess their claims of descents. <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaed_5b84.html" title="User:Maed">Maed</a> 01:47, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The difference between these articles and ahnentafels is that these articles only show select ancestry that can be multiplied many times over. Why not an Armenian ancestry of Diana, Princess of Wales? Or a Canadian ancestry of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall? It can go on and on and on... The ahnentafels, on the other hand, equally represent ancestry back to a certain point without singling out a line that can later be multiplied into various other articles. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 04:12, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If a genealogical lineage (in your words, select ancestry) is relevant to the subject's life, position, or other issue, that actually is encyclopedic knowledge, as positively argued by several editors in this page (even Lethiere who votes against here). Wikipedia can very well include such information. (For example, I cannot find much justification for Diana's descent from Americans, but much justification for presenting her descent from, say, earlier princesses of Wales, if such happens to exist in reliable sources. Same probable no with Canadian ancestry of Camilla, if exists, whereas for example her possible descent from earlier duchesses and countesses of Cornwall would be justified if exists.) And, by the way, can you provide any clear evidence that articles about people's genealogical lineages back to their some relevant ancestry have actually been deleted through a proper AfD procedure here; you claimed such with your allegation of "precedent". I got information that such is not the case and that the nomination here misrepresents. Assuming good faith, I give you opportunity to prove your allegation. <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaed_5b84.html" title="User:Maed">Maed</a> 04:37, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>An article on either the Finnish ancestry of the king-elect of Finland or the Emperors of Russia as Grand Dukes of Finland come to mind. In particular, there was a series of articles by ObRoy. Mad King Ludwig idolized a French king, could we not make an article about his French ancestry? <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 05:33, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Please show proper links, to the names of the allegedly deleted articles, and their AfD pages. As far as a search of WP pages (keywords 'finnish ancestry king finland', search for both namespace and WP project space) shows, there has never been an article of Finnish ancestry of elected king of Finland (can you tell us what is the said person's actual Finnish ancestry?). It seems there exists an Ahnentafel of his son (and it literaly exists, an AfD did not result in deletion) where subject is a son (a prince), not the elected king himself. Thus, prove your allegation - vague allegations of some deletion whose very name even remains unclear are not evidence of precedent. And, there clearly still exists at least one article about Russian tsars as Grand Dukes of Finland, see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Finnish_monarchs_1a16.html#Grand_Duchy_of_Finland_in_Russian_Empire_1809-1917" title="List of Finnish monarchs">List of Finnish monarchs#Grand Duchy of Finland in Russian Empire 1809-1917</a>, where they are listed; are you suggesting it should be deleted. And, what come to Louis II of Bavaria, if that really is an attested fact (who French king?), there might very well emerge such an article, if there exists an attested genealogical descent. Note that it is often undesirable to put lengthy genealogical lineages to biography articles, but another article of that specific subject serves well as a linked material of a biography here. <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaed_5b84.html" title="User:Maed">Maed</a> 05:45, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> There is, without doubt, scope for an encyclopaedic article on Christianity and witchcraft, but this is not it. We'd be better off forking from the Inquisition articles, and bringing that up to date, using the numerous published sources which do exist, rather than using this original research. Alternatively we could userfy it to let people have time to fix the souring and verifiability issues. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 21:20, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Not only is it "interesting," it is historically verifiable, and significant--with contemporary impacts/consequences (seen in a number of court cases regarding witchcraft and the right to Freedom of Religion in the US Bill of Rights). There are literally hundreds of scholarly works on this topic published through university presses around the world... Not THAT is notability.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - This article lacks references, yes, but I'm sure on a topic like this sources can be found and added. That does not make it original research.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This article is in definite need of additional sourcing and additional NPOV information from other perspectives but it is of itself encyclopedic.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Definitely needs proper sourcing, but that is VERY EASY to fix. Using webpages alone, there are literally thousands of Christian websites alone out there where "Christian views on Witchcraft" can be found and used as source material for this page. But I am suspicious that this whole argument is motivated by a desire to suppress, not by a desire for NPOV and proper sourcing.207.34.120.71 18:18, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There are 150 first team all conference players each year from BCS conferences. 234 players will be drafted by the NFL.

<li><b>Comment.</b> If the places themselves don't have articles, why do we need a disambig page for it? The point of a disambig page is to allow navigation between articles with the same or similar titles; what reason is there to navigate through red links? <i><b><a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoomsDay349_6323.html" title="User:DoomsDay349"><font color="darkblue">Dooms</font></a><a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoomsDay349_7ac1.html" title="User talk:DoomsDay349"><font color="lightblue">Day349</font></a></b></i> 19:39, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - if the target articles get created, then there might be a need for a dismabig page. Note that for only two items, the usual disambig action is to provide disambig text in the article itself referencing the other article, and not to create a separate page. so until three of these town need to be distinguished, I fail too see a need for this page. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 21:11, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, that's only if one search term is substantially more likely than the other. When the search terms are equally likely, there is no reason to favor one of them.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is an interesting case. Pages like these are extremely useful, because they help channel incoming links to their appropriate target: Imagine if someone wikilinks the term Mătăcina in an article, intending to point to Mătăcina in Alba County.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, it's an interesting case, but since all cities, towns and villages are (currently) considered implicitly notable, I think think this is an instance where a pre-emptive disambiguation is acceptable, albeit a bit excessive. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 23:55, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>speedy keep</b> pending stub. no need for disambig page of 2 terms, this shld be stubbed as one of them, with similar importance its just the one that gets the title first, the other gets some dishniguishing thingy. even as is, it helps avoid links being created to alternative/wrong transliterations (this is probably the reason for it, please put more thought into you afd noms, for instance cld have proded it or just asked it's creator 1st if you didn't understand why it was there).&#160;<span style="background-color: #000000">&#160;<font color="white"><b>⇒</b></font> <a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball"><font color="white">bsnowball</font></a>&#160;</span> 11:10, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>This was the subject of an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Good_Egg_1c0c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Good Egg">earlier AfD</a>, and the conclusion was that it should be transwikied to Wiktionary. At the time, I supported the transwiki, saying that I believed the phrase dated back to at least the twenties. However, a little study of my sources (mostly <a href="../../../p/2E/_/P._G._Wodehouse_66a1.html" title="P. G. Wodehouse">P. G. Wodehouse</a>) has shown that I probably overestimated the notability of this <i>particular</i> phrase. In fact, the term "egg", as British slang for "person" (similar to "fellow" or "bloke"), does indeed date back to at least the twenties, but was commonly used without any adjectives at all! When adjectives do appear, "bad" and "old" are quite as common as "good", and a wide variety of others may appear as well. So I now think the transwiki was a mistake, and I certainly think this particular combination of two words falls <i>far</i> short of the level of notability required for a Wikipedia article. (I also suspect the Wiktionary version should be removed, possibly to be replaced with a definition of the slang meaning for "egg", but that's a separate issue.) <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 19:49, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Was tagged with {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-band_6234.html" title="Template:Db-band">db-band</a>}}. I deleted, and I recieved a message to my talk page saying that the person who proposed tagged with an intent of saying it failed notability requirements (not a speedy reason). I double checked by looking at the edit summary of the tagger (<i>19:28, December 4, 2006 Walter Görlitz (Talk | contribs | block) (Appears to meet the requirement of non-notable. No national tours. No releases on major lables. Also removed gratuitous band names)</i>. For this reason I am going to seek second opinions on whether we should keep this or not. <b>No Stance</b> (Talk —— <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">ask me for <b>help</b></a>) 19:58, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- the {{db-band}} template states "<i>it is an article about a band, singer, musician, or musical ensemble that does not <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_of_vanity_articles_63d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion of vanity articles">assert</a> the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">importance or significance</a> of the subject</i>." Thus, by linking to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>, it is automatically calling into question the notability of the subject and whether or not the article asserts it. The edit summary is immaterial to whether or not the article meets criteria for speedy deletion. The template indicates that the article <i>failed to assert</i> notability.

<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b>. I will admit I'm finding it hard to find any "notable" references to BVE, mainly because first of all, it's freeware and not a commercial project, and second because it's aimed at a rather niche market. However, BVE Trainsim is the most popular freeware <a href="../../../t/r/a/Train_simulator.html" title="Train simulator">Train simulator</a> in the world. It's perhaps a bit unfair to ask to link to notability-proving websites since I'd suppose most of the railfan magazines this game has appeared in do not have websites. I'll agree the article needs be cleaned up, it's starting to read like an FAQ. --<a href="../../../p/k/e/User%7EPkerUNO_21e7.html" title="User:PkerUNO">PkerUNO</a> 00:01, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not really an expert on the matter - I certainly am a railfan, but I don't buy any magazines. I've asked a few friends if they can find any articles on BVE in their magazines, but I doubt they'll reply in time for the VfD deadline.

<li>It should, but the current guidelines favour big, commercial releases.

There are many railfan-run websites devoted to BVE and most search engines have a separate category for BVE. Unfortunately, most railfan magazines, where this game would most certainly appear, don't have websites, thereby making this job even harder. --<a href="../../../p/k/e/User%7EPkerUNO_21e7.html" title="User:PkerUNO">PkerUNO</a> 00:43, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Correct. This is a definite case where the guidelines promote <a href="../../../c/o/u/Wikiproject%7ECountering_systemic_bias_0f3c.html" title="Wikiproject:Countering systemic bias">systemic bias</a>. Trouble is, BVE is a pretty big fish in a small pond, and I don't think the present guidelines take account of that. Google hits are arguably very crude determinants of notability, but in this case they should at least be enough to elevate BVE above the masses of non-notable freeware games which are played by a few dozen people if any. "BVE" "train" gets 240,000 ghits; even "Boso View Express" (the rarely used full name) gets over 20,000. <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdorableRuffian_c1ea.html" title="User:AdorableRuffian">AdorableRuffian</a> 20:08, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A "particularly narrow genre of music", according to the article. But:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Laser gun and phaser effects"?</li>
<li>"Post-post-post-modernism"?</li>
<li>Not a "line" but a "figure eight" of reason?</li>
<li>"Inexplicably clad in assorted tin foil outfits"?</li>
<li>"Robo-Nerds"? (no Google hits in conjunction with this term)</li>

<p>This is an article which has just been rescued from certain death as a copyright violation from Memory Alpha, but cites as it sole source a novel written from the perspective of a security officer (and I don't think it's canon either) and the MA article from which it was originally copied and now rewritten, albeit still primarily from an in-universe perspective. Seems to me this isa subject best left in Memory Alpha.

<li>I think Starfleet Security is pretty well established, but thats been beat to death. I dont have access to the Drumhead, but its always been one of my favorite episodes.

<li>I realise it must be a bit difficult to try to deal with this type of thing without access to any sources, but we can't use your recollections as a substitute. I don't have access to the episode, either (just blown my budget buying books and dvds to flesh out TOS episode articles), but the <i>Encyclopedia</i> says Thomas Henry was "admiral in charge of security" (lowercase). Do you agree there is, or at least could be, a distinction between "Starfleet security" (the redshirts, who are under line command) and "Starfleet Security" (some group back home that does high-level stuff), just as with the Engineering departments? <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 23:03, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am not certain what the actual issue is. It may be a naming discontinuity though it doesn't appear that way. It seems to be a 'legal' Section 31. There had been numerous references to a "starfleet security" in the show but not much of an exploration of it. IIRC they just are a conviniant way to fork the plot with some random last minute report. I do not recall correctly but I believe Miles O'brien underwent a covert operation for starfleet security in a ds9 episode against the notorious Orion Syndicate... --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 22:13, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The question is not whether if Starfleet were real these bodies would be sufficiently notable for inclusion. They clearly would be. The question is whether they have played a sufficient part in Star Trek to deserve separate articles. These have at time been mentioned and various characters fall within their ambit. But the organisations <i>themselves</i> play only a fringe role.

<ul>
<li><b>Fundamentally re-orient</b> or <b>merge</b> into the appropriate separate articles. The problem with having separate articles about fictional things is that it presents them as existing independently of the shows, in some "fictional universe". This is a problem for a few reasons on Wikipedia, but a major one is: when the show's writers change, the properties of the thing changes; the "history" of Starfleet Security might be changed by a 1990's show when there was some contradictory statement about it in a 1960's show. In comparison, the properties of chemical elements, for example, do not change and they are in themselves self-consistent. Our knowledge of them or theories about them might change, but when they do that is included as a historical element, with reference to the surrounding framework of people and places. Similarly, articles on fictional things must be made with reference to the surrounding framework of the books, television shows, etc. from which they come, which do exist in the real world. Articles ridden with statements like "The predecessor to the current branch of Starfleet Security were the weapons and security personnel of the Earth Starfleet" are not appropriate for an encyclopedia, while "They are frequently depicted in episodes as laying suppressing fire while one of the main characters, for example Captain Archer, runs for a certain objective." and "In the first episode of Season 3, "The Xindi", the MACOs participated in a mission on a mining planet to rescue Captain Archer and Commander Tucker." (<a href="../../../m/a/c/MACO_d65b.html" title="MACO">MACO</a>) are properly connected with the real world. This is to some extent separate from the sourcing issue. On that matter, if the several descriptions in books, official guides, and plot summaries are not acceptable then the featured article on <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a> is not (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulbasaur#Notes_and_references" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulbasaur#Notes_and_references" rel="nofollow"><i>all</i> its sources are like this</a>), nor are the many thousands of other articles on fictional characters and television episodes (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:24_%28TV_series%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:24_%28TV_series%29" rel="nofollow">24</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Friends" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Friends" rel="nofollow">Friends</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:CSI" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:CSI" rel="nofollow">CSI</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:That_%2770s_Show" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:That_%2770s_Show" rel="nofollow">That 70's Show</a>) it goes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Categories_named_after_television_series" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Categories_named_after_television_series" rel="nofollow">on and on</a>). These are vast categories of articles with no reliable sources (and invariably no sources cited whatsoever). This issue needs to be resolved, but these thousands upon thousands of articles are not going to be fixed piece-meal an AfD here and there. Whether reliable sources on a subject exist cannot be evaluated by a mass AfD, and some of these topics do have reliable sources and warrant independent articles. Also, these articles do have work and information put into them and should be transferred to other wikis; that is not going to happen en masse. Perhaps we need a template with a longer term deleting system; these thousands of articles should not be deleted in successions of sudden 5-day AfDs, but there does need to be some enforcement of Wikipedia content policies. (Separate note, if this is to be morphed in a mass nomination: based on a search of academic journals, newspapers, and magazines, "Starfleet Academy" is far more noteworthy, with many more mentions (though I did not look very hard for reliable sources). I did find, however, happen to find an article in the <i><a href="http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/(upmlppei1n3yo355zcfpke45)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,13,13;journal,37,42;linkingpublicationresults,1:119813,1" class="external text" title="http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/(upmlppei1n3yo355zcfpke45)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,13,13;journal,37,42;linkingpublicationresults,1:119813,1" rel="nofollow">Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology</a></i> which has an apparently thorough review of Star Trek medicine by episodes. These sorts of things exist in abundance for the famous Star Trek, and for other famous fictions. While we should not allow these articles to continue unaltered (or even unmolested), or permit new badly sourced ones to be created, a 5-day AfD is not going to suss out all the books (and Star Trek is the subject of third-party academic, analytical books) or all the magazine articles and this remains a wiki with some articles that are works in progress; these are not living persons.) —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 01:18, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>See, here's the thing. I agree with you, fundamentally, that if you can put together enough third-party sources that either discuss a fictional work's impact on the real world, or critically analyze the technical merits of the fiction (writing, cinematography, etc.). The problem <i>here</i> is that none of those things exist for Starfleet Security. No one has written a book about how the use of non-lethal methods by Starfleet Security altered popular opinion on alternative methods of law enforcement. And, even if they did, that article would probably be about <b>Star Trek</b>, not <b>Starfleet Security</b>. There is a profound difference between the two, and attempting to extrapolate the importance of Starfleet Security from our hypothetical article is a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.

<dd>That's because, unlike Starfleet Security, the Emperor has achieved iconic status in popular culture.

The article reflects that -- consider the fact that 90% of the article isn't about his <i>fictional</i> life, but the real-world process that led to the creation of the character, and its impact on media. Your inability to distinguish between in-universe importance and real-world importance is a continuing theme in these debates, and a somewhat disturbing one.

<dd>In the grand scheme of things, this is probably a minor point -- but please ditch the hyperbole.

<dd>Its been around for 30 years because the series has been around for 30 years, and that is by no means an indication of Security's notability. Beyond that, the "expendable redshirt" is not synonymous with Starfleet Security. The phenomenon is already covered within Wikipedia, invalidating the need for an article specifically dealing with this plot device. There is a profound difference between exploring the dramatic significance of Crewman #40129 and what you're trying to do here. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 04:59, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's notable enough in the Star Trek universe, and mentioned enough, to be included here (though it could use some fleshing out, to make it clear to casual readers how it has a different mandate to Starfleet).

<li><b>Keep with rewrite</b>. Notable, mentioned often in the series. Verified, just watch the series. Being mentioned in the series is notability.

<dd>No, it's just that I find the OR argument to be an obfuscation in this case; really, I think your reasoning is you don't think it's notable, or it's fancruft. But the OR argument being used here seems to be saying, no one with expertise in a field can add anything to an article on it, even if their arguments are sourced. Strictly speaking, anybody who adds <i>anything</i> to Wikipedia, if it's not copied word for word from a source, is using some "OR". The OR requirement is meant to say, "don't quote your own research" - not "don't write an article which you know something about". <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 15:03, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I find two things wrong with your statement. One, I admonish people above that cruft is not and never will be a deletion criteria, for if it was, Pokemon would be my very FIRST target.

One justification for this standard is that it is impossible to write a good article that complies with Wikipedia policies (WP:V, WP:NOR, WP:NPOV, WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE, WP:NOT#DIRECTORY) unless there are multiple, independent sources on which to base the article. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChondrite_3324.html" title="User:Chondrite">Chondrite</a> 22:44, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - There is nothing notable about the general counsel of a company (with a few exceptions), nor is every partner or former partner of every law firm notable. So this article fails WP:Bio. On top of that, the second half seems to be about some legal dispute - I don't know the story on that, but it doesn't seem to have anything to establish notability or have much to do with, well, anything.

<li><b>Additional Response</b> I've had about 1,000 edits in 1.5 years, versus 2,000 edits for Smeelgova on this topic in six months (0.5 years). Most of my edits, I would classify as defenses to Smeelgova's 2,000 edits which are pervasively anti-LE. For about six months, for example, the article would have been better entitled "criticisms of Landmark Education." I hope the Admin who clears this out simply takes note of the notability of Art Schreiber as A) a coporate attorney and B) that both the CEO of LE and CEO of Landmark Education business development were true speedy delete candidates. In short, the AFD debate should depend on 1) content and 2) Wikipedia policy, not the number of people voting one way or another. <a href="../../../s/m/1/User%7ESm1969_68e2.html" title="User:Sm1969">Sm1969</a> 00:11, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Is it too late to roll Sheffield United F.C. managers in with the same discussion? The squad article at least does contain a bit more detail than the squad list within the main article, but the page detailing the managers is just an exact duplication of the list on the main article..... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 09:05, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I had a look at the SWFC list. I can't see what the objection to this is - OK, I can find all the info if I wade through 40 or so individual player articles (but who is going to do this?) but here we have a nice informative synthesis on one page (which I could print off in one go). Eg it gives an immediate overview of the (impressive) numbers coming through the academy. <a href="../../../p/c/1/User%7EPc1dmn_8029.html" title="User:Pc1dmn">roundhouse</a> 09:41, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Anon-removed Prod, arguing that the page is "useful to have available for those interested in where the audio samples within the song come from". I don't deny that, but usefulness isn't a viable reason to keep an article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, it's pretty funny that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a> disallows this article by name. And I don't know how reputable the <a href="http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/157797/ghana-considering-2032-olympic-bid" class="external text" title="http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/157797/ghana-considering-2032-olympic-bid" rel="nofollow">external source</a> is, and even if it's reliable, it's pretty trivial with respect to the 2032 Olympics as Ghana is only "considering" a bid, which it "might not [meaning 'probably will not'?] win" -- so, that external reference can't support a Wikipedia article, so the article should be deleted. But that external source does sort of undermine the assertion at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a> that <i>nothing can be said about [the 2032 summer Olympics] that is verifiable and not original research</i>.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. The article itself begins by saying "The 2032 Summer Olympics' location is still undecided." So no single fact about it exists in the present except the year it is scheduled to take place. The tenuousness of Ghana's bid is underscored by the linked article itself, in which a Ghana representative acknowledges “the idea might sound funny now." The only substantive action Ghana has taken is write the IOC and "receive information about the date for the submission of the bids." If the article were entitled Ghana's tentative consideration of bidding to be the venue for the 2032 Summer Olympics we would not accept it. But that's all there is to the article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:17, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This has a not insignificant Google presence. The question is whether it has been the subject of multiple non-trivial written sources who are independent of the subject. I did not find any. Almost all the sites I look at are <i>selling</i> or <i>promoting</i> the set. The article's only source, Money Week’s interview with Michael Acton Smith, is only a peripheral mention and, as the creator of the set, he is not an independent third party. Thus, no apparent <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notability</a> substantiated through <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 23:14, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Someone is going to need to do some necessary edits, probably myself, but if its me I need some help to get the format right because I haven't done such edits previously.

<p>Unencyclopedic and subjective. Also has a huge problem as to how 'alcoholic' is defined. Is it anyone who has drunk too much or a more serious problem? Must the person have admitted to being an alcoholic? At the very least the term must be defined and each entry very carefully referenced. This article poses a legal minefield given potential for defamation <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe">WJBscribe</a> 23:26, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Further comment. I am especially concerned by the inclusion of people such as <a href="../../../i/r/a/Ira_Hayes_5011.html" title="Ira Hayes">Ira Hayes</a>, a war veteran whose suggested alcoholism is so tied up to likely <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder.html" title="Post-traumatic stress disorder">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>.

<ul>
<li>While I did add my "vote" to delete, I don't think that Ira Hayes should be somehow omitted from this list if it did stay. He was famous, and he was an alcoholic. The list isn't titled, "List of famous alcoholics, except the otherwise good people who had a rough go of it and wound up drinking for various reasons." --<a href="../../../o/n/o/User%7EOnorem_b6c2.html" title="User:Onorem">Onorem</a> 18:58, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I should have been clearer. I was pointing out that a wide range of people would end up lumped together by the criteria 'alcoholics' without room for discussion of wider pesonal problems that might have lead to this, not that he should be excluded should the list continue. The list is a very blunt instrument- it lacks the necessary sensitivity for dealing with such a topic. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe">WJBscribe</a> 19:52, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - part of this could be salvaged by using "... who have been diagnosed as being an alcoholic" as an objective criterion.

<p>This is a synthesis from primary sources, i.e. original research. Does it have a place here if rewritten to fix that?

<dd>(edit conflict where I repeat WJBScribe's point)Well, it's not a "major branch of Starfleet," because Starfleet doesn't exist. It's a plot device in a work of fiction. What I'm trying to figure out is how important a plot device it is. Is it merely a designator for the characters who are introduced when the plot calls for a court-martial or is the organization itself involved in the plot? <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 01:11, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is probably not an "anti-Star Trek cabal" of Wikipedia users who want these things gone, I will give you that. But, I feel strongly that there are personal feelings mixing in with some of the AfD nominators stretching back to initial edits on <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_captain_%28Star_Trek%29_8c08.html" title="Fleet captain (Star Trek)">Fleet captain (Star Trek)</a> where material was removed, over and over again as "unsourced" even after sources were provided. The same user who was doing this then nominated Warrant Officer (Star Trek) for deletion and did so in a quick and quiet fashion, not bothering to contact or talk page those who had worked on the article. When the deletion was overturned, its parent article, Starfleet alternate ranks and insignia was also nominated for deletion and the nominator openly stated that they were upset that Warrant Officer was still around and would therefore nominate its parent article for deletion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_November_30&amp;diff=91132585&amp;oldid=91129856" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_November_30&amp;diff=91132585&amp;oldid=91129856" rel="nofollow">[104]</a>. When <i>that</i> deletion attempt failed, one of the users involved followed my edits to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet_Security_d296.html" title="Starfleet Security">Starfleet Security</a> and, after I made an honest and innocent attempt to imporve the article, I was <i>slammed</i> on the talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Starfleet_Security&amp;diff=92296643&amp;oldid=92293872" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Starfleet_Security&amp;diff=92296643&amp;oldid=92293872" rel="nofollow">[105]</a> in a highly uncivil tone, my edits called "crap" and "hogwash", accused of making up sources, and of committing a copyright violation. When all this is overturned on the Admin Norticeboard, less than 5 minutes later Starfleet Security is up for deletion. Then, after <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcat_e5e1.html" title="User:Coolcat">User:Coolcat</a> makes the best case he can, the AfD nominator of that article in turn nominates this one for deletion, almost as an effort to get Coolcat stirred up even more. Three years ago when I joined this site, something like this would <b>NEVER</b> have happened. People would have talked it out on talk pages instead of trying to get things deleted to upset other users. I guess times change but I simply don't think this is right.

<dd>I don't understand this tendency toward not naming names - I axed a chunk of the fleet captain stuff (repeatedly) because it was uncited. You've since provided a plausible citation (Okuda's assertion, I think some other stuff from print sources) and, voila, no more removal by me. The warrant officer material continues to be speculative nonsense/crap/hogwash, the only "citation" being to a fanboy website -- it should still be deleted. (Heck, the phrase "warrant officer" is never mentioned in all of live action Trek -- yes, yes, I know, you have these myriad resources back home. But, as Morwen points out, "I don't have it with me" doesn't alleviate the burden of proof.) Starfleet Security I voted to *keep* even though the article itself is still laden with OR and generalizations -- but, as I said on that AfD page, there's an underlying degree of usefulness to it. As for SF JAG, another keep -- and how about you take a look at its edit history, remind me who's done a fair amount of sprucing up.</dd>
<dd>I don't buy the "it's personal, not business" assertion, at least insofar as I'm a factor. Until this spate of AfDs, neither you nor Cool Cat nor anyone else on wikipedia has really even registered as a person to me -- it's not worthwhile to keep that stuff in my head -- and the only thing that's stuck in my head about you is the Navy thing. I don't check contributors' names; I check contributions. If I were to have a gripe against you (outside of mainspace contributions), it's your lumping me in with the folks endorsing the more recent deletions. I have no problem AfDing something as WP:OR; I probably would not, however, AfD something Trek-related for WP:N (as these latter ones appear to be) because I am, after all, a geek -- I keep it closeted in the real world, so that part of me really goes crazy on wikipedia. --<a href="../../../e/e/m/User%7EEEMeltonIV_6dc8.html" title="User:EEMeltonIV">EEMeltonIV</a> 20:42, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

This AfD should be closed as the article has changed names and there is a huge rewrite and expansion in progress. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 02:24, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

In fact, <a href="../../../k/l/i/Klingon_law.html" title="Klingon law">Klingon law</a> has its own page, with good reason IMHO, since it's well-established, and of major importance in several episodes and movies (across all ST series, not just one). How about you work on improving those existing articles? If you find enough good information on Romulan or Cardassian law to warrant an independent article, we can consider it. But a "Law in Star Trek" article that just lists different legal codes would be duplication - and if it tried to compare them, that would be original research. It simply can't survive.</li>

<dd>It's worth noting CoolCat has decided that since the article is merged, this entire deletion discussion is null and void.

So far, two articles (the SF JAG and Klingon Law) have been merged into one (Law in Star Trek) and then the deletion notice removed since it's a "new article under expansion". Some may find this bold and acceptable. Others might find it disingenuous. You claim it will turn into a "fine article".

<li>Husnock, CoolCat, Re: content - I haven't changed my thoughts on a "Law in Star Trek" article. I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with - but if you find some sources regarding a race's legal system, you should put them in the article <i>for that race</i>. If you find so much information that a new article is justified by size, fine. And I do think Klingon Law has been the subject of so many episodes and movies that it could carry its own article. But you'd be hardpressed to find as much canon information about the other legal systems to justify their own individual articles. And any attempt to compare these legal systems in one article, no matter how well-sourced, would rapidly turn into OR. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 09:26, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In the serries starfleet (entire frenchise), klingon (mostly on TNG and Ent), cardassian (ds9), ferengi (ds9) had been explored. Many minor races' legal systems were also explored such as the Edo. I however deiced not to ever contribute to articles related to fiction.

<dd>Don't say that! I'm still looking forward to seeing what you guys come up with! My main concern is where it gets added, that's all. Look - the main <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romulan.html" title="Romulan">Romulan</a> article is safe, okay? No-one can say they're an insignifcant race, they've been in the thick of things since the 60s. That means people can say it needs reworking or referencing, but they can't just wipe it out. So, if you find a properly sourced fact on Romulan law, put it there. It will be safe. Find another fact - put it there. Same for the other major races. Eventually, you might find enough to make a new article. But until then, the material you contribute will be safe - <i>it will not be deleted</i>. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 10:08, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Not really. The current article includes, wholesale, the same content, plus some additional content which is either unsourced or sourced in the same way, from original media. That's still the same problem, I'm afraid. If we are to keep this, it has to be cited from canonical sources, not as a distillation of plot synopses but from editorial descriptions of the concepts involved. Ohterwise it is simply not permissible, per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. My view is that this belongs on Memory Alpha, where being cited from original media will not be a problem at all. I'd not have a problem with a stub that said simply that the office of the JAG is the military discipline wing of Starfleet and then an external link to an article on MA, but this business of watchign the show and then writing about it directly is simply not on. This is nothing to do with how accurate a summary it is, from my meory of these episodes it's pretty accurate, but we don't <i>do</i> that stuff here. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 13:34, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The <i>Star Trek Encyclopedia</i>, or other episode guides, can be used as a reference for the appearance of JAG stuff in those episodes, so there's no strict need to cite the episodes. I agree citing episodes directly is problematic, but in this case, unlike <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet_Security_d296.html" title="Starfleet Security">Starfleet Security</a>, the prose isn't written terribly in-universe, and it doesn't do any speculation or educated guesses about the JAG office, it just lists appearances of JAG officers. So I think what I'm trying to say is that I disagree that this particular case is a particularly novel synthesis, any more than say, listing all the episodes in which there are Klingons, or the Prime Directive, would be&#160;: it can easily be sourced. The part in the merged article about Klingon law, and assertions about the legal system are more problematic.

The article can also be expanded to how legal pratices have been affected by material from the show and vice versa. The door is open for more than myself to work on this, also.

<p>The corridor does not seem to exist as a geographical entity. Statscan does not refer to it at all, and a google search seems to only turn up pages that can be linked back to this page, or that are refering specifically to the geographical area, not an urban area, or a political bloc. Often these pages are referring to the Quebec City-Montreal-Ottawa, or Montreal-Ottawa-Toronto. The original author has been given considerable opportunity to provide a source, and has neglected to from this point. Considering the fact that there seems to be absolutely no source that supports the concept or an urban corridor encompassing Montreal and Ottawa, and considering the fact that Statistics Canada excluded Ottawa from the Greater Montreal Area census region, it seems that the evidence would support deletion of this article. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamincan_64f8.html" title="User:Jamincan">Jamincan</a> 00:33, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
