<p>The first of 4 webcomics I bring to you today is Number 53, found <a href="http://www.number53.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.number53.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If you have a look at Talk:Number 53 (webcomic), you'll see the article author noting why he believes the article to be notable, being that it is linked from <a href="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/p/6405/53" class="external text" title="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/p/6405/53" rel="nofollow">The Webcomic List</a>, however, I disagree. Being that the Webcomic list is merely a webcomic link site which hosts entries for thousands of webcomics. This is not a notable website, having been established just over 3 months ago, a look on Google for "number 53" webcomic only finds <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22number+53%22+webcomic" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22number+53%22+webcomic" rel="nofollow">30 links</a>, all of them trivial. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 00:10, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a Sonic the Hedgehog fan fiction webcomic (related to the nomination above), hosted on a forum thread. Yes, it doesn't even bother with a free web host, you can see it <a href="http://www.fridaythe13thforum.com/showthread.php?t=39121" class="external text" title="http://www.fridaythe13thforum.com/showthread.php?t=39121" rel="nofollow">here</a> on the Friday the 13th Forum. Now the forum has about 1500 members, which might make it barely notable enough for an article about the forum itself, but a singular webcomic thread?! And it's not even popular on that forum, about 10 different people have ever replied to that thread. Also note that you'll see Wikipedia linked prominently in original webcomic post, they're using a Wikipedia page as a handy free "About Us" page, which also generates a handy little promotional tool by appearing in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_webcomics.html" title="List of webcomics">List of webcomics</a>.

<p>Already been up for deletion twice before, but both times consensus was hard to reach because of the post-Katrina immediacy of the article. To quote one user from the previous votes, "Millions of people lose loved ones in tragic circumstances every day. The fact that a TV crew happen to stumble upon Mr. Jackson does not make him notable... If Jackson gains notability, then we can add an article." Eight months later, with the benefit of hindsight, I'm not sure how Jackson is any different than the hundreds of other victims interviewed by the media. Unless he's done something of note that hasn't been covered, this is more memorial than article. <s><b>Delete.</b></s> <a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass">Tijuana Brass</a> 00:15, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>comment.</b> You still do not establish notability. His story was very briefly broadcast worldwide, yes, but only through media outlets which use emotional stories to raise their ratings. What happened to him is unfortunate but that does not establish his notability. The media exploited his bad fortune. He is nothing more than a passing and media figure with nothing to show for it.

<dd>I don't think that Strothra meant any disrespect by that, he was just trying to make a point. Saying that Jackson was "the human face of the Katrina tragedy for millions of people" is, well, hardcore POV. Speaking out of personal experience, I don't remember the guy at all outside of Wikipedia, and I was glued to a television for weeks after the hurricane, keeping up with it. He's one of the thousands of faces of victims of the storms, but not particularly notable. Memorials are good and well, but Wikipedia isn't for that. <a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass">Tijuana Brass</a> 03:39, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I apologize if you thought I was attacking you. That was not my intention. I was simply attempting to point out that the media exploit many individuals for their tragedies and they have nothing to show for it. This individual is no different than the many who have come before him. The mass public forgets these individuals easily and grow tired of seeing these tragedies on TV and so the cameras move on to the next big story and the money stops flowing into these disaster areas when they no longer recieve widespread attention. It's an unfortunate truth about society and there are quite a few studies on this trend. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 05:35, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Sorry, but I completely disagree with that statement and I wonder to what extent you are familiar with the case. Klinghoffer's notoriety has nothing at all to do with the opera. He has been a symbol of the inhumanity of terrorism for over 20 years. Newsbank gives over 4,400 hits for Klinghoffer up to the present and very few discuss the opera. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 15:21, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Kinghoffer was merely one victim of "terrorism" and is not different from any other victim. His story was simply exploited by others as is the case here. This fact in itself does not make him or this guy especially notable. And I would argue that your usage of individuals serving as "symbols" is POV. Symbols for who exactly? How are they a symbol? What does it mean that they are a symbol? Does the fact that they are a symbol change anything? It's a loaded term. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 15:31, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>My usage??? What exactly are you talking about? If Klinghoffer is no different from any other victim, why don't we have articles on every victim of the WTC?</li>

<li>That's fine. Note that I never tried to get you or anyone else to change votes. I merely made a comment with my initial Keep vote. When you boil it down, my personal view is that Mr. Jackson for reasons completely out of his control is a sort of symbol of all the victims of Katrina, almost none of whom will ever get an article here. I guess I agree with CNN, which featured Hardy Jackson prominently in their "quarter century of newsmakers" round-up <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/12/02/cnn25.top25.tan/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/12/02/cnn25.top25.tan/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<dd>How are you judging the fame of the hurricane victims? The victims as a group are famous. There were famous actors and senators who held property that was destroyed and thus they are victims. This individual is hardly "famous". Still, the vote is about notability and not fame. This individual has not even met the standards of notability.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I can't sit back and watch Fiji get slammed once again. Let's give them some credit for building an even taller building than this. Not to mention that it is a major landmark in Suva. But beyond all that, if we get rid of this, do we then delete some of the buildings on our <a href="../../../t/a/l/Tallest_buildings_in_the_United_States_0f54.html" title="Tallest buildings in the United States">Tallest buildings in the United States</a> article?

<li><b>Delete</b> The page is practically the same as it was when it was first created.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Article may be considered notable as it refers to thing that was once notable. Notability doesn't perish. There must be something about it more belonging to the period when it was tallest, the reasons why it was made, etc. However, as the article has remained unattended for so long, my guts aren't very sure whether it would turn out to be a worthwhile article.

<li><b>Keep</b> Deleting this would be an error. This is a genuine description of a cross-partisan political project in Canada. Fireweed's initial roundtable session was attended by a good cross-section of academic and political experts, and recorded and telecast by Canada's Parliamentary channel. This is an initial entry, which I am sure will be improved by others and over time, but the information is intended to be balanced and informative. User:Rick Anderson 02:30, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I sure hope we shall hear from some knowledgable Canadians in this discussion before people who have little first-hand knowledge summarily censor a legitimate political entry. The individuals involved in this are well-known, the fact that they have engaged in this discussion together is significant, the effort is legitimate, it is broadly-based, it is not partisan. But perhaps it is more fun to just lob judgement from a grand distance. User:Rick Anderson 19:42, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Speedy Keep</b>. Let's please avoid systemic bias. Notability is established right at the beginning, it hosts Nepal's most popular chat room. Obviously a Nepal website will have a low Alexa ranking, from when is Alexa an acid test? Wikipedia is for people of all country, not for the rich countries with high internet access. This is even more notable considering the current political situation in Nepal. Let's look beyond our borders to the global picture, not everyone has the same kind of oppurtunities. <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoom91_0629.html" title="User:Loom91">Loom91</a> 09:25, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

It's becoming clear that he just wanted to do something nice for a friend, and it appears that some people are starting to interpret this AfD as a discussion on Ms. Antalek's worth as a person, rather than as an encyclopedia article. I know it's not, and you know it's not, but not everyone knows that.

<li>Here's a rough translation from AltaVista Babel Fish:</li>
</ul>
<p>Hernan Lopez, born Argentinean the 15-04-1977, centered multifacético artist at first in the architecture and that soon would deposit all its creative load in the tango. An example paradigmatico of the joker of fourth degree is considered. Founder of the interpretativo system of the personality that consists of being made the estupido one to hide that he is natural estupido. It caused that by Frachela comparison it is seen as but studio illustrates cultor of metodo Stanislavski of the actor, and that Marley, TV conductor, like a French estructuralista. Their feats like tango dancer were so important that until a letter "Milonguero of Building" was dedicated to him. A controversy with respect to its doctrine and thought exists, in as much to the responsibility, given the characteristic equality differentials with Emilio J. Rizzo. In order to desmarañar this intríngulis that worries to the modern historian has mentioned a witness, companion of both: Tomás Peisker. Tomás I declare: "they grew up literally together, in any case he is stupid to say that some I copy myself of another one, they lack the encefalica mace to carry out this cerebral process", a corchea, four semifusas, greater DO.</p>

<dd>Spanish. Unfortunately, in spite of the tempting title of 'Game of the Distribution of Beer', this is not a beer drinking game. Although surely not as much fun, it sounds interesting. It's a "Game Simulation of Beer Distribution" used to teach, learn, and explore principles of management, production, supply, demand, and inventory management. It potentially relates to Game Theory, Economics, &amp; Management. Short. <a href="../../../a/n/f/User%7EAnFu_cb94.html" title="User:AnFu">AnFu</a> 10:53, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The game of the distribution of the beer is a game of the simulation used in atmospheres of education to demonstrate a number of dominant principles of the management of the source chain. Fact in front with the uncertain demand for the beer and and a chain of gradual source, the players is that they fight to avoid to work of product whereas they try to avoid to finance great inventories. The game introduces quickly to students to several important concepts of the management of the chain of source including turnpikes, cooperation, and prognosis</p>

<p>Logistic engineering takes care of the science of the logistics. The logistics talk about the purchase, transport, distribution, storage of raw materials. The handling of all these activities efficiently is for an effective organization the main question in the mind of any logistic engineer. Diverse measures of operation are used to examine the effectiveness of the logistics of an organization. The measurement of more popular operation and extensively used is the landed cost. The landed cost is the total cost to buy, transport, raw materials of storage and that they distribute, half-finished and finished merchandise. Another measurement of equally important operation is the mark of the client. It is the percentage of the demand of client who immediately is satisfied. The logistics are generally service operations of the cost-center, but it provides value via the client satisfaction. It can lose that value quickly if the client is not satisfied. The client of the end can include another center of the process or the work within the manufacture, a warehouse in where to the articles or the final client are stored that will use the product. Another much more popular derivative and a complete use of the logistic term that has appeared in recent years is the provision chain. The provision chain also watches an efficient linking of the same one with the distribution of the purchase and the organization. While Logistic sight single steps with the provision and the distribution immediately related, the provision chain watches manifold escalones/etapas, the right of the acquisition of the raw materials to the final distribution of merchandise or products finished for the client. One is based on the basic premise of which the activities of the provision and the distribution if they estan integrated with the manufacture and the logistics operations, can have like result better capacity of gain for the organization. The local minimums of the total cost of the industrial operation obtain replaced by the global minimums of the total cost of the whole chain, giving one better capacity of gain for the members of chain and of it lowers the costs for products there.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Even though the current article is insufficient, this is a valid and expandable topic. "Girlfriends" and "boyfriends" are concepts which can only exist in a specific type of society, and not, for instance, in a society where sexes are raised separately from a certain age and all marriages are arranged. I am convinced that there are anthropologists or sociologists who have studied this type of relationship, and that the article can be expanded. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 09:11, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>there's no indication that anything will become of this "bourse". given that, the only other thing i can think of to do with this article would be to merge it to "planned exchanges that never happened". the question is, should it be deleted now or given more time (or merged)? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_A_865a.html" title="User:Bob A">Bob A</a> 01:05, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Oppose.</b> I agree strongly with all the comments opposing the deletion of this article. While it is definitely in need of updating - what's the situation now, etc., to delete this page seems like a covert agenda intended to render invisible serious motivations for continued American military threats against Iran. To delete this article is a ridiculous proposition. Erik 11:26, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose.</b> This was a newsworthy event for months, causing much speculation and discussion.

<li><b>Against deletion</b>. The fact that the opening of the Iranian Bourse has been posponed for geopolítical reasons or may be cancelled is not enough reason to destroy the information. At the time when the US is threatening Iran is just normal to expect projects to be put on hold. The article just needs to state that and explain the whole story, why it happened or why it didn't.--<a href="../../../t/e/q/User%7ETequendamia_a57b.html" title="User:Tequendamia">tequendamia</a> 04:50, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Against deletion</b>. Wow, i can't believe that anyone could be considering deleting this article! The intention to establish an alternative to the petrodollar, thus financially harming the U.S., seems like a pretty valid reason for the U.S. to attack Iran. Certainly a better reason than to prevent them from developing nuclear weapons, of which there is no evidence.

<dd>I don't know French, but it sounds right; the Brazilian Portuguese words for "stock exchange" is "bolsa de valores", and "bolsa" is the Portuguese word for "purse". --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 02:57, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Traditionally a <i>bourse</i> is a currency exchange, not a commodities exchange. Wikipedia is not Wikinews and I'm undecided whether detail on a not-yet-realized proposal belongs in its own article, rather than a sub-article on conflict between political factions within Iran. What I consider important (and very dangerous) is that some people call this proposal "a pretty valid reason for the U.S. to attack Iran." <b>No vote.</b> <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 04:26, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, it doesn't qualify based on a Wikipedia editor (or a consensus of them) saying something like that; it qualifies <i>now</i> only if this is among the comments from current and former Bush Administration military and national-security experts which have been reported by the major media in recent weeks. However, if Mr. Cheney and Mr. Rumsfeld think that way, then it will soon become <i>very</i> notable. Perhaps we should keep and expand the article based on what has been published; but in most cases there are large numbers of grand proposals that die out or are replaced by something else. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 23:45, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Check your facts: Nobody here called it "useless", nor attempted to revise anything to meet any hidden agenda. The question here is whether it's encyclopedic content that will be worth reading in an encyclopedia one hundred years from now, or if it's just news whose current importance (and potential future greater importance) will soon be overtaken by later developments.

<p>I am probably going to lose this one, but... Religious fanaticism is a priori a NPOV violation. The whole article cannot escape being terminally biased. One man's religious fanatic is another's normal religious person. And before you can retort with, "one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter, and look, we do have an article on <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a>", at least terrorism is a defined crime and statutes describe it and people who may condone it at the very least recognize that they're involved in it. Religious fanaticism is much more amorphous, and cannot be defined. Practices of sect X, which some may consider to be R.F., should go into the article on sect X. Everything else here is hopeless conjecture. Note also that this article has been untouched for half a year. <b>Delete</b> - <font color="blue"><strong><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">the.crazy.russian</a> <a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">τ</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crzrussian_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crzrussian">ç</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">ë</a></strong></font> 04:13, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Very strong keep</b>. I can't imagine anyone wanting to delete this. Why on earth? It's a very important topic in current climates and just because an article may attract POV is no reason to delete it. It is quite possible to discuss the evolution and strength of religious fanaticism over the ages and the controversy surrounding it in a NPOV manner. It's possible to discuss who considers what to be religious fanatcism and who doesn't and how it affects global politics. This is so obviously encyclopaedia material. If you think it's POV, well clean it up or tag it but don't delete it. <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">Abortion</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a> provide two perfect parrallas, I don't see any difference.

<ul>
<li>Loom, this AfD is not absurd, and I resent the notion. Islamic R.F. should be covered in article on muslim religious philosophy, but not as "R.F.", rather as "this is what they do, this is why they do it, and here's who condemns it." You see, R.F. is inherently an epithet. For example, the article refers to the adherence to Shari'a as R.F. That just serves to denigrate the billion muslims who adhere to it. And I am arguing that there is no way to clean up an article like that, it's inherently uncleanupable. Please re-read the article and the nom carefully -- and consider being softer around the edges. - <font color="blue"><strong><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">the.crazy.russian</a> <a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">τ</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crzrussian_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crzrussian">ç</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Crzrussian_13af.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian">ë</a></strong></font> 14:54, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You're right in saying that the abortion, terrorism (and any other hot issue) articles attract POV edits, but that's not what the nom is for. The title itself is inherently POV. If we were to use those examples in comparison, the articles would instead have titles like "Abortion as Murder" or "Terrorist Arabs." I agree that there's useful content that could presumably be written here, but it would need to be added in a way that doesn't have tinge of a POV accusation of "fanaticism." <a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass">Tijuana Brass</a> 16:29, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. We should no delete an article because it's bad NOW, but only when it could be nothing but bad EVER. The article doesn't have to label any particular group as fanatics, it can discuss the CONCEPT of religious fanaticism and alleged examples with cited sources as to allegations and refutations. It is not necessary to say 'following Shariyat is religious fanaticism", we can say "this what religious fanaticism is, Reputable Source A calls following Shariyat religious fanaticism, but Reputable Source B refutes this claim". NPOV and bad material is not ground for deletion, bad topic is, and I don't think this opic is predestined to be bad.

<dd>That's a good point, but it'd be difficult in practice — it's hard to do an article on religious fanaticism without mentioning at least a few groups (although there may be an appeal to a general agreement for certain groups, like Charles Manson's).

<dd>It was a step in the right direction, but the very last sentence is exactly why POV is a problem — "Members of the religious mainstream usually disapprove of fanaticism, but some also feel it to be necessary to maintain cultural identity and spread the word of God." Your aim was clearly not to take any side on the issue, but it's exceedingly difficult to nail down objectivity on this one, as this sentence indicates. A noble effort, though.

<li><b>Keep</b> article needs editing and cleanup, not deletion. It is (to me) clearly an encyclopedic topic. See the article on <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> for a good example of how to approach this kind of stuff. Deleting notable articles without given them a chance to improve harms wikipedia, instead of helping it. Also I object that any encyclopedic article could be by necessity not NPOV. And if it is so, is that still grounds to delete if, if it is encyclopedic? Many topics would be missing if wikipedia avoided controversy. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerle_bd9f.html" title="User:Perle">Perle</a> 19:57, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Google hits =/ page views; we're not measuring how popular Ms. Ashton is (I rather think the electoral results did that for us). They measure how <i>notable</i> she is. What you and several other noms are doing is arguing why she <i>should</i> be notable, and your arguments are defensible, but the purpose of AfD isn't as an advocacy group. Demonstrably, Ms. Ashton was a mere drop in the outside world, and barring greater success in politics, she just hasn't demonstrated that the world's particularly noticed her. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:30, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>User:Tyr_shadowblade I do not understand why this article was slated for deletion mere seconds after I posted it. The information is verifiable, does not violate copyright and is unbiased. And what did <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester">User:Swatjester</a> mean by "nn cruft website"? Please be specific as to how this article can be improved, as I'm new to posting here.</p>
<p>The poster deserves more explaination. The criteria for a Wikipedia article about a web site is at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. The requirements are set rather high, or every promoted website in the web would have a Wikipedia article. "nn" just means "non-notable", which refers to Wikipedia's requirement that a website or person or band be "notable" to be included. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 06:14, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>User:Tyr-shadowblade Warriorship is a "non-serious topic"? Mr Binguyen is entitled to his opinion . . . even if it's wrong. I looked at Wikipedia's articles on the topic of notability and understood that this is not necessarilly a "requirement", as "Wikipedia is not paper". I thought RWT was of interest, and their website certainly isn't a fancruft or vanity website. Have any of the people in favor of deletion even looked at the material there?</p>
<p>User:Tyr_shadowblade Just realized that I made a mistake in the first paragraph and edited it. RWT was an organization which created a website and published several books . . . if that makes any difference. Not JUST a website.</p>

<dd>You stated that, <i>Except for this mere participation at the 2006 Commonwealth Games these athletes have achieved nothing of note, thus falling below the notability bar.</i> To what notability standard do you refer to. The only one I could find is at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, where it states that:</dd>
<dd>"the following types of people may merit their own Wikipedia articles:
<ul>
<li>Sportspeople who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in an individual professional sport, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports, including college sports in the United States. Articles about first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate, but only if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad already have articles."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Now the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Commonwealth_Games_e6e9.html" title="2006 Commonwealth Games">2006 Commonwealth Games</a>, whilst not the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympics.html" title="Olympics">Olympics</a> or the World Championships, still had 71 nations and territories competing. It is classed as a Category A event by the IAAF when calculating world rankings.

<dd>I created these articles on the athletics participants and others based on the fact that 1) they had competed at this level, 2) they had a profile on iaaf.org and 3) these athletes, in each of their own countries, are considered notable. -- <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanblair23_6de0.html" title="User:Ianblair23">Ianblair23</a> <a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIanblair23_060c.html" title="User talk:Ianblair23">(talk)</a> 04:49, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Hello Ian. I have mentioned this a few times before, in other contemporary athlete deletion debates, that some weak countries are allowed entries on a wildcard basis, meaning their athletes do not have to meet the A-qualifying standard to qualify, unlike an athlete from a developed sport power, who must meet the A-qualifying standard to apply. So I am not convinced that wildcard-qualifiers are sufficiently notable on sporting-merit alone, as they have not earnt their position in the international arena on merit. (I am pretty sure the A-qualifier is less than 10% outside the WR).<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">ßlηguγΣη</span></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 04:55, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>What Blnguyen said. The WP:BIO guideline mentions "an individual professional sport". Whereas the top finishers at the Commonwealth Games are indeed fully professional, I don't think these athletes are. Mariuti Uan clocked a personal best time in 11.65 seconds. He would have entered a 98th place on the <a href="http://www.friidrett.no/friidrett/statistikk/2005/ute/mssprint05.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.friidrett.no/friidrett/statistikk/2005/ute/mssprint05.htm" rel="nofollow">2005 statistics</a> in <i>Norway</i>, a rather small country which sent 1 athlete to the latest World Indoor Championships. Moreover, getting an IAAF profile is not a great achievement by itself, seeing that <a href="http://www.iaaf.org/athletes/athlete=208675/BioPopUp.html" class="external text" title="http://www.iaaf.org/athletes/athlete=208675/BioPopUp.html" rel="nofollow">an athlete like Stian Andersen has a profile</a>.

<li><b>keep</b>: There are numerous noteworthy controversies stemming from the <a href="../../../i/a/t/Iatrogenic.html" title="Iatrogenic">iatrogenic</a> epidemic of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_spectrum.html" title="Autistic spectrum">autistic spectrum</a> diagnoses. This AfD is unlike the usual offensive attempts to silence dissenting medical opinions, as it seems likely to be a protest to make a point, triggered by the odd decision to delete Neanderthal theory of autism. The real reason this article needs to be kept is that big pharma has as much as admitted its culpability for the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">autism epidemic</a> by launching an expensive, preemptive lobbying and propaganda assault aimed at securing immunity from the industry's enormous <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_injury.html" title="Vaccine injury">vaccine injury</a> liabibilities (e.g. <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodefense_and_Pandemic_Vaccine_and_Drug_Development_Act_of_2005_583f.html" title="Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act of 2005">BioShield Two</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Readiness_and_Emergency_Preparedness_Act_7a2d.html" title="Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act">PREPA</a>). The assault also shows that the industry is unwilling to defend itself in the judicial system, which itself has been undermined to suit corporate special interests, rather than the mere carbon based life forms that courts were originally designed to serve. At least ten bills were in the works as of the end of last year to shield vaccine makers from any form of responsibility for these atrocities. Liabilities are projected by some observers far in excess of tens of billions of dollars. The controversies will only escalate as health care rationing decisions are made about the best/most cost effective treatments for this huge, emerging population. The controversies may be ignored deliberately by the mass media, as advocates like <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_F._Kennedy%2C_Jr._9dae.html" title="Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.">Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.</a> have found out, but there is no doubt that the increasingly unstable and inefficient medical system will be put under considerably more stress in the near term. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 19:31, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are correct in that the deletion of the Neanderthal theory of autism sets a preference for me (and should for others too). However, in this case I'm not arguing only this point, but for the bad idea to have similar information at many locations. If you and <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> prefer to have the vaccine argument in this article that is fine with me, but then you will need to delete it from the other articles (like <a href="../../../c/a/u/Causes_of_autism.html" title="Causes of autism">Causes of autism</a>). --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 05:47, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is nothing wrong with redundancy, per se; the purpose of this article is to summarize the various controversies in one place and then provide links to the in-depth article on each one. I always wanted this article to be succinct, providing readers with the means to study each matter more deeply, but with the right context. The term "controversies" is carefully chosen to avoid bias. Although I think the Neanderthal theory is specious, I think it should be kept and would have voted to keep it. I want all the controversies here. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 14:10, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> .. Well, I don't think using Great Expectations to make a point is the way to go about it enacting change, because it will meet resistance with every article it is tried on. The best way is make a proposal and build consensus using a test case on a temp page somewhere so people can play around with different ideas. It may very well be a great idea, but it has to be demonstrated and build up support, which takes time. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 00:07, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> and all worthwhile information into the actual article.

<li>Well, some look otherwise reliable and are not obviously part of the joke. However, prompted by your question, I've spent some time trying to get to the bottom of it. It looks like the creators of this parody religion have been successful in using the Wikipedia article to fool various people such as Webster's On-Line Dictionary into thinking that this is, indeed, a popular joke like the spaghetti monster or whatever (in which case I would consider it to be encyclopedic as long as it was discussed as being a parody or a hoax, not as if it were a real set of beliefs). The article can't bootstrap itself into notability, so I've changed my vote. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 12:27, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry friends i dont mean to be annoying but this article took so long and i hope i can spare it with one more chance. Here goes...Please use dogpile instead of Google. Searching with one search engine cannot simply disquality something for being popular or not. Taken from the Geocities Stats for website /rameysrealm stats show: www.rameysrealm.com has been visited a total of 92,363 times. A link here with a huge comprehensive gallery on the cam found at&#160;:</li>

<p>The ghostcam has had many, many hosts- the name changed- some links were lost- but if you go to any paranormal community and ask them about the ramcam or "rameys cam" they will know exactly what you are talking about. Rameys Realm won an award for the most Original Paranormal Site at Hunts ghosthunters paranormal group. Its listed on Paranormal Australia- Horrorfind Ghosts- Will County Ghost Hunters Society- Paranormal Reviews- Best Websites. Net - Ghostfiles. Org- Ghosts In The Linen Mill- Ghost Encyclopedia @ The Late Shift- Deviant Art and more...I just find it frustrating that something with plenty of reference- thousands of photos- genuine website- plenty of links and adequate hits simply cant make it to wikipedia...The Ram Cam is one of the strongest and convincing paranormal cams ever put on show- not to mention one of the longest lasting. What more is required?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm sure that your cam is well known within the ghost hunter communities and boards but I don't think it's especially known to the rest of us. Google certainly has its faults but still if something has little Google hits it's usually one among other pointers to non-notability.<br />
But that aside your article is also to a large extent <i>original research</i> which is not allowed on Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No_original_research</a>. So it also lacks independent sources and references which would be necessary to verify most things mentioned in the article.<br />
Maybe you want to consider to make a more general article about <i>ghost cams</i> around the world <a href="http://www.ghoststudy.com/camlinks.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ghoststudy.com/camlinks.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> <a href="http://www.chatcamcity.com/Ghost-Cam.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chatcamcity.com/Ghost-Cam.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> <a href="http://www.paranormalaustralia.com/portal/#GhostsCams" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.paranormalaustralia.com/portal/#GhostsCams" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, with your cam as part of the list of existing ones? But please remember, no original research, just information which can be verified be independent sources. <a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptimale_e2f2.html" title="User:Optimale">Gu</a> 14:15, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have links that directly mention the things that i have mentioned in this article to verify that these did indeed happen...You can see the pictures that relate to the apparitions mentioned in its text. I still ask of you to keep this as it is different than other ghost cams and has had reliable sources such as investigators and tests to conclude that it wasnt a hoax. I can post links that give more direct mentioning of the article which further shows that what is said can verified by more than one source. Im having a difficult time understanding this.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> no evidence of notability or exceptional popularity. I would support a well-sourced article on the concept/phenomenon of ghost cams in general, though. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 08:17, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>It appears that people are ignoring the sources listed and going about their merry ways researching the camera with their own methods its already been clearly stated that Rameys Realm won an award for the most Original Paranormal Site at Hunts ghosthunters paranormal group. Its listed on Paranormal Australia- Horrorfind Ghosts- Will County Ghost Hunters Society- Paranormal Reviews- Best Websites. Net - Ghostfiles. Org- Ghosts In The Linen Mill- Ghost Encyclopedia @ The Late Shift- Deviant Art and more...The website has nearly hit 100,000 web views (according to its host Geocities) and there are sites that back up its sources that show the information is accurate and reliable. Please stop ignoring the sources which directly point out the camera and its "popularity".</p>

<p>This term gets only three Google results. Unfortunately, none of them work. From the results page, two of them appear to be mentions in a list. The word is not shown in the third result, but it is not promising. If this was a real field of study, I would expect far more results, with at least several of them being of decent quality. The article mentions cellular memories (mispelled in the article), which seems to be pseudoscience from my brief investigation. Here is one statement about them. "Cellular memories are stored in the DNA, which we receive from our ancestors. Cellular memory is created whenever we experience trauma or make an emotional decision. And if you believe in such things, cell memory comes in from other lifetimes, other aspects of ourselves in other dimensions." I believe that this article should be deleted as non-notable pseudoscience. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 12:07, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I wrote the article and I live here. This is a huge community and shows on all the tourist and real estate maps in the area. There is more than one Sun City. The community I wrote about is Sun City Palm Desert and is a community of nearly 5000 homes. There is also another Sun City near Hemet in Riverside County and yet another in Indio (also in Riverside County) called "Sun City Shadow Hills". I don't feel that Sun City Palm Desert should be deleted, rather, the Sun City near Hemet can simply be added with it's own article. When you have a community with over 10,000 residents, which is more than many incorporated cities in America that are recognized here, that should not simply be written off.

<li><b>Comment</b> Can I withdraw a nomination? There's only one vote to delete here, and I already understand the reasoning.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi Danny.... yes, that article you refer to is the Sun City near Hemet, California, which is also in Riverside County. Besides the sheer size of Sun City Palm Desert, the main reason for the notability of it is the golf club, which is open to members who don't actually live in the community itself. Within the community is a huge "par 72", 36-hole regulation golf club. The course is known as "Mountain Vista". It was designed by former PGA Tour great and two-time PGA Player of the Year, Billy Casper and Greg Nash. The club is divided into 2 courses: The San Gorgonio (6,669 yards) course and the Santa Rosa (6,720 yards) course. This is one of the most significant courses in southern California and is only a few miles south east of the new Classic Golf club being built for the Internationally known Bob Hope Golf Classic.

<p>Allegedly, a Knights Templar splinter group turned American mobsters.

<li>I see a bunch of assertions of notability have been added since it was prodded. No opinion yet on those. There's a bunch of stuff related to <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nerdcore_hip_hop.html" title="Nerdcore hip hop">Nerdcore hip hop</a> that may be similiar- the folks on that talk page are asserting that since the movement is "underground", there won't be any reliable sources covering any of this. Nothing against this genre, but what's unverifiable can't be in an encyclopedia. Also, FWIW, apparently some of these people have taken to writing aritcles about themselves, see High-C for example. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:21, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Not sure if this counts as being a national tour or anything, but I know he's playing in Vancouver (did play?

<li><b>Weak keep</b> after some research. He is in fact playing dates in Vancouver, Oregon, San Francisco and San Jose in the next couple of weeks (though they are listed on his LJ and aren't exactly huge venues), and did appear on MuchMusic's Going Coastal program in March.

<p>I'm not sure what the correct format here is, I'm sorry, but I wanted to say that the reason the info is mostly copied/pasted from Jesse's website is that I was too lazy to re-write it. Oh, and also to say that Jesse also has a weekly hip-hop column in Halifax's Daily News. You can check it out here: <a href="http://hfxnews.ca/index.cfm?cid=45" class="external free" title="http://hfxnews.ca/index.cfm?cid=45" rel="nofollow">http://hfxnews.ca/index.cfm?cid=45</a> .

<li>Strong keep. The very basis of this genre is indy, DIY, self-produced and self-released artists. Many notable nerdcore artists will probably never release on any label whatsoever. Jason Gortician 01:57, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, now that it's been rewritten (Good job, Tony). A lot of the music stuff just skirts around the fringes of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> (especially C1.3, C1.9, and C1.12), and I went back and forth on it a couple times, but the newspaper column clearly qualifies him under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s requirements for writers (circulation figures <a href="http://www.hfxnews.ca/index.cfm?pid=4" class="external text" title="http://www.hfxnews.ca/index.cfm?pid=4" rel="nofollow">here</a>).

<li>I'll have to go with the <b>keep</b> here. Although I admit that it's surfing close to the line in some respects, I can't and won't put an artist I've actually heard on the radio with my own ears on the delete side of the line. (And besides, I'm down with anything that actually inspires <a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELefty_Lucy_0983.html" title="User:Lefty Lucy">Lefty Lucy</a> to become a Wikipedia contributor.) <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 16:53, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> does pass <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and is verifiable, in my opinion. For that matter I think the verifiability clauses are mostly crap, since they tend to encourage wikipedia turning into a lame mash-up of the New York Times and Wired, which is not anything the world has been particular clamoring for. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerle_bd9f.html" title="User:Perle">Perle</a> 03:02, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as many above, as this article does not seem to meet any criteria for deletion, but OTOH I have very little confidence that this article could become and stay POV unless some fair-minded editors do serious work and then monitor it closely for a long while. I'll volunteer to do what I can on this, but I think it will take more than one of us.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> — Agree with other "Keep" votes above but also there is a debate about the length of the "Human Rights" section in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> article which currently constitutes 9% of the total article length.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is an important topic; however, I must agree with nom that the current article is hopelessly POV. Even the lead section seems to say, The U.S. thinks it has human rights, but it doesn't. I would be willing to help rebuild an article from scratch to treat the topic from a more neutral standpoint.

<p>I disagree with it being non-notable. Brian Flemming is a notable director of a very notable documentary which has been featured in Newsweek Magazine, the LA Times and countless other prominent publications (see <a href="http://www.thegodmovie.com/press.php" class="external free" title="http://www.thegodmovie.com/press.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.thegodmovie.com/press.php</a>). This is no less notable than anything Michael Moore has done, just perhaps more controversial given that most people aren't athiest whereas there are far more Democrats. As to the length of the article, I will work on fleshing out the article more robustly tonight. -- <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeroverse_1fd3.html" title="User:Zeroverse">Zeroverse</a></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> it doesn't matter how notable Flemming is; that does not confer any notability to a one-off publicity stunt unless major media outlets cover his "War on Easter". to use your example <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeroverse_1fd3.html" title="User:Zeroverse">Zeroverse</a>, if Michael More took a dump in a paper bag, walked it up to the front porch of Bush's Crawford Ranch, lit the bag on fire, hid in the bushes, filmed George Bush stomping it out, and them someone created an article called Crawford Ranch Flaming Poo on Bush's Hush Puppies I'd still say delete.

<dd>I stated "household name" meaning his name is common knowledge among most Americans. You can have a conversation with any half-wit on the street and they are highly likely to know who Michael Moore is. Whereas this Flemming fellow cannot claim the same. I'm sure he's a nice guy but not notable. Media coverage does not make an individual notable. The individual's achievements make them notable. There are standards to judge this but as I said before, no one here cares if Flemming is notable. You are not arguing along the lines of this AfD which is concerns if War on Easter is notable. It is not. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 21:01, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I appreciate that you are trying to be objective, but I think it's incorrect to say that "the individual's achievements make them notable." What exactly has Michael Moore achieved that Brian Flemming hasn't (other than make more money)? While all your other points about moving/merging this article may be valid, I don't think they should be done under the cloak of "notability." If the article is insufficient at this time, fine...but saying that something isn't notable because Flemming hasn't "achieved" as much as say, Michael Moore, is a poor reason to exclude this article from the public...especially as Easter 2006 is only a few days away and there is very little critism of the holiday in general. The very fact that someone vehemently opposses Easter is notable in itself, and the fact that a growing group of people are committed to this effort is notable on its own merit, Flemming or no Flemming. Brian Flemming is an extremely notable individual in the atheist community anyway. He might not be a "household name" to religious folk that prefer not listening to opposing perspectives, but that doesn't discount his importance to rational thinkers in the freethought community. The War on Easter is extremely important to atheists and freethinkers, and calling it "not notable" because the relative size of the freethought community is miniscule is really just a form of mob rule and bullying. <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeroverse_1fd3.html" title="User:Zeroverse">Zeroverse</a> 14:29, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
<p>Please login before making comments. Further, you have not invalidated the arguement. The <b>article</b> does not establish the organization's notability regardless of whether or not it's been reported on in a few news outlets. That fact does not make an organization notable. Yahoo and a radio station are hardly major media outlets. FOX News is a major media outlet but it's only one and it a current item.

<li>Besides, I couldn't find any mention of O'Reilly doing a piece on this on his website archives. All I could find was a bunch of blogging about Fox News doing a piece about employers not allowing people to display Easter decorations and other cultural bias against Easter. As far as I can tell it had nothing to do with Brian Flemming and The Rational Response Squad and in fact is exactly the opposite of what Flemming is trying to do.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:20, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do NOT Delete:</b> My home, snailmail and email boxes are spammed with religious propaganda weekly. Some people trying to share an alternative point of view should be applauded.

<li><b>KEEP</b>, at least for the next couple months. This topic may ultimately justify it's own web page, or be more appropriate for a section in TGWWT. It all depends on how Christians respond.

The reason there is a concurrent AfD of 2 "Atheist" articles is coincidence (I'm too lazy to count but there are probably about 600+ articles on active AfD right now... meaning "Atheist" articles make up 0.3% of articles on AfD) and more due to the fact that the 2 articles make no strong case for meeting their respective guidelines.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 02:53, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I prodded this as a slang dicdef (and left a nice message on the creator's talk page about the policy on dictionary definitions and the deletion process). The creator removed the prod tag replacing the word "slang" in the definition with "widely accepted". However, even if this is a "widely accepted" term, it's <i>still</i> a dictionary definition and not appropriate for Wikipedia under <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickelShoe_8b97.html" title="User talk:NickelShoe">Talk</a>) 16:39, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

There are ZERO results for them on Last.fm. I don't really know what else you can ask for as proof of a non-notable band.

<dd>I would concur with <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisTyers_1664.html" title="User:FrancisTyers">User:FrancisTyers</a>. I wasn't going to mention it, but since this particular thread has come this far, let me state that I, too, believe, this is a bad-faith AfD. It's no secret there is no love loss between JFAS and me -- to the point that I repeatedly have asked him not to post to my talk page. I believe the matter that precipitated this AfD is the issue of JFAS's incessant and appallingly tacky/vicious edit warring at <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Dellums_4dba.html" title="Ronald Dellums">Ronald Dellums</a>. He can't stand the man -- a point he makes perfectly clear on his user page.
<ul>
<li>March 13, I was approached by an anonymous editor to stop by <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Dellums_f504.html" title="Ron Dellums">Ron Dellums</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Deeceevoice&amp;diff=43593450&amp;oldid=43573179" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Deeceevoice&amp;diff=43593450&amp;oldid=43573179" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> There was no mention in the anonymous post made of <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustforasecond_cc17.html" title="User:Justforasecond">User:Justforasecond</a>. I did so, made a few edits and then decided to post the matter of JFAS's (and others') constant edit warring on the Admin Notice Board<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44204234" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44204234" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. (Other intervention did not succeed in deterring JFAS, so the article currently is in a locked status. JFAS subsequently was blocked April 5 for his continuing conduct.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Justforasecond&amp;diff=47132792&amp;oldid=47099908" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Justforasecond&amp;diff=47132792&amp;oldid=47099908" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>)</li>
<li>A few days later, I made the following post at <a href="../../../r/o/n/Talk%7ERon_Dellums_f409.html" title="Talk:Ron Dellums">Talk:Ron Dellums</a> directed at JFAS, informing him I had edited the existing version of the section dealing with Dellums' family and that his attacks on Dellums "would not be tolerated."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ron_Dellums&amp;diff=47949975&amp;oldid=47942849" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ron_Dellums&amp;diff=47949975&amp;oldid=47942849" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> Note the date and time of the post: Revision as of 13:14, 11 April 2006.</li>
<li>At 18:28 that same day, JFAS moved to archive the old Afd for <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28African_philosophy%29_fabf.html" title="Cool (African philosophy)">Cool (African philosophy)</a> (the second or third attempt to obliterate this article, the last having been closed at the end of December -- incessant and ongoing)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Cool_%28African_philosophy%29&amp;oldid=47990576" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Cool_%28African_philosophy%29&amp;oldid=47990576" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> and immediately thereafter, at 18:31, opened up this latest attempt to erase it.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Cool_%28African_philosophy%29&amp;oldid=47991004" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Cool_%28African_philosophy%29&amp;oldid=47991004" rel="nofollow">[29]</a></li>

<li>No comment on the motivations behind the nomination, but there is an actual issue here that needs attention from experienced editors: Is the notion of a whole article on cool as an African philosophy an example of giving undue weight to one (or maybe more) academic(s)? We can all agree there's overlap between this article and <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28aesthetic%29.html" title="Cool (aesthetic)">Cool (aesthetic)</a>. If this is a POV fork of the former, it needs to be merged back in.

<li><b>Comment:</b> as long as it takes. If there is unverifiable information in the article -- as with any other, then delete that information. Let the article remain in that state -- with a stub or other tag appropriate to its condition -- until someone has the time and interest to improve it. I mean isn't that the way Wikipedia is <i>supposed</i> to work? (Duh.) And that's what's happened to the piece so far; whole chunks have been obliterated.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>But it hasn't stopped there. This article has been under constant attack. This is the third or fourth attempt to obliterate it, the last effort concluding as late as the end of December. Here, the article has been attacked for lacking information I previously had inserted in the article, but which was hacked out of it!&#160;:p And there were subheads delineating the widely accepted components of the aesthetic that were left blank (as is done in <i>lots</i> of articles on this website), inviting input and further development as a means of helping to form a general framework for the piece. They, too, were deleted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The so-called "weaselwords" of the opening paragraph are a rewrite -- one I did not do. One of the people complaining about the condition of the piece did that. I left it as a concession. And, yeah. I, too, think the wording sux.&#160;:p</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Returning to the question, the fact is <i>no</i> article on Wikipedia should depend upon the time and attention of a single editor for its development. Nor should it be obliterated simply because no single editor has worked tirelessly on it. People grouse about the page. If they spent a <i>fraction</i> of the time, energy and attention <i>constructively</i> editing the piece (not just hacking away at it) and <i>contributing</i> information that they've so far spent complaining about it or, <i>ad seriatim</i>, trying to get it deleted, hell, it'd be a freaking featured article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Has anyone thought to put it up for article improvement, as is, I believe, fairly common practice around here when the desire is to improve an article? Has it been suggested for the project concentrating on articles treating Africa? Gosh. What a concept. The answer to both questions is no. Because beyond the criticism (some of it justified; I have <i>not</i> had the time or the inclination to concentrate on it) of the article itself, the hostility of detractors (as is evidenced by those who continue to focus on attack Thompson's unassailed scholarship completely without foundation, while completely ignoring the writings of others) has been directed toward the editor and/or the very subject itself. One of the primary detractors below has had the unmitigated gall to assert, "But many people don't recognize the [A]frican aesthetic as existing." Yet he so far has failed to produce a <i>single</i>, <i>learned</i> individual (biased opinions born of ignorance or animus don't count) who would make such an absurd and possibly racist statement. There is no doubt that indigenous African peoples, as with all other members of humanity, have aesthetic standards and belief systems. Further, there is ample evidence, and considerable scholarhip that supports, that there is, <i>indeed</i> a collective cool aesthetic commonly held across traditional, indigenous African societies that has far-reaching implications with regard to how individuals comport themselves, how they interact, that governs/mediates both everyday/pedestrian and artistic expression. That aesthetic merits an article -- just as <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_aesthetics.html" title="Japanese aesthetics">Japanese aesthetics</a> merits one.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This article has <i>not</i> been treated the way other articles on the website generally are treated.

<li><b>STRONG KEEP!!!</b> See my comments on the discussion page, as well as the results of a proper Google search. I've reconsidered my position. I've tried to post this several times, but have been unable to do so. (Another instance of a collateral damage block; it happens to me <i>constantly</i>.) The two subjects are substantially different and both need space to be developed. <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28aesthetic%29.html" title="Cool (aesthetic)">Cool (aesthetic)</a> should continue to deal with the pop culture manifestations of "cool" with a nod to its African/African-American roots. As I mentioned on the talk page of Cool: (African philosophy), there are all sorts of possibilities for further development of <s>this</s> that piece -- an examination of the evolution of "cool" and the anti-hero (the "bad nigger," Stagga Lee, Iceberg Slim, Clint Eastwood's nameless drifter, etc.). I suggest it be renamed "Cool (pop culture aesthetic)." I suggest the other article be renamed "Cool (African aesthetic)." In the readings I've done, primarily Thompson and the academicians who quote him refer to it as a "philosophy." All others seem to refer to the same (or very similar)concepts elucidated by Thompson as an "aesthetic," which, frankly, seems more appropriate. (I utilized Thompson's terminology in setting up the "philosophy" article as a means of differentiating it from cool in the pop culture context.) I reiterate that Wikipedia has far too few articles dealing with Africa and African culture. Cool in the African cultural context is sufficiently complex that it merits an article of its own. Google "African cool aesthetic" and see what you come up with. There's ample information on the subject in an African context and in the African diaspora to fill an article without mention of Fonzie and social stratification and many of the, IMO, rather shallow, pop-culture manifestations of the phenomenon. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 21:35, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>While Thompson's work (which actually includes several monographs) is the source of the term "philosophy" in connection w/cool, there is ample scholarship among academicians, anthropologists, art historians, etc., who write of an African cool "aesthetic." When I separated out the article from it pop culture stuff, I chose Thompson's terminology to diffrentiate the two, "aesthetic" from "philosophy." Further reading tells me the article is best titled "Cool (African aesthetic)," because "philosophy" has other connotations that see incongruous with the phenomenon and, indeed, somewhat antithetical to traditional African ways of being in/regarding the world. Whatever the article is called, there is a need to examine the phenomenon in its original and purest context, grounded in the cultural, existential, spiritual and moral framework that gave birth to it. And even if one <i>completely disagrees</i> that African cool and pop culture cool are even <i>remotely</i> connected at all, the subject still would merit an article -- because of cool's far-reaching influence in African the plastic and performance arts, interpersonal relationships, notions of propriety, comportment and spiritual centeredness. It is a cultural ethos at the heart of the indigenous African psyche/identity. It remains clearly in evidence today in the Motherland and, certainly in the Caribbean and the Americas. And there is scholarship supporting that fact. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 15:35, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment:</b></dd>
<dd>Sorry, but that's about the most absurd comment yet. I have no objection whatsoever to the Fonz being on the page. The character is a perfect example of pop-culture cool. After all, it'd be pretty silly to contend that "cool" has been assimilated into mainstream American culture and then object to images that support that fact. My point -- again -- is that, with this vote, many are, in effect, saying that an article on cool as a legitimate, indigenous cultural ethos that is an underlying value in African society with regard to personal comportment, interpersonal relations, functional art, music, dance, etc., has no inherent value. And that most certainly is not the case. Cool in the African context would merit an article had there been no trans-Atlantic slave trade and no consequent infusion into American popular culture. It is complex, with pervasive implications in virtually all forms of indigenous African cultural expression. There is ample information about cool in African culture that is clearly not POV; it is the result of scholarly inquiry and rigorous research. Some of those sources have been provided on the talk page. The contentious subject is, in fact, pop-culture cool -- which, does not render an examination of cool in traditional African societies or in the African diaspora POV or superfluous. Quite the contrary. Further, an examination of pop-culture cool in its various permutations and disparate meanings is not critical to an examination of African cool. Far from it. If anything, the parent article to one on pop-culture cool should be one treating the African cool aesthetic. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 13:17, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Whether the subject has value or not is a subjective question(personally, I would say that African cool was indeed at the origins of the American cool...but of course thats my POV), which can be addressed from all angles on <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28aesthetic%29.html" title="Cool (aesthetic)">Cool (aesthetic)</a>.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 13:20, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you said you <i>didn't</i> believe African cool was the source of pop-culture cool, my response would be the name. Who cares?

<p>Actually, the consensus is not that its a POV fork and I find your comment that it is "irresponsible of any admin to keep it," made after asking me to reconsider my vote, insulting. The article needs a lot of work but it is a valid article. In addition, Robert F. Thompson's article is extremely well known and has been reprinted in a number of places (for example, here <a href="http://mitpress2.mit.edu/e-journals/Leonardo/reviews/may2005/rise_mosher.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mitpress2.mit.edu/e-journals/Leonardo/reviews/may2005/rise_mosher.html" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> and here <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/013912733X/002-5564636-5931208?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/013912733X/002-5564636-5931208?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>). The problem with this article is that instead of actually seeking consensus a small number of editors ON ALL SIDES OF THE ISSUE continually attack each other's assertions. As for more references to prove the validity of this subject, try these:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Healing Wisdom of Africa</i> by Malidoma Patrice Some, Tarcher, 1999, pages 191-92, where it says, "...people show admirable dexterity in appearing cool." The text refers to the African cultural concept of appearing perfectly in control even when adrift in confusion.</li>
<li><i>Cool Pose&#160;: The Dilemmas of Black Manhood in America</i> by Richard Majors, Janet Mancini Billson, Touchstone; 1993, page 57, where it states, "John Janzen dates the phenomenon of cool in Africa back to at least 2000-3000 B.c." The book also has a section on the "The Roots of Cool in African Culture," which can be read online at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0671865722/ref=sib_vae_pg_57/002-5564636-5931208?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;keywords=africa%20cool&amp;p=S023&amp;twc=6&amp;checkSum=yLQMfcFiIgmrRQuRBQokArqErXJtJj4a0ubK%2BNhoGyo%3D#reader-page" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0671865722/ref=sib_vae_pg_57/002-5564636-5931208?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;keywords=africa%20cool&amp;p=S023&amp;twc=6&amp;checkSum=yLQMfcFiIgmrRQuRBQokArqErXJtJj4a0ubK%2BNhoGyo%3D#reader-page" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> (log-in to Amazon.com required).</li>

<dd>That's just ridiculous. The article is <i>about</i> the cool aesthetic in the African context -- as is made clear by the article's title.

If, as <a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> admits, this is a recognized "existant theory" then there is no reason to delete the article.

<dd>Absolutely not! Cool is not a "theory"; it is a clearly identifiable aesthetic in African societies/cultures.

This is clearly an intolerable, utterly nonsensical double standard that will not be tolerated.

<dd>My apologies to the extent to which my distracted, half-hearted (and, admittedly, half-a**ed) changes to the article earlier today may have contributed to your confusion. I realized I really had absolutely no time to devote to the article and had succeeded in not only making the article <i>less</i> coherent, but in screwing up the footnotes, as well. I've reverted the article back to an earlier version. Please see this page's discussion page for more information. Thanks for stopping by to inquire. You reminded me that I'd neglected to go back and do the revert this a.m. (I was interrupted by a series of phone calls and a courier at the door -- and it <i>completely</i> slipped my mind.) <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 23:53, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment:</b> This was posted by Deeceevoice at talk:Articles for deletion/Cool (African philosophy)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion/Cool_%28African_philosophy%29#Response" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion/Cool_%28African_philosophy%29#Response" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> <code>Just received an e-mail from the professor cited above (the one doing research into cool in African American literature), Jacqueline Goldsby, Univ. of Chicago. Here is what she wrote, in part: <i>I skimmed the debate at the Wikipedia website, following the link you provided. Since I'm just embarking on my own research into the concept, I can't offer the kind of definitive sourcing you need.</i></code> The bottom line is, that neither Deeceevoice, nor Jacqueline Goldsby who is researching the concept, are able to offer any other sources than Thompson. This article was already renamed 4 times in an attempt to find a title that fits DCV'S original research. That's not how an encyclopedia works. I concur with Zoe: An article on Thompson's book would be acceptable, but this is a POV fork article on a philosophy which isn't verifiable. <a href="../../../c/o/y/User%7ECoYep_5bfa.html" title="User:CoYep">CoYep</a> 13:16, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I find it exceedingly telling what CoYep <i>doesn't</i> report of my e-mail exchange with Professor Goldsby. She writes:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p><b>I'm struck that the contributors to the debate are so hostile toward Robert Farris Thompson's discussion of "coolness" in Flash of the Spirit. That book is recognized by scholars as *the* definitive treatment of African-derived art forms and practices across the diaspora. Thompson's credentials are impeccable, as is his scholarship. It's specious for your opponents to dismiss the idea of "cool"'s Africanist origins simply because only one (English-language) text addresses it. That's often the case in scholarship. After all, seminal ideas have to start somewhere.</b></p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>And while Goldsby refers to "that book," Thompson has written <i>several</i> celebrated and acclaimed monographs addressing African aesthetics and the aesthetics of African cool on the African continent and in the African diaspora, as well.</dd>
<dd>CoYep's contention is absurd on its face. I've offered <i>several</i> such sources on the discussion page. Many of the sources which CoYepu attempted to debunk, discount or flat-out mischaracterize still stand, as any quick perusal of the discussion page readily will reveal. Further -- again -- Thompson's works on African art and African cultural aesthetics are seminal in the field, accepted and respected -- as they have been for more than 40 years. And the contention that the article is a "POV" fork is specious and an obvious red herring. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 13:55, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No. It is apparently <i>you</i> who fail to grasp the scope and breadth of Thompson's scholarship. I don't know how many times one must state the facts. This man has had material on African art and African aesthetics and African cool in publication since (as near as I can figure) 1964 -- likely before you were born. I myself been acquaintaed with his work and reputation as a well-known authority in the field since 1974. Wikipedians seem to be just about the <i>only</i> people who <i>claim</i> to know anything about the subject who don't seem to know anything about the man. And the fact that this is the first <i>you</i> have heard of him and his important work does not render his voluminous work "original research" -- not by a long shot.

<p><b>comment:</b> Even a professional researcher know of <i>only one</i> book -- even then she doesn't call it a "philosophy" and there's a good likelihood it's a forgery or she was mislead (she hardly "skimmed" the discussion and she mentions the hostility towards thompson -- huh?). I can't believe DCV is making everyone jump through hoops on this. She described her motivations for creating the page -- it is a POV fork. She supported merge but when it looked like her POV might not get enough attention when merged back in she changed her tune to "strong keep".

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Actually, IMO, no. The article addresses only the aspects of African-Amerian culture that are expressions of the African aesthetic of cool. There are other clear expressions of this aesthetic in the African diaspora, as well -- in Caribbean and Brazilian cultures, specifically, where the imprint of Africa remains more pronounced -- which the article has yet to treat. But there are, indeed, manifestations that have become part of the pop-culture cool aesthetic, such as male machismo (which, though grounded in African cool, is not part of it). It is a product of the African-American experience and a survival response to slavery, oppression, etc. These "mutated" or descendant forms of cool more properly belong in an article treating African-American culture -- or, to the extent to which such expressions have been assimilated across ethnicities into mainstream American/pop culture (in the case of cool machismo, in bad-boy/anti-hero personas and archetypes) even better, into an article on "Cool (pop-culture aesthetic)" -- the "Cool (aesthetic)" article renamed. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 12:08, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Acknowledged. I still don't think the article is distinctive enough from Cool (aesthetic) or other pop culture/African American articles.

<dd>That's actually because the text introducing/delineating the elements of African cool was deleted, along with subheads where the information had yet to be written. The basic framework of the article was gutted months ago. There isn't sufficient information remaining in the article to help people understand that point. But the sources I've provided above do allude to those elements -- if you're interested in checking them out. And much of it is really distinct from and more meaningful than the pop culture phenomena/expressions of cool. A merge of the two articles is basically saying the underlying cultural aesthetics of much of black Africa do not merit a separate article -- when that certainly is not the case. The concepts and values involved and their myriad forms of expression throughout portions of Africa and the African diaspora are certainly complex enough to need that kind of space and separation to be detailed and explained.<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">Deeceevoice</a> 12:46, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think the page should be kept up. Though I don't attend Tulane, I do live in the New Orleans area, and I've heard this around town quite a bit. The character Turtle on "Entourage" has forcefully said "Pace" upon exiting a room and may have originated this usage. While "pace" is definitely a neologism, I disagree that it is a protologism because of this source. Furthermore, since this is a reaction to the growing, post-Katrina changes besetting New Orleanians--e.g., "My house in Lakeview got paced in the storm."--I think pace takes on an important cultural context and is thus just as appropriate on Wikipedia as UrbanDictionary. Admittedly, the definition is vague and needs to be refined. -- CBowes</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Pace is a slang term derived from esoteric Cajun/French vernacular. Only recently has it been resurrected by twenty-somethings native to the area and entrenched in Cajun culture and history. With the geographically diverse blend of undergraduates at Tulane University, the term has spread as far west as Bellevue, WA, and as far north as New York.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am still very intrigued by this page. It is inappropriate for me to modify the original definition, but I urge the original poster to do so to reflect both a more specific denotation and the reasons we have defended "pace's" use. By the way, it is also possible that "pace" in this context could have originated from "hale and pace," the cockney rhyming slang for "face." Thus, the expressions "I paced my face" and "I have to pace myself before I *pace* myself." I would appreciate if the people pushing for deletion would be more descriptive in their reasons, instead of just insulting the people who are defending the listing. What exactly are you looking for in regards to "pace's" relevance, and what would satisfy your need for outside sources? No matter what verdict Wikipedia decides upon, it is entries like this that define its relevance. Either it is a democratic medium for the progression of knowledge and culture, or it is as pedantic and intolerant as a first grade teacher. I think deleting this entry would be a line in the sand pushing Wikipedia into the latter group.

<p>Keep- Although an annoying term because of its stunning popularity in Post Katrina New Orleans, "Pace" has certainly become terminology on par with such early 90's California surfer lingo as "rad" and "awesome." Urban Dictionary, while also an appropriate location for the terminology, doesn't provide enough credence for terminology being used by an entire culture's population. -WLW <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.81.125.59 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.81.125.59_031d.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.81.125.59">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Please don't get pretentious and pace, pace. At the heart of the matter for those of you shouting "delete" is that you do not live in New Orleans, where the term has its origins, and you have no compassion for just how paced your city can become when it's hit by a hurricane. Do you really feel any better when you kick those who are down? Is there a reason why we can't have our culture displayed in Wikipedia? I think not. Please, just give pace a chance. -Dgran</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Pace is sweeping Uptown New Orleans and elsewhere as fast as any slang term in the past quarter century. It belongs on Wikipedia, and if wikipedia decides to "pace" pace, then it will be missing a prime opportunity to keep up-to-date with pop culture. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Lewlou84 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lewlou84_b5bd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lewlou84">contribs</a>) 13 April.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I believe Pace is an important new term both for New Orleans and for all of Louisiana. As a resident of Baton Rouge I can attest to having heard the term Pace on several occasions which proves that it is not just a local phenomenon. Pace is becoming an important part of Louisiana culture and is proving its viability by spreading to different cities and even different states. To delete this term would be both close minded and intolerant. RockerBT 22:23, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b>. It can be verified, Jarmusch, Waits and Cave have all discussed it in interview. It's a joke organisation but it's still significant pop culture, providing commentary on the artistic relationship between Waits and Jarmusch. That it was even proposed for deletion is preposterous.

<p>Yes, the reason I didn't simply blank the page was that so many other templates depend on it. And these templates are involved with timezones and all. We need to consider the implications.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I have also never heard of this secret society. A secret society is difficult to verify indeed, but they have to have done SOMETHING visible or note worthy to truly exist. As a student at the University of Virginia, I can say I've never heard anything about this alleged secret society.</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Never heard of this secret society, nor seen a single symbol around Grounds at the University of Virginia (may indeed exist elsewhere, but not here). No verifiable activities, as far as we know it could be one person commenting on wikipedia. Other secret societies have been documented at least by the school newspaper, or are found in the University Guide Service handbook, but this one is neither. Probably just a handful of wannabe students that do not accomplish anything.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Point taken, however it is more widespread that some secret societies that have been listed and asking for the notable activities of a secret society is difficult to satisfy. I suppose this makes the verifiability suspect, but perhaps the minor publishable activities and enough votes to keep will suffice. <a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmashkanthegreat_0c03.html" title="User:Smashkanthegreat">$mashkan</a> 17:24, 11 April 2006</li>

<li>I also know of several schools where the ghosts seem to be active, most notably at VCU in Richmond, VA. Though their activities seem to be only moderately 'visable', logos pasted around campus, for example, Smashkan makes a point that they are more widespread than some other secret societies that have articles on Wikipedia. Verifiability, to me, is the only questionable criteria for this article and given that I am the third person to have witnessed their activities, I vote to keep it posted.

<p>Istrancis: Hi, I'm the author of this article, and I note that there seems to be a problem with it. It's my first article, you see, and I'm probably missing a couple of rules etc. Sorry if I've caused you trouble, but I just thought that it'd be nice to have my school on Wikipedia. If you want to delete it, that's no problem, but I'm still not sure what I should do to fix it. I guess it's not really all that significant, as I said I just thought it'd be a nice entry, but if there's any way I can improve it, please let me know.</p>

I don't really have a problem with having 10 million articles on schools, podunk towns, TV episodes, etc as they aren't really hurting the encyclopedia. Kotepho 11:00, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Istrancis: Listen guys, thanks a lot for your help and all on this, but I think that the best thing to do is to just delete this article, and I'll go through the rules and stuff, get a little more experience and see if there are any articles I can edit, and then maybe I'll come back and post this article again. But for now, sorry for causing you trouble, and thanks again for your help! Bye for now.</p>

<p>This is a very problematic page that violates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>. Let me state that I am not at all motivated by any desire to censor Wikipedia. There are plenty of sex articles I would never dream of deleting, because they have been properly documented in psychiatric and medical literature. This is different. I'm nominating this because its existence clearly violates policy, and it is a very attractive target to vandals. I also don't like having what are supposed to be factual articles that are filled with speculation, fiction, and outright lies. A couple of days ago, this was added to the article:</p>
<p><i>"The most unique and hilarious variation, however, is the one where it is said that immediately upon being punched, the partner taking it up the ass contracts so forcefully, the active partner's penis is ejected three winks prior to ejaculation. At this critical juncture, a delicate BABY is also evacuated, and it immediately begins to eS the Dee of the repudiated partner to finish him off. If the baby is a good girl, she will swallow. Male babies never never nerver swallow. Good luck to everyone!"</i></p>
<p>I don't know what kind of person it takes to come up with this stuff, but I suspect it's not the kind of person we need to write articles. I've tried to edit out the fiction, but without any success. One user repeatedly puts back information that he really can't be bothered to provide sources for. Other editors have repeatedly removed the information, and it has been put back. One such piece of information is the idea that punching someone hard enough in the back will cause their rectum to prolapse and form a so-called "pink sock." I'm not a physician, but I know that simply being punched does not cause rectal prolapse. I'd like to see this article deleted, but perhaps it and its kind could be put on one page, perhaps titled sexual urban legends, to make it easier to monitor vandalism, to give all these terms context, and to limit the amount of trivial references to movies, cartoons, TV shows, and video games each one inevitably attracts. At any rate, I'm done with this article. Monitoring it and others like it is a thankless job, and no one seems to care anyway about whether it is factual or not. Comments directed at me personally during this discussion will not be answered on this page, and should instead be directed to my talk page where they will be promptly ignored. People crying "censorship!" will not be taken seriously. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G. Crawford">Brian G.

<li>While I realize that not everybody agrees on the notability of unelected political candidates, the precedent has already been set that <i>federal</i> candidates are entitled at <i>least</i> to inclusion in a merged list. Baldasaro was also briefly a candidate for the leadership of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Canada_d0d3.html" title="Progressive Conservative Party of Canada">Progressive Conservatives</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>; AFD precedent has <i>always</i> favoured inclusion of party leadership candidates. So I'm inclined to the <b>keep</b>, but if this absolutely has to go I could live with a merge into either <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_the_Universe_9c0c.html" title="Church of the Universe">Church of the Universe</a> or a Marijuana Party candidates list.

<li>This one should be <b>kept</b>. The article has been in need of improvement for some time, but Baldasaro is a notable enough figure -- he runs a religious movement (of sorts), is a perennial candidate for public office and, as Bearcat mentions, tried to run from the PC leadership in 1998. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 20:11, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b>. I'm aware of absolutely no current precedent supporting deleting failed candidates in major elections where they may be merged into X party candidates in X election pages. I don't like that alternative myself, in large part for candidates like Atkins where they've run in multiple elections. But it's far, far better than deleting information. Historians today are interested in national elections 100 years ago, and information about candidates assists their research.

<p>To the best of my knowledge the article has been created by a fan and supporter. I can see the argument for deletion, but IMO it should stay. Sebstuart 23:13, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree! Watching the show it is clear that Edmund is one of the more notable characters. He has already been on Richard and Judy and Harry Hill's TV Burb (both quite mainstream shows) and he has given interviews to national and local newspapers. To delete this article before the terrestrial showing of BatG runs its course would be a travesty.</p>
<p>It has been written by the good people of Downing Collge, Cambridge, who have also set up "www.edmundbolton.co.uk"</p>

<dd>You missed my point, which was that if all the timelines are added to the list that should be (it doesn't matter by whom) then the list will be too long to be one page anymore.

<dd>When it gets that long where it is almost complete then we can examine our options such as deletion. For the time being, considering it is all on one page and far from complete, deletion is obviously premature. Of course, it is also possible that many of our existing timeline pages would themselves be merged or deleted over time, thereby eliminating the risk that the list would ever achieve a length that would even suggest the need for deconsolidation. Not that this is intended in any way to disparage the often very real benefits derived from spinning-off articles and lists. Despite your well-meaning question that seems to view AfD as a discounting mechanism establishing a net present value for articles based on future editing flows, my personal timeline for forming an opinion on AfD only runs for five days. Put simply, I am uncomfortable with a capital sentence rendered for alleged future crimes. In the present case, now well beyond my timeline due to the quite unfortunate initial close, no crime has been committed so the judgement must be to acquit. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:12, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I see absolutely no legitimate reason to delete this perfectly good, well establiahed article.

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> An immensely-helpful resource for researchers, as many articles aren't categorized appropriately and many users don't browse category pages.

<li><b>Comment and Keep</b> Can you show some precedence for deleting article history?

<li>Recently I requested it to be done for <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Gordon_Lawrence_9b54.html" title="Roy Gordon Lawrence">Roy Gordon Lawrence</a>. I think GFDL is a a concern. But this has solutions:
<ul>
<li>Mere lists of facts aren't copyrightable. Most of this article, is that, and as such, its not a concern</li>
<li>If the good content is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carroll_High_School_%28Fort_Wayne%2C_Indiana%29&amp;diff=48067781&amp;oldid=40379010" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carroll_High_School_%28Fort_Wayne%2C_Indiana%29&amp;diff=48067781&amp;oldid=40379010" rel="nofollow">substantially different</a> then the bad content (e.g. a total rewrite) it's a new work. This is just like if you take contents from an external web site, and totally reword it. That's ok. Basically, I'm saying the vandals have a copyright, and works derived from that, but not works that aren't derived from it. The fact two versions exist in the same article's history, does not mean one was is truly derived from another (retaining mere facts does not count).</li>
<li>We can record a list of edits (user id/datestamps) in the talk page, for attribution purposes</li>
<li>Finally, given that there is so little content, if any admin wishes to, without an AFD, they can just go ahead and delete the article *while* immedidately remaking it with new content (e.g. a substub).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, I welcome any admin to interpret my vote to mean I want the attacks gone, and I want an article for this school to exist, however that is accomplished, whatever has to be done. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 08:15, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
