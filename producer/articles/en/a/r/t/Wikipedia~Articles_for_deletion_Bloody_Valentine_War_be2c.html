<li><b>Comment</b>. Gundam is a genre-defining franchise that's been produing new installments for nearly 30 years.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. As I said in another of his AfD nominations, Brian G. Crawford's declaration that he wants to purge everything Gundam-related from Wikipedia smacks of bad faith to me. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedxiv_dabe.html" title="User:Redxiv">Redxiv</a> 18:28, 24 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. I'm unsure what is <i>prima facie</i> bad faith about an editor's assertion that a separate article for every single bleeding individual weapon system ever featured in a Gundam spinoff involves massive NN ubercruft -- a position with which I happen to agree. What I think <i>is</i> bad faith is claiming he wants to purge every Gundam-related article from Wikipedia.

<ul>
<li>A single user deciding he'll go on a one-man crusade against a subject he's too unfamiliar with to tell what's notable and what's not seems like bad faith to me. And he's admitted that he wants to wipe out the Gundam articles. He said as much in his cluster of AfDs. Also, his methodology seems disengenuous to me. He's arbitrarily grouped articles together for mass AfDs, but logically the should all be in a single AfD. The debate is over whether any articles along the lines of the ones nominated should exist, not over any specific article. The impression I get is that he's going for a shotgun approach. If he succeeds in getting some of these articles deleted, even if others survive AfD, he'll use the deleted ones as precedent for a new round of AfDs. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedxiv_dabe.html" title="User:Redxiv">Redxiv</a> 23:06, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I thought much the same myself, come to that. There's a lot of "said as much" and "seems like" in Redxiv's reply, and not a lot of actual fact in the heap of inferences ... never mind complaining that this isn't in one giant AfD, given the complaints about giant AfDs. Should we start speculating about the lack of good faith of the Gundam crowd in passionately defending each and every article, no matter how trivial (an article for every individual <b>weapon system</b>?!?) and launching unprovoked personal attacks? This would work a great deal more smoothly if there was less "he's out to GET US" rhetoric and more focusing on the merits of the argument. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 13:22, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><small><b>Strong Keep</b> The article in question outlines a cannonical event of <b>critical</b> significance to one of the most prolific and lasting science fiction series of all time. Supporting a motion to delete this article demonstrates a severe lack of perspective uppon the part of the supporter.

<li><small><b>Strong Keep</b>. If anything, you're being too specific with your delete requests... By that logic, you'd have to delete every Gundam article on Wikipedia, along with most other Anime articles - in fact, there are several more obscure series that should have been targeted first. And I'm not in favor of that - I enjoy having the information on this and other series all available in one place. Furthermore, varying amounts of data on the subject (Gundam) are found on the Japanese, French, Spanish, Italian, and German Wikipedias shows, in my opinion, that at least the general subject deserves coverage here. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolux_Ex_Machina_fda5.html" title="User:Golux Ex Machina">Golux Ex Machina</a> 06:47, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><small><b>Delete</b>. Not notable. No assertion of notability. Few people care about the fictional storyline, and those that do will go to the wiki specially designed for it.

<li><small>Exactly! It is dates and tech specs from a fictional universe.

</li>
<li><small><b>Strong Keep</b> - for the reasons described above, as well as the fact that Wikipedia is a vertiable Hitchiker's Guide to Earth - 'Cruft' or no, Wikipedia is to inform. Just because it's not important to you does not automatically make it useless. For example, in the early Middle Ages, no one in Western Europe could read, save those outside monestaries... and even then, reading was still a rarity. Said monestaries were full of old parchments and books - some dating back to when Aristotle and Socrates were philosophising about reality. The church could easily have tossed it all out - because all they needed was the Bible, and the rest was basically 'cruft' to them. Yet they kept the knowledge, because they knew it'd be important to someone some day. What is being done here may just be with pop culture - but it is still information to be noted, logged and provided for everyone in this Hitchiker's Guide to Earth. Aside from all this, the only reason the Gundamwiki exists is to hold these articles that are being nominated for deletion (in such a way that abuses Wikipedia's regulations, might I add) in case they actually are deleted - not because someone made their own Wiki.

Furthermore, Wikipedia is meant to be a treasure trove of knowledge on almost ANY subject that anyone can add to and enhance, these Wikis are nothing more than the culmination of hard work from various fans. And finally, just because someone else made their own Wiki doesn't mean that any and all articles on the subject of the Fan-Wiki should be deleted from the real Wikipedia, this is a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman.html" title="Strawman">strawman</a> arguement.

It's not that we don't want articles on fictional subjects. But those fictional subjects have to be notable, meaning they have to have been referenced by reliable, third-party sources. The Star Trek wiki (MemoryAlpha) was created precisely for this reason, because a lot of hard-core fans were writing articles that were obscure even within the Star Trek universe. <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 18:07, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> - Gundam is an important series in anime history and I don't see the purpose in deleting an article discussing a fictional war within the storyline. I find the article informative and useful. Also, deleting this and not deleting every other fictional timeline on Wikipedia would be nothing more than pure hypocrisy.--Pkmatrix 00:34, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> If it would be possible I would like to know Mr. Crawford's reasons for deleting this article. The Gundam series is a very successful and old series. It is more popular than most anime out there. So why are we trying to delete something that is viewed by its hundreds of thousand fans. This article is very informative despite it being a made up show about "anthropomorphic robots with japanese swords" (extreme paraphrase). Please Administrators do not delete this article just because of one sour person. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Rueben Ortiz (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rueben_Ortiz_de31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rueben Ortiz">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">No personal attacks please</a>. You clearly disagree with the nomination, and your opinion is just as valid as everyone else's. <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 03:18, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b>, and an abuse of the AfD policy from a person whose primary "contribution" to Wikipedia is to delete other people's contributions. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceberg3k_a804.html" title="User:Iceberg3k">Iceberg3k</a> 20:22, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I won't comment on whether this article should be kept or deleted. I will say that the "car fender" comments in the nomination are unhelpful, irrelevant, and do not help the impression that this nomination and others like it are based on personal dislike of the subject rather than an effort to improve the encyclopedia. I'll also echo Iceberg3k's comment above, in that the vast majority of Brian G. Crawford's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brian_G._Crawford_d18e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brian G. Crawford">contributions</a> consist of participating in the deletion proccess, often times supporting the deletion of articles on fictional characters and the like. Frankly, it disturbs me, and I hope very much that this user's conduct changes to a drastic degree.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean Black</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black"><font color="#FC0FC0">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:50, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Gundam is a highly verfiable, notable, and revalant to the topic. If you delete this, than all other fictional conflicts would have to be delted as well. How can you understand a series if you have no context of it? What's the War in star wars? Why is Starfleet going arround and doing stuff? Without this context, the reader will have little idea what the point of the series, or why it is important. --Eldarone 18:25, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
