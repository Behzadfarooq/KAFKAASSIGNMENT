<li><b>Keep</b> <del><b>or Merge</b></del> I am a Rutgers alumni and life-long NJ resident. I've met more than a few people from NJ and beyond who when told I went to Rutgers would promptly ask about the "Grease Trucks". I have rarely met anyone from New Jersey who hasn't at least heard of them, and many have been there at least once. The Grease trucks are noted in various sources, most famously in Maxim, and are a well-known part of the Rutgers University social environment. At the very least they deserve mention on the Rutgers University wiki page, though it is probably too complex to detail in a small space. Needs its own entry. --Daveyboy37 17:19, 25 September 2006 (UTC) <i>changed to KEEP and clarified position</i></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I am against a merge since the Grease Trucks have grown beyond just Rutgers culture. Students have traveled from others colleges, including community colleges to have a sandwich I am a primary witness to such events. As a free encyclopedia that require a community to expand, democratic methods can be taken even if an article has been deleted (which I did not know since I created this article from a redirect, an improper one might I add, since Food trucks are not called Grease trucks. The name is unique to these Rutgers trucks). I question the fairness of the previous delete because so few responses were taken. The failure to pass may have been due to poor quality, which I believe I avoided in this article, as well as a lack of research in notability (possibly because of lack of citations). This rewritten version comes complete with citations. A simple search of Grease trucks in Google brings copious amounts of results (notable results might I add). <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 19:15, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The grease trucks are a well known regional institution of sorts. I would estimate that the majority of people who went to college in the Greater NJ area since 1990 or so have heard of the grease trucks. They are a ubiquitous aspect of Rutgers college life, a large national univrsity and as such, it is my opinion that the entry is valid and should be retained. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 12.151.113.139 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.151.113.139_aefc.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.151.113.139">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b>. Merging with <a href="../../../r/u/t/Rutgers_University_ce58.html" title="Rutgers University">Rutgers University</a> is not a solution since it isn't solely a matter of "student life"...it's grown beyond its connection with Rutgers (as per Valoem). Though a reference on the Rutgers page is warranted, it's already there in the template and I think under the section titled "points of interest" (if not, i'll correct that). Deletion is not the solution, since this is notable and its notability is cited. This subject is just as notable as the Harvard <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck_Truck_44c0.html" title="Fuck Truck">Fuck Truck</a>...actually moreso. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 20:42, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The Grease Trucks are a staple of the Rutgers campus. This article is not about a single truck on a single corner, it's about a <i>specific group</i> of trucks that cluster together. They are notable especially in light of the Fat Darrell/Maxim Magazine exposure. The history log of this article backs up Valoem's claim that this incarnation of the article was only created on 8/25/06 <i>not</i> March, and therefore should not be speedy deleted. <a href="../../../w/l/2/User%7EWl219_bdc1.html" title="User:Wl219">Wl219</a> 12:32, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would suggest that in order to make the Grease Trucks <i>even more notable</i>, references to 2005 Daily Targum articles about the complaints of harassment by female students should be added. <a href="../../../w/l/2/User%7EWl219_bdc1.html" title="User:Wl219">Wl219</a> 12:35, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"STRONG KEEP"* -- I lived in central jersey for 18 years and though I never attended Rutgers University, I visited the grease trucks on more than one occasion. The flow of young people crowding the area late at night is a social event in itself. Good memories, affordable yummy greasy food, more fun than going to the local diners. The grease trucks are a part of New Brunswick's youth culture. I was looking for information about them to show my west-coast friend and this article conveniently showed up in search results. It was helpful... Please don't delete it...68.171.137.121 07:28, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> When I was in Tampa last fall, Rutgers came to play USF and there was a feature on the grease truck (presumably because of the Maxium article).
