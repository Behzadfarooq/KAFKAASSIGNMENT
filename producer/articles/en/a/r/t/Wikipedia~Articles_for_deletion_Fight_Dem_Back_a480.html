<p>Irrelevancy, FDB is a small group of students with a personal grudge against people with certain political affiliations. Their actions and lack of credibility don't warrant an entry. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by The Merovingian (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Merovingian_6286.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Merovingian">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think that opposing fascists and neo-Nazis constitutes a "personal grudge against people with certain political affiliations". The fact that the group claims activity in two countries (Australia and New Zealand) is a point in favor of their possible notability, but I will let editors more familiar with this group judge that point first. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:11, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Their activity in NZ is limited to one or two semi-active members. It is more of a cult than a legitimate organisation. They are fairly despised by both anti-fa and left-wing groups alike due to their strange and more-often-than-not inappropriate tactics. The Merovingian</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see any support for the nominator's allegations about the group or its reputation.

<li><b>Keep</b> This article has vaule in an encyclopedia. It is an unbias article that contain factual information. This article also has notablilty because student interested in hate groups and racism can relate to this information.

<li><b>Keep</b> Although FDB might not be that well-known or vitally important, there is still a role for the article. Anyone, for example, researching the contemporary history of anti-fascism in Australasia or in the free speech/hate speech debate would find it useful. However, it is important that the article is kept robust and NPOV. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobfrombrockley_29ed.html" title="User:Bobfrombrockley">BobFromBrockley</a> 09:13, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> 160 unique Googles attest to the difficulty of covering this neutrally from reliable sources. Nothing on Google News (although to be fair there's only on Gnews cite for the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti_Nazi_League_37b5.html" title="Anti Nazi League">Anti Nazi League</a>, but that scores many more unique ghits).

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b></s> Seems mostly to be <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> as it is referenced by its own site (links 1,3,5 and 6),an abandoned blog by one of its members (2),and an article written by one of its members in a (possibly defunct) NZ student magazine. There is a link to an article on the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_First_Party_db88.html" title="Australia First Party">Australia First Party</a> site, but I'm not sure one (possibly not entirely unbiased) reference is enough to produce an NPOV article. There also seems to be evidence of a few revert wars which is normally a pointer to POV editing. That said, I think a bit of cleanup would save it. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 16:05, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Keep</b> - there's been some cleanup and external references added. I'd like to see a more rigourous treatment of the Criticism section and some references for the middle paragraph of the Politics section, but I don't believe this now merits a delete.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Numerous articles in all major Australian newspapers, and most major NZ papers. Members have appeared on a number of television news reports, as well as A Current Affair and Today Tonight. I'd like to assume good faith on the part of wikipedian Delos' vote to delete, but according to the FDB website he once said he'd like to hang an FDB member or take him out into the desert and "peg him." <a href="http://www.fightdemback.org/2005/08/30/dont-lie-to-us-alex/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fightdemback.org/2005/08/30/dont-lie-to-us-alex/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Surely you must consider them somewhat notable if you have expressed a desire to kill them? <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrett_ca1d.html" title="User:Drett">Drett</a> 16:16, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd also like to assume good faith on the part of the person nominating this for deletion, but it appears that their one other contribution to WP is a single piece of vandalism. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrett_ca1d.html" title="User:Drett">Drett</a> 17:44, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The best course of action then is to assess the <i>article</i> on its own merits, and ignore <i>who</i> is involved in the process. Whether the article is nominated for deletion by Jimbo Wales or 223.181.64.221 shouldn't affect the outcome, the deletion, retention or no decision should rest solely on the qualifications of the article. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 17:51, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I was merely making the point that the nomination may have been made in bad faith. To assess the article on it's merits: It would appear that the article refers to the group's website itself for trivial information on the group. It also refers to critics of the group for criticism - this seems reasonable. Once it has been decided that this article should not be deleted, it would probably be a good idea to utilize the wealth of information printed on this group in the media to broaden the scope of the article. This conference paper from the Queensland University of Technology may also be of use. <a href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/archive/00003487/" class="external autonumber" title="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/archive/00003487/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>
<dl>
<dd>No, <i>before</i> it's decided whether or not to delete the article, these kind of references <i>must</i> be added, or the only appropriate conclusion is delete. The citations are all blogs (i.e. valueless) and the group's own website (equally valueless). Essentially, there's no real evidence presented that the group <i>even exists</i>. Whether the nomination is made in good, bad or indifferent faith is entirely irrelevent. Rather than resort to personnal attacks against the nominator, instead argue the merits of the article. <i>If</i> the article merits inclusion, the result of the debate will be keep. Relying on a group's website for information is terrible, best illustrated by all the nominated band websites - for example, if you read my band's website, you would wrongly conclude that a) we exist, and b) we play music. Without a <i>real</i> reference, the article fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, a non-negiotable policy of Wikipedia - and thus is deserving of deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:28, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No problem - you're definitely allowed <i>and encouraged</i> to edit articles while they're up for deletion. Poorly written articles that need rewriting are oft times deleted when an overhaul is in order because overhauling an article is a lot of work. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:45, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, as WilyD says, you can certainly edit articles during an AFD, in fact lots of articles have been saved from deletion because the issues have been addressed during the discussion. If you have something to verifiable and NPOV to add, get in there. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 18:56, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There are articles from newspapers (such as The Australian and the Australian Jewish News) which discuss this group's activities in a general manner (as opposed to members commenting on incidents or issues) - however these articles are no longer available online from their original source, but have been copied onto the group's site verbatim. Is it acceptable to add these as references? <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrett_ca1d.html" title="User:Drett">Drett</a> 18:58, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> There's no doubt that this nomination for deletion is in <b>bad faith</b>, motivated by the fact that the nominator (203.89.173.120) is a New Zealand white supremacist/neo-nazi, who happens to be one of the investigative targets of FightDemBack.<a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmoul_Aschkenazi_4729.html" title="User:Schmoul Aschkenazi">Schmoul Aschkenazi</a> 01:29, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Is it a personal attack if the information is true? FDB are quite aware of the position of the neo-nazi at the cited IP and attempts to baselessly smear or defame the group in efforts to dilute the FDB message.
