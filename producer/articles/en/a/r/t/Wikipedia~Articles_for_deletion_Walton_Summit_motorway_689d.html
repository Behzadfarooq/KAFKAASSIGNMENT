<li>There is simply no such thing as "Walton Summit motorway". The concept of this stretch of road being a wholly separate motorway by that name is a simple <a href="http://pathetic.org.uk/motorways/waltonsummit.htm" class="external text" title="http://pathetic.org.uk/motorways/waltonsummit.htm" rel="nofollow">invention of a "Pathetic Motorways" web site</a>. (The other occurrences of this name on the Web, such as <a href="http://www.lmars.co.uk/m65motorway.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lmars.co.uk/m65motorway.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, and on Usenet, such as <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/uk.transport/msg/a85fa1c6aa35f220" class="external text" title="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/uk.transport/msg/a85fa1c6aa35f220" rel="nofollow">here</a>, all turn out to have that web site as their source.) If you look at <a href="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=53.7185&amp;lon=-2.6369&amp;scale=25000&amp;icon=x" class="external text" title="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=53.7185&amp;lon=-2.6369&amp;scale=25000&amp;icon=x" rel="nofollow">a map of the road</a> you'll see that this is simply a common slip road, that was previously a stretch of "A" class road, but where now non-motorway traffic is barred for the very simple reason that there is no way of exiting that stretch other than by joining a motorway, and that is still labelled as the <a href="../../../a/6/_/A6_road.html" title="A6 road">A6</a> on <a href="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=53.7192&amp;lon=-2.6356&amp;scale=10000&amp;icon=x" class="external text" title="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=53.7192&amp;lon=-2.6356&amp;scale=10000&amp;icon=x" rel="nofollow">some maps</a>. As I have argued before:
<ol>
<li>The sign on the "Walton Summit motorway" in the photograph on the web site that says "Walton Summit" <i>isn't naming the slip road</i>. It's not a road name sign. It's a <a href="http://www.highwaycode.gov.uk./signs06.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.highwaycode.gov.uk./signs06.htm" rel="nofollow">direction sign</a>, pointing the way, off the interchange and along the slip road, to Walton Summit.</li>
<li>There are <i>plenty</i> of motorway slip roads and other nameless motorway-class stretches of road in the U.K.. <a href="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=52.4792&amp;lon=-1.7132&amp;scale=25000&amp;icon=x" class="external text" title="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=52.4792&amp;lon=-1.7132&amp;scale=25000&amp;icon=x" rel="nofollow">Here are some more</a>. <a href="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=51.4993&amp;lon=-2.6899&amp;scale=25000&amp;icon=x" class="external text" title="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=51.4993&amp;lon=-2.6899&amp;scale=25000&amp;icon=x" rel="nofollow">And here</a>. <a href="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=51.5591&amp;lon=-0.5332&amp;scale=25000&amp;icon=x" class="external text" title="http://multimap.co.uk./map/browse.cgi?lat=51.5591&amp;lon=-0.5332&amp;scale=25000&amp;icon=x" rel="nofollow">And here</a>.</li>
<li>It's certainly going to be in the interests of a "pathetic motorways" web site (the only source for this information) to build up the importance of a road into a fully-fledged "motorway" simply so that it can have one more target to knock down as "pathetic".</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Whilst a country's major highways may warrant articles, we should draw the line at articles on their individual slip roads going by invented names. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:01:44, 2005-08-07 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, lets look at some of the things that you claim. As I have pointed out previously to you, this is an extremely unusual sliproad. Show me another one in the UK that meets two motorways at the same time. Oh, you can't. There isn't one. There is no claim that it is a "fully fledged motorway". In fact, the site states "Really, it's an overgrown sliproad.."</li>
<li>Secondly "Walton Summit Motorway" is only a 'working name', until the correct name can be found through more research. This name is in common use throughout the British Roads community. There is no claim anywhere that the signpost pointing down the hill does anything other than point to a destination. Presumably you also don't recognise "Mancunian Way" but only A57(M)...</li>
<li>Thirdly, it was never previously a stretch of "A" road. It was new build and opened under motorway restrictions. This claim of being a motorway simply because it accesses a roundabout that meets only motorways is false. See M1 junction 21, for example.</li>
<li>Fourthly, I suggest you look up the meaning of "pathetic" properly... Pathetic Motorways does not simply exist to "knock targets down" - there's a heck of a lot of solid research that needs to go on to actually examine small motorways accurately. That's real genuine research that involves trawling round archive material located all around the country. It's not designed to be staid and boring, but interesting for the reader to learn some things. And yes, I'm very annoyed at the suggestion that it is just pure fantasy. You try doing some of the work!</li>
<li>However, I vote for <b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../m/6/5/M65_motorway.html" title="M65 motorway">M65 motorway</a>, with possibly a link provided from <a href="../../../m/6/1/M61_motorway.html" title="M61 motorway">M61 motorway</a>. It's not important enough to be in Wikipedia in its own right, although it is something that is extremely unusual, so perhaps deserves a mention elsewhere. If it came down to it, I'd go Delete rather than Keep. And I wrote the bloody website! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 62.173.88.146 (<a href="../../../6/2/2E/User_talk%7E62.173.88.146.html" title="User talk:62.173.88.146">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.173.88.146_ac15.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.173.88.146">contribs</a>) 11:25, 10 August 2005.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is simply false to claim that the Walton Summit Motorway does not exist. The slip road has become legendary under that name and its status as a stretch of motorway, subject to UK motorway law, is indisputed. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 15:08, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>The thing that is actually false here is the claim that it has "become legendary under that name". That's uttter rubbish. It hasn't. As I said, the <i>only</i> source for that name, which isn't even in widespread use, let alone "legendary", is the "Pathetic Motorways" web site, which has simply made up that name for a common slip road. There is <a href="http://www.highways.gov.uk./knowledge/facts.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.highways.gov.uk./knowledge/facts.htm" rel="nofollow">simply no such thing</a> as "Walton Summit motorway". <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:33:45, 2005-08-07 (UTC)</li>
<li>All you have established with the above reference is that there is no designated motorway by the name of the "Walton Summit Motorway". I also notice that the above map establishes that there is no such thing as the Newcastle Urban Motorway, nor even the Durham Motorway--two stretches of motorway that I'm intimately acquainted with. Well done: at this rate you'll have proven that there are no roads in Britain except those that are listed under official names on a map produced by the Department of Transport. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 15:51, 7 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And assuming this hyperbole were actually true, this exercise of verifiability in action would be a problem <i>how</i>, exactly?
<ul>
<li>There is no verifiability problem; there is simply a case of a guy showing a single map that doesn't list a particular entity. I don't know what you find to be hyperbolae here--is it my statement that the motorways in question aren't named on the map or my statement that they nevertheless do exist? Both statements are verifiably true. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 16:40, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
