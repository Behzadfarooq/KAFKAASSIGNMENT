<p>I could think of a million reasons to get rid of this page, but let's just start with non-notable (page hasn't been touched since March 2006), far from NPOV (quite popular?), original research (nearly all of their "references" are merely other F_W links) and downright inaccurate - which is what happens when fans write a vanity page. <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoomisSimmons_5ef4.html" title="User:LoomisSimmons">LoomisSimmons</a> 05:09, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Not <i>a single</i> reference from anything even remotely close to a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. The article asserts a good deal of notability, and this is supported by "Fandom Wank" getting almost 300,000 Google hits, with (exactly) 500 of the first 1,000 hits being unique, but again, all of the hits I saw were message board posts and blogs. In addition, and what <i>really</i> convinces me that this is insignificant, is that it's hosted on a freeweb service that itself is not notable enough (FYI: Alexa rank of 63,593) to have its own WP article. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 15:11, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the main reason they're hosted on JournalFen is that they got kicked off LiveJournal (and possibly other sites), and they wanted somewhere they knew wouldn't do that. - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakomk_1f87.html" title="User:Makomk">makomk</a> 11:00, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Yes, and this entry fails to mention that the <i>reason</i> they were kicked off not only LiveJournal but Blurty as well is because F_W members were actively encouraging members to harass people that they were "wanking", going as far as to post personal real life information of people (including pictures, full names, addresses and even telephone numbers). That's the problem with a fan page - the bias. F_W has its own Wiki, so why does their "history" need to be documnented here? Before you know it, places like OhNoTheyDidnt and Premade LJs - both communities with over 30,000 members - will have entries here. <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoomisSimmons_5ef4.html" title="User:LoomisSimmons">LoomisSimmons</a> 13:20, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't know much about the days before Journalfen, but as of right now, F_W and its affiliated communities are <i>adamant</i> about not giving out the personal info of anyone featured there, and the mods will immediately delete the comments of and ban anyone caught doing this. You're not even supposed to alert the people being wanked that they are on f_w or participate in the wank on your own. These things are all right in the comm's rules. So if that's the problem you have with the community itself, and your issue is that Wikipedia condones such behavior by keeping the article up, then it's really a non-issue at this point. If you have an instance where someone's privacy was violated by the comm recently, then cite examples.AGNGoo 18:55, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Oh, let's see... reports to the LJ administration? Police reports, if it's gone that far? News articles? What's that? No such thing? Then the information is not properly included in the article. I assumed you had some kind of proof of it when you first mentioned it, but naturally it wasn't there if there's no external corroborating evidence.

<li><b>Keep</b> very interesting article about a website that has thousands of members. The website covers a whole range of fandoms and it is very much the case that major players within fandoms have heard of it. Amazing though it may seem to the person who brought up this AfD, a lot of people have heard of Fandom Wank (and we're not talking people just within the Wikipedia), and there are several articles on Wikipedia of less notable figures, for example: Daniel Brandt. I'm calling that the person who posted this AfD has some sort of grudge against FW. EDIT: And if you want to get rid of this, then (as said in the previous AfD) get rid of GNAA first86.129.32.151 16:34, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. The first deletion debate probably should have been thrown out, as notability was asserted without being proved. The lack of actual references outside of the community imply a walled garden. Absent extenuating circumstances, three thousand members is not particularly impressive nor does it argue for inclusion. Furthermore, articles are not kept on the basis that articles still worthy of deletion remain. An article <i>must</i> stand or fall on its own merits. Finally, the article itself makes no assertion of notability, despite its length and verbosity. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 18:52, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

If this article is deleted, we would have to delete all these as well, and something tells me this is not in keeping with the spirit of Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> per previous afd and the fact that most of the reasons for deletion are incredibly weak--external documentation can be provided and probably should be.

Furthermore, see comments by those who have provided them in favor of keeping this article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThephotoman_1da2.html" title="User:Thephotoman">Thephotoman</a> 14:57, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> because the community is, in a word, notorious. It does need some work to present a more neutral point of view, but all in all it is just as valid as any other page referring to fandom and having a Wiki page reflects that. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsik_6f71.html" title="User:Orsik">Orsik</a> 16:33, 20 August 2006 (UTC)Orsik.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think it's valuable to have articles on particular internet communities, and that's certainly never going to be part of a mainstream encyclopedia. Wiki is a good place to go specifically for information about things you might hear about randomly that you have no clue about, and fandom_wank is one of the places you might accidentally run across in general net discussions. As to the size fo the comm? It's about as big as some of the small towns we have pages for (eg, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perry_%28village%29%2C_New_York_9c97.html" title="Perry (village), New York">Perry, NY</a>), and probably has more constant activity.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd like to point out that the majority of these keep votes are simply "if so-and-so is here, why can't this be here?" which, as <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> has pointed out, is no reason to keep anything. If there are other vanity pages that need to be deleted, then let's get rid of them. As for "proving" anything about F_W through external documenation, I challenge anyone to do so. The first AfD should've failed solely because notability was not proven (still hasn't been, other than "lots of people RILLY RILLY LIEK IT!!11"), and now we have the problem of original research. No matter what articles are here that shouldn't be - yes, even the cursed GNAA (which I disagree with as well), the bottom line is that F_W has no place on Wikipedia because it does NOT NOT FOLLOW WIKIPEDIA'S OUTLINED RULES. Notability? FAIL. Verification? FAIL. Neutral point of view? FAIL. And I challenge anyone to be able to "prove" any of the "points" made in the article <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoomisSimmons_5ef4.html" title="User:LoomisSimmons">LoomisSimmons</a> 17:39, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> What "points" are made? It's a descriptive article about a community, and the reason I brought up the small town article is that it is also a descriptive article about a community. I don't see an NPoV issue here at all; the criticisms of the site are mentioned and the number of members is mentioned. It could probably do without the In-Jokes section, but that's a simple edit. I've been working on another community page <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo%2C_NY_50e4.html" title="Buffalo, NY">Buffalo, NY</a>, and the tone there is far less in tune with NPoV. I think it needs a really nitpicky re-edit, but I don't think that this means it should be <i>deleted.</i> <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_w_86a2.html" title="User:Miss w">Miss w</a> 17:58, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The fact that you are comparing a TOWN with an online community as the same thing is mind-boggling. And up until yesterday, this article was extremely NPOV; someone was just polite enough to get rid of all the stroking and back-patting. Nevertheless, I get the impression that F_W is going to become the new GNAA: someone points out the flaws and uselessness of it being here, and its members will come flying in like locusts to defend their precious page. <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoomisSimmons_5ef4.html" title="User:LoomisSimmons">LoomisSimmons</a> 19:23, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The fact that you're refusing to see that a community is a community is what's mindboggling.

<dd><b>Comment</b> F_W does a lot of covering up itself, such as the reason for their being banned from LiveJournal (and Blurty) and the banning of people from their own Wiki who step up to challenge a lot of the lies they tell. Even if there is proof, (screencaps, links, etc), they'll ban that person anyway. So I don't see how F_W is any different than any other community who "covers up" things. <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoomisSimmons_5ef4.html" title="User:LoomisSimmons">LoomisSimmons</a> 19:23, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> So basically, your whole reason for bringing this up for deletion is that you don't like FW and think they lie a lot, without any corroboration whatsoever of that idea. Cite evidence of said lies. Bring up the screen caps--they'd be housed elsewhere, probably by the person who originally posted them. As far as I know, the only screen caps that have gotten people banned have been screencaps of f-locked posts, which are prohibited in the comm because they aren't allowed to wank f-locked posts. That's visible in the comm's regulations. Exactly what instances are you referring to? Perhaps we could find verification, in which case it would be an interesting addition to the article. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_w_86a2.html" title="User:Miss w">Miss w</a> 19:42, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I suspect the real issue is that there aren't any verifiable sources and we're wholly unconvinced that this forum is worth an encyclopedia article.

<li>In keeping with the note at the head of the page, the reason I think it should be kept is quite simple: Wiki is the only place to get non-biased information on sites such as this. Yes, it could lead to the consequence of bad_penny having a page, or OhNoYouDidn't, but honestly? I don't think that's a bad thing. Cyber-communities unattached to major entries (eg, hatrack.com would be attached, presumably, to <a href="../../../o/r/s/Orson_Scott_Card_9716.html" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a>--I haven't checked, though) are orphan information, and they are topics which someone could quite conceivably come looking for if encountered elsewhere on the web. One of the wonderful things about the Internet is the spontaneous generation of distinct sub-communities, and it behooves an online encyclopedia to treat them as legitimate. If we want to avoid having a page for every single comm, maybe we could come up with an over-arching article which includes several under general categories, but at present, that doesn't exist, and an article specifically dealing with one particular comm, as long as it is written in NPoV, is as justifiable as one on a small town or any other minor hobby. (Another possible "general" page would be net-watching as a hobby, rather like <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philately.html" title="Philately">philately</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/r/Bird-watching.html" title="Bird-watching">bird-watching</a>, with F_W, bp, and others addressed as separate aspects of it. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_w_86a2.html" title="User:Miss w">Miss w</a> 20:25, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: A page on net-watching might be rather interesting and useful. I can think of at least a few other communities similar to FW, albeit with different focuses, which might be included. Vigilanterodent 22:05, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> or alternatively delete the Fark.com article as well. This article and the Fark article mirror each other in structure, and useless trivia. (Maybe they could be merged with other articles on similar communities?) Why is Fark.com noteworthy and Fandom Wank isn't? Fandom Wank is frequently mentioned in the blogosphere, often in context unconnected to Fandom Wank itself <a href="http://www.pissnvinegar.com/2004/11/05/younglibswank/" class="external text" title="http://www.pissnvinegar.com/2004/11/05/younglibswank/" rel="nofollow">1</a>, <a href="http://irresponsible.patachu.com/2006/05/in-japan-they-have-fandom-wank-too.html" class="external text" title="http://irresponsible.patachu.com/2006/05/in-japan-they-have-fandom-wank-too.html" rel="nofollow">2</a>, <a href="http://whedonesque.com/tag/fandom+wank" class="external text" title="http://whedonesque.com/tag/fandom+wank" rel="nofollow">3</a>, <a href="http://blog.newsarama.com/2006/06/22/scandal-at-privet-drive/" class="external text" title="http://blog.newsarama.com/2006/06/22/scandal-at-privet-drive/" rel="nofollow">4</a>, <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/29050" class="external text" title="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/29050" rel="nofollow">5</a>, <a href="http://leegoldberg.typepad.com/a_writers_life/2005/12/potter_pedophil.html" class="external text" title="http://leegoldberg.typepad.com/a_writers_life/2005/12/potter_pedophil.html" rel="nofollow">6</a> and has been slowly but surely redefined the meaning of the word "wank" in fannish contexts. It's no longer about masturbation and plot holes, but also about flame wars and ego-tripping. I think that an encylopedia whose article on <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthiness.html" title="Truthiness">truthiness</a> is longer than their article on <a href="../../../l/u/t/Lutherans.html" title="Lutherans">Lutherans</a>, who have an article about a small piece of slash fanfiction which used to be an internet fad in 2002 (<a href="../../../v/e/r/Very_Secret_Diaries_9d6c.html" title="Very Secret Diaries">Very Secret Diaries</a>) either should re-think their approach to pop culture items and internet phenomena in general or leave things as they are. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules2_62d4.html" title="User:Jules2">Jules2</a> 23:33, 20 August 2006 (UTC)Jules2</li>
<li>Are you suggesting, with a straight face, that Fark and Fandom Wank can be equated? Also, the existence of one article has never been accepted as a valid criteria for the retention of another. The article discrepancy you describe happens because people belonging to non-notable worthless sub-forums and what not flood Wikipedia because the world must know about obscure trivia. Much like most of the people arguing for this article to be kept, actually. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 23:39, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, indeed I state that Fark, Metafilter and Fandom Wank are pretty much the same type of online commentary. So what about the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Very_Secret_Diaries_9d6c.html" title="Very Secret Diaries">Very Secret Diaries</a> article? Or <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthiness.html" title="Truthiness">Truthiness</a>. Are those really notable? Or as notable as the length of the article in the case of <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthiness.html" title="Truthiness">Truthiness</a> suggests? How many <i>Colbert Report</i> fans have typed their fingers off, editing the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthiness.html" title="Truthiness">Truthiness</a> article, or the article on Colbert's fake persona? Are you suggesting that they weren't biased to flood wikipedia in order to give <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthiness.html" title="Truthiness">Truthiness</a> its length? Or that the author of the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Very_Secret_Diaries_9d6c.html" title="Very Secret Diaries">Very Secret Diaries</a> hasn't got them bookmarked? I think you confuse bias with personal investment into a subject. Fact is that Wikipedia could not exist without people having personal investment into the <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codex_Seraphinianus_0a14.html" title="Codex Seraphinianus">Codex Seraphinianus</a> or <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_rice.html" title="Brown rice">Brown rice</a>. That does not make the content of the articles less truthful nor does it make them more or less notable. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules2_62d4.html" title="User:Jules2">Jules2</a> 00:17, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I didn't respond to many of your points in detail because they're irrelevant. The primary problem here isn't notability but <i>verifiability.</i> There aren't any sources for crafting this article; it's all primary research. And while this and Fark might be similar types of sites, this is rather akin to stating that my local little league team and the Detroit Tigers are both baseball teams: the statement is true in a limited sense but deeply misleading. I've no doubt that related fandoms flooded those articles; their time will come. You still haven't given a justification for keeping <i>this</i> article. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 00:23, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am afraid this will degenerate into wank if we continue this discussion. Well, you should look up the meaning of wank as I am using it here as fast as you, because if your mission succeeds you won't be able to look it up on Wikipedia anymore. Anyway, I am not sure if I can give you a justification for keeping the article, since you're quite intense about deleting it. But personally, I find the fact that the Official <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joss_Whedon_368c.html" title="Joss Whedon">Joss Whedon</a> blog has used the word <b>wank</b> in the Fandom Wank definition of the word without actually linking to Fandom Wank in any form a sign that the definition word <i>wank</i> has been irreversibly altered by Fandom Wank among a significant part of the online community. That is one thing that makes Fandom Wank notable. As for media mentions <a href="http://www.metroactive.com/metro/07.19.06/work-0629.html" class="external text" title="http://www.metroactive.com/metro/07.19.06/work-0629.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> describes a series of events that partially took place on Fandom Wank. Fandom Wank is not explicitly mentioned, but only because the author mistook Fandom Wank for <i>the LiveJournal fanfic community</i>. Wikipedia could have put her right, if she had actually done research. --<a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules2_62d4.html" title="User:Jules2">Jules2</a> 00:57, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Furthermore, Truthiness has been the subject of multiple articles in the mainstream press. I deeply doubt whether "Fandom Wank" will manage such a feat. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 00:24, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: The mainstream press is not the only source of documendation. I could fairly easily provide first-hand documentation (which should trump documentation provided third-hand, which is what you get most of the time with the mainstream press) of most of the claims in this article. Those for which I cannot do so could be provided by others. The only reason I haven't done so is a matter of time constraints. Furthermore, <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truthiness.html" title="Truthiness">truthiness</a> was a concept championed by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Colbert_e40e.html" title="Stephen Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a>, who is much closer to the mainstream press than Fandom Wank by virtue of being a cable television personality. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThephotoman_1da2.html" title="User:Thephotoman">Thephotoman</a> 00:48, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please read the policy on original research (<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>). We're a tertiary source, so we rely on secondary accounts. There aren't any of those for this site.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Your argument against referencing primary sources is not valid, as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> allows for such. The only thing prohibited through <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> is posting work in Wikipedia that would result in Wikipedia being referenced as a primary source. No such material is presented here. Tell us what you want documented, and it will be documented. If the mainstream press and textbooks were the only things referenced, it would mean that Wikipedia would be a much less robust encyclopedia--most articles on Internet phenomena would not be present. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThephotoman_1da2.html" title="User:Thephotoman">Thephotoman</a> 01:04, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
