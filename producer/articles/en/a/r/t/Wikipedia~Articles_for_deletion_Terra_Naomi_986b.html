<li><b>Comment</b> - The subject has toured nationally according to her own website (linked in my vote statement) and the websites of various venues across the country that have hosted her; she has been featured on a major media outlet; she has an internet prescence that is comparable to other indie bands with established articles. The fact that her career has taken off on the Internet more so than any place else (though again, she has toured the US and into Canada) does not make her irrelevant, in fact, it makes Wikipedia perhaps the most valid place to report on her career. --<b><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexwcovington_2ca2.html" title="User:Alexwcovington"><font style="background:#000088;" color="#FFFF88">AlexWCovington</font></a></b> (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexwcovington_ddca.html" title="User talk:Alexwcovington">talk</a>) 03:59, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I have promised Alex that I will take another look tomorrow afternoon -- please do not count my vote as final before then. The music scene is evolving right now, and I think that diminishes the value of the "signed to a label" test specified by <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. Ohconfucius seems to have actually done the research and come up with a <i>delete</i> conclusion, but I admit I haven't done it myself, and that my "ask a friend" test was a little lazy (in fairness, my buddy Pete really does know a crapload about the indie music scene, so it wasn't just like some random friend... but yeah, I should do the research myself). Anyway, I remain borderline. I will research again tomorrow, as per Alex's request, and may change my vote.

<li><b>Comment</b> For the record, there is no "signed to a label" test -- one of the guidelines is <i>two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels</i>, but this is only one test.

<li><b>Comment</b> We need Verifiability outside of her website. Something to backup the claims made...more than one source is needed. I could make a website that looks just like her's and claim a lot of things that are not verifiable outside of the website. Thing is wikipedia needs proof, not truth or certainty. She fails both <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>...not to mention <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The cnbc story was about not about her exclusively, which an article needs to be. The story has to be about her and only her which it isn't, making the mention trivial (like rolling stone mentioning a website name in passing in an article.) While I like a few of her songs, she doesn't pass the guidelines we set up for music/performers. The rules are the rules. Especially <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>...those are non-negotiable and can never be ignored.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Terra Naomi has been on several national tours, including one opening for pop-star Tyler Hilton, in the summer of 2005. In addition the Wikipedia rules say that "Has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show."

<dd><b>Comment</b> How are your "people got killed for translating the Bible" arguments any less out-of-proportion than the Nazi analogies?!</dd>
<dd>The point you are missing is that Wikipedia is not some government democracy that you can vote for change. It's a private organization, and they make their own rules, using their own money combined with private donations. You can ask nicely for them to change their rules, but you have absolutely no right to <i>demand</i> it. After all, you are completely free to buy a web server and create your own website using the Wikimedia software...</dd>
<dd>Anyway, this petty anti-rule argument is moot. I would strongly encourage those who voted "delete" to please see the rationale for my changed vote at the top of this page. Ezra has brought information to our attention that Terra Naomi <i>does</i> satisfy <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>.

<dd>I have reviewed my arguement and it stands firm. It <i>does not</i> satisfy <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> so this is not the end of the story. Also, the article is lacking VERIFIABLE information beyond this. No links, nothing to back up anything claimed here or on the website.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I just edited the article to add an additional citation and reduce the POV and promotional aspect of it. I think it reads fairly neutral now. Artist <i>does</i> satisfy one criteria of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> (track appears on other notable media), and in addition has some inherent notability due to the unconventional path to success. Even a strict reading of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> turns this article into a redirect rather than a delete, and I think the latter point puts it over the edge to a keep-er. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaysweet_f27f.html" title="User:Jaysweet">Jaysweet</a> 19:04, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> and it might be added that that is one interpretation of <i>Has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show. (But if this is the only claim, it is probably more appropriate to have a mention in the main article and redirect to that page.)</i>... personally I don't think having a track on a soundtrack really satisfies that because at that point the question now becomes "is the soundtrack notable in and of itself as a form of media". Besides, in my opinion that argues a redirect... I'd be more convinced if I saw a tour schedule from a source other than her own website. Still, it is largely a moot point because peering into my crystal ball I predict this will be kept at least on a "no consensus" and in one year's time she will likely meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> solidly anyway.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:25, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> please do not put words in my mouth. I am not contesting the film's notability at all. I am contesting the fact that the artist has no verifiable notability beyond this. In light of that, yes, deleting the article and redirecting to the movie is fine. Not every artist that has a track featured on a movie sound track (moreso an indy movie like this where no-name artists are usually used) should have and article. There needs to be more claim-to-fame beyond a sound editor deciding that X artist's song sounds good to use for a 5-10 second clip for X part of a movie. The article was pegged for AfD because there are no verifiable claims of notability beyond the persona website and now having a track used in an indy movie (which frankly is laughable at best) <b>Delete and redirect</b> --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 19:12, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b></p>
<p>Basically this (sorry long) item places the justification on Terra Naomi being the currently pre-eminent example of an Indie musician exploiting a new "scene" via the medium of YouTube.</p>
<p>First I need to introduce myself by saying I have no connection with Terra Naomi save that I’ve contributed a lot to her message board in the past 2 months. I’ve also been (sort of) been delegated to assemble some points on why Terra Naomi entry merits retention by some members of the board. Note that I'm well aware these things can become personalised, so this is factual.</p>
<p>Of all the factors, the most important is her importance on YouTube. That the full future impact of YouTube and its ilk as major cultural channels has yet to be fully evaluated is undeniable, but the influence is clear to see. If, as I believe, YouTube and the like are considered to be influential and important, then Terra Naomi is undoubtedly the pre-eminent exemplar of Indie music on that medium. It can easily be argued that this qualifies under this condition&#160;:-</p>
<p>“Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop); note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability.”</p>
<p>(local scene referring to the YouTube community of course).</p>
<p>The facts regarding Terra Naomi’s importance on YouTube are undeniable and verifiable. These include the following</p>
<p>for two months from the early July to early September, Terra Naomi was the most subscribed musical channel on YouTube. Only in the last week since major label involvement on behalf of two other artists has that position been supplanted on the all-time list.</p>
<p>one of Terra Naomi’s 32 videos (Say It’s Possible) has been viewed over 860,00 times alone. On YouTube alone, total views are in the region of two million.</p>
<p>Terra Naomi’s songs have inspired over fifty YouTube “covers” (I’ve lost count after that).</p>
<p>The following are key YouTube stats (as of 13th August 2006)</p>
<ol>
<li>16 - Most Subscribed Channels (All Time)</li>
<li>3 - Most Subscribed Channels (All Time) - Musicians</li>
</ol>
<p>Of lesser importance, but still worth noting are</p>
<p>Terra Naomi has a strong presence on MySpace, with 800,000 plays (verifiable) and over 21,000 “friends”. This is many more than some more established artists (for example, Katie Melua – the selling female artist in the UK last year has fewer than 8,000). Yes, these can be manipulated, but I’ve not heard of Terra Naomi “polling” anybody.</p>
<p>From stats I’ve assembled from Terra Naomi’s message board, she has an international presence unprecedented at this stage of a career – 53 countries represented in all continents (save Antartica). Evidence of an increasing globalisation through this new medium.</p>
<p>Terra Naomi has a track (Clean) on the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack for Maggie Gyllenhaal film, sherrybaby (released 5th September 2006)</p>
<p>Terra Naomi ha also released (independently) four CDs (ignoring promotions) including</p>
<p>Terra Naomi 2002 Terra Naomi EP Terra Naomi 8 Track Virtually CD</p>
<p>Terra Naomi has toured across the United States on her own, and as a support act to Tyler Hamilton.</p>
<p>I would also add that I have met Terra Naomi at two concerts she gave in London (The Borderline, 26th August 2006 and The Troubadour, 28th August 2006). These are verifiable as I have pictures on Flickr and there is a review of the Troubadour performance on YouTubeTalk. Those watching included two groups who flew in from Italy and one from Germany for the event.</p>
<p>Terra Naomi was in London for talks at the invitation of a record company – details are confidential, and I’m not party to them, but she was accompanied by representatives when I met her.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> That's all very interesting... but none of that describes how she meets the current guidelines for this sort of article on Wikipedia (see <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>).--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:20, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>I included the condition that I think it qualifies under near the beginning. That is namely the importance in a "scene". Tying scenes into a narrow, regional or geographical boundary is artificial and not representative of the development of the Internet or social networks like YouTube and MySpace. SJ</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think you have a hard sell considering MySpace or YouTube a "scene". There are hundreds upon hundreds of bands on those sites promoting their music. It's a useful tool to get your name out there, but calling the fact that a number of people download or listen to a particular artist or song on these websites a "scene" is a stretch. You are trying to interpret the meaning of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> in a novel way that is outside the bounds of how it was written.
