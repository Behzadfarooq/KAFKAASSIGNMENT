<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It has five days' worth of discussion from the moment that Tariqabjotu nominated it. Responding to your suggestion of merging it with the article on Jerusalem - with all due respect, I think that's a fundamentally bad idea. Even fleshed out, this will still be a very long (unboundedly long, some might say) list, which is going to take up an awful lot of space in the Jerusalem article if someone puts it there. No other city article has a "list of places" attached, for reasons which I've always taken to be aesthetic as much as anything else. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 07:39, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Artsojourner: This list was originally created as a new article in May 2005 because the original Jerusalem article was getting too long <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jerusalem&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13775503" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jerusalem&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13775503" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> because this is not simply an issue of "lists vs categories" (in any case, lists and categories serve different functions on Wikipedia and both are legitimate, see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes_edc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes">Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes</a>) and it's an integral part of the <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> article</b> <i>and</i> the <b>{{<a href="../../../j/e/r/Template%7EJerusalem_8a53.html" title="Template:Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>}} template</b> on this list's page. This list was originally created as a new article in May 2005 because the original Jerusalem article was getting too long <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jerusalem&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13775503" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jerusalem&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13775503" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Thus this list is part of an important integrated totality. To remove it, or even to move it around, would scar and harm BOTH the <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> article</b> <i>and</i> the <b>{{<a href="../../../j/e/r/Template%7EJerusalem_8a53.html" title="Template:Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>}} template</b>. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 10:23, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>It's neither an integral part of the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> article nor an integral part of the {{<a href="../../../j/e/r/Template%7EJerusalem_8a53.html" title="Template:Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>}} template. I don't believe the article is linked from the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> article anywhere (except in the template) and it's only linked from the template because the article exists. Several of the links in the {{<a href="../../../j/e/r/Template%7EJerusalem_8a53.html" title="Template:Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>}} template are links to categories that work perfectly fine. It is true that the page was forked from the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> article due to its length, but that alone is not a reason to keep an article. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 13:37, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Tariqabjotu: I am not following your reasoning. If you admit that it's linked the to {{<a href="../../../j/e/r/Template%7EJerusalem_8a53.html" title="Template:Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>}} template then it's linked to the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> article and yes the article exists (that's why you nominated it and that's why we are voting here) unless you nominated something that does not exist so then this vote should be cancelled ASAP, as we can't vote for things that do not exist. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 13:48, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Lists are redundant with categories <i>if it is an unannotated list of bluelinks in alphabetical order</i>. That is all a category can do. In this case we have a number of redlinks which probably should be made blue at some point. The list also sorts things by <i>type</i> of landmark, collecting all of it on one page, the category system needs to divide it into a series of subcategories to achieve the same. I'll agree that the list probably ought to have some more annotations to it, but this does not make the presence of the list unjustified. In its present form, the list does serve a purpose as a navigational aid, although I won't oppose converting the whole thing into a navigation box (template for use on all Jerusalem landmark articles) if annotations are not forthcoming. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 11:26, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a fair enough article, although in essence it is just a way of keeping a big list of the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> page, or a fork if you prefer. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Prince_Manifest_a6ca.html" title="User:The Prince Manifest">The Prince</a> 11:47, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I just skimmed the page, but it seems it might be valuable to someone. If Wikipedia ever implements an <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontology.html" title="Ontology">ontology</a> system along the lines of <a href="http://ontoworld.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://ontoworld.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Semantic MediaWiki</a>, then it should be possible to auto-generate a list like this (which would then be preferred over manual generation, for many reasons), but until that functionality is available, it will be hard to duplicate this kind of list. So why not keep? —<a href="../../../d/f/a/User%7EDfass_f166.html" title="User:Dfass">Dfass</a> 14:28, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, I think it would be better to have a category Jerusalem and link to articles from there, not adding my keep or delete because on the one side I think having this is a good idea, but as a list one can fast loose overview <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 14:43, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Lists and categories serve somewhat different though partially overlapping purposes. Any difficulties in maintaining a list are similar to the difficulties involved in maintaining the category; in fact, if you have one, it makes it fairly simple to maintain the other, and furthermore, if you have both, you are more likely to get a complete set including pages where somebody includes it in the list but doesn't categorize properly, or the other way around. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 15:50, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> A list has the advantage of having each type of place broken down, while we could do that with subcategories that would result in a fair number of categories with few entries. Also, the redlinks are useful to know what doesn't have an article yet. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:02, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> For all the good reasons mentioned above, plus for someone planing to go to Jerusalem it will give him/her a complete picture of what is of interest; I already found some articles that I didn't know existed. I think <i>every</i> city needs to have such a page, not only London and Jerusalem; the servers can handle it. As to the work involved; that's what we're here for; almost seven billion of us. <a href="../../../i/t/z/User%7EItzse_7796.html" title="User:Itzse">Itzse</a> 16:21, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> A category does not group things together, and to leave it in the [Jerusalem] article would make it insufferably long. (PS. Why do people always seem to fall back on the strict laws of whatever manual-of-style is "in" on the given week only when it is in regard with someone else's religion or icons thereof? Ever wondered?)<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/c/User%7ECockneyite_18c2.html" title="User:Cockneyite">Cockneyite</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/c/User_talk%7ECockneyite_95c4.html" title="User talk:Cockneyite">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cockneyite_d1c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cockneyite">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep but...</b> I would split this into two articles... one on "<a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighborhoods_of_Richmond%2C_Virginia_c34c.html" title="Neighborhoods of Richmond, Virginia">Neighborhoods of Jerusalem</a>" and another on "<a href="../../../b/u/i/Category%7EBuildings_and_structures_in_Jerusalem_9c15.html" title="Category:Buildings and structures in Jerusalem">List of buildings and structures in Jerusalem</a>" The rationale is that Jerusalem is one of these ancient historical cities where there may be articles about very specific notable places. Also, I believe there is a <a href="../../../e/s/s/WP%7EESSAY_6d64.html" title="WP:ESSAY">wikipedia essay</a> or policy on the difference between lists and categories and how both can be valuable in wikipedia if used correctly. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 23:06, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Good use of grouping. Beginning of description of individual sites. Categories are not good for these. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 01:34, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> needs expansion and elaboration, but lists and categories each have a place for organizing information. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 02:02, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> Other than with the category, the items which have not yet been initiated encourage the creative work of Wikipedians. The <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> article is already very long and it is only natural that for such a large and for many also "central" city as Jerusalem that additional articles should evolve. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 02:54, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. <s>A category could handle the job of this list? So could a paper map. So what? Certain editors prefer using categories. Others prefer using lists. Why should one try to impose its preferences on the other? Also,</s> the list meets <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> by aiding navigation and aiding in the development of new articles. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 03:50, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>A category could handle the job of this list? So could a paper map. So what?</i> I hope that was a joke; for obvious reasons a paper map is not possible. There are decent arguments out there for keeping this article, and so there is no need to resort to a comment like that. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 06:11, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Please accept my apologies. It was an unwarranted comment and I have revised my argument so that it is more relevant to the issue at hand. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 06:31, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> this lists vs categories issue has been discussed hundreds of times.
