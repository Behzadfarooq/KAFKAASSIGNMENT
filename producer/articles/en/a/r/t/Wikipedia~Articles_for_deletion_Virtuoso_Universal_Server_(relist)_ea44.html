<dd><b>Comment</b> - I assume good faith. The duplicate articles seem to me like and attempted page move by an inexperienced editor/self-promoter. The AfD process cannot be a ban on improving the articles. On the contrary, it should encourage people to do their best to save the articles. Copy-paste duplication is the worst fault of this article, and it needs immediate attention.</dd>

<dd>As to the author, Kingsley Idehen. Google claims to get about 94,600 hits for <i>"Kingsley Idehen"</i>. (About ten times as many as my name.) In reality there are 187 "most relevant results". Most of these are in respected web and paper publications. I do not think this guy needs any self-promotion on Wikipedia. He is notable by himself. I believe the same can be said about the software product. -- <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetri_Krohn_f1f9.html" title="User:Petri Krohn">Petri Krohn</a> 22:16, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. All this is very confusing with the moves, redirects, blankings, and so forth. I just closed the article on Virtuso Universal Server as a DELETE (discussion <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Virtuoso_Universal_Server_bbc3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Virtuoso Universal Server">here</a> based on the consensus at <i>that</i> AfD. <i>This</i> AfD has not reached a consensus and ought to be relisted. However, if the <i>content</i> of this article is to be retained, it looks like it should go under an article named "Virtuso Universal Server" rather than this article name (OpenLinkVirtuoso), as that appears to be the correct name... so I will now move both the article to that (just-deleted) name, as well as this AfD, and relist this AfD, hoping that that makes the most sense. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 16:49, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> To clarify - OpenLinkVirtuoso has now been moved to Virtuoso Universal Server, so this AfD is now actually an AfD on the article named Virtuoso Unviersal Server. The previous article named Virtuoso Universal Server has just recently been deleted per consensus at that AfD. It's claimed above that the content of thetwo articles was very similar, for what that is worth. The whole thing looks a ploy to prevent Virtuoso Universal Server (or at any rate the material in the article) from being deleted at its AfD, so in a way this could be seen as a re-creation of a deleted article, but it's not as clear-cut as that, since the article OpenLinkVirtuoso was created <i>before</i> (the original) Virtuoso Universal Server article was deleted. Ploy or no, I don't see that convincing arguments have been made at either AfD, so I think we should look at it again and that the article should stand or fall on its merits. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 17:17, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You might also include criteria 6 <i>(The software has won an independent award or honor, including mention as one of the top ten applications in its class in an independent published list.),</i> as Kingsley Idehen was nominated a 2003 InfoWorld Innovator for <i>"his scientific instincts to build Virtuoso, a wildly innovative virtual database..."</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b> I struck out my delete vote in the original discussion because that vote was based on the duplicate article and the blanking, which appeared to me to be interfering with the AfD. Hopefully that won't happen the second time around and with only one article. No vote from me just yet. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraig_Stuntz_f2ad.html" title="User:Craig Stuntz">Craig Stuntz</a> 20:24, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>softwaremag.com list OpenLink Software, Inc in their <i>Software 500</i> list of the largest software companies globally <a href="http://www.softwaremag.com/S_FocusAreas.cfm?Doc=The500" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.softwaremag.com/S_FocusAreas.cfm?Doc=The500" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> An other claim to notability is related to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> itself. Wikipedia runs on top a <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySQL_62a0.html" title="MySQL">MySQL</a> database. MySQL is usually regarded a <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Swedish</a> project, but in fact it has its roots in <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a>, with both the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Widenius_fbb6.html" title="Michael Widenius">founder</a> and the current <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marten_Mickos_295a.html" title="Marten Mickos">CEO</a> being Finns. With the new section on "History" the article now provides a "noteworthy insight into the history database technology development in Finland." The Kubl RDBMS (now called Virtuoso) was in fact one of a large set of Finnish database start-ups, several of them still playing a major role in the global <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_relational_database_management_systems.html" title="Comparison of relational database management systems">RDBMS market</a>.
