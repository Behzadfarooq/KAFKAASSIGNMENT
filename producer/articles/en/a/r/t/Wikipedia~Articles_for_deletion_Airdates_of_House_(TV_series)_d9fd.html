In the former, I think the broadcast information is relevant to the article, particularly because some networkss censor the show and some do not, which has lead to controversy. The latter is alternate format to present essentially the same information in a prose style. I think there are broader issues to be considered here and I don't think AfD is really the right forum to address it. <font color="#F06A0F">–</font><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony"><span style="border:1px solid #F06A0F;background:white;color:#F06A0F">&#160;Þ&#160;</span></a> 11:24, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> is there a policy for including local air dates for every single country in the world where it is broadcast? Further, is there any way to verify this information? I just don't see what it adds to the article. The information is not on localized versions (beyond what it is called in each country, and there's questions about that too), it's just the network and an incomplete listing of unreferenced dates. The Simpsons reference provided contains information about each country, not just an airdate, and the Rome article is not about the debut of the series in other countries (barring Britain), it's about the airdates of individual episodes. <a href="../../../w/l/u/User%7EWLU_ad34.html" title="User:WLU">WLU</a> 12:49, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../t/v/_/WP%7ETV_d668.html" title="WP:TV">WP:TV</a> says "Lists with International broadcasting information, or syndication information is often not desired here", where "here" is the introductory paragraph, implying that such lists are appropriate elsewhere, though the project page doesn't mention it again. Clearly, including such information is the de facto standard, which is why I'd like to expand this discussion.
<dl>
<dd>"elsewhere" is not specified, but I read <a href="../../../t/v/_/WP%7ETV_d668.html" title="WP:TV">WP:TV</a> to mean [not within project TV/wikipedia]. I do not believe <a href="../../../t/v/_/WP%7ETV_d668.html" title="WP:TV">WP:TV</a> makes inclusion of airing of all individual episodes internationally a <i>de facto</i> standard at all. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 07:01, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Usually, what happens with these things is the network advertises the series on TV, so a local viewer comes to Wikipedia and adds the information. Theoretically, it's verifiable in the sense that if you lived in that country, you could turn on your TV and see the ads for yourself. (See <a href="../../../w/e/e/Talk%7EWeeds_%28TV_series%29_b3c9.html#Broadcasters" title="Talk:Weeds (TV series)">Talk:Weeds (TV series)#Broadcasters</a> as an example.) Beyond that, the networks frequently do publish schedules and occaisionally announce the premiere of a big show via a press release, so we could simply enforce a higher standard of verifiability if that's the problem.</dd>
<dd>The Simpsons page is slightly better, in that it does go into detail in some instances, but the only part that's sourced is the Spanish version and most of the countries don't have any more information than would fit in a table. (eg. <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcasting_of_The_Simpsons_e34f.html#Broadcasting" title="Broadcasting of The Simpsons">Broadcasting of The Simpsons#Broadcasting</a>) If the prose is preferrable to the table format, we could start migrating them to a longer format. (See also <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Smallville_broadcasters_and_home_video_releases_8abf.html" title="List of Smallville broadcasters and home video releases">List of Smallville broadcasters and home video releases</a>.)</dd>
<dd>As for Rome, I guess you didn't see it, but the main article does have the international broadcast information, including the dates of the series premiere and first season conclusion. (<a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome_%28TV_series%29_81a4.html#Broadcasting" title="Rome (TV series)">Rome (TV series)#Broadcasting</a>) The only thing it doesn't have is the local name, presumably because it's simply "Rome" in the local language. For some series, the name of the show doesn't translate that easily, so the show may go by completely different names. (Smallville is "Young Superman" in Japan and House is apparently known as "God of Medicine" in Hong Kong.) Including the local name in such cases is important because viewers might otherwise think that the shows are different. Not that it's important in every case, but putting it in a table format means you need to have the name for all of them. <font color="#F06A0F">–</font><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony"><span style="border:1px solid #F06A0F;background:white;color:#F06A0F">&#160;Þ&#160;</span></a> 21:01, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
