<p>A series of tables listing the tracks included on free CDs issued by the <a href="../../../n/m/e/NME_8ba4.html" title="NME">NME</a>. I have many of these CDs myself, but nonetheless I don't think magazine covermount albums are notable per se. I'm also of the opinion that any NME compilations which are notable - <i>In A Field of Their Own</i> and <i>Ruby Trax</i> might be - should have standalone articles with infoboxes and commentary, not a mess like this. The bottom line here is that the only people who could be remotely interested in the tracklistings of some old freebie compilations are... well, nobody really because those who own the discs presumably have the covers too! <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 12:50, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - which is a pity as there's obviously been a bit of work in this. Some of these might be relevent to an artist discography (such as the Morrissey compiled disc), but apart from that, no. "Ruby Trax" and "Sgt Pepper Knew My Father" would be worth entries as both were comprised of exclusive recordings made particularly for the magazine. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 13:27, 26 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agree entirely. Even if it <i>is</i> deleted, I'm always happy to userfy articles like this upon request, as it might save somebody some typing if - for example - they want to put the tracklisting of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morrissey.html" title="Morrissey">Morrissey</a>'s disc into <i>his</i> article. But, I think this overview article as it stands is really not worthy of an enyclopedia. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 14:06, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Sgt Pepper KMF presently has a little section in the <a href="../../../s/g/t/Sgt_Pepper_f566.html" title="Sgt Pepper">Sgt Pepper</a> article. It's ok to mention its existence there, buy the detail of that would probably best be kept here. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- I've a stack of those 4-track EPs somewhere, so if this doesn't get deleted, I'll add the information. <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Waits_f3cf.html" title="Tom Waits">Tom Waits</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/x/Pixies.html" title="Pixies">Pixies</a>, <a href="../../../h/%C3%BC/s/H%C3%BCsker_D%C3%BC_ff49.html" title="Hüsker Dü">Hüsker Dü</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Smiths_5dab.html" title="The Smiths">The Smiths</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wedding_Present_8e85.html" title="The Wedding Present">The Wedding Present</a>, <a href="../../../c/8/6/C86_%28music%29.html" title="C86 (music)">C86</a>.

<ul>
<li>I have at least 10 of them, some of which aren't listed, so if the list is kept I can add them too. (My two favoured outcomes of an AFD are a bad/inapproriate article being zapped, or impetus beginning for an article's improvement - clearly the latter is best in most cases. In this case, I'm still not convinced that it's a worthy article, but I welcome the high quality debate and if it is kept at least we now have some people who undertake to improve it). --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 03:30, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Certainly the <i>issuance</i> of these sampler discs by the magazine is a noteworthy fact, and the background paragraph should be expanded. The tables may not all be well designed, but seem verifiable, and answer the obvious questions that will arise once the existence of the compilations is announced. I can't see <i>merging</i> this stuff into the NME article in chief either. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 16:15, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Is this opening the floodgates? Nowadays there are UK music magazines who have a CD on the front of every issue (and I mean EVERY issue). In the days of the 7" EPs the NME included (of which I have a small pile too...), such giveaways were a rarity but things have changed and it's now more surprising if a music magazine doesn't have a CD glued to the front. I don't feel they represent a notable event in the life of the magazine but I suppose the question is whether or not these discs are notable <b>purely</b> because they were issued by the NME (etc..). <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 17:20, 26 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think the earlier releases are more notable than the later. Back then the NME was considered the arbiter of cool, and those tapes/discs were a rarity. Hell <a href="../../../c/8/6/C86.html" title="C86">C86</a> even spawned a genre. These days ... not so much. I think the worry is the slippery slope that says NME discs are notable, therefore Uncut discs musts be too. It's the same thought that says <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> minor characters are in, therefore every minor character in Anime du jour should have its own article. That argument is so monstrously wrong-headed that its hard to know where to begin, but is does seem convincing to many editors. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I would try to hit the brakes on the slippery slope if individual issues of the magazine or its accompanying disc got individual articles. NME was perhaps something of an industry leader in adding this content; but that in itself does not mean that they should get an article while its imitators do not. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>, and people write about what interests them. If someone else decides to compile an equally comprehensive list of a competitor magazine's gimmie discs, I'd be inclined to keep that too. To me, in a nutshell, this is a compilation of verifiable information about a noteworthy publication. Someone has taken the trouble to compile it and write an article for us. The text should be expanded. The info which someone has taken the trouble to compile should not disappear. I know it's a logical fallacy to point out that we have an article about <a href="../../../a/o/l/AOL_disk_collecting_3ac0.html" title="AOL disk collecting">AOL disk collecting</a>, but if AOL discs are worthy of an article so are these. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:08, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Merge? No, indeed not. I do however think the important compilations should be in individual articles, where they get an infobox, a bigger picture, and commentary. <a href="../../../c/8/6/C86.html" title="C86">C86</a> is clearly a case in point! (and I didn't know it was an NME tape until I read it here). <i>Ruby Trax</i> is pretty notable too I reckon. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 03:34, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but rename List of NME Compilation CDs or List of NME Compilation tapes or List of NME Compilations - On the sole basis that I personally find this interesting, ignoring all "deletion" rules jsut this once&#160;;). However, if it is to be deleted, then save me a copy of a page, which I'll put somewhere (most likely as a subpage of my userpage). --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDangherous_d22f.html" title="User:Dangherous">Dangherous</a> 17:52, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
