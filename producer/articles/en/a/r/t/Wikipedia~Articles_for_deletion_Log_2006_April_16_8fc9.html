<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus</b> (keep). While sympathetic to the OR concerns, it does not invalidate the entire article. The external links seem valid, so the topic is at least discussed at some level outside of Wikipedia. Since the votes are about 70% delete, but no argument other than OR was put forth for deletion, I'm calling this a no-consensus keep. Voters on both sides are encouraged to remove OR from the article, tag it as needing such, or to start a dialog on the article's talk page. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 01:35, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>That's not this article. This is this article. If you feel the "Christians in the Persian Gulf" article is not notable or falls under some other criteria for deletion, nominate it for deletion. As it stands, this article — an article that, uncited, states that being a "QPOC... intensifies the complications of existing in an oppressed community within an already marginalized community" and that "queer life has become a catalyst for religious and political crossfire worldwide and prohibited as taboo and perverse in social laws in most non Western countries" — sets off my <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>-dar. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 20:32, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I didn't mean to suggest it should be deleted because it's not about an organisation, I was pointing out that some voters seem to think it is an organisation and might not have considered the matter as fully as possible. However, on reflection this is not as big a problem as I thought and I've struck the ambiguity. Btw, threatening to or encouraging others to nominate articles for deletion for no good reason other than "If A is OK, why not B?" tends to rub <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> up the wrong way. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></b></a> 01:20, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>My apologies if I misunderstood you, but why did you count the Google hits then? I was not trying to suggest that the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christians_in_the_Persian_Gulf_52a3.html" title="Christians in the Persian Gulf">Christians in the Persian Gulf</a> should disappear; it served as an illustration that there was something wrong with a criterion I thought I saw being applied. A simple way to establish that a criterion for deletion is wrong, is to show that it also condemns perfectly good articles when applied to them. Or did you mean my reaction to Erik the Uncivil (no offense intended)? That was in the hope it would make him think about what he wrote, as a <i><a href="../../../g/e/d/Gedankenexperiment.html" title="Gedankenexperiment">Gedankenexperiment</a></i>. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 03:33, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was joking, by the way. I thought it was such a spectacularly bad joke that no one would take it seriously.

<li><b>Keep</b>, <b>revise</b> and <b>expand</b>. Obviously there is much more to be said about this, but it's a good start towards describing the experience of a group of people who both experience racism and homophobia/heterosexism. I don't really understand the objection that this is not an objective article, since this is obviously a topic with many viewpoints and isn't likely to be objective no matter who writes it.

<li><b>Keep it, please</b> - I am surprised that someone would like to delete the article. I posted it precisely because there is no much information going around about the OITC and the little there is seem to indicate it is a scam of which people should be warned. It seemed to me that Wikipedia could be a good place for people to pool data about it so that a more clear picture appears. I have conducted research and have included all information available, with links to newspapers that <b>anyone</b> can check. Please, don't ask to delete it before checking the links and considering the importance of people being able to access some information about this matter. Brintolin (Talk)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Alexia rankings have proved to be highly unreliable and my attempts at the aforementioned google search have turned up more hits than previously reported. In addition, being a fan of Pebble Version, I know of many sites that mention it which do not show up in the google search. Finally, it tends to rank in the top 30-40 on Top Web Comics, so it clearly has a decent following. --NBolt <font size="1">(talk)</font> 22:120, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus/keep</b>. While the people voting for delete had a 68% simple majority, I fail to see how this page could be considered so unsalveagable as to warrant deletion. The page has valid references, and appears to be attempting to summarize that research, rather than just being plain original research. Deserves a cleanup and/or an expert tag, and a possible rename, but not a delete. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 01:56, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is <b>not</b> original research; the article summarizes academic studies performed by others in a neutral way. I don't understand what makes it "just not encyclopedic".

<li><b>Comment</b>, yes it lists "resources" which can be from anywhere. Simply putting down a name and a title of an article without where the article was published does not make a resource verifiable and thus this is OR. See I can do it as well <i>Jersey Devil PhD.

<li>I understand your point, and I agree this this is probably a paper someone wrote. I think with cleanup by people who know psychology, it can be turned from a paper into an article. I'd like to see it around for sixty days to give a chance for cleanup, because the subject has merit per Not a paper encyclopedia and the other psychological relation articles. I'm not a fan of the article as is, but I see no reason to delete. <a href="../../../t/k/e/User%7ETKE_5ab7.html" title="User:TKE"><font color="maroon"><b>T</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/k/e/User_talk%7ETKE_bf64.html" title="User talk:TKE"><font color="gray"><b>K</b></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TKE_3c8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/TKE"><font color="maroon"><b>E</b></font></a> 03:25, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Some content in this article may be suitable for merging into other existing articles, but unless it is truly encyclopedic to have an article devoted solely to attractiveness, self-image and body-type preferences among JUST whites AND African Americans, this article should be deleted I believe. I mean, should we also have an article called "Attractiveness, Self-Image and Body-Type Preferences among Asians and Pacific Islanders"? I know, a little exagerated, but I think you get my point. I just don't think its encyclopedic to have an article for a non-notable study done on a non-notable subject. --<a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJake11_12df.html" title="User:Jake11">Berger</a> 03:51, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's my philosophy too, most of my voting history shows. As I said, I'm not a fan of the article but I do think this is rather quick for deletion, because it could be cleaned up.

<li><b>Comment.</b> I ask that you please, please don't consider precedent a reason for an AfD. With a thousand articles deleted every day through speedy, prod and here, context for the current situation is applicable. Sure, there are other middle school articles that may exsist because they escaped notice of the process, or notability exist (which isn't an official guideline either). Seriously, do you think <i>paraphrase</i> "Walker Elementary School in Oregon has a 1,000 students. They have education and sports" is the foundation for anything? <a href="../../../t/k/e/User%7ETKE_5ab7.html" title="User:TKE"><font color="maroon"><b>T</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/k/e/User_talk%7ETKE_bf64.html" title="User talk:TKE"><font color="gray"><b>K</b></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TKE_3c8d.html" title="Special:Contributions/TKE"><font color="maroon"><b>E</b></font></a> 00:20, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I certainly will consider precedent. I don't beleive in acting randomly. Over the last year there have been a huge number of school AFDs. The overwhelming bulk of schools (including ones like this) are kept. It's not "happen stance" that elem+middle schools are kept. It's the norm. Deletion is the exception, and almost always involves non-verifiability. <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Schools_for_deletion_archive_a17f.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Schools_for_deletion_archive_2005_b29c.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive/2005">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive/2005</a> shows the standard is it to keep all verifiable real K-12 schools (including elems and middle schools). Schools are in Wikipedia, because they are wanted, not because they "<i>escaped notice</i>". It is very intentional that school articles are created, and kept. Incidently, I don't vote to keep preschools normally, because I feel there is a clear precedent to delete them. I think we need to follow precedent, in order to provide reasonable and predictable results. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 01:48, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Can you please elaborate on this? It could well be the evidence we're looking for, but I'm afraid that I can't find "Eddie" listed in the <a href="http://www.birdhouse.org/beos/bible/toc.html" class="external text" title="http://www.birdhouse.org/beos/bible/toc.html" rel="nofollow">table of contents</a>. I would suggest that the interview you mentioned goes more towards establishing the notability of Pavel Císler than about any particular piece of software he created. Indeed, perhaps what we could do is to summarise the contents of this article and <b>merge</b> it into Pavel Císler—who does appear to be notable. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">GeorgeStepanek</a>\<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeStepanek_0414.html" title="User talk:GeorgeStepanek"><font color="gray">talk</font></a></sup> 00:50, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That TOC and the book beside me don't agree about contents in all cases so don't take it as canon, but its mentioned along with other text tools; during the text on Pe; during the StyledEdit section, and a few other places. --<a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 01:07, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The relevant guideline in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28software%29_dfdb.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (software)">Wikipedia:Notability (software)</a> requires that: <i>"The software has been verifiably the subject of non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the software developer, such as a major media news media, a book, a peer-reviewed scientific publication, or an article in a reputed technical magazine. A single such publication that is specifically about the software is sufficient; for publications that mention the software while not being specifically about them, and for publications of lower profile (such as a local newspaper or an e-zine), multiple such works are needed."</i> So this helps, but it would probably not be sufficient on its own. Do you know of any other references? I've done a Google search, but I coudn't find anything that appeared to meet these criteria. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">GeorgeStepanek</a>\<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeStepanek_0414.html" title="User talk:GeorgeStepanek"><font color="gray">talk</font></a></sup> 03:41, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I agree. An encyclopedia is a reference work that deals with all fields of knowledge. The word comes from the Greek words <i>enkyklios paideia</i> meaning "general education". All encyclopedias define at least some vocabulary terms and some even have embedded dictionaries (e.g., <i><a href="../../../e/n/c/Enciclopedia_universal_ilustrada_europeo-americana.html" title="Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana">Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana</a></i>). Besides, it is not a dictionary definition. See "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/good" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:good">good</a>" to see what a dictionary definition looks like.--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 03:40, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Keep votes like the ones above are why I could never, ever take Wikipedia seriously. We're disagreeing on fundamental definitions here, and if you don't know that adding a bunch of alternative spellings and trivial usage examples to a dictionary definition gets it no closer to being an encyclopedia article, well, I can't see agreeing with you guys on anything, even the color of the sky. Somebody might as well get rid of <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>, because it's not being followed at all here. I just hope the closing admin ignores the votes that go contrary to policy, but that happens only very rarely. We're on the slippery slope, people. Enjoy the ride down.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Right now this is no better than a dictionary entry, and I don't think it's a very notable phrase, but it's possible it will grow into a lengthy encyclopedic article detailing historical events/figures and controvery surrounding the phrase, etc., full of relevant citations and captions.

<p>Delete. I googled this term and found numerous different definitions for it, including transexual operations, sex toys, and mind control, but not the stated definition.

<li><b>Keep all</b>, parts of towns and cities are often far better populated and far more notable than many small villages, but for some reason villages don't seem to get AFD'd. I too have misgivings about a lot of geographical place articles, but it does seem rather unfair to single out <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. Given time and research, all of these topics have the potential to be good additions to the encyclopaedia. I for one would be very interested to know about the history, topography and demographics of each of these places. (Declaration of interest: I am from Edinburgh; but then so are nearly half a million other people, so there is a potential readership out there.) --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 09:13, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> all, places such as these are beyond the usual subjective nominations and debates appropriate for AfD.

<li><b>Strong keep all</b>. These are all verifiable and merit inclusion in an encyclopaedia. Many of these Edinburgh suburbs were distinct villages in their own right with significant history. Per comments above, over time they will come to be expanded into decent articles - <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colinton.html" title="Colinton">Colinton</a> is a good example (compare to original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colinton&amp;oldid=27267300" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colinton&amp;oldid=27267300" rel="nofollow">stub</a>).

<li>We'd be keeping these by default if they were still individual villages; it seems odd to delete them because they've grown! They all have potential for expansion - <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marchmont.html" title="Marchmont">Marchmont</a> or <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merchiston.html" title="Merchiston">Merchiston</a> are decent examples - and they're more definite areas than it might at first seem; Edinburgh is more clearly divided in this regard than many UK cities, IME. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 15:19, 16 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To follow through on my above comment - the only reason for nominating these seems to be that they're stubs. Areas of exactly comparable importance with fleshed-out articles seem to be acceptable - but the notability of something, and the suitability for an article, should be somewhat independent of what's currently been written. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 15:24, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>With this much support I have more faith that these articles really do have a future. When I was looking at the edit histories of some of them and saw they basically had creation and a stub edit, I was a bit worried. <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silverknowes.html" title="Silverknowes">Silverknowes</a> in particular got to me when the only thing it said about the place was that it had a golf course. But if this many Wikipedians really believe these articles have a future, then I have no problem with the articles. Is there a way to retract my nominations or something? It's doubtful that we'd have to wait a week to see the end results. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 19:54, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> i would say he is well known outside of DA - i wasn't aware that he is on DA or gfxartist at all. Actually i'd say that lots of people know his art without knowing it's from him. His gallery (currently offline - here's a partial mirror - <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050302232857/www.anry.ru/eng/gallery/gallery.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20050302232857/www.anry.ru/eng/gallery/gallery.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>) will come as first page (from 500k hits) on google just on search term 'anry' alone. If i'll have time, i'll try to lookup some russian sources on him, but my russian is not very good. I won't vote because i am inactive on wp for long time, i just thought you should know this.- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnyDog_85c7.html" title="User:JohnyDog">JohnyDog</a> 19:56, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That first result which pops up doesnt function and redirects to a webhosting service. Also a quick flick through some of the other results lead to other uses of the word anry (or in one case what seems to be another person using the same name). Yes he has other galleries featuring his work, but I could quite easily place some of my photos on multiple galleries and websites and use that to claim 'notability' for my work. What I think is the issue for these artists who have been tagged AfD is that although they may be extremely talented artists they lack further impact or notability beyond these websites which feature them. Bleedman and <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linda_Bergkvist_6679.html" title="Linda Bergkvist">Linda Bergkvist</a> havent been nominated and I think thats because their articles show that they have been published or involved in significant work beyond the production of work for these sites like <a href="../../../d/e/v/DeviantART_5bd3.html" title="DeviantART">DeviantART</a>. <a href="../../../t/y/h/User%7ETyhopho_61b0.html" title="User:Tyhopho">Tyhopho</a> 20:30, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Campaign is a bit strong. The category <b>advertises</b> that it's subjects are <b>not notable</b>, and I was about to go through the category and nominate those which are indeed nn myself. It's called cleaning up/enforcing our guidelines and policies, not a "campaign". --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 22:21, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The word "campaign" turns out to be more loaded than I intended. What I meant was, all of the articles were nominated at once (and, of course, in seven different spots), rather than determining the success of the category first. I'm not happy with that, as I'd rather not see a category used as the basis to delete an article. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Selinker_8b26.html" title="User:Mike Selinker">Mike Selinker</a> 04:14, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The disputed category is entirely redundant, as committing suicide and being related to a famous person does not make for a WP article, that comes from at least being involved in a newsworthy suicide, a different criteria altogether, plus the cat authors have admitted it is designed to contain non-notable people, and that they hope the articles within it will be used to conduct original research. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></b></a> 22:59, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You're asking whether I believe an article in a category defined as "non-notable people" passes a notability test? If it were part of a category called "The Kerrys" (as opposed to John Kerry), I'd vote to keep it in a heartbeat.

<dd>Sorry Mike, that's not how the project works. Individuals must satisfy the criteria at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, regardless of which category they have been put in, who they are related to or the reasons behind the creation of their article or its nomination for deletion. Voting "keep" when you do not believe a subject is inherently notable is usually a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, especially when trying to "save" an article or category you have created or edited. Information on notable individuals (including important events involving family members which have a bearing on the individual's life) should be "fleshed out" on their own page. However, I'm sure you've figured all this out for yourself by now. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></b></a> 16:29, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've been here for a while, Deiz, so among the things I've figured out for myself is that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a guideline, not policy. It's not the only reason an article might need separation from a main article. One reason might be to avoid clutter in a complex article. Another reason might be that the subject is not as significant as the main article. The notability test is one reason why you might believe an article should be deleted, but it isn't a reason that all users must follow for every article. Again, I didn't create any of these articles, but I think all (except maybe Daisy Keith, which is the stubbiest of stubs) are intriguing, and thus I vote to keep them (and thus try to categorize them in some useful way). Your mileage may vary.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Selinker_8b26.html" title="User:Mike Selinker">Mike Selinker</a> 19:22, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But if they alone don't meet the likes of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, then they don't merit an article of their own, so add their information to their notable relative's article. I'm not dismissing what you and Michael have identified as being pointless or uninteresting, but I don't think the framework of a general encyclopedia is the place to pursue it. Perhaps a third-party webpage or website linked to Wikipedia...? &#160;Regards, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Kernow_9a2b.html" title="User:David Kernow">David Kernow</a> 16:23, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BIO is indeed a guideline, and sometimes notable people don't fit, but I'm still wondering: what is the significance - or intrigue - of this piece? The suicide took place 22 years before John Kerry was born, and when Richard Kerry (who seems to have written one book and had a decent career as a diplomat) was six years old. If there was documented evidence that the event had affected the life of a notable person, this might be something. But there isn't, its still just a guy who killed himself and whose grandson would eventually run for President. There is is a very big difference between Fred Kerry and, for example, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheyenne_Brando_1032.html" title="Cheyenne Brando">Cheyenne Brando</a>, whose entire life was influenced by her relation to a celebrity, and whose newsworthy suicide has been linked to it. Mike, much love. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></b></a> 23:17, 17 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Y'know, that's a very good point, Deiz. It's possible my interest in this one is influenced by <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hannelore_Kohl_682f.html" title="Hannelore Kohl">Hannelore Kohl</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheyenne_Brando_1032.html" title="Cheyenne Brando">Cheyenne Brando</a>, which might be more interesting than this one. But this seems complete enough for at least me to be neutral on it.

<dd>As an aside, there has been a low level controversy over the nature of her relationship with Trotsky as of late. Some documents seem to suggest that she was mentally unstable at the end and had a crush on her father, which may have contributed to her suicide.

<li>The nomination is not ambigious; there is only one article up for deletion. However, there is absolutely no difference between Francophone and Ukrainophone except that the former is more widespread. The added cultural meaning of Francophone doesn't make it more encyclopedic; it just means that additional information should be added to the Wiktionary entry. It would be so nice if participants could show even a modicum of reason and try to discuss the matter itself instead of voting on every imaginable bureuacratic irrelevancy. I think we can decide on the merit of a single article without assuming that it creates a carte blanche for anyone who wants to zap all similar articles out of existence. / <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Isotalo_5ad2.html" title="User:Peter Isotalo">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPeter_Isotalo_e370.html" title="User talk:Peter Isotalo">Isotalo</a></sup></li>

<li>Well first off you're right, the francophone and ukrainophone articles do have the same information value, which is why I say that one should not be deleted if the other is not, simply for consistency’s sake. However the cultural value attached to them is <i>exactly</i> what makes them worthy of inclusion in the encyclopaedia or not. Why write about something that isn't "valuable"? My personal opinion is that the article on the Ukrainian language is too long (in fact it says so when you edit it). I think it should be split, and some of the information on geographical distribution moved here. The same could be done for francophone, etc. That would be much more useful than deleting this page. In other words I <b>oppose the deletion</b>. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevlar67_26f5.html" title="User:Kevlar67">Kevlar67</a> 12:51, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>All terms have "cultural value", even dictionary definitions. You could vote to keep any dictionary definition by claiming it has a certain cultural value. "Ukrainophone", though, seems to be so rare that it might very well be considered a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>.</dd>
<dd>That <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_language.html" title="Ukrainian language">Ukrainian language</a> is too big is not a valid excuse to start forks that have dubious encyclopedic value. There are countless ways to create sub-articles of main language articles (just look at any of the language <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">FAs</a>), but articles about the speakers as a group or a term for the sake of the term itself is not one of them. See <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geographic_distribution_of_Portuguese_c5f9.html" title="Geographic distribution of Portuguese">geographic distribution of Portuguese</a> for a precedent.</dd>
<dd>Please have a closer look at how language articles are written and keep in mind that none of "-phone" articles I'm aware of contain encyclopedic information (i.e. not just language usage) that wouldn't easily fit in the main language article or isn't already contained in them. I believe you should reconsider your vote.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: First of all this article is not copyrighted (if you could read the first sentence) and is rather promoted by a governmental institution to be published anywhere. If you think this article is biased, then it should also be illogical for the Wikipedia to have an article named "armenian genocide" online, since even the United Nations approve the fact that it cannot be named as "genocide" and therefore should be regarded as "allegations" only. Millions of people from tens of countries oppose the idea of so-called Armenian genocide by Ottomans. Also looking at the issue from a different point of view, half a million Muslim Ottoman citizens were also murdered by Armenians (not Russian, Italian, British or other forces in a war) and if there has been an Armenian genocide, then there surely is a Turkish Genocide by the Armenians. This article reflects the views of millions of Turks, including many Armenians of Turkish descent living freely and happily in Turkey. Its objectivity comes from the extensive proof and facts from the archives of tens of organizations and countries. <b>Therefore, deleting this article does not improve Wikipedia's credibility, but only diminishes its objective and neutral attitude. It is also a major offense for the memories of hundreds of thousands of Muslims, who have been murdered by Armenian terrorists 1914-1922, and their relatives. Having a debatable topic like "Armenian Genocide" but not allowing people to edit it is unbearable since some of that article is based on the fake documents and some doesn't even have a basis. Now, deleting this article for it opposes a debatable topic is neither a wiki-style nor a democratic/historical approach.

It links to the disputant sources in the Turkish Government already and has taken viewpoints of Turkish historians into account, so copying statements from the wholesale is unnecessary as well as being a major <i>faux pas</i>. One might consider renaming that article to <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Massacre_3a62.html" title="Armenian Massacre">Armenian Massacre</a> so as not to arouse a minority, but even the word 'massacre' is apparently disputed by one of the users involved in the edit war there, so it's best to draw a line in the sand to avoid editorial creep. Whatever the Armenians did to the Turks is covered elsewhere I'm sure, and does not detract from the reality of histoical events. Just because there are more Turks than Armenians doesn't mean they get to rewrite historiography! As a neutral European (with friends of Armenian and Turkish descent), I believe that nearly a century has passed, and these issues will be acknowledged by the Turks sooner or later. And even if that weren't such a huge inflammatory NPOV question, the article is also appallingly badly translated, has not been through the usual Wikipedia creation process, and the people who uploaded it don't seem to understand the GFDL. Are they in fact the copyright holders? Because if not, they cannot declare it GFDL, nor if it is public domain.

<li>I don't understand what is meant by "suggest final warning" above. I contest that the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> article is a good Wikipedia article as it stands. Confining myself to the issue at hand, the article is confused or confusing about the notion of "Turkish authorities", which are contrasted with "Turkish intellectuals". Are Turkish historians not Turkish intellectuals? Why are they lumped together with "authorities"? They may be authorities in their field of research, but that is not what you would normally understand "Turkish authorities" to mean. Why is Zeki Kuneralp quoted as an "authority", and quoted as if he spoke yesterday instead of more than 15 years ago, while the poor man, who has now been dead and buried for almost eight years, had then been retired for more than ten years? What is the subtext of the section heading "Political Arguments"? The excerpt or summary of the official position of the Republic of Turkey, although not entirely wrong, is quite incomplete. There are external links, but it is very difficult to navigate them to find reliable further details about the official position. Some people who have a strong point of view on the matter, from both sides, want to censor the presentation of some different points of view. I strongly believe that the viewpoints of <i>all</i> major players in this tragic, deep, and long-standing conflict should be reported accurately and comprehensively in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 19:15, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>So if I understand you guys correctly, because <i>you</i> don't agree with the position of the Turkish government on the issue, the information about that position should be withheld from other readers of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:44, 17 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Information about the position is not being withheld from readers. The identical text is linked to from <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html#Websites_opposing_the_genocide_theses" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide#Websites opposing the genocide theses</a> (third bullet point); there are 2000 words in section 4 alone describing the position of the Turkish authorities (that of national institutions of historians I think is hard to distinguish from that of the Government, since it is obvious that there is little academic freedom for historiographers, what with one person still on trial for this). The intention must be to produce one definitve article on the events, noting disagreements in the relevant places, in accordance with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. If section 4 doesn't represent the arguments in the link well, then a possible rewrite of it or new section 4.3 could be suggested at <a href="../../../a/r/m/Talk%7EArmenian_Genocide_0a21.html" title="Talk:Armenian Genocide">Talk:Armenian Genocide</a>. By 'final warning to users' I meant that an admin should take this in hand and make it very clear to him that uploading 160KB of someone else's undeited inflammatory propaganda and making or repointing a dozen redirects to it (which I've now listed on RfD) is not part of editing an encyclopaedia. I don't think either holocaust denial or raising awareness of massacres should be a crime, but if the user concerned doesn't get it and continues to disrupt, should they be banned like the similar user who blanked <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan.html" title="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a>? --<a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedders_7ad5.html" title="User:Cedders">Cedders</a> 23:30, 17 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Both sides produce inflammatory propaganda, but if you call <i>this</i> inflammatory propaganda you haven't seen much. Personally I think we should not have the debate here, or on <a href="../../../a/r/m/Talk%7EArmenian_Genocide_0a21.html" title="Talk:Armenian Genocide">Talk:Armenian Genocide</a>, but leave it to historians and record what they report. Loaded terms like "genocide" are inherently POV, and in particular terms such as "denial", implying that one side is "wrong", should be avoided. But I must confess (blush) I had overlooked the fact that that third bullet gives access to this "inflammatory propaganda", and therefore I have changed my vote to "delete". I think, however, that it is not given sufficient prominence or representation. For the record, the remaining defendant in the trial is a journalist, not a historian, and the charge, based on his criticism of a court decision, is insulting the Turkish judiciary and attempting to illegally influence a court case (where the latter carries a much higher penalty than the former). That is not to deny that such cases have a chilling effect, but I think the reason behind bringing charges has nothing to do with Armenian issues, but is really aimed at undermining the EU policy of the Turkish government. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 17:26, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep'</b> I think the article should be kept since it reflects different opinions based on facts and proofs on a topic that is highly debatable among the historians.

<li>Zucker says he <i>wants</i> to make the movie. Weinstein says he <i>wants</i> to make the movie. That's fine, but nevertheless, <b>it hasn't actually been started yet</b>. I'm not treating IMDb as the decision-makers, but it's a good indication that a project has started active pre-production, which SM5 hasn't.

<p>Response:</p>
<p>Although the article found by searching 'worwis' is in reference to a blog, it's deletion will not in any way benefit the primary aim of WikipediA.</p>
<p>As mentioned is the article, the sole aim of the blog is to benefit humanity, "whatever culture, race or religion".</p>
<p>I don't think it's a valid point if it's a "minor" website or not. It has a unique purpose and it's contents is different to that of any other article on Wikipedia. The level of uniqueness is such that it should be taken note of and assured it's small space on Wikipedia, as oppose to bieng deleted.</p>

<p>Kukini, what do you mean by "per nom", and also by this "unless updated to respond to WP:WEB issue"?</p>
<p>Thankyou</p>

<li>Hi StriveR. "per nom" just means he agrees with the nominator's reasoning for deletion (e.g. me). <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is a guideline for inclusion, which you need to read. Basically, what you need is to identify a number of reliable sources, who have written in depth, about the web site. You need to show that more people, then you, and the users, are interested in it. We need information about the site, that doesn't come from the site. Most web sites, don't meeet this requirement, and can't be listed on Wikipedia. It's probably best to use other places, besides Wikipedia, to list your web site. We don't include web sites based on how good they are. We write about web sites that are widely deemed "notable", which few are. Probably a tiny fraction of a percent of all web sites, could every be listed on Wikipedia. So, while you could try improving the article, there's no guarentee you're work wouldn't be lost. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 18:28, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>Thanks for help Thivierr and Kukini. I doubt many people have written their interest in depth or the like, but for me 26 google hits is quite high&#160;:-P. Anyway, please visit the site yourselves so that you may benefit atleast.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> StriveR, 26 hits is pretty far from high. The site doesn't appear to have much traffic and the article doesn't outline any level of notability. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 21:34, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello IrishGuy</p>
<p>I say 26 hits is high because I expected one if any. The people here may delete the article, but hopefully you can benefit from the website. All I wanted to do was to spread it and benefit people, but anyway hopefully different chances to come if this website isn't going to be much help.</p>

<p>How can it be "the sum of human knowledge" if you don't let people contribute such things? The blog itself was made for the sole aim to benefit as many as possible, so whats wrong with providing information about it's roots and the like?</p>
<p>Earlier today I ate a bowl of cereal. It was corn Chex. Up until me writing this...I was the only person in existence with this knowledge. Should that have an article as well?

<p>No, what you did shouldn't be included in Wikipedia. Thats because it has no aim to benefit people and is of no benefit anyway. The worwis blog however has hand-picked sayings of the widely known early leaders of Islam - but religious material has been filtered by myself so only the sayings which all can benefit from have a place on the blog. Take this for example: Imam Ali [AS] said: "Silence is the best reply to a fool." and "Be like the flower that gives its fragrance even to the hand that crushes it". Now I think thats worth a space on Wikiepdia.</p>
<p>Whoever deletes the article will put theirselves and others at loss from these beautiful sayings. Why don't you visit it now, because the point is that people like you benefit? br</p>

There are very notable sites that have no desire to educate or enrich people...but they are still notable. Your site isn't. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 16:59, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>By the sites rules it isn't notable but I think it should because of it's contents [but that's not the point here anyway]. I would of thought a different type of article would be nice to widen the and enrich the variety availible. But it is good, even if it is not set out and designed well, because it is purely words of wisdom. Anyone here can just go to it, be it only two or three people of whatever amount so you can be at an advantage, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Just take about three minutes browsing and reading abit Irishguy; I recommend you scroll down and read abit on the sixth blog down on the homepage [spaces.msn.com/worwis]. I'd just like to know what you think and your opinions if you don't mind.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, this article is important to Drake University students, and thus holds relevant for them. Peggy's is a student staple at Drake.

<li>Problem is, if this article is kept, then Drink (arguably the most popular nightclub in the area) and other Des Moines-area bars -- not to mention <b>millions</b> of neighborhood bars around the world -- could end up having their own articles. I drive by Peggy's every day on my way to work, and I'm aware of its popularity during the Drake Relays, but this article may be more suitable for a travel guide than an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../i/o/w/User%7EIowahwyman_bb9b.html" title="User:Iowahwyman">Iowahwyman</a> 00:05, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The creator of this page has tried to add a reference to it from the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_oil.html" title="Peak oil">Peak oil</a> page to disparage genuine science. At most it should be an alternate title for "back of an envelope" page which by the authors own admission was the original term and is in fact the more commonly used despite his affection for cocktail napkins. The creator's biography also states legal entanglements that would be affected by this article. The content of the article is also questionable as point of view. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonate_8add.html" title="User:Carbonate">Carbonate</a> 01:48, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Carbonate - you're free to criticise within reason - but this legal thing you mention - is that an inebriated rant - or if not what does it mean? As the "creator" I should hope I knew of any legal matters related to Peak prognostication. Also - do tell - what is the legitimate science in peak oil - note the entire argument turns on name-dropping, hero-worship and <a href="../../../f/u/d/FUD_f18b.html" title="FUD">FUD</a> - there is not a wit of hard science referenced in the entire piece to support even one of the 4 main tenants, the best we have is a scrap of paper scrawled upon by the great one. It's poor science, poor economics - classic Cocktail napkin science. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a> 02:18, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think it is ranting to draw attention to items mentioned on your own user page and if you are involved in some arbitration, it needs to be known by others if fair assessments are to be made. I will admit that I did not check the source of the comments on your user page and if they are inaccurate I apologize for bringing them to light here and suggest you make corrections. As to your references on the peak oil page, you should describe what is lacking in any of Hubbert's published works there rather than create a new page that says nothing relevant and linking to it. You clearly have not read much of the reference material on the peak oil page and I would direct you an easily obtained copy "Twilight in the Desert" by <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Simmons_d306.html" title="Matthew Simmons">Matthew Simmons</a> who references and digests thousands of papers from the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_Petroleum_Engineers_d599.html" title="Society of Petroleum Engineers">Society of Petroleum Engineers</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonate_8add.html" title="User:Carbonate">Carbonate</a> 09:55, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I would argue that even if I were an axe-murderer passing caesarean-encrypted edits through from exile in Bahrain - it would have little to do with the subject of science and whether or not some science really isn't science after the Galilean/Newtonian tradition of empirical and repeatable first-person observation - Indeed, you, my gentle friend, whether you acknowledge it or not, are a product of the enlightenment, and if you had any idea of the personal lives of the icons under whose intellectual umbrella you, and I both take shelter, you might be tempted to run rabidly back into the rain. I suggest politely that it really is inappropriate to rant against a position by attacking the messenger - of which I suggest, you know only a fractional portion of the precious little there is to know. While I am active in the legal sphere, my legal interests have to do with eliminating predatory advertising on public property and nothing whatsoever to do with Peak Oil (which could hardly get into court - there being no evidence on which to base a claim). Moreover, I believe that I did discuss my concerns re Peak Oil as so many have, and my observation is that one point of view has been permitted to dominate the article at the expense of the reader. While I am as concerned as the next about the humanitarian issues surrounding energy, I try not to allow my zeal to confuse the line between belief and science.

<li><b>Comment</b> It appears that Napkin and Envelope are exchangeable terms, with Napkin being the modern equivalent of the older Envelope, and that the variation of the phrase from Back of Envelope, Back of Napkin, Calculation, Physics etc are abundant with at least two books combining envelope or napkin with physics or science. True, these variations are not stable and singular within the language; however in all their variety they share the common meaning of a rough estimation of some scientific conjecture.

<li><b>Another Comment</b> Perhaps it makes sense to merge into <a href="../../../b/a/c/Back-of-the-envelope-calculations.html" title="Back-of-the-envelope-calculations">Back-of-the-envelope-calculations</a> which is presumable the original phrase - but I also think the phrase Napkin Science - refers to something related but distinct. I also think this particular form of the expression may be fairly deemed a colloquialism - however, the principle of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cargo_cult_science.html" title="Cargo cult science">Cargo cult science</a> is important, and I see evidence that Fermi's Napkin is being merged with Feynman's <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cargo_cult.html" title="Cargo cult">cult</a> to accurately describe that branch of pseudo-science which achieves social importance prior to rigorous experimentation. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a> 02:03, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'd like to nominate this for deletion for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The list is so long that both Firefox 1.0 and latest IE hang for a long time while trying to display the page (on a 3GHz PC with 1GB RAM). This is extremely annoying and makes Wikipedia appear unprofessional.</li>
<li>If this was addressed by splitting the page into many smaller lists by letter, it becomes even harder to maintain. If this AFD fails I think it should be split in that way, though, to at least address the browser issue.</li>
<li>There is very little encyclopedic value to this article.</li>
<li>It is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. I'm aware of the arguments that the entries are easily verified, but show me another list on the subject and I'll accept it's not OR.</li>
<li>It is unknown how many songs are actually missing that should be included.</li>
<li>I find it hard to see situations where this would be useful.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm not a deletionist or inclusionists. I don't like such labels and I don't think they have any place on Wikipedia. But I do think that this article is plain silly. I acknowledge that people have put a fair amount into compiling this list, but frankly this fact does not make the article any more useful.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> There are many articles on Wikipedia in which I have no interest. That doesn't mean they should be deleted. Mosts lists are incomplete, and it's not ideologically unsound for this to be the same (if it were a 'serious' topic, then the incompletedness would be an issue). Its size suggests that there are sufficient people interested in it. If it is unmanagable, then split it up. If you feel you wouldn't like to attempt that, then leave it to someone else. It has already survived twice: accept consensus. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS">The JPS</a> 15:33, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Wikipedia is not a data mining operation. There are an infinite number of ways we could divide up the sum total of all songs ever written - how about the songs whose titles do appear in the lyrics, the songs whose titles appear N times in the lyrics, etc? Obviously we can't have them all, so we have to just pick a few. But who decides which are the most important ways to divide up and list songs by arbitrary criteria? I think Wikimedia projects should provide the raw material for researchers to create their own custom lists along these lines, but leave the original research to the researchers. A wiki-datamining project would be interesting, come to think of it... but this isn't the place for it. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowersofnight_dd24.html" title="User:Flowersofnight">flowersofnight</a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFlowersofnight_468d.html" title="User talk:Flowersofnight">(talk)</a> 18:47, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per The JPS. Moreover, why does the phrase "original research" pop up every single time a list is NfD? Wikipedia articles are not supposed to be carbon copies of existing works of literature, either in content or in concept. And anyway, it doesn't take much research to discover that a given song doesn't contain the title in its lyrics. -- <a href="../../../s/m/j/User%7ESmjg_a789.html" title="User:Smjg">Smjg</a> 19:42, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the OR claim is that the characteristic of being a song whose title does not appear in its lyrics is somehow notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> for the following reasons.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Everyone is saying this list is arbitrary, however, isn't much of the less "official" stuff on Wikipedia the same? For example, many songs by many bands somehow merit their own encyclopedic entry, with seemingly no "encyclopedic value" to back them up. I cite <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Final_Cut_%28song%29_077b.html" title="The Final Cut (song)">The Final Cut</a> and <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smile_Like_You_Mean_It_4352.html" title="Smile Like You Mean It">Smile Like You Mean It</a>, among others. On a similar note, I will cite <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, and all of the year entries, which were seemingly created just for the hell of adding an entry that tells us what happened in that year. Arbitrarily done.</li>
<li>In reference to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> and the years, as mentioned above, these are similar lists. Extremely long, ridiculous to read in one sitting anyway, and serving no purpose, just as people say about this list.</li>
<li>Also on the same note, articles on dates, such as <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_10.html" title="January 10">January 10</a> are the same ridiculous pointlessness.</li>
<li>Who can feasibly manage any large article? If you are going to be on that bandwagon, who can manage an article such as <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number.html" title="Number">Number</a>, which is large, and yet still there. And it is also split up, and yet it's there.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In conclusion, I just don't get deleting the article. Especially, as per above, if the consensus has kept it on for two times already.--<a href="../../../l/j/l/User%7ELjlego_3be3.html" title="User:Ljlego">Ljlego</a> 02:26, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To address Ljlego's points:</dd>
<dd>1) Saying "We have an article on Crappy topic A, therefore Crappy topic B is fine" is not good enough. Digging up any old junk on Wikipedia and using it as an excuse to let more rubbish in does not do the 'pedia any good. Perhaps "Crappy topic A" should not be there either, just nobody's got around to deleting it yet.</dd>
<dd>2,3) If you're looking for examples of long, boring lists to illustrate your point, you could not have made a worse choice than the year and date entries. They're featured on the main page, occasioanlly quoted in newspapers, and are clearly interesting.</dd>
<dd>4) The <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number.html" title="Number">Number</a> article is large, but it's of a very high standard and is well maintained. It's also not likely to get much bigger. The song list is extremely large, it's just a dumping ground for essentially identical info, and there's no indication that its growth is slowing. And the bigger it gets the less meaningful the contents. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyk_0a6a.html" title="User:Reyk">The El Reyko</a> 03:34, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm confused. This *is* a list of songs with titles not in the lyrics. It would be kind of pointless to include instrumental songs in the list, as they do not have lyrics and all of them would qualify. Kotepho 16:24, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Non-notable by American and Western standards? Isn't this Wikipedia site for global viewing? The importance of the article was asserted by the act of simply moving it in order to protect it.There are people who genuinely want to know what is going on in the Pacific. It is very unfortunate that this article had to be moved to keep from becoming a victim of "speedy deletion" in the first place.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Just because there are articles on other terms qualifying the words <i>"atheist"</i> and <i>"agnostic"</i> doesn't mean <i>"agnostic atheism"</i> is anything more than a neologism. (There might be grounds for AfDing those other articles for similar reasons, by the way). Second, the first link you cite states <i>"agnostic atheism"</i> is synonymous with <i>"weak atheism"</i>, which would be grounds for merging the two articles. Looking through the sources on your second link shows that there is no consistent usage of this term. It really does seem like a neologism that people make up to fit whatever theory they seem to be pursuing at the time. If the article itself was better sourced as to where they got their information from I'd have less issues with it, but as it stands it's still <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">noosphere</a> 02:40, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Jeandré, your point seems to be that the term <i>"agnostic atheism"</i> is used outside Wikipedia. I am aware of this. However, it still seems to be a neologism for several reasons. First, it's not in any dictionary I'm aware of (apart from online dictionaries that use Wikipedia as their source). Second, the outside sources that do use the term <i>"agnostic atheism"</i> do not say where they got it, so that makes me suspect they just coined it; a suspicion that is confirmed by the relatively few hits this term gets. Searching google for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=atheism+-wikipedia&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=atheism+-wikipedia&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" rel="nofollow">atheism -wikipedia</a>" returns over 9 million hits, "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=xPK&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=agnosticism+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=xPK&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=agnosticism+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">agnosticism -wikipedia</a>" returns almost 2.5 million hits, while "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=I4e&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22agnostic+atheism%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=I4e&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22agnostic+atheism%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">"agnostic atheism" -wikipedia</a>" returns only about 12 thousand hits. Third, the term is used inconsistently: in this article one of the doctrines of <i>"agnostic atheism"</i> is supposedly that <i>"knowledge of the existence and nonexistence of deities is irrelevant or unimportant"</i> while the article you quote says nothing of the sort. Finally, and most importantly, this article is completely unsourced. Where did they get these definitions? Beats me, because there isn't a single reference. As such, it violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and should be deleted accordingly (though copying it to the <i>"weak atheism"</i> talk page before deletion is also acceptable). -- <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">noosphere</a> 02:27, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is an established term which appeared in print at least 25 years ago and is widely used together with weak and strong atheism.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I believe <i>"weak atheism"</i> and <i>"strong atheism"</i> are also neologisms, but let's take one neologism at a time. Anyway, whether or not this particular neologism has appeared in print <i>"at least 25 years ago"</i> (can you provide a reference for that, by the way?), the fact is that that says nothing about this article's violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.

<dd>Sure. Sue Townsend had her character Adrian Mole describe himself as an "agnostic atheist" in 1982, in "The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole". The first Google groups hit for "agnostic atheism" is <a href="http://groups.google.co.uk/group/alt.atheism/msg/450f912ca8c65c63?dmode=source&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.co.uk/group/alt.atheism/msg/450f912ca8c65c63?dmode=source&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">this alt.atheism post from 1991</a> - they've been discussing "agnostic atheism" for *fifteen years*. Now those are not valid sources in themselves, but combined with the detailed outside sources you dismissed above, which do use and define the term, it certainly starts to look less and less like a neologism. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVashti_aa77.html" title="User:Vashti">Vashti</a> 19:51, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<blockquote>
<p>...We might as well define "agnostic" while we're at it, since there is a similar division of usage. I call a "soft agnostic" one who says: "I don't know whether there is a God or not." A "hard agnostic" is one who says: "The proposition `There is a God' is undecidable." Robert Green Ingersoll (1833-1899), the great 19th-century freethought orator, took the hard agnostic position when he said: "The Agnostic does not simply say, `I do not know.' He goes another step and says with great emphasis that you do not know." George H. Smith uses the term "agnostic atheist" for this position. He uses the term "agnostic theist" for a person who "believes in the existence of god, but maintains that the nature of god is unknowable." Yet another position, taken by Alfred Jules Ayer (author of LANGUAGE, TRUTH AND LOGIC, copyright 1936) and many skeptics, is: "The statement `There is a God' doesn't make sense, since the term `God' is undefined or incoherent." Such people do not call themselves agnostics, since they clarify the definition of the hard agnostic given above by expanding it to "The proposition `There is a God' is significant and it is neither true nor false: it is undecidable."...</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Deleting this article would certainly set a dangerous precedent for the continuity of philosophical articles since all philosophy is original "research". Using the criterion at <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, we could legitimately strip most religious articles since much of the information in those articles originate from disreputable sources, such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Holy_Bible_70c7.html" title="The Holy Bible">The Holy Bible</a> which has been translated innumerable times by only God knows how many people. Should we limit such religious articles to only discussions occurring in academic journals? I've seen some really crazy flame wars in academic journals. They're not exactly the pinnacles of authority.

I'm not an expert on determining the spread of a word; however, I think this is certainly something worth looking into.

Boolean searches were conducted to strip results that mentioned "Wikipedia". You cannot find some terms and subjects through any search engine or in any dictionary. Knowledge of these subjects and words would necessitate access to private libraries or subscriptions to extremely expensive academic journals. Esoteric subjects are inherently noteworthy for encyclopedic inclusion. The appearance of a deficiency of information about a subject should prompt further inquiry about the subject instead of blunt opposition to the subject's inclusion.

<p><i>[crazy indenting, let's start over]</i></p>
<p>But your own quotes disprove what you're saying, <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">noosphere</a>. <i>"If an article topic has no reputable sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic"</i> doesn't mean that an article with no sources listed can be removed, it means that an article <b>for which no sources can be found</b> should be removed. It's not talking about the article, it's talking about the topic, the subject itself. Like saying "we all know Tony Blair is a reptile, but the reputable sources won't print it" - there are no reputable sources for that and it doesn't merit inclusion as fact. We've provided you with several reputable sources, but this is not enough. As for <i>"material that is challenged and has no source may be removed by any editor</i>, I've never thought that was about deleting articles, but about removing material from articles. Read for context. I've already shown you the recommendation to add {{unsourced}} to unsourced articles from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>; how about these quotes from <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"You can add sources even for material you didn't write if you use a source to verify that material. Adding citations to an article is an excellent way to contribute to Wikipedia."</i> - this directly contradicts your claim that nobody can prove what the original author was thinking; facts don't need telepathic verification.</li>
<li><i>"Disputed text can immediately be removed entirely <b>or moved from the article to the talk page for discussion. If the disputed text is harmless, and you simply feel a citation is appropriate, place {{fact}} (or {{citation needed}}) after the text."</b></i> - again, improve, don't delete.</li>
<li>Where I think you may have got mixed up a little: <i>"Unsourced criticism or negative material <b>in the biographies of living persons should be removed immediately</b>, and not moved to talk.</i> - this article is not a biography of a a living person.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, this article has many quotes, which I don't doubt.

<li><b>Delete</b> — To me the content looks like mostly non-neutral, personal editorial "research" that employs technical jargon and quotations from Einstein to provide an aura of credibility. It is an awkward read that doesn't really clarify anything with respect to "aether" IMO.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'd swear I've seen this stuff before in another article article. I've asked <a href="../../../e/r/k/User%7EErkDemon_282e.html" title="User:ErkDemon">ErkDemon</a> to fix problems with several articles (or rather, disorganized notes for articles) which he has started and apparently abandoned. In this one, buried in the sand I see some hints of one side of a multifaceted and subtle but notable topic, related to issues which are sometimes discussed under the heading of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mach%27s_principle.html" title="Mach's principle">Mach's principle</a>. But I think we all agree that <i>this "article" is not an article at all, but rather disorganized jottings which apparently represent Erk's attempt to start writing an essay promoting his somewhat idiosyncratic views.</i> (In this sense, I agree with Pjacobi that Erk's version of this article violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.) Another article by Erk, <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objections_to_general_relativity.html" title="Objections to general relativity">Objections to general relativity</a> obviously suffers from similar problems, and upon closer reading also proves to be wandering, repetitive, and to entirely ignore a host of equally important objections to gtr.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Here is my <i>alternative proposal:</i> I propose we
<ol>
<li>move this and <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objections_to_general_relativity.html" title="Objections to general relativity">Objections to general relativity</a> to <a href="../../../e/r/k/User%7EErkDemon_282e.html" title="User:ErkDemon">Erk</a>'s user space as User:ErkDemon/Aether and general relativity and User:ErkDemon/Objections to general relativity respectively,</li>
<li>leave a polite message on his talk page encouraging him to develop his thinking in this sandbox,</li>
<li>demand that he seek some peer review <i>before</i> moving anything back to article space.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I propose this because I suspect Erk is struggling to organize his thoughts; I think he's put more work into these protoessays than may appear from their inchoate state. But he does need to recognize that they are still very much at a sandbox stage, far from ready to present to the world even as essays, much less as reasonably unbiased encyclopedia articles. Also, of course, <i>essays</i> should go on his personal web pages, or in his user space at the very most. I do think <i>it should be possible to write genuine encyclopedia articles on each of these topics</i>, but I don't know whether Erk should be trying to do that himself since he seems to have rather narrow and idiosyncratic views. I also wish he understood that you can't even write an essay by quotations out of context, much less an encyclopedia article.</dd>
<dd>If the rest of you think my proposal is impractical, I'll change my vote to <b>delete</b> at least Aether and general relativity since I certainly don't think we can permit "articles" in such a sorry state as these to hang around indefinitely without substantial improvement. ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 07:29, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No hard objections to <i>userfy</i>, even it means we have to face new round of discussions in the future.

<dd>I agree that in its current state it doesn't seem very useful, at least for me. However in principle an article on this topic could be useful, as whether there is an ether in our world is a current topic of data-driven active debate (there's the blueshift of the <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_microwave_background.html" title="Cosmic microwave background">cosmic microwave background</a> giving a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preferred_frame.html" title="Preferred frame">preferred frame</a>, and then the <a href="../../../o/h/_/Oh_my_god_particle.html" title="Oh my god particle">ultra high energy cosmic rays</a> that again point to frame-dependent physics). On the other hand, while these involve the real world they aren't built into <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a>. General relativity is pretty clear cut, it comes with a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metric_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Metric (mathematics)">metric</a> that transforms covariantly and whether you want to call this <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mach%27s_principle.html" title="Mach's principle">Mach's principle</a> or an <a href="../../../a/e/t/Aether.html" title="Aether">aether</a> is a matter of semantics or <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> – This seems to be an odd situation: Aether theories <i>are</i> of historical interest, and historical comparisons of various types of aether model <i>would</i> seem to be legitimate: general relativity is of interest: discussions of relativity theory often say that aether theory(ies) are known to be disproved. And yet, we have an article by Einstein (currently in print, verifiable, in paperback), declaring general relativity as being effectively a special class of aether theory.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I would have thought that the existence of this Einstein article and its "gist" was worth documenting, if only because GR people seem to have a habit of insisting that Einstein said no such thing, until they are confronted with quotes. Provide a quote, and one tends to be told that it's been taken out of context. Provide a much larger quote to make it obvious that one isn’t quoting selectively, and other objections appear. Ask the critic if they have ever actually 'read' the article that they say is being misrepresented, and you tend not to get an answer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The idea discussed in the article 'is' idiosyncratic to modern eyes, but the argument was Einstein's, not mine. As for the idea of getting the thing peer reviewed, well, thew wiki rules say that the criteria for inclusion are about verifiability rather than correctness, and even if you think that Einstein was off his rocker at the time, you can still buy the documentary evidence of what he said at your local university bookshop.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>CH:</i> re "quotations out of context", both quotations were Einstein's one was from "Aether and the theory of relativity" lecture (1920), and the other was from "Relativity and the problem of space: The concept of space in the general theory of relativity": Both Einstein quotes were VERY much in context: if you are claiming otherwise, I suggest that you find something to back up this assertion: I don’t think that you can. I've seen the "out of context" objection used a lot in the past, speciously, as a way of objecting to something that ios both factual and verifiable, presumably in the hope that other readers might take it on trust that it 'is' out of context, without actually checking. Perhaps a better article on Einstein's argument could be written, but complaining that it includes too much of Einstein's actual words seems to be an odd thing to do, since Einstein's writing is quite efficient, and putting words in his mouth doesn't seem efficient when the actual quotes are available.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as Wiki editors with "bees in their bonnets" about certain issues, well, I notice C.H., that you still seem to be managing to insist, in almost every article that you comment on, that it really ought to be rewritten to be more about Mach's Principle! If I sound like a stuck record on certain topics, then so do you! Please, don't keep telling everyone else to write articles the about Mach's Principle that you want to read – do some work, write it yourself and let the rest of us get some peace!&#160;:) I keep reading on Wiki that you could write better articles on some of these subjects yourself, but that your time is too valuable ... well, perhaps for the rest of us, our time is valuable too ... so I'd suggest that in these cases perhaps if you can write the article, do, if you can't, don't. The "Oh dear, this article is very bad, I could do much better, but unfortunately I'm very busy so the person ought to do more work to bring it up to my exacting standards" bit begins to wear a bit thin after a while.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You should also note that using the vfd page for one article to suggest and discuss the possible deletion of another by the same author is probably bad practice: discussions about whether an article should be deleted should be visible to users browsing that article, so that they have a chance to enter the debate, and discussions about deleting an article should properly only concern themselves with the article's contents, not the identity of the author.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Having said all that, I'm voting to delete my own article because by Dec 2005 I'd gotten sick of all the anonymous personal attacks on Wiki, and decided that this wasn't somewhere I wanted to hang out any more, so I don’t intend to expand or improve any of these articles any further, and as far as I'm concerned, you can delete all of them.</dd>

<p><b>Delete.</b> I don't find it as much more than a vanity article; it is a small community that has few active people and the article is short on information on them in my opinion because there is little if anything of note to say about them. The rest of the information on the page is more a candidate for merging with the 'Criticisms of Wikipedia' page than a seperate article. <a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardry_Dragon_6d1a.html" title="User:Wizardry Dragon">Wizardry Dragon</a> 22:17, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep.</b> The majority of those who have contribute to the page have no afiliation with Creationwiki. The article has been modified many times by veteran editors, so I don't think any vanity remains, if any was present.

<li><b>Comment</b> So far the only mentions I have found are various miscelaneous passing references, such as here: <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/oldearth1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.religioustolerance.org/oldearth1.htm" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> which brings up another reason to possibly keep the article. Many people seem to be under the incorrect impression that CreationWiki is somehow associated with Wikipedia. Having an article on CreationWiki that says that that is false is helpful. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:37, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I think we need to avoid deleting articles in what might appear to be a partisan matter. I don't regard this article as a vanity article.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> miserably. The reason we want multiple independent sources to write aobut something, is we need those sources, to have in-depth neutral article. This page can't say anything meaningful. It can just repeat what CreationWiki says, as that's about the only source of information available (obviously a non-neutral source). Notice please, that the "Criticisms of CreationWiki" section is *entirely* unsourced. It refers to "Critics of CreationWiki", but doesn't say who those critics are, or where those criticisms were published. I suggest those "critics" are the very Wikipedian(s) who wrote that section. This is such a minor web site, that almost no publisher of note, either knows or cares enough to write about this very minor site. Removing all unsourced stuff, will leave behind, a rather pathetic substub. -<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 19:36, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> While i agree the article doesn't meet the WP:WEB guidelines, they are just that, guidelines. In this case we are dealing with a controversial topic that I think most of us do not take seriously, but has high political impact, at least in the U.S. Stretching things a bit to maintain neutrality may be appropriate here. I'd also call attention to footnote 2 of the guideline. I think a case can be made that the parent organization, Northwest Creation Network, is notable enough for an article and that, at worst, this page should be moved to that title.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 12:47, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As a "rival" to WP's pages on the same topics, it seems sensible for WP to maintain an article on it.

<li><b><s>Weak</s> delete</b>. Listing a blog as an external link is a great indication of a vanity promotion and lack of credibility. None of the members of the band or albums produced assert any notability, and the bands they have toured with also lack importance; so I don't think who they've toured with in this case has any implications on the assertion of their notability. I favor deletion unless the article is immediately cleaned-up to show the band's credibility as an encyclopedic article of interest.
