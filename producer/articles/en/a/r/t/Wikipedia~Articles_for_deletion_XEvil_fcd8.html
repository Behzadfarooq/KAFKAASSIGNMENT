<ul>
<li>Well, you've proven the game exists. That was never in question. Have a look at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, they explain what is the right kind of source. hings like proper media mentions, reviews, things of that sort, not brief descriptions of what the game is and a download button. (I'm trying to be helpful BTW.) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 21:44, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well people don't care about things unless they cost money, for the simple reason that there's always a catch, and costing money is usually it (hence lack of reviews). Therefore, most free games without a catch don't bring regular attention since it's the media's job (in America at least, the place I'm searching from) to show us the terrible and awful things about our world. In the case of video games, the game needs to be conterversal and a scapegoat of how awful video games are (to hit the target audiance of people who want videogames gone), a category which this game doesn't fit. In the case of PC game World, it is published media with a description of the game and I thought that would be enough. If that isn't enough, which to you it probably isn't, just go ahead and <s><b>delete</b></s> it. I'm tired of fighting a losing battle. But make no mistake, I'm not convinced and probably never will be that this should be deleted. I'll also hope that when you said "I'm trying to be helpful" you're not being "sarcastic or ironic in an AfD" since I usually assume some sort of good faith (you know what happens when you assume). Since "a topic is notable if it has been been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself." I'll wait until another published company has a writeup about it, and now the multiple published works part will be true. Until then, it will be deleted.

<ul>
<li>Easy, I honestly wasn't being sarcastic. I was just making a suggestion for what is really needed in the article. If something like I had suggested was found, I would be quite happy to change my stance. I understand what your saying, and I believe people are working on clarifying metters on games such as this, because like you say, free games get very little (if any) media coverage, but could well be notable. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 23:17, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well even if I can convince you, few people who have voted come back and see how the comments and discussion are going, so I don't think I could convince the other delete voters to change their mind. However, since other people have voted keep I think I will change my vote to <b>keep</b>, and I'll do my best to clean up the article.--<a href="../../../c/l/y/User%7EClyde_Miller_83b6.html" title="User:Clyde Miller">Clyde Miller</a> 01:25, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> (was keep til I noticed the guideline said MULTIPLE) I've played this game for the past 5 years regularly. Lots of people know about it, but wikipedia is bureacracy and is about following the rules. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28computer_and_video_games%29_2db7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (computer and video games)">Wikipedia:Notability_(computer_and_video_games)</a>, does this article meet any of the criteria? Has the game has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the creator of the game: The underdogs is the only real review of the game, I suggest everyone actually read it if they voted on it. Has the game has won an award from a notable award-giving body independent of the game creators, sponsors, and publishers? No, but it has an underdogs award but is underdogs notable? Has the game been converted to other media? No. So it fails 2 of the 3 guidelines but the guidelines say you only need 1 of these. Thus is underdogs trustable? <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_of_the_Underdogs_b786.html" title="Home of the Underdogs">Home_of_the_Underdogs</a> seems to be notable enought to be included on Wikipedia but there are policies against using inclusion as an argument. <b>So the question is, is underdogs notable?</b> What are other sources which document free and old games are there any more notable than underdog? I think I'll side on keep just to be safe. --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuirex_283a.html" title="User:Quirex">Quirex</a> 20:29, 30 November 2006 (UTC) Note I looked and the guidelines said multiple sources so no I'm changing my vote to <b>Weak Delete</b>. Wikipedia policy forces the vote. --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuirex_283a.html" title="User:Quirex">Quirex</a> 20:34, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree - the Underdogs article was the only decent review I could find. If you look at the links provided by Clyde Miller, you'll also see two tiny reviews on PC World and About.com, both of which are clearly appropriate sources. As I said, the reviews themselves are so small (bordering on inconsequential) that I can't really quibble much with a delete vote. I'm on the fence myself, but I think that the cited sources arguably satisfy policy. So, I defaulted to a weak keep. -<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">ave</a>)</i> 23:52, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well the "<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28computer_and_video_games%29_2db7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (computer and video games)">policy</a>" you citied says "The following is a proposed Wikipedia policy, guideline, or process. The proposal may still be in development, under discussion, or in the process of gathering consensus for adoption. References or links to this page should not describe it as "policy"." Since that means that a source doesn't have to be a giant review, PC World (published) should be ok (that makes multiple sources). Also <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability</a> is under discussion, so I'm not sure how much we should trust that. Right now I'm not sure good how good of an idea it is to vote based on policys under discussion or proposed policys. Just my two cents--<a href="../../../c/l/y/User%7EClyde_Miller_83b6.html" title="User:Clyde Miller">Clyde Miller</a> 23:59, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I went through and read all of the article's references. The PC World link is just a trivial description of the source which is so small it probably could've come from the README or the .lsm file itself. The PC World is trivial and thus it really has no bearing as a reliable link. Thus it still unfortunately lacks multiple non-trivial sources. Is there a PC World article which links to that PC World Article? --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuirex_283a.html" title="User:Quirex">Quirex</a> 00:39, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I went through a lot of google hits, and I have to admit that I couldn't find any reviews that were clearly non-trivial (other than Underdogs). Every other mention of the game is of the 1-2 paragraph variety. Some of them do appear to be legitimate (albeit semi trivial) reviews rather than something coming from the developers <a href="http://www.gamezworld.de/showentry.php?ID=578&amp;lang=e" class="external text" title="http://www.gamezworld.de/showentry.php?ID=578&amp;lang=e" rel="nofollow">e.g.</a>. You almost got me to teeter over the line to a weak delete, but it's now an OK article as rewritten, so I'm sticking with my weak keep so long as there's a non-trivial rationale for notability. -<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">ave</a>)</i> 04:45, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
