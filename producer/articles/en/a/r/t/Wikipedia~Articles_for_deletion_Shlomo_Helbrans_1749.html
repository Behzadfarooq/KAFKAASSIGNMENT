<li>Shira: That is a very shallow and "based on technicalities" type of perspective. So any guy with a beard who looks like a Hasid and gathers around him a few dumb suckers can get to call himself a "Rebbe" (and to the world-at-large <i>all</i> the Hasidim look like "rabbis") and if that "Hasid/rabbi/Rebbe" was reported for crimes they are worthy of articles on Wikipedia on such ridiculously based arguments that his actions were reported over and over again in the media? So then, do we go and look up all the police <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blotter.html" title="Blotter">blotters</a> and the daily crimes section in local papers and if it involves someone who looks Hasidic, he thus <i>ergo</i> is turned into a "notable" and "verifiable" "rabbi" on Wikipedia 'cause Wikipedia has "magical rules" (like <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magical_thinking.html" title="Magical thinking">magical thinking</a>???) that can make "something out [a] nothing" (somewhat in a self-presumed God-like fashion, no?) I do wish we could all keep perspective in cases like this and not simply revert to spouting "the rules" when some good common sense should come first. Many people from all walks of life have verifiable information from multiple sources available yet they do not merit article/s on Wikipedia, just see the daily toll on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> to prove it.

<li>He is a notable and verifiable individual, nothing more. The article should definitely reflect that his claim to be a legitimate rabbi, run a legitimate Hassidic sect, etc. are disputed if this can be <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliably sourced</a>) as well as other <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliably sourced</a> criticism of his activities. If the dispute is extensive, I would certainly agree the intro should be reworked and should not present him as being a rabbi etc. without referring to a dispute. But all this is about the content, not about whether the topic is encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 17:00, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Shira: He is only notable because the media latched onto him. There is nothing notable about him <i>per se</i> -- not as a "rabbi" not as a leader of Jews, not as anything, just a scumbag. There are literally thousands of legitimate and notable <a href="../../../s/h/t/Shtiebel.html" title="Shtiebel">shtiebel</a> <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebbe.html" title="Rebbe">Rebbes</a> with hundreds of congregants each yet there are no articles about them, nor should there be. Simply because someone has been written up in the papers for accused misdeeds does not make that person notable. Not every petty thief and pickpocket deserves articles merely because it's gotten into the papers and is available online in multiple articles and links. Wikipedia should not reflect a false sense of reality by misapplication of the "rules" Shira. Wikipedia should have article about a subject if and when that subject is truly notable in and of their fields. Helbrans is neither a "rebbe" nor is he anything. At most he maybe gets to be on something like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish-American_mobsters_f711.html" title="List of Jewish-American mobsters">List of Jewish-American mobsters</a>, and I don't think that Helbrans makes the cut for that either since he is small fry, and if that's your cup of tea, then it's a sad day for Wikipedia and lovers of knowldege. Finally, <b>Helbrans fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> since no-one writes "biographies" about nobodies</b>. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 12:47, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While I couldn't agree with you more that "He is only notable because the media latched on to him." But unfortunately, that's the definition of notability Wikipedia has. Wikipedia's decision to use news media coverage as a criterion for notability produces just this result: A person or a band or a video game or a brand of chewing gum is notable because the media latches on, regardless of any intrinsic merit or value (or lack thereof) it may have. This may be unfortunate, but Wikipedia has thousands of articles on people and topics that are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiably</a> notable for what might seem to me to be no good reason. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 19:18, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't think WP has the capability of judging among the various Hasidic sects, or the ethical merit of their Rabbis. . <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:38, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hi DGG: While "Wikipedia" may not have the "capability" to judge -- yet <b>knowledgeable editors</b> about the subject of rabbis, Jews and Judaism, do have this capabilty. If someone were to say that <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_ce9b.html" title="Flat Earth">the Earth is flat</a> or that there is <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_on_Mars_a50d.html" title="Life on Mars">life on Mars</a>, would you then say "oh well, Wikipedia does <i>not</i> have the capabilty to judge if the Earth is flat or round or oblong, or that there is or is not life on Mars"? Obvioulsy not! It would be the editors and writers, most known to their peers on Wikipedia, as having reliable knowledge about the subject at hand to venture and give forth either credibility or plausibity about that subject. If one were to follow the logic of your argument to its ultimate conclusion then NO article would <i>ever</i> be deleted from Wikipedia because, after all (using your argument) "Wikipedia does not have the capability of judging, or the ethical merit" of the subject/s -- which would then in effect mean that once editors write <i>anything</i> it cannot be nominated for deletion, 'cause after-all who are we mere mortals to judge articles on Wikipedia about anything. Finally may I say, the biggest rebuttal to your argument here is that Wikipedia assumes the exact opposite of what you argue, because in cases of doubt, there are in fact templates like {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert_3e75.html" title="Template:Expert">Expert</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert-subject_82ba.html" title="Template:Expert-subject">Expert-subject</a>}} that opnely request and admit: "This article or section is in need of attention from an <b>expert on the subject</b>... [a relavant]] Wikiproject... may be able to help recruit one..." See also <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Expert_Request_Sorting_7ae9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Expert Request Sorting">Wikipedia:WikiProject Expert Request Sorting</a>.
