<ul>
<li>After the required five days of discussion the VfD consensus was to delete the article. However, as the article has new block-compressed revisions which are not supported by the new selective undelete feature and could result in data loss if deletion and undeletion happened the article cannot be deleted for "a month or two" until the software is updated. Accordingly, the article has been marked for deletion and protected until the software problem is fixed. --AndyL 22:25, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a personal essay (and a rather good one) based on individual research by a user who cannot accept the neutrality policy no matter how many times it is explained to him (see the talk page). There appears to be no prospect of him allowing it to become npov. He is of the opinion that his idiosyncratic views are fact because he has read many books and fully referenced his article. I think he needs to find another outlet for his views, as Wikipedia is not suited to his purpose. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 01:17, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> This is not Original Research; it cannot be since all the information it contains appears to come from the public domain. It may be an "Original Compilation" but then, so are all the articles that I write. Extracting information from text books and other published resources is not Research.

<dd>Much, perhaps most original research in the humanities is based on information that is in the public domain.

<li>This <i>is</i> Original Research. It may make use of published sources, but it uses them in a very idisyncratic way, to attempt to prove a particular thesis. Basically it assumes that when classical or other authors use the terms <i>res publica</i> in Latin, <i>politeia</i> in Greek, or <i>commonwealth</i> in English they are all referring to a particular constitutional form of mixed government, which in many cases is pretty evidently not the case. <b>Delete</b> (or possibly re-work under a title such as <i>Constitutional theory of mixed government</i> so as not to hijack the term "Republic").<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 07:44, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay, the talk page makes it clear that the article was written as soapboxing. But do you really believe there's nothing here that can be salvaged for other articles? Citing sources in support of original assertions is OR, but describing what sources say themselves is not. The article has a great deal of the latter. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 08:47, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Perhaps, but the main author wouldn't permit it and there are plenty of articles on related issues which can be worked on more constructively. The whole slant of this article is too idiosyncratic for it to be worth anyone's effort to try to turn it into something else, and no one is likely to want to deal with the hysterical reaction that would be the likely response of the main writer. Thus there is no realistic prospect of it ever becoming npov. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 09:34, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article rather hysterically describes a non-descript linguistic shift in a word's usage over the past 2500 years or so. Ironically, this shift appears to be somewhat less than average, and I sense that the author has some PoV political ax to grind (among other things). <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 09:44, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b>. (Note to administrator: but don't count this as a Keep if that would block a consensus to <b>Delete</b>). While there are some paragraphs that are <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> and the article seems to have been written to present the author's somewhat idiosyncratic POV about republican or "mixed" government, I don't think it suffers from this more than a great many other articles, and there is a considerable amount of useful fact. The <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> aspects can be cleaned up, although the attitude of the author on the Talk page suggests that this might be a bit of a battle. The basic problem I have with the article is that it overlaps the topic of <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">Republic</a>, and I don't see sufficient grounds for it to be an independent article. It should be merged with <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">Republic</a>, although I hesitate to set <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> loose on that article. By the way, I don't find this article terribly well-written. Yes: the sentences are grammatical and the diction and style are those of an educated writer. But it is a bit disturbing to see these labelled as "good writing" because the article is really too long, meandering, unfocused, and a bit muddled. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 15:30, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Today on the talk page he basically called me a Marxist with "Jewish" thinking. Funny that, since being a descendant of resourceful, independant-minded anabaptists, their lingering influence strikes me at almost every turn of my life. He's only managed to strengthen my opinion that the content of this article is so riddled with hysterical agenda, any NPoV content would require much work to glean and merge, so my vote to delete it all does stand. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 17:45, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The problem with merging it with <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">Republic</a> is that although it purports to be about the concept of a republic, it's really about the use of certain words which would not actually equate to "republic" in modern usage, and about a certain type of mixed government which the author on very dubious grounds maintains is the "true" definition of a republic. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 15:42, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, I wouldn't suggest that it should be merged <i>en bloc</i>, but tather that the useful material and information from the article be worked into <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">Republic</a>.

<li>Merge any salvageable content into <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a>, delete article - this title is pretty useless, and any links should just be changed. The article is really a mixed bag. It's written to present a particular argument, so it effectively becomes a personal essay. It's also not terribly coherent, and frequently synthesizes material in ways that give the whole product a strong feel of original research. However, the republic article is no great shakes either, and obviously this article is written as a critique of that one. Some elements could be saved, but what is really needed is someone with a much better grounding in the theory of political science to give the entire subject area a major rewrite. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 17:05, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've started editing the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">Republic</a> article, initially the opening paragraphs, and will maybe do a bit more from time to time (not that I'm an expert). Actually I think we should be very careful what we import into that article from "Classical definition of republic". By the way I see from a link on <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">Republic</a> that Wheeler has now reproduced "Classical definition of republic" at <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/wiki.php?title=Classical_definition_of_republic" class="external text" title="http://www.wikinfo.org/wiki.php?title=Classical_definition_of_republic" rel="nofollow">Wikinfo:Classical republic classical definition of the republic</a>. Wikinfo is probably a much more suitable vehicle for this sort of work than Wikipedia, so we shoudn't feel too bad about deleting all his hard work. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 21:13, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

I let the people speak for themselves. It is much more clearer that way. Here is another inovation. That will enhance Wikipedia as the place to go. Let the words speak for themselves instead of me telling or interpreting what they said, which will propably be the wrong way any way.</li>

<p>I do acknowledge that some material is original. I am defining it in all its parameters. I will delete the article except for one sentence about it being "mixed" That is unrefutable. To keep all the links already established on Wikipedia and to keep it in the Category sections, I think it advisable that only <b>ONE</b> external link from Wikinfo on the original page. I think that this is the best course available at this time. Without a "Classical Republic" it will be hard to understand the Republic of Venice, the American Constitution, the English Constitutionalists like John Aylmer and Geoffrey Elton and others. In a couple of years, when this gets thrown around some; it can be put back on its original page.</p>
<p>I have personally bought <i>Founders and the Classics</i>, and <i>The Theory of Mixed Government in Antiquity</i> at great personal cost. I have through interlibrary loan am getting James Blythe's <i>Mixed Government in the Middle Ages</i>. I am continuing my research as fast as humanely possible.</p>

<p>Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn writes, "Talking to a professor of a big American university, a specialist in modern German history, I remarked that Hilter was a demogogue like Cleon. 'Cleon?' (He remarked.) "Yes, Cleon of Athens", (professor:) 'Ah, that's antiquity. It's none of my business."

<dd>Wheeler, the <i>only</i> reason you have a computer and the leisure time to tap on its keyboard is because human societies tend to specialize. Did the prof deny AH was a demagogue or something? <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 19:46, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Haven't you read the Scriptures?---There is nothing new under the sun. If you read the classics and esp. Aristotle, that a certain dictator at that time, formed a club of men much like the SA and SS, to protect himself and further their objectives w/o being interupted. All this happened before already. As George Santayana has said, "Those who refuse to learn from history are condemned to repeat it." Sad. I can go thru the classics, and see Hitler throughout them--already portrayed. One must read, the classics, theology, philosophy, literary criticism, history, etc. and to have a "real experience" of the world, to really know the world and make sense of it. Sadly, we still haven't learned from the Greeks and we are going to repeat the same mistakes. Tyranny comes out of democracy.

<p>This is now the definition of a republic. "Sovereignty derives from the people". Just like Hitler wanted.

<dd>Hitler ran a bit of a scam, didn't he?

<dd>Look at this definition. "A republic, in its basic sense, is a state in which sovereignty derives ultimately from the people". What is the difference between this and a democracy? This is what a democracy is. Again, the principle of identity. Why say the word republic if it is the same as democracy? Again, why say "democratic republic" when republic is the same word as democratic? All this is illogical. Does Republic and Democracy mean the same thing? If so, why seperate articles? My head is spinning with the complications of what I am reading. It is obvious we don't have a clue.

<dd>So on the one hand you're saying that sovereignty deriving from the people equates to Hitlerism, on the other that it equates to democracy - you can hardly have it both ways! Actually of course there's a great deal of difference between the notion of th e"sovereign people" as in the French and American revolutions, and the quasi-mystical Nazi concept of the "Volk". I do wonder however whether the "Republic" article might better be defined in terms of "citizens" rather than the "people". <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 08:01, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In current usage a republic is a <i>type</i> of democracy, is all, usually characterized by intermediate layers of elected representation and some sort of executive branch. No scandal there, no <i>lost in space</i>. No surprise there's been some natural linguistic shift over the past 2500 years. What's interesting to me is how <i>intact</i> the word has remained compared to others. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 19:37, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think a republic is most commonly defined in what it is not. The French republic, the republican constitution of various American states, and archetypically the Roman republic, were all so defined specifically in opposition to hereditary monarchy, especially of course monarchies that were perceived to be oppressive. The concept of a republic seems to have originated with the Romans, looking back from the days of the empire to the republican arrangements that had preceded it, which in turn were defined in opposition to the monarchy of the Tarquins. The Greeks, with a different history, and a more analytical approach, classified states as monarchies, oligarchies, or democracies, or indeed some mixture of all three, but aarguably did not have need of the precise concept of a "republic". Indeed one could argue that the Greeks didn't, and don't, have a word for it: the word politeia fundamentally means "the government", "the body politic", and so on in general terms, rather than what we would call a republic (so of course does the Latin res publica in most contexts), and the current Greek state, the "Hellenic Republic", is called in Greek "Elliniki Dhimokratia", so for the Greeks at least democracy and republic are synonymous. In practice, if you were to read beyond the opening sentence of the current "Republic" article, you will see that a distinction can be made: not all republics are democratic, not all democracies are republics. The United Kingdom has democratic institutions, and a mixed form of government, but is not referred to a "republic". Those who campaign for Australia and other countries of the British Commonwealth to become republics are not asking for their countries to have a more "mixed" form of Government, but for their head of state to be an elected official rather than the Queen or her representative. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 20:49, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sparta is a Republic with a King. Cicero called Sparta a republic. Machiavelli called Sparta a Republic. John Aylmer called Sparta a republic. John Hooker was enthused with Spartan and Roman republicanism. Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist papers which were originally newspaper articles that was widely read by the general population called Sparta a republic. John Aylmer saw that Tudor England was a republic. Sparta is a republic.<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 21:33, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, Sparta was a state with two kings (a most unusual form of constitution). As to Cicero calling it a republic, if you're referring to your quotation "res publica lacedaemoniorum" (I quote from memory) this is more likely just to have meant "the Spartan state", rather than implying that it was a "republic". <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 21:50, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Where in God's green earth do you get that a republic is the same as democracy. Neither Plato nor Aristotle confuse the terms. Have you people read the Athenian Constitution by Aristotle? I'm I taliking to a brick wall? Don't you understand plain english? The word has been <b>bastardized</b>. Only in the last two centuries has the word changed in meaning.

<dd>I think you're fundamentally mistaken in applying the term "republic" to what Plato or Aristotle may have said about Athens. It's not a question of whether either place was a democracy, it's more that the concept of "republic" is really an anachronism as applied to this period, and really has nothing to do with the concept of a "mixed" constitution which admittedly was discussed at that time. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 21:50, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Comment</i>: Mr WHEELER, I think, has missed two important points. First, WP offers free content (no charge) and editing by consensus, which simply means one can edit as one pleases, but if it doesn't conform to a consensus it won't remain. Second, he doesn't seem to understand what original research is. One can include 1000 references to the literature, peer-reviewed, widely published, everything... but if the article's thesis is an original synthesis, it's not encyclopedic. For example (broadly put for clarity), if WP had existed 100 years ago, and a young Swiss patent official named Albert Einstein had posted his work to WP in an article entitled "Special Theory of Relativity", it would likely have been deleted as original research. Wheeler may still argue that WP is Marxist (I'm certainly not), that his arguments are correct and so on, but the consensus is that his ideas are original, and with their additional, underlying politcal agenda, they also fall under the "WP is not a soapbox" guideline. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 18:54, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
