<p>Mahatma Ghandiji was born in the midst of a Febuary rain in south dakota. Shortly after his birth he became fascinated with the celebreality, Hogan Knows Best. Ghandiji's father, a wealthy christmas tree shops employee, decided that Ghandiji should learn basic Viking studies at a young age to prepare for the Norweigen attack, which would later destroy all of civilization. Shortly after his apearance on the hit T.V Drama, Deal or No Deal in the late 13th century, Mahatma Ghandiji was turned to stone bye a British Archer, Luke Fittes. Luke Fittes was a poor man, who spent much of his time in Berlin, studying the effects of extreme cold weather, while having had 3 eggnogs, and a large sandwich. Ghandiji reanimated and came back to life when his father in law, Hulk Hogan, kissed the stone in which Ghandiji had been turned into, breaking the spell, and making it suddenly come back to life. Ghandiji later became well known as the lead singer of Drowning Pool, a popular christian revival group from brazil. Ghandiji was killed, this time for good, by Luke Fittes's great grandmother, Eugine Fittes, who was later killed by L'infection de Vagine.</p>

ShareConnector was a popular index site for files on the eDonkey network. ShareConnector did not host any files; instead, the links it contained were accessible through an eDonkey network client. It was taken down by an anti-piracy foundation on December 14, 2004 due to the suspicion of breach of copyright and trademark laws. The site came back online, on December 19, 2006. The main was used from a backup taken on November 26, 2004 shortly before it was shut down. The forum was started from stratch due a recent backup not being avaiable.</p>

<p>Dennystown was a district of Dumbarton near the river Leven. It consisted mainly of tenements built to house the workers of the nearby Dennystown Forge. It was locally known as "Little Dublin" due to the large number of Irish immigrants who lived there having come to the town to work in the local industries. The area was largely cleared in the 1960's and blocks of multi-storey flats built on the site.</p>

<p>Oren Stambouli an up and coming Venezuelan Filmmaker</p>
<p>Oren Stambouli was born in Caracas, Venezuela. At the age of 21 he moved to the United States in pursuit of his dream of becoming a filmmaker. After graduating with a degree in Film from Emerson College in Boston, Oren Stambouli received an offer to be part of the production team in a Spanish Soap Opera in South Florida. The soap opera, “La mujer de mi vida”, was broadcasted in the United States, Central and South America. This project was co-produced by the two most influential media companies in Hispanic TV in the US and Latin America, Venevision and Univision. Both companies belong to the largest Latin Media Conglomerate.</p>
<p>In January of 1999, Oren became a segment producer for several shows at Telemundo, the fastest growing Hispanic network in the US and stronger competitor to Univision.</p>
<p>The start of the new century marked a turning point in Stambouli’s career. After working for the two major Broadcast Hispanic Networks, Oren was hired by MTV Networks in the Latin American division. He went from the most powerful Spanish broadcast networks (Univision,Telemundo) in the nation to one of the most renowned names in contemporary culture, MTV. Among his most notorious jobs for the Latin market was to be a part of the production team of several promos and shows for Nickelodeon and MTV Latin America including “Alejandro Sanz Unplugged”,“La Ley Unplugged” .</p>
<p>In 2002, after working in several MTV and VH1 productions Oren decided to move to New York were he became an integral part of the launch of “U-Pick Live” an interactive block at Nickelodeon.</p>
<p>While working for “U-Pick Live”, Stambouli was appointed to work at the Kids Choice Awards in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2003, Oren participated as unit manager at “Stuff’d” the first interstial show ever made in New York for the recently created network “Nicktoons”</p>
<p><br />
After 6 successful seasons (401 episodes) “U-Pick Live” shoot his last episode at the end of may with a special performance by “Simple Plan” that took place on the rooftop of the MTV Building in Time Square. At “U-Pick Live”, Stambouli has had the opportunity to work closely with stars like Adam Sandler, Mike Meyers, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jack Black and others.</p>
<p>After 11 years Oren created the opportunity for himself to make his dream a reality by directing and producing his first film. At the end of 2005 after taking a 2-month break from his job Oren went on an introspective journey that took him to Bali, Australia and NZ. That trip marked the beginning of his recently finished film Trust 22.</p>

On September 20th, 2002, the Rama VIII Bridge was officially opened in Bangkok, Thailand. The bridge consists of a single pylon located approximately one-third of the distance from the northwest end of the bridge. Golden suspension cables are extended from this pylon to the rode's surface. The bridge spans the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok. The Bridge is 2.45 km long including approach spans. Since its creation, the Rama VIII bridge has become a noted architectural tourist attraction, and an image of the bridge has even been included on the backside of Thailand's 20 baht bank note.</p>

<p>Pickled eggs are a popular bar food noted for their imperishability and acquired taste. Shelled, boiled eggs are soaked in a cold brine for 2 to 22 days then jarred to be stored in public view. The brine traditionally imparts a spicy flavor to the eggs. Beer is a traditional beverage of choice when eating pickled eggs. Some consider pickled eggs a delicacy. They are consumed mainly in the United States, although not unilaterally. They are most common in the northern part of the country. Pickled eggs are not associated with any particular holiday.</p>
<p><br />
Trivia:</p>
<p>In an episode of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>, Homer Simpson selects the "black egg" from Moe the bartender's jar, which Moe declares identifies Homer as the Designated Driver for the night.</p>

<p><br />
Like many other great musicians, Jordan's flame was extinguished too early. On December 13, 2005, Timothy Anderson Jordan, II, took his own life <a href="http://www.punknews.org/article/14852" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.punknews.org/article/14852" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. To many he was the life of the party or the charismatic guitarist at the show, but to his friends and family he was a hero and a brother.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Early Life</b></p>
<p><br />
Tim grew up in the small farming community of Camden, AR. His father, Tim, Sr. was a contractor. Tim was always encouraged by his dad to pursue the family business or sports, mainly basketball. Tim was a successful high school basketball player and had a promising future. However, along the way music found his spirit.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Altar Ego</b></p>
<p>While in college at Ouachita Baptist University, Tim met Jarred Smith and Aaron Lunsford (now of As Cities Burn). The three had an instant music connection and formed Altar Ego, a pop-punk Christian outfit. However, tensions arose between Smith and Tim, and Tim exited the band as they were cutting their first demo. A few of the songs did feature Tim on guitar.</p>
<p><br />
<b>School or No School</b></p>
<p>After the split from Altar Ego and Ouachita Baptist University, Tim found himself at a neighboring university. While there, Tim began to find himself as a musician. Not feeling like school was for him, Tim withdrew and sought refuge at home working for his dad. With pressure from his mom, Tim found himself in school once again at a local community college. This would be Tim's 2nd completed semester at school (the first being from OBU). However, at the end of the spring 2001 semester Tim left this college and enrolled at a local tech school to pursue the family business. This would be his fourth school in two years. He had given up on music as a career.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Higgins Switch</b></p>
<p>In the summer of 2001, Tim attended a church camp for high school and junior high school kids as a worship leader in one of the smaller groups. While there he would meet his next opportunity for musical success. One night while walking into the main conference area, Tim noticed a guy with vampire red hair. Tim being the charismatic person that he is approached the red headed guy and asked what the deal was. His answer was that he was in a band. This intrigued Tim and he had to know more. The two spent the whole night discussing life, music, spirituality, and the possibility of Tim auditioning as second guitarist for the band. Two weeks later Tim found himself in the small Eastern Arkansas town of Wynne in a mini-storage unit auditioning for a band called Plumbline 34. Soon after Tim found himself packing a few of his belongings and moving to Wynne to live with bassist Allen Winkler, the one that had convinced him to tryout for PL34. The band was made up of vocalist Brad Branham, guitarist Eric Wade, bassist Allen, and drummer Matt Hagler.</p>
<p>With a new member and a new sound came a new name. While returning home from tour one night, the band was stopped by railroad crossing arms with no train on the tracks. A Chinese fire drill ensued. However, vocalist Brad stayed in the car to meditate on possible name changes. He opened his eyes and saw a sign, literally. Higgins Switch was born.</p>
<p>The band continued to play locally and regionally seeing mild success. Moreover, it was apparent to everyone that their live show was worth seeing with their coordinated jumps, crazy guitar throws, dynamic dancing, and spitting on the members of the band, all mainly influenced by Tim. However, in the fall of 2002, just one year after becoming Higgins Switch, the band called it quits to pursue school and private lives.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Green Olive Tree</b></p>
<p>After the split of Higgins Switch, Tim sought out one of the most talented bands in the area, Green Olive Tree. Co-founding guitarist John Dodson had just left the band. Tim saw this as an opportunity to join an already established band. He was right. For the next year, Green Olive Tree toured the country and gained the respect of many national acts on Tooth and Nail Records and The Militia Group. At the time the band roster was Chris Latimer – vocals/guitar, Andy Greenfield – bass/vocals, Tim Jordan – guitar/vocals, and a revolving door of drummers, including former Evanescence drummer Matt Outlaw (now of India). However, after a year of constant touring and seeing little commercial success, Latimer broke up Green Olive Tree.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Welton and Number One Fan, etc.</b></p>
<p>With two of his former bands gone, Tim once again found himself a man without a country or a band for that matter. However, due to the connections he made while with Green Olive Tree, Tim was able to find a place with the Fort Smith, AR outfit Welton. A four piece rock/emo group signed to Snapdragon Records. The group was again another well established group. Snapdragon released one Welton Ep that was split with the band The Response. Such songs as “Typecast Letters” were included on the EP. But like Tim’s previous projects, Welton soon ended.</p>
<p>For the first time in his career, Tim’s phone was ringing with offers. He accepted a gig with a mildly well-known group called Number One Fan as their touring keyboardist. This gig allowed Tim to showcase his other talents besides just playing guitar. After finishing several tours with NOF, Tim parted ways in pursuit of something more permanent.</p>
<p>During both the Welton and NOF projects Tim always managed to find time for friends, family, and other endeavors like India (Chris Latimer of Green Olive Tree’s current project).</p>
<p><br />
<b>All-American Rejects</b>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_american_rejects" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_american_rejects" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>]</p>
<p>What he found was the biggest career move he would pursue yet. Through the connections he made via his other projects, Tim was invited to audition for the widely known All-American Rejects[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_american_rejects" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_american_rejects" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] as their touring keyboardist. This would enable him to meet great musicians, industry professionals, and play on David Letterman all of which he achieved in under a year. At the end of the 2005 Van’s Warped Tour, Tim left AAR to join the up and coming Mississippi band Jonezetta.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Jonezetta</b>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonezetta" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonezetta" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>]</p>
<p>Tim met Jonezetta[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonezetta" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonezetta" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>] through his best friend Aaron Lunsford of As Cities Burn. Tim and Lunsford were former band mates from the early Altar Ego days. Tim met ACB while playing with Welton. He stayed friends with both them and Lunsford and even convinced ACB to audition Lunsford when original drummer Bryan Dixon exited the band.</p>
<p>Tim officially joined Jonezetta as the fifth member of the band in the summer of 2005. The band moved from Mississippi to his private, secluded lake house in East Camden to finish the debut album for Tooth and Nail Records. On December 13, 2005 at the age of 24 Tim took his own life.</p>
<p>On December 22, 2006, in Little Rock, AR at Juanita’s Cantina As Cities Burn, Jonezetta, India, and The Evidence all paid tribute to Tim. All the profits went to a suicide prevention organization. Tim’s memory will always live on in the hearts of the people who love him.</p>

<p>Dennis Cass is a freelance writer who most recently accepted a visiting professorship at Carleton College. He has written for such periodicals as GQ, Slate, City Pages, Minnesota Monthly, Harper's, and This American Life.</p>
<p>His first book, "Head Case: How I Almost Lost My Mind Trying to Understand My Brain" is due out in March of 2007. It cronicles his attempts to learn just how his mind works, but delves into his turbulent family history, his writer's block, and his own descent towards a nervious breakdown.</p>
<p>The only class he taught this term was English 180: Creative Non-Fiction. It was composed of 15 students writing 3 pieces--a rant, a memoir, and finally a personal essay. The class periods were devoted to writing excercises, peer review, and socratic seminar-type group editing.</p>
<p>While his professorship at Carleton expired at the end of the Fall 2006 term, he has mentioned a hesitant desire to continue in the school year of 2007-2008, teaching upper-level English students the craft of writing.</p>

<p><b>The Red Room Theatre Company</b> is one of the most high profile London theatre companies.</p>
<p>It was founded in 1995 by <a href="http://www.sohotheatre.com/p28.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sohotheatre.com/p28.html" rel="nofollow">Lisa Goldman</a> as a voluntary organisation, and became regularly funded by Arts Council England in 2002 and then achieved charitable status in 2006 (charity number <a href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?regno=1110724&amp;submit=Run+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?regno=1110724&amp;submit=Run+Search" rel="nofollow">1110724</a>). The Red Room believes theatre should be a truly public art form.</p>
<p>The Red Room has a track record of over ten years of award-winning productions and is a radical voice of new theatre and film in London, creating groundbreaking collaborations between writers, artists and communities to provoke and influence wider social debate.</p>
<p>In addition to its high quality, innovative productions, the Red Room has involved itself in the past in debates and activism around culture and politics, such as Going Public (2003), a debate at the Tricycle Theatre about theatre as a public art form with contributions from the RSC, Cardboard Citizens and Outside Edge. The Red Room also initiated the network <a href="http://www.artistsagainstthewar.org.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.artistsagainstthewar.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">Artists Against the War</a> (2003), exhibiting art work and supporting anti-war artists with events including Palestine Verbatim in Trafalgar Square and Shock and Awe cabaret.</p>
<p>Of over 20 productions the most recent works are: <b><a href="../../../h/o/x/Hoxton_Story_3f15.html" title="Hoxton Story">Hoxton Story</a></b>, <b>Snake Park</b>, <b><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stitching-Methuen-Drama-Anthony-Neilson/dp/0413772934/sr=11-1/qid=1168032909/ref=sr_11_1/202-4343353-5279832" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stitching-Methuen-Drama-Anthony-Neilson/dp/0413772934/sr=11-1/qid=1168032909/ref=sr_11_1/202-4343353-5279832" rel="nofollow">Stitching</a></b>, <b><a href="../../../k/a/y/Kay_Adshead_53f1.html" title="Kay Adshead">Animal</a></b>, and <b><a href="../../../k/a/y/Kay_Adshead_53f1.html" title="Kay Adshead">The Bogus Woman</a></b>.</p>

<p>Transcendental Students (TS)</p>
<p>The Transcendental Students were a group of cultural radicals at NYU during the 1960's and 70's who developed a unique brand of social protest. As opposed to SDS, which held that government and society needed to be completely restructured before they could be humanized, TS members believed that humanization of social life in general could begin immediately. Heavily influenced by anarchist thought, TS strove for "insurrection through happiness."</p>
<p>Their protest method was that of the "Freak In." These recreational gatherings involved the convening of students on university grounds, where jugs of wine, rock music and massive amounts of marijuana were openly enjoyed. A series of "Freak-Ins" were staged through the spring semester of 1969, while university officials attempted, sometimes half-heartedly, to clamp down on TS activities. In line with the larger cultural radical protest of the period, exemplified by the hippies and Yippies!, the TS approach was that of broadcasting a lifestyle in the hope of humanizing and liberating NYU student culture. Though TS collaborated with SDS occasionally, they were often critical of SDS members, considering them "too serious" and "on an ego trip".</p>
<p>Very little was documented about TS, but a brief interview with a TS organizer can be found on the documentary "Anarchism in America" directed by Steven Fischler and Joel Sucker.</p>
