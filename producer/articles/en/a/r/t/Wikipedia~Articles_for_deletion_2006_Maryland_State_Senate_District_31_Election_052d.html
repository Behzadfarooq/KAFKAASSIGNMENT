<li><b>Delete</b>. Hasn't happened yet. Besides, I don't think State Senate election contests merit separate articles, even when they <b>have</b> already happened. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 12:49, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Agree with <a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">User:BM</a>. It's too local. If kept, we's set a precedent for articles about every single local election in history. Future national elections can be kept based on national interest (providing they have sufficient information), this one can't. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:50, Mar 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is silly. Wikipedia has tons of articles of marginal or only local interest. As somebody involved in local politics, I give credit to the author for caring enough about local elections to create the page. Jrlformd 13:35, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

One article on the 2006 Maryland legislative election would work (at least when it gets closer), or ones on the overall history of each district, but articles for a single year, for a single district, for a single legislative body? Too granular, and would make Wikipedia further US-centric (and yes, I'm a US citizen/resident).

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm very concerned that there is so much distaste for expanding the knowledge base. Why should the writer not provide additional information? The pages there are not hurting anybody and may actually provide additional information for those who want to look for info on the internet. Deleting the pages seem like an effort to restrict information, which seems to go against the point of having a Wikipedia. Davidmycanty 16:47, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> this and all similar articles. Wikipedia does not need an article on every election for every office in every state in the US. This is Ashlee Simpsonesque overkill.

<li>You may be right, and in that case those other articles would also have to be deleted. It's all a matter of how exactly you mean it.

<li><b>Merge</b>. If you check out , this is far from the only such article being created. Everything is factual; the worst that can be said about these articles is that they are currently stubs and may not get enough information to become an encyclopedic article. My feeling is that this set of articles be combined into Maryland elections, 2006. If that combined article begins exceeding the 32 KB standard limit, then there's nothing stopping us from splitting it back up, as appropriate. — <a href="../../../d/l/j/User%7EDLJessup_f14d.html" title="User:DLJessup">DLJessup</a> 05:01, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, barring some evidence of special notability for this race (scandal of national significance, etc.). Having been involved in several campaigns at this level, I see no reason to believe they are encyclopedic; in the event they involve political figures of some notability, they can be covered in appropriate biographical articles. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 12:06, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just a question: this article was pushed to VfD on March 7th. Under normal circumstances, that would mean that a decision should have been reached on or about March 12th. It's now March 20th.
