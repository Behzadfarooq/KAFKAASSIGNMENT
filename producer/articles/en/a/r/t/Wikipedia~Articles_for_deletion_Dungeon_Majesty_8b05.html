Never heard of Kubla Con, which doesn't have its own article -- while that's not the strongest point, I think it's fair to note it.

Judging from the website, it's a public access cable show with about three or four episodes, which is what really settles it for me.

<dd>We're not debating how good of a show, we're debating the fact that its not notable.

<dd>I didn't point that out, Bighaz did. He also pointed out that regardless of whether or not its a policy or guideline people do tend to follow it quite a bit.

Lets also not forget its got a total of 3 episodes, which again would make it fail any kind of notability test. With such little exposure, this could be seen by many as just a way to try and advertise the show or gain notability.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:36, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

A very large number of editors vote along lines of notability -- without notability, it becomes increasingly difficult to find <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, at which point the articles are far more likely to contain <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, and fail to pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> tests.

Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information; if we include an article for every club, ever, the whole system breaks. So there has to be a filter, there has to be a line. We can debate all day about where the line should be placed, and whether this article is above or beneath that line, but I feel the line itself is necessary. How many hundreds or thousands of public access shows are there, in the US, past and present? The whole world? Can we afford to list them all? What's unique about this one? What sets it above the rest? I'm not saying there's nothing unique, I'm just saying I and a few others need a little more convincing. My delete vote isn't a vote against the show; I'm sure it's great, and I'm sure people enjoy it, and I hope they do. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 20:24, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your argument is well intended, but wrong. If an article is not properly sourced, then we should delete it. I see no reason to delete <i>this</i> public access show simply because you have issues imagining how we would deal with articles about <i>other</i> shows. Can we afford to list them? The simple answer is yes, if they are well sourced, verfied, and neutral. WP is not paper. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 20:33, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I could just as easily say the same of you -- well-intentioned, but wrong.&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">Ad hominem</a> proves little. In my eyes, this <i>is</i> one of the "other" shows. Well-sourced? The only source I see used is the group's own website -- the only claim to notability I can find in the article is itself an apparently unsourced statement. There's almost no content in this article, "this is a show, these are the five cast members' names. Trust me, it's notable. Here's some links!" Three sentences and a five-bullet list. Are you honestly proposing that a few hundred thousand articles like that are a good idea? <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 20:47, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, being a stub is not a reason for deletion. Let it be, and it will grow. I'm not judging those other articles until I see them.

<dd>Notability has everything to do with deletion policy. The connection has already been made twice for you. As for telling us to let it be, see <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. The article isn't yours to control. Its not being deleted because its a stub. Its being put up for deletion because other than a mention in a year and a half old tv show, its not even on the radar. One common theme for notability is being published in multiple non-trivial credible publications. You've got one with G4techtv. Blogspot, myspace and earthlink don't fit that criteria.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 22:25, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To respond to your points in order - notability is not part of deletion policy. There's no way to make it sound like it is. Someone above listed it being very short as a reason to delete it. I am not claiming to control the article. "I don't like it" is not a reason to delete it either. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 06:24, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

It has everything to do with notability, and this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_notability_criteria" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_notability_criteria" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> which clearly states: "This category is a collection of possible criteria/policies/guidelines for inclusion or deletion of articles". Deletion is closely tied with notability. Whether or not its stated in full bold letters on the deletion policy page. In addition to that as someone pointed out there aren't enough reliable sources to build an article on becuase this is so far off the radar. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 15:36, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My mistake, I thought that this was AFD, not Speedy deletion. I was under the impression that Speedy applied only to speedy deletions. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 00:14, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Speedy is part of the deletion process here, and notability is part of that. Thus your connection between deletion and notability that you were seeking. Also the second link I provided had nothing to do with speedy and all to do with deletion and inclusion and notability is mentioned throughout. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 01:47, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Speedy is part of the <i>speedy</i> deletion process, but not, actually, AFD. That's quite clear. There are many things that apply in Speedy but not AFD. That's why there are separate policies. The second link you provided does not, unfortunately, provide a link to any AFD policy that says anything about notability. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 06:17, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I'm not convinced that this has achieved enough notability to provide us with enough sources to write about it with a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. My interpretation of notability is that notability exists to serve actual Wikipedia policies, and I think in this case we just can't source the claims that it's highly regarded, and I'm not certain we can be sure that it's aired where the article says it's aired. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 17:09, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Its not remotely discriminate. By saying this should be kept, you're saying anyone who makes a 3 episode cable access show should be able to have an article on wikipedia. Discriminate is setting notability guidelines for inclusion so that every idea for a show that was ever executed doesn't end up here.

The fact of the matter is notability is often used to decide whether or not articles get to stay here and this fails terribly.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 01:47, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, people have pointed to things that are not policy, claiming that they behave as if they are policy, but frankly, the fact that you made a mistake before doesn't mean that you have to make a mistake again. Time to mend your ways! <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 03:21, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Mend my ways? People have pointed to several things that are policy that reference notability. WP:NN also references a long standing precedent of articles being removed on the grounds of notability. As such notability is a perfectly acceptable reason to put an article up for deletion. If you'd care to address the issue of notability, I welcome it.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 03:34, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no 'issue with notability'. It's not part of AFD policy. WP:NN is an essay, not even a guideline. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 05:30, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not 'my opinion'. Notability is not part of AFD policy. WP:NN is an essay, not even a guideline.

<dd>I've been told that it crops up in essays, in other policy that does not apply to AFD, and that people think that it should be, but I have not been shown that it is actually <i>in</i> AFD policy.

<dd>Sorry to cut in late, but you still didn't address how this is not in breach of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information. I'm not sure you understand the boundaries standing between someone and creating a public access tv show (none).

<dd>I'm talking about this article, which seems to me to be neutral and verifiable, and not to have offended against any wikipedia policy. Please remember that WP is not paper. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 06:28, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's fine. its also not a directory. One thing to differentiate an article between being encyclopedic and being part of a general directory is notability. That is also part of WP:NOT. Almost anything can be neutral and verifiable (and no it wasn't neutral with statements like ...and Riley Swift - the dungeon master! it read exactly like a vanity page or ad. Which is what it is.). Neutral and verifiable are not the only criteria for inclusion. Some people feel that way, some people feel the other way and that is why were here. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 06:43, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure why "...and" is not neutral, but hey. It's odd that some people don't think that policy is important, but you're right, that's why we're here. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarfiend_b5a7.html" title="User:Carfiend">Carfiend</a> 06:54, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Because its not the proper tone for an encyclopedia. It reads like an ad or sounds like someone announcing something flashy. And yes policy IS important. There are more policies than WP:V and WP:NPOV. You just took the time to quote WP:NOT by saying its not paper, read the whole policy. You can't use part of it to justify the existence of the article then turn around and ignore 2 other parts of the same policy that would say it doesn't belong here.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 07:15, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. Not encyclopedically notable. If the girls can ramp up their popularity in a major way, then maybe. But at the moment, less than 1000 ghits suggests that this show has not attained critical mass. Their youtube audience is pretty underwhelming<a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=DungeonMajesty" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=DungeonMajesty" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. True, the girls seem to have only tentatively embraced youtube, but 400-600 views per clip after 1 month is tiny by youtube standards (there are over 1 million youtube videoclip views a day<a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=DungeonMajesty" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=DungeonMajesty" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>) <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 20:20, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom.

<dd><b>comment</b> it was mentioned on the Screensavers like 18 months ago, but that single mention I don't think brings it near enough notability.
