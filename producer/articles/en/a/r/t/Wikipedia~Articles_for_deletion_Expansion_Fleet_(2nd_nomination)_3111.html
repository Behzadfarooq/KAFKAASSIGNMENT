<p><b>keep</b> The discussion page of the article on Expansion Fleet clearly lists various arguments why this nomination for deletion is not only invalid, but also why it is notable enough.

<dd>The comment I received on my notable references is clearly offending, which is not allowed due to the "dont bite the newcomers" policy. It seems I'm getting more and more reasons to declare the nomination invalid.

<p><b>KEEP</b> To delve into it being questioned as notable or not, if it has not been added or known, this site has 2 books published about it, one 360 pages, the most recent 546 pages. Other than that, what is such the problem with keeping Expansion up? One would think there are better things to do with time. Users submit the knowledge to share existing things with the world. I look now and see <b>The Free Encyclopedia</b>. Let Expansion Fleet be free information to the world. - Tom Hobson<br />

<b>Comment:</b> By the way, Expansion Fleet is trying to usher votes into this AfD page from their home page. See the message below:<br />
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The article of Expansion Fleet on Wikipedia.org is currently under a hot debate to be deleted. Some "Deletionist" Admins of Wikipedia claim it is "non notable" because they personally don't know it, and attempt to delete it repeatingly at what obviously appears to be a personal attack on anything that doesn't float their boat.</p>
<p>Please help ups keep the article on Wikipedia, by voting "keep" at this URL:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Expansion_Fleet_%282nd_nomination%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Expansion_Fleet_%282nd_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>You can do so by going to the URL above, clicking "Edit this page" and then adding (at the bottom of the already posted text) the following line:</p>
<p>'''keep''' any comments here ~~~~</p>
<p>And click "save page" on the bottom.</p>
<p>This needs to be done ASAP if we are to crush the corrupt abuse of the Wikipedia policies by its admins.</p>
<p>Please also consider signing our petition against Wikipedia corruption:</p>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Vorak and Aneirin are the authors of the page. Logically, they hold high positions in the management of Expansion Fleet.

<p><i>Vorak is the only owner of the site I think. So him saying for it to be deleted probally means it should be deleted. He said he withdrew any allowing of Expansion to be on this place.

<p>"'Keep"' This is a General use online encyclopedia, this is true, so are you going to try and delete everything from it that hasn`t been widely heard of? This article, simply by being here and through this discussion is, albeit slowly, giving the site exposure to outsiders. So all of those who are in favor of deletion and give this link to thier friends are doing nothing but promoting the site, the oppinion of the poster notwithstanding, they are still viewing the link and taking in the name, there is no reason to delete the site. Perhaps rather than simply try to abolish it you should look at it and then form an oppinion.71.97.190.106 02:10, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> This is why you shouldn't follow instructions from the Expansion Fleet site. Everybody there is unaware of the Wikipedia <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> procedures. If they hate Wikipedia, so be it. They are the "haters" for attacking Wikipedia. We are merely following Wikipedia's policies. Think about it this way. If we had an article for every forum, regardless of size, the expenses to run this site will shoot upwards. Therefore, it is not a hate crime. This policy may be changed if you are willing to donate mass amounts to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/y/c/User%7ESycthos_ff74.html" title="User:Sycthos">Sycthos</a><a href="../../../s/y/c/User_talk%7ESycthos_0fbd.html" title="User talk:Sycthos"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 06:36, 22 January 2006 (UTC)
