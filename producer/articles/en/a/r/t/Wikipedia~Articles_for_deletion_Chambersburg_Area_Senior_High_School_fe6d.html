<p>Chambersburg Area Senior High School is the sole high school of a tiny town in rural Pennsylvania. It fails all three counts of the (not accepted) <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESchools_f044.html" title="WP:Schools">WP:Schools</a> policy. It has not been the subject of a non-trivial work, it has no notable alumni, it has not gained recognition for special achievements, and it has no special architectural history. Moving on to the more general <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> criteria, a Google search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Chambersburg+Area+Senior+High+School%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Chambersburg+Area+Senior+High+School%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> reveals that there are no published works available on the Internet with Chambersburg Area Senior High School as their primary focus, except primary sources published by the school itself and its associated organizations. Finally, the article has already been merged into <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chambersburg.html#Chambersburg_Area_Senior_High_School" title="Chambersburg">Chambersburg#Chambersburg Area Senior High School</a>. Looking through <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chambersburg_Area_Senior_High_School_1f75.html" title="Chambersburg Area Senior High School">Chambersburg Area Senior High School</a>'s edit history reveals that a fairly large number of the edits are vandals or non-sense. Merging the article will ensure that more people will see the content and be able to revert the vandals faster. The current article should be left as a redirect to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chambersburg.html" title="Chambersburg">Chambersburg</a>. <a href="../../../t/b/j/User%7ETbjablin_eba4.html" title="User:Tbjablin">Tbjablin</a> 06:19, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm confused by this nom...if the content is already merged and you want the page to be a redirect, then just do so. That is just a normal page-content edit...don't need to be in AfD world, since you're not trying to <i>delete</i> the whole page from existing at all. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 07:24, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I've redirected the article three times already, but people keep reverting the change. I was asked on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Talk%7EChambersburg_Area_Senior_High_School_db12.html" title="Talk:Chambersburg Area Senior High School">Talk:Chambersburg Area Senior High School</a> to bring the article up on AFD to get a resolution on whether to redirect, leave as is, or delete. <a href="../../../t/b/j/User%7ETbjablin_eba4.html" title="User:Tbjablin">Tbjablin</a> 14:47, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would advise you to examine the "improvements" in the article more closely. The first paragraph has been copied three times with minute variation to make the article appear bulkier. Notice that the school's enrollment of 1,800 is mentioned <b>three</b> times once in each of the article's three paragraphs. It's pretty obvious that no one is paying attention to this article. I think it would be better patrolled by maintaining it in the subsection it currently occupies in inside the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chambersburg.html" title="Chambersburg">Chambersburg</a> article. <a href="../../../t/b/j/User%7ETbjablin_eba4.html" title="User:Tbjablin">Tbjablin</a> 00:30, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Although the article is somewhat lengthened, there is no additional content (or any references) regarding article's primary focus, the high school. The additional material focuses on a single high school athlete, who is borderline noteworthy in her own right. <a href="../../../t/b/j/User%7ETbjablin_eba4.html" title="User:Tbjablin">Tbjablin</a> 04:59, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A statewide award to the principal, a national ranking for a sports team, and national recognition for an athlete are all strong claims of notability for the school itself, with reliable and verifiable sources provided. Notability has been established to Wikipedia standards. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 05:16, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - this article has clear notability by <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, in that it is an important local place. Small town or not, it has a population of 1800 students, and is clutch to the town.

<dd>I would suggest a more narrow search.

Many other news articles happen to contain the words Chambersburg, high, and school in no particular order and of no relevance to the topic. <a href="../../../t/b/j/User%7ETbjablin_eba4.html" title="User:Tbjablin">Tbjablin</a> 14:45, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I believe this is more specific: <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22chambersburg+high+school%22+OR+%22Chambersburg+Area+Senior+High+School+%22+OR+%22Chambersburg+Area+High+School+%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22chambersburg+high+school%22+OR+%22Chambersburg+Area+Senior+High+School+%22+OR+%22Chambersburg+Area+High+School+%22" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> No real opinion, but I may have stepped in something here by accident by cutting the CASHS section in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chambersburg%2C_PA_7bab.html" title="Chambersburg, PA">Chambersburg, PA</a> by about half, to a very short paragraph. Feel free to revert this back to the longer paragraph. Actually, I think the larger paragraph on the Coyle Free Library is more appropriate than a full paragraph on the HS, but I'm not a high school student. <a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmallbones_ca2c.html" title="User:Smallbones">Smallbones</a> 17:43, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename</b> to whatever school district it is a part of, and move all lengthy school district description copy in it.

<dd>What if the article was renamed to Schools in the Chambersburg Area and included data on public and private schools in Chambersburg and the surrounding area? We could move most fo the current section on schools from the Chambersburg article, which I believe may have grown overlong.

<li><b>Keep</b> There are enough press references to this particular high school to justify an article of its own. Some high schools are notable.
