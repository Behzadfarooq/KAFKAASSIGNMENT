<p><b>Delete</b>. First the school is no more. It is an ex school. Second it is not now and was not in its lifetime a notable school, the more so since it was a Primary school, and these are ten a penny in the UK of GB and NI. So it is simply a piece of non notable information, nay an item of indiscriminate information, and fails in so many ways. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminate (etc), <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> simple because it isn't.

Since the article is of today's vintage I suspect it may even be speediable. I bow to a more knowledgeable head over that. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>, obviously notable school, as all schools are. Suggest nominator withdraw nomination, as school AFDs are a waste of everyone's time since deletionists fail by default in the case of no consensus. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 14:07, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It would probably be worth showing that you have read the article before stating an opinion. The nomination and the article(s) both state that the schools no longer exist. The epithet "deletionist" is really aggravating. In order to keep Wikipedia worthwhile the dross has to be removed. Think of it as a process of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnowing.html" title="Winnowing">winnowing</a> the wheat from the chaff. Seeking to include all the schools under the sun and adding the defunct ones is not really in that spirit. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 14:31, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That may be true, but there's nothing that makes me think that Wikipedia's most precious articles (school articles) should be "winnowed" and not allowed room for expansion and organic growth. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 14:39, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>room for expansion and organic growth</i> is a euphemism for "leave it alone and maybe someone will do something to it in the future." If these articles are precious as you state, please make them notable such that they survive. Merely asking for a "stay of execution in case some future fellow passes by" is a recipe for a load of non notable stub and sub-stub articles. I realise you take the topic of schools very seriously. An excellent use of that seriousness would be to research genuine notability and assert it within the articles. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 14:59, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Forbidden, you have now claimed in multiple articles that all schools are notable and insitsted that they are Wikipedia's "most precious articles" (apparently more important than featured articles or articles about basic things like <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light.html" title="Light">light</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon.html" title="Carbon">carbon</a> or biographies of influential people like <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha.html" title="Buddha">Buddha</a> or <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>) without giving any explanation or grounds for this. To be blunt, it is getting tiresome and borderline disruptive. Please try to contribute something useful to these discussions. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:43, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's preposterous. Stating my opinion is not disruptive. I am trying to make my view on the matter heard in these discussions, and I am not going to be discouraged just because certain editors disagree with me. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 14:42, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It may become disruptive when you make the same assertion again and again and (here is the important part) make no effort to back the assertion up. The fact that many editors disagree with the assertion certainly doesn't help matter. I'm not attempting to discourage you, however, your repeated assertions with no attempt to back them up is significantly reducing the signal to noise ratio in the school AfDs. (tI might be less disruptive if you actually tried to do some minimal research to the school articles or bothered cleaning up/expanding any of the myriad school articles you insist on keeping). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 19:55, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Primary schools are not inherently notable. They are indeed <i>"ten a penny"</i> in the UK. Without some other claim to fame, and considering the fact that this school no longer exists, this article is pointless.

<li>To be fair, someone should consider turning all the redlinks black in that article and only having links when notability is proven and asserted. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 14:31, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> both. If next Afd (for the current school) decides to keep the school (which I'm not proposing), a line or two about these two schools can be added there. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 14:38, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The above may be a reasonable compromise- keep the 'daughter' school with a reference to its history and have the parent schools' articles redirect <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlowmonkey_68f2.html" title="User:Blowmonkey">Blowmonkey</a> 07:28, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. First, the fact that the school has closed does not make it less notable. Second, the school is distinct from others because it was affiliated with the Presbyterian Church and its closing was a result of an attempt to create an integrated education system in Northern Ireland. In other words, this is more interesting than an elementary school in suburban New Jersey. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 16:15, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Being affiliated with a random church does not automatically confer notability, nor does closing as a result of education reforms in Northern Ireland.

<li><b>Delete</b> Per Resolute, Ultra-Loser and partially Islay.
