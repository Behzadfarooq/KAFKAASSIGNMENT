<p>Daniel Zachary Epstein was born on June 18, 1983. Some refer to this as D-Day (Daniel-Day). Epstein performed poorly throughout middle and high school, a record which culminated in his expulsion from several undergraduate institutions. Low SAT scores and a basic refusal to engage the humanities, particularly philosophical texts, contributed to Epstein's inability to reenter American institutions. Epstein suffers from asthma and consequently suffered severe weight-gain starting in his 18th year, due to an unhealthy combination of zero exercise and excessive eating. He currently resides in Atlanta, Georgia, in an assisted living facility, where he watches television.</p>

<p>Patrick Cederberg, Kabir Daljeet, Colin Jack, and Marius Masalar are the key components in the unique blend of metal, synth, and intricate keyboard melodies that is Eve of Exile. Patrick tackles the guitar and vocals with thumping riffs and a sophisticated growl, with lyrics that delve deep into his own creative swimming pool. Kabir hits the bass with immense style, aggression, and attitude; slapping it like a freak on a leash, and Colin hammers away on the skins with nothing but pure strength and force, each crack of the snare like a gunshot on a distant battlefield. Finally we have Marius on the keyboard, sliding up and down the keys like ice, pumping out melodies and works of art. Hailing from Mississauga, Ontario, Eve of Exile have managed to get a good grasp on the gun, and shoot for the stars. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ericzorn (talk â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ericzorn_50f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ericzorn">contribs</a>).</small></p>

The theory as a whole is more complicated, and delves into the reasoning as to why men and women can not be friends in any true, non-sexual manner. However, the term intellectual whore itself merely refers to any male who is "kept" by a female for the purposes of moral comfort, security, emotional soakage abilities, and other such non-sexual issues, while the males maintain their presense out of a misguided attempt to secure a romantic relationship.</p>
<p>The term almost always denotes an unhealthy, almost co-dependant relationship between the two people, where the woman is knowingly commiting the falsehood of allowing the male to think they have a chance, while the male is being duped into a painfull relationship, constantly being near what he wants while never obtaining it. The term derives from Dallas Lyn's reading of "The Whore of Mensa", a short story contained within a Woody Allen book entitled "Getting Even". While the term is never explicity used therein, it was the inspiration for the term.</p>
<p>While the male in this situation is termed an Intellectual Whore, the female is usually termed an Intellectual Pimp, although in more extreme cases where true malevolence is shown on her behalf, she may be termed a "Ninja Bitch" by those who believe in the theory.</p>

<p>Some contemporary critics of Roman decadance, such as <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cato_the_younger.html" title="Cato the younger">Cato the younger</a>, attributed its rise to the influence of the Hellanistic philosophy <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epicurianism.html" title="Epicurianism">epicurianism</a>, while modern historians such as <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Gibbon_4de8.html" title="Edward Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a> and Cyril Robinson also attribute increasing Roman affluence and the pacifying luxury it afforded.</p>

<p>One of the nation's most outstanding on-the-floor coaches and basketball organizers and innovators, Foster was the first coach in the history of the NCAA to guide four different Division I schools (Rutgers, Utah, Duke, South Carolina) to 20-win seasons. Listed in Whoâs Who in the United States and Whoâs Who International, Foster was named National Coach of the Year in 1978 after leading Duke to a 27-7 record, the NCAAâs Final Four and national championship game against Kentucky. That teamâs efforts are chronicled in John Feinsteinâs book, "Foreverâs Team."</p>
<p>1974-75 brought Coach Foster to the helm at Duke University where he inherited a team that had finished the previous season with a 10-16 record. Fosterâs fourth Duke team went to the NCAA national championship game. While at Duke, Fosterâs teams made three straight NCAA tournament appearances and earned a #1 national ranking. He was also named Coach of the Year.</p>
<p>Coach Foster has been named to several sports halls of fame, served as a college basketball analyst for CBS, ESPN and others, coached numerous all-star teams, and had almost 40 players play professional basketball. In 2003, he joined basketball greats like John Wooden, Bill Bradley, Henry Iba and others when he was named the National Invitational Tournamentâs âMan of the Year.â</p>
<p>Foster is a native of Norwood, Pa. and currently serves as special assistant to the commissioner of the Western Athletic Conference. Foster served in the United States Air Force and graduated from Elizabethtown College and earned a Master's Degree from Temple University. He is married to Shirley Foster and has four daughters: Vicki Foster, Debbie Smith, Julie Foster, and Mary Foster.</p>

<p>The Track &amp; Field Organisation is a record label/promotional agency based out of North London. They have some ties (not sure whether formal or informal) to the American Elephant 6 recording collective, and sell LPs by Elephant 6 bands such as Great Lakes, The Ladybug Transistor and of Montreal, as well as promoting some of their own bands, such as Kicker and The Loves. While living in London, I became a fan of a few of their house bands and went to many of their events -- they may still have monthly meetings at the Betsy Trottwood Public House in Islington, which is how I became aquainted with them. However, upon my return to the States, I was unable to find very much information about them, as their own website &lt;<a href="http://www.trackandfield.org.uk/" class="external free" title="http://www.trackandfield.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.trackandfield.org.uk/</a>&gt; isn't exactly chock-full of information.</p>
<p>Because I myself don't know a whole lot about the label, I'm hoping that creating a wikipedia entry about the Track &amp; Field Organisation will acrete more information as people more familiar with T&amp;F than myself will add info to it. In particular, I would like to see an article about Track &amp; Field because of their devotion to classic British and American soup and pop music, something sorely underrepresented in the current musical landscape.</p>

<p>Incommunicado is a progressive punk rock music group from Pittsburgh, PA formed in 2004. The members of the band are Chris Feigh on vocals, Mobie Estus on guitar, Fred Fenner on bass, Chris Williams on drums, and Ryan Warmbrodt on guitar. The band name was chosen due to the band itself being disgusted by the incessant, self centered mingling and networking plus conceited nature of the other bands from the area. The definition of the word is âin solitary confinementâ and âto deprive of communicationâ which is the state that the band says itâs in when in the midst of pompous company. Just as known as Incommunicado's music is their ethical stance. They stand as a rare example of a band that remains loyal to independent values, following through in the spirit of the original "DIY punk ethic" with all booking and merchandise done themselves for instance. The band formed when Chris Feigh and Brian Estus met drummer Steve Sobeck, now a member of a stoner rock band called Satanic Bat. Incommunicado later added Fred Fenner on the bass after meeting him in an online musicians ad. The line-up was complete after Ryan Warmbrodt then became the other guitarist. In 2005, Steve left the band, and they recruited Chris Williams, whom the band met through a mutual friend. Incommunicado released a five song EP in early 2005 which was well received and provided even more exposure to their growing fan base in Pittsburgh and abroad. A new full-length album is scheduled for release in early 2006.</p>

<p>"Best glide" refers to the airspeed of an airplane where lift and drag are balanced to permit maximum range while gliding. On a total drag curve, which adds the curves showing <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parasite_drag.html" title="Parasite drag">parasite drag</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Induced_drag.html" title="Induced drag">induced drag</a> versus airspeed, the lowest point on the curve is the best glide airspeed. This airspeed is known as L/Dmax. Flying slower than this airspeed reduces range by producing excess induced drag, while flying faster produces excess parasite drag.</p>

<p>A Rockford turn is an alternative colloquial expression to <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootleg_turn.html" title="Bootleg turn">bootleg turn</a> for a particular <a href="../../../d/r/i/Driving.html" title="Driving">driving</a> manoeuvre. This term for the manoeuvre is derived from the depiction of its use in the opening credits of the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> show <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rockford_Files_e643.html" title="The Rockford Files">The Rockford Files</a>. The manoeuvre is also variously referred to as a "J-turn" and a "<a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootleg_turn.html" title="Bootleg turn">bootleg turn</a>". However, the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootleg_turn.html" title="Bootleg turn">bootleg turn</a> is described elsewhere as being performed starting in a forward direction, and the Rockford as described herein is referred to as a bootleg variation called a moonshiner's turn.</p>
<p>Briefly, the manoeuvre is performed by starting from a standing start, then accelerating sharply in reverse. When approximate maximum speed in reverse is attained, then the driver twists the wheel hard to one side, while simultaneously applying the brakes heavily in order to lock the wheels (the <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergency_brake.html" title="Emergency brake">emergency brake</a> may also be employed to the same effect). The intended result is a slide 180 degrees to face forwards, followed by the driver immediately shifting into forward gear and accelerating sharply. A <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macho.html" title="Macho">macho</a> spinning of wheels adds to the visual appeal.</p>
<p>The manoeuvre is clearly employed when one's car is situated facing the wrong way and a rapid turnaround and departure is desired. However, it is unclear how much this manoeuvre is productively employed outside of fiction.</p>

<p>C4C describes itself as being "supported by individuals across Europe" However, its finances are not transparent, and its website acknowledges the backing of software multinationals such as Microsoft and SAP.

<p>The <b>Big Pature</b> was 450,000 acres of prairie land, in what is now southwestern Oklahoma, reserved for grazing use by the Cheyenne Arapho tribes after their reserve was opened for settlement by a land run on April 19, 1892. The Big Pasture was maintained until June 5, 1906, when Congress passed an act (chapter 2580, 34 Stat. 213) requiring that it be disposed of by alloting in severalty to each child born into the tribes after the act of 1900, each child receiving 160 acres. The remaining land was sold by sealed bid in December of 1906 and the proceeds placed in the U.S. Treasurey for the tribes.

<p>Magneurol is a blend of herbs and vitamin which contains a unique and rare ingredient called "Magnetite" which is believed to be the source in the brain allowing animals to demonstrate sixth sense-like abilities more commonly referred to as ESP.</p>
<p>The company RemCure Enterprises says that most life has magnetite and humans do also in varying amounts, suggesting this is why some humans experience paranormal phenomenon and others with lower amounts do not.</p>
<p>"Animals have long been known to sense magnetic fields," said Baard Williams, spokesperson for RemCure Enterprises(TM). "Fin whales mysteriously follow the Earth's geo-magnetic fields. Canines demonstrate the ability to predict earthquakes and, additionally, in India an entire tribe escaped the recent Tsunami two days before the devastating wave."</p>
<p>What science has uncovered is that magnetite has been found in animals, human tissue and plants, strengthening the belief that magnetite gives the ability to sense the Earth's magnetic fields. Animals appear to have higher levels of magnetite than humans, allowing them to perform spectacular feats of paranormal awareness as a result of their connection with the Earth's magnetic fields.</p>
<p>RemCure believes that magnetite levels can be safely increased in human beings with the blend Magneurol.</p>

<p>Johnny Irion originates from a family of artists. His grandfather, Fred Knight, a tenor singer, was cast in the traveling Broadway show, âOklahomaâ just before retiring from the stage. His grandmother, Rubilee Knight is a classical violinist. His uncle, Thomas Steinbeck, son of John Steinbeck, writes books and screenplays. Having been surrounded by music all of his life, then exposed to great literature by his uncle, writing and performing was a natural progression for him.</p>
<p>At fifteen, Johnny started a band, Queen Sarah Saturday with his neighborhood friends. In 1993 Queen Sarah Saturday inked a double CD recording contract with Sonyâs alternative label, Thirsty Ear. The band toured extensively across the U.S. and Canada winning a wide fan base. Their first video made the MTV rotation. The video also made the college top ten charts with Johnny's original song âSeemsâ. âSeemsâ was later used in Liv Tylerâs debut movie, âEmpire Recordsâ.</p>
<p>When the band members went their separate ways, Johnny toured with Dillon Fence, singing and playing guitar on their U.S. and European tour with the Black Crowes. Encouraged by Chris Robinson of the Black Crowes, Johnny moved to Los Angeles. While in Los Angeles, Tom Rothrock, producer and owner of Bongload Records and Acid Blues Records brought Johnny on board to sing and play guitar on some of his studio projects.</p>
<p>In 1999, Johnny partnered with Sarah Lee Guthrie, (daughter of Arlo Guthrie) and Tao Rodriguez-Seeger, (grandson of Pete Seeger). Using their last names, they formed the folk trio RIG. In between writing, playing piano and guitar and singing, he tours with his wife, Sarah Lee Guthrie. Johnny has played venues from Royal Albert Hall and Carnegie Hall to more intimate house concerts. Going back to his Southern roots, Johnny expresses his music in a contemporary, original folk rock sound.</p>
<p>âUnity Lodgeâ was released in March of 2001 and "Exploration" in 2005.</p>
<p>Johnnyâs writing is often compared to the early, more poetic works of Neil Young. He appeared as a musician in John Malkovichâs film, âGhost Worldâ and made a guest appearance on the CBS series, âThe Jobâ.</p>

<p>The true name of Satan, the Kabalists say, is that of Yahveh reversed; for Satan is not a black God, but the negation of God. The Devil is the personification of Atheism or Idolatry. For the Initiates, this is not a person, but a force, created for good, but which may serve for evil. It is the instrument of Liberty or free will. They represent this Force, which presides over the physical generation, under the mythologic and horned form of the God Pan; thence the he-goat of the Sabbat, brother of the Ancient Serpent, and the light bearer or Phosphor, of which the poets have made the false Lucifer of the legend. -Albert Pike âMorals and Dogmaâ Ancient and Accepted Rite of Free Masonry written and published in 1875.</p>
<p>The Sinagogue of Satan is a religion based on the Ancient and Accepted Rite of Free Masonryâs definition of Satanism, as described in Albert Pikeâs work âMorals and Dogmaâ, from which the paragraph at the top of this page was taken. This religion is not based on those of the popular Satanists of our day, Hollywood or Christian propaganda, except for Aleister Crowley. His connection with the Freemasons and the fact the Sinagogue of Satan took their name from a short story in his book Konx om Pax, called âThien Tao; or, The Synagogue of Satan.â The Sinagogue of Satan cannot be denied nor can they deny being a by-product of the Thelemic family.</p>
<p>Interestingly, members of Anton LaVey's Church of Satan and other Satanist organizations and groups are known to have membership in the the Sinagogue of Satan.</p>

Finance studies and addresses the ways in which individuals, businesses and organizations raise, allocate and use monetary resources over time, taking into account the risks entailed in their projects, The study of finance is as much an art as a science, it requires one to be crafty in choosing ones investments wisely and requires some amount of wisdom on the part of the investor.</p>

<p>Recently a patend has been granted on "Rotation of Sound".The unique characteristic of âRotation of Soundâ has a greater auditory impact mainly because of its moving (rotational) features. Thus, RS has a greater âimpact valueâ in the binaural auditory science. Basic characteristics of different forms of acoustic radiation are based on the amplitude â frequency â phase manipulation. In neither of them is motion (rotational) domain.</p>
<p>We know that humans can best judge the characteristics and the quality of a sound. Method of âRotation of Soundâ produces the perception of complete rotation (360 degrees) in head preferably when listener is with a headphone set through only a two-channel audio playback device. Putting dynamics on stationary auditory perception Rotating Sound has becomes a high-end sensual projection to evoke better response. Neuro-Psychological study has shown that âRotation of Soundâ has a greater perceptual impact on human brain. Paper has been accepted in International Journal of Neuroscience. Rotation of Sound is originated by Sajal Bandopadhyay, WINGARD, Institute of Visual and Auditory Science, Kolkata,India. In conclusion, it is stated that the invention described above opens up a new challenge in the field of auditory science especially in binaural Auditory Neuroscience.</p>
<p>In addition, those skilled in the art will further appreciate the essential spirit and scope of the invention.</p>

<p>Founder of Ahmadiyya movement who claimed to be the Promissed Messeih &amp; Mahdi.</p>
<p>The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam is a religious organization, international in its scope, with branches in over 178 countries in Africa, North America, South America, Asia, Australasia, and Europe. At present, its total membership exceeds 200 million worldwide, and the numbers are increasing day by day. This is the most dynamic denomination of Islam in modern history.</p>
<p>The Ahmadiyya Movement was established in 1889 by Hadhrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908) in a small and remote village, Qadian, in the Punjab, India. He claimed to be the expected reformer of the latter days, the Awaited One of the world community of religions (The Mahdi and Messiah). The Movement he started is an embodiment of the benevolent message of Islam -- peace, universal brotherhood, and submission to the Will of God -- in its pristine purity. Hadhrat Ahmad proclaimed Islam as the religion of man:</p>
<pre>
"The religion of the people of the right path" (98:6)
</pre>
<p>With this conviction, the Ahmadiyya Movement, within a century, has reached the corners of the Earth. Wherever the Movement is established, it endeavors to exert a constructive influence of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> through social projects, educational institutes, health services, Islamic publications and construction of mosques, despite being bitterly persecuted in some countries. Ahmadi Muslims have earned the distinction of being a law-abiding, peaceful, persevering and benevolent community.</p>
<p>The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam was created under divine guidance with the objective to rejuvenate Islamic moral and spiritual values. It encourages interfaith dialogue, and diligently defends Islam and tries to correct misunderstandings about Islam in the West. It advocates peace, tolerance, love and understanding among followers of different faiths. It firmly believes in and acts upon the Qur'anic teaching:</p>
<p>"There is no compulsion in religion." (2:257)</p>
<p>It strongly rejects violence and terrorism in any form and for any reason. The Movement offers a clear presentation of Islamic wisdom, philosophy, morals and spirituality as derived from the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Qur%27an_2e07.html" title="Holy Qur'an">Holy Qur'an</a> and the practice (Sunnah) of the Holy Prophet of Islam, <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> (peace and blessings of Allah be on him). Some Ahmadis', like late Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan (who served as the first Foreign Minister of Pakistan; President of the 17th General Assembly of U.N.O.; President and Judge of the International Court of Justice, at the Hague), and Dr. Abdus Salam (the Nobel Laureate in Physics in 1979), have also been recognized by the world community for their outstanding services and achievements. After the demise of its founder, the Ahmadiyya Movement has been headed by his elected successors -- Khalifas. The present Head of the Movement, Hadhrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad, was elected in 2003. His official title is Khalifatul Massih V.</p>

<p>I think transient cookie should be listed as a synonym for session cookie in computer science. Transient is a more logical description because its opposite is the persistent cookie that is retained in computer memory when the browser is closed; transient cookies are deleted when the browser is closed [whether they are absolutely purged from the computer would be an interesting issue to pursue. What brought this to my attention is todays news stories that the National Security Agency has inserted "illegal cookies," I think that means persistent, onto the computers of visitors to its site in order to track their surfing. It promised to stop this practice but how "stopped" would it be if "erased" cookies were secretly retained? My understanding is that it's impossible to absolutely destroy data on a hard drive. The only way to do that is to totally physically destroy the HD, as by, say, sanding it to a powder; but this probably isn't true for data held in Random Access Memory...conventional wisdom has been that data there is absoulutely erased when electrical power is cut off. I'm no expert in this, but I think some experts should be consulted.] The relationship of persistent and transient less clear when session is used, altho session is the more widely used adjective.</p>

<p>Yavorka - A growing trend in the Pittsburgh, PA, USA area, is for the youth of the city to toast to yavorka upon drinking. The origin is still unknown, but it seems to have stemmed from this website. <a href="http://www.yavorka.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yavorka.com" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. Typically each person raises their drink, says yavorka and then drinks their favorite beverage, wishing each other good drinking. The yavorka trend seems most popular in the northern areas of the city currently, but has spread to the city's South side and as far as Westmoreland County.</p>

<p><b>Asius</b>. There are at least two characters in Greek mythology with this name, both associated with the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trojan_War_017a.html" title="Trojan War">Trojan War</a>, and both minor characters in <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer.html" title="Homer">Homer</a>'s <a href="../../../i/l/i/Iliad.html" title="Iliad">Iliad</a>. One Asius was a son of <a href="../../../h/y/r/Hyrtacus.html" title="Hyrtacus">Hyrtacus</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arisbe.html" title="Arisbe">Arisbe</a>, the first wife of King <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priam.html" title="Priam">Priam</a> and daughter of <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merops.html" title="Merops">Merops</a>, the seer of Percote. This Asius led the contingent from a cluster of towns on both sides of the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellespont.html" title="Hellespont">Hellespont</a>, including <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arisbe.html" title="Arisbe">Arisbe</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Percote.html" title="Percote">Percote</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/s/Sestus.html" title="Sestus">Sestus</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/y/Abydus.html" title="Abydus">Abydus</a>. Asius himself resided in the town of Arisbe, by the river Selleis, and this may have been the capital of this little Hellespontine domain. Asius had a brother named <a href="../../../n/i/s/Nisus.html" title="Nisus">Nisus</a>, and two sons named Adamas and Phaenops. All four men (Asius, Nisus, Adamas, Phaenops) fought at <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy.html" title="Troy">Troy</a>, as allies of King Priam. Adamas was killed by <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meriones.html" title="Meriones">Meriones</a> before <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy.html" title="Troy">Troy</a>, and Phaenops (who came from Abydus), was a close friend to Hector - <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo.html" title="Apollo">Apollo</a> once adopted the form of Phaenops to address <a href="../../../h/e/c/Hector.html" title="Hector">Hector</a>. Asius, son of Hyrtacus, was killed by the Cretan king <a href="../../../i/d/o/Idomeneus.html" title="Idomeneus">Idomeneus</a>.</p>
<p>The other Asius was a <a href="../../../p/h/r/Phrygian.html" title="Phrygian">Phrygian</a> and son of King <a href="../../../d/y/m/Dymas.html" title="Dymas">Dymas</a>, and brother of Queen <a href="../../../h/e/c/Hecabe.html" title="Hecabe">Hecabe</a> of Troy. He belonged to a tribe of Phrygians who resided by the River <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sangarius.html" title="Sangarius">Sangarius</a>. In the Iliad, Apollo is said to have taken Asius's shape to encourage Hector to fight <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patroclus.html" title="Patroclus">Patroclus</a>. This Asius survives the Iliad, but <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictys_Cretensis_60c0.html" title="Dictys Cretensis">Dictys Cretensis</a> says he was slain by <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telamonian_Aias_f3c8.html" title="Telamonian Aias">Ajax</a>. Asius, son of Dymas, is not listed near the beginning of the Iliad as a leader of the Phrygians; that honor goes to <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascanius.html" title="Ascanius">Ascanius</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phorcys.html" title="Phorcys">Phorcys</a>, both from Phrygian Ascania. The connection between the Phrygians of Ascania and Asius's Phrygians from by the River Sangarius is unclear in the Iliad, as elsewhere. There may have been two Phrygian tribes in northwest Asia Minor, each with a separate king.</p>
<p>The name Asius might be associated with 'Asia', given that both the above mythological personages hail from Asia Minor (which the ancient Greeks knew as 'Asia'). However, there was an ancient town in <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crete.html" title="Crete">Crete</a> named Asos (or Oasos). Although neither Asius appears to be Cretan (one is from Arisbe by the Hellespont, the other from Phrygia), Greek mythological sources describe ties between Asia Minor and Crete in the generations before the Trojan War. King <a href="../../../t/e/u/Teucer.html" title="Teucer">Teucer</a>, a mythical ancestor of the Trojans, is said to have been Cretan (although other sources claim he was indigenous to the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troas.html" title="Troas">Troas</a>, and a son of the River God <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scamander.html" title="Scamander">Scamander</a>).

<p>Logan was born into the âRoyal House of Dangartheâ. He never wanted to rule. He learned martial arts, fencing, weapons handling, war tactics, politics, history, culture, and etiquette. His older brother Timothee and his parents were all killed in a battle against the Techno Union. Logan ruled his people for two years. After those two years his younger brother took the throne so Logan could become Senator.</p>
<p>Logan was a twelve year old senator. He became one of the youngest politicians in the Galactic Senate to date. He started in the senate in 22 B.B.Y. and fought for the creation of an army of the republic. He was many targets of assassination attempts. Logan was bold, and a young idealist. Since he was so young many thought him naÃ¯ve, a brat, and un-ambitious.</p>
<p>Logan met Senator Bail Organa who introduced his to Mon Mothma and many Jedi. When Count Dooku called people to a meeting to create the Confederacy of independent Systems Logan sent a spy. Logan sent his predecessor Senator Rouge to spy on the Confederacy. He told Rouge to supply the confederacy only with credits (currency).</p>
<p>Logan was a very cunning senator. He tricked Palpatine into making his a Governor. This appointment would help him spy for the Loyalist Committee. Logan was one of the senators to sign the Delegation of 2000. Along with Padmâe, Mon, Bail, Rouge, Jar-Jar, and Bel um-Clar.</p>
<p>After the Empire was created Logan was still a Governor. He did not change thing for the people in the sectors that he controlled. They noticed no change so were not mad with the Empire. During the Raid on the Jedi Temple he went to investigate and saved a young eleven year old Padawan and adopted him...</p>

<p>Pali is a member of the Indo-European language family, and the language of the earliest (Theravada) Buddhist scriptures. An abbreviation of pali-bhasa (lit. âthe language of the texts) it is today unspoken/understood save for Theravada monks, devotees and scholars. Its grammar and vocabulary are similar to that of the Sanskrit language which similarly developed in North India. Modern philologists classify the language as a form of Middle Indo-Aryan, or Prakrit as those languages are known in the Indian tradition. The dates surrounding the origin of the Pali language are unclear, although scholars speculate that the first texts were written in Sri Lanka at some point during the 1st century B.C.E, but as a spoken language it probably dates back far further. The texts written in the language are grouped together under the title of the âPali Canonâ, which is around fifteen times the size of the Bible. Grammatically, it is highly inflected with eight separate cases for nouns (Nominative, Accusative, Instrumental, Dative, Genitive, Locative and Vocative), and a complex verb system. Phonetically, it is again similar to Sanskrit, although this was probably due to adherence a simultaneous linguistic movement which sought to formalise the Sanskrit language (see Geiger, Wilhelm, "A Pali Grammar")</p>

<p>A telephone patch (also sometimes known as a "hybrid" or a "<a href="../../../c/o/u/Coupler.html" title="Coupler">coupler</a>") is a device used by radio and television stations to connect a telephone line to studio microphones and speakers (or headphones and earpieces for <a href="../../../f/e/e/Feedback.html" title="Feedback">feedback</a> control reasons), allowing practical call-in shows where the host may interact with callers.</p>
<p>From a telephony standpoint, a patch is simply a telephone with a hold button, a release (hang up) button, and an on-hold indicator light. (This may, of course, be extended to dozens of telephone lines under manual or computer control, and may include dozens of other features like caller queueing, caller ID, etc.)</p>
<p>From a professional audio standpoint, a telephone patch is a line-level audio source and also requires a line-level audio feed, typically provided as 600 ohm balanced mono <a href="../../../x/l/r/XLR_a185.html" title="XLR">XLR</a> connectors. There is often also an input for <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_on_hold.html" title="Music on hold">music on hold</a>, which is usually provided by an undelayed feed of the program's audio, which allows callers to come "up to speed" with the current conversation and (usually) reminds them to turn down their radios or television sets.</p>
<p>Echo cancellation, level control, electrical isolation and many other subtle features are essentials in even the simplest telephone patch.</p>

<p>Saint Holos was a Caucasian female of Armenian decent who was born in Armenia but was later relocated to a newly established small village which was populated by Armenian immigrants in The Republic Iran (Persia) called Peria, because of the 1915 genocide of The Armenians by the Ottoman Turks in her motherland, Armenia .</p>
<p>She had a normal life as a child and later as a teenager in Peria where she spent most of her life. (Besides the early years when she lived in Armenia)</p>
<p>When she got older , she discovered that she could go into altered states of consciousness (Trance) where she was able to communicate with Angels.</p>
<p>She was the "medicine-women" of her village and provided herbal cures and remedies to her fellow villagers free of charge. Her only reward was to see their pains go away and see the smiles on their faces once again.</p>
<p>As with most people of that age , especially of the female population , she did not have a formal education and as such she could not read nor write .</p>
<p>All of her knowledge about healing people came from communicating with Angels . When she did not know what to do and how to cure her patients , she would go into a trance state where she would learn what to do from "Angels of the Lord" .</p>
<p>In cases where no other option was available , she could cure the sick by praying for them . She could also perform this service from distance in cases where she could not go to the patient and / or the patient could not come to her.</p>
<p>It is said by many of the villagers that when she was at an age where she could not be of assistance to the villagers , she was picked up by to "Angels" who took her to a "cloud" (Possibly an Unidentified Flying Object (U.F.O.)?) where she ascended to the heavens and to The Almighty Lord Jehovah where his mighty kingdom resides . . No pictures or paintings of Saint Holos are known to exist.</p>

<p>Christ Church Cheltenham is a growing, family church. We see ourselves as a Christian community, grouped around the call of Jesus.</p>
<p>In our worshipping life we aim to âchoose from the whole menuâ in a broad diet of worshipping styles. At different occasions, and often combined, worship is led by Christ Churchâs choir and by the worship group New Creation. Preaching is shared by a lay and clergy team of nine. Standing in the evangelical tradition, we love and teach the Bible.</p>
<p>Christ Church is fuelled by daily prayer and by occasional congregational prayer meetings.</p>
<p>A small evangelism working party oversees the delivery of Alpha courses, Prayer Visiting, Welcome Evenings and other forms of outreach. Meanwhile a separate World Mission working party oversees the spending of a growing budget for Godâs work here and overseas. We are privileged nearer home to meet many people through baptisms, weddings and funerals.</p>
<p>This is a way of life we believe weâre called to hand on to a new generation. The whole family is catered for at Christ Church, from the crÃ¨che, through childrenâs groups and on into our youth work. For adults we host a network of home groups and a Friendship Club for older people. Christ Church also runs an excellent OFSTED-inspected Playgroup.</p>
<p>Christ Church is growing steadily at the moment, for which we thank God. Weâd like to think weâre an easy church to join, so do come and pay us a visit sometime. Within a growing congregation itâs important that everyone feels cared for. So a careful system of pastoral care seeks to express mutual support within the church family. Our Prayer Ministry team is also busy, praying with and for individuals who need Godâs help.</p>
<p>We value our links with the wider community, working closely with the neighbouring church school. Our suite of halls and rooms is also in constant use.</p>
<p>We repeat our invitation to come and see us sometime â it would be lovely to welcome you.</p>

<p><b>Holofiber</b> is the world's first "Responsive Textile". Clinical studies conducted at the University of Loyola by Dr. Lawrence A. Lavery found test subjects wearing Holofiber garments demonstrated "a measurable increase in sub-dermal oxygenation" levels in the hands and feet.</p>
<p>As an application, it is commonly worn by persons with circulatory impairment problems (such as persons with Diabetes and/or Reynaud's Syndrome).</p>
<p>Holofiber is also worn by numerous professional athletes as a means to enhance their performance. Athletes include World Tri-Athlete Champion Michellie Jones, world-reknowned Adventure Racer Lawrence Foster, and Ultra-Marathoner Ray Zahab.</p>
<p>Holofiber was developed and created by Dr. Robert Klein, a pioneer in holistic medicine, and David Horinek. The fiber is a derivative of the polyester family. The active components in Holofiber are composed of a blend of minerals and gemstones that are ground to a fine powder and then sheathed in a polyester filament. When exposed to ambient environmental energy (thermal heat, UV Light), the fiber resonates within a specific frequency range that has been shown to relaz the capillaries and increase oxygen circulation. The technology was developed as a non-pharmacological response to circulation enhancement.</p>
<p>Holofiber can be found in a number of garments, including socks, gloves and underwear. More information can be found on the Holofiber Website at [www.Holofiber.com], including articles about the fiber in publications such as the New York Times and Textile World Magazine.</p>
<p>Despite it's claims, Holofiber is still fighting an uphill battle for acceptance. Further testing is still required to validate initial test results. While some wearers claim to feel a "warming" or "tingling" sensation, many wearers fail to experience this. The verdict is still out about Holofiber's effectiveness, but if proven, it represents an exciting new approach to dealing with injury, pain, and discomfort.</p>

<p>Mack and Mesh are two people who started a series of videos showing off Mesh, who is a really scared individual, playing games that are meant to be frightening. Mack then records Mesh playing these games and uploads them to the internet for other people to watch. These videos are usually really funny, and aren't staged at all. The newest series of videos are ones of Mesh playing F.E.A.R.</p>

<p>This is an AMAZING song from Pink Floyd's <a href="../../../m/o/m/Momentary_Lapse_of_Reason_1639.html" title="Momentary Lapse of Reason">Momentary Lapse of Reason</a> album.</p>
<p><i>The author's name, the date the album was released and the lyrics to this song should appear here</i>.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Momentary Lapse of Reason is right up there with Wish You Were Here -- Pink Floyd's most "popular" album, according to available statistics.</p>
<p>I have loved Pink Floyd's music for a VERY LONG TIME. I wore out my first copy of [Dark Side of the Moon] in the summer of 1973, and I believe I am familiar with all of the Pink Floyd albums ever released. No other band even comes CLOSE to creating such a powerful, all-encompassing effect upon any sensitive listener (except MAYBE the Moody Blues).</p>
<p>Anyway, all of the songs from the [Momentary Lapse of Reason] album should appear in Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Broad Street was one of the two original main avenues in Philadelphia. It, along with Market Street, intersect at the center of Philadelphia's famed city hall. William Penn when planning the city, designed number streets, but called 14th street Broad, just as he called first street Front Street. Broad Street has the unique position of being halfway inbetween the delaware and schuykill rivers. Broad Street is home to many things, including the Kimmel Center and Academy of Music on the so-called Avenue of the Arts, as well as the Philadelphia Sports complex. North Broad Street, above Spring Garden, is known for being a hub of Philadelphia African-American culture. Also on North Broad Street is Temple University. Other schools on Broad street include Girls High School, and just down the street Central High School and Lasalle University, the Philadelphia school for the creative and performing arts, and Roman Catholic High School. Broad street at the city limits turns into route 611, which is an avenue with stores serving the wealthy northern suburbs. Broad street is also home to the broad street line subway, which carries hundreds of thousands of passengers a day. every year broadstreet is shut down for the ten-mile long broad street run.</p>

<p>There is a well known trend for recreational <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recreational_drug_use.html" title="Recreational drug use">drug users</a> to use two or more <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychotropic_drugs.html" title="Psychotropic drugs">drugs</a> in combination to achieve a particular effect.

<p>I cannot find any existing Wikipedia article which deals adequately with this phenomenon.</p>

<p><b>Avea</b> is the only GSM 1800 operator in Turkey. It has been founded in 2004 with the merger of the two GSM operators Aycell (<a href="../../../t/u/r/Turk_Telekom_628d.html" title="Turk Telekom">Turk Telekom</a>) and <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aria.html" title="Aria">Aria</a> (joint venture of Is Bankasi (51%) and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telecom_Italia_Mobile_1b2e.html" title="Telecom Italia Mobile">Telecom Italia Mobile</a> (49%)). TIM and Turk Telekom own 40% stake each and Is Bank Group holds 20%. Its competitors, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkcell.html" title="Turkcell">Turkcell</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telsim.html" title="Telsim">Telsim</a>, both use the GSM 900 standard and have been founded in 1994.</p>

<p>The merge of two GSM operators has resulted in the need of redesigning the network architecture to extend coverage and to solve the issues created by the network load. Avea has been able of terminating most of that process about one year after its creation, and currently covers a vast majority of Turkey's land area with more than 7000 <a href="../../../b/a/s/Base_station.html" title="Base station">base stations</a> (A map can be found on <a href="http://www.gsmworld.com/cgi-bin/ni_map.pl?cc=tr&amp;net=it" class="external text" title="http://www.gsmworld.com/cgi-bin/ni_map.pl?cc=tr&amp;net=it" rel="nofollow">The GSM World Web Page</a>). Differently from <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkcell.html" title="Turkcell">Turkcell</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telsim.html" title="Telsim">Telsim</a>, Avea doesn't have an extension in the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus_c705.html" title="Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus">Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus</a> and customers therefore roam on the KKTC Turkcell and KKTC Telsim networks.</p>
<p>Being a merge of two networks, Avea suffers from the heteregeneity of roaming partners and customers with numbers beginning with 50 and 55 don't have the same list of roaming partners (see <a href="http://www.avea.com.tr/mps/portal?cmd=roaming&amp;menustate=9&amp;pagemenu=dolasim.aria.ortaklar&amp;type=0&amp;lang=en" class="external text" title="http://www.avea.com.tr/mps/portal?cmd=roaming&amp;menustate=9&amp;pagemenu=dolasim.aria.ortaklar&amp;type=0&amp;lang=en" rel="nofollow">the list of roaming partners for 505 customers</a> and <a href="http://www.avea.com.tr/mps/portal?cmd=roaming&amp;menustate=9&amp;pagemenu=dolasim.aria.ortaklar&amp;type=1&amp;lang=en" class="external text" title="http://www.avea.com.tr/mps/portal?cmd=roaming&amp;menustate=9&amp;pagemenu=dolasim.aria.ortaklar&amp;type=1&amp;lang=en" rel="nofollow">the list of roaming partners for 555 customers</a> for the different partners' lists). Avea also offers GPRS / EDGE / 3G roaming in multiple countries (see <a href="http://www.avea.com.tr/mps/portal?cmd=staticpage&amp;filename=kapsamavedolasim/dolasim/505_gprsortaklar.html&amp;menustate=9&amp;lang=en&amp;pagemenu=dolasim.gprsortaklari.505" class="external text" title="http://www.avea.com.tr/mps/portal?cmd=staticpage&amp;filename=kapsamavedolasim/dolasim/505_gprsortaklar.html&amp;menustate=9&amp;lang=en&amp;pagemenu=dolasim.gprsortaklari.505" rel="nofollow">the list of GPRS roaming partners for 505 customers</a> and <a href="http://www.avea.com.tr/mps/portal?cmd=staticpage&amp;filename=kapsamavedolasim/dolasim/555_gprsortaklar.html&amp;menustate=9&amp;lang=en&amp;pagemenu=dolasim.gprsortaklari.555" class="external text" title="http://www.avea.com.tr/mps/portal?cmd=staticpage&amp;filename=kapsamavedolasim/dolasim/555_gprsortaklar.html&amp;menustate=9&amp;lang=en&amp;pagemenu=dolasim.gprsortaklari.555" rel="nofollow">the list of GPRS roaming partners for 555 customers</a>).</p>

<p>As the latest participant in the Turkish GSM sector, <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aria.html" title="Aria">Aria</a>, Aycell and Avea have been obliged to offer lower prices to attract a maximal number of customers. Consequently, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkcell.html" title="Turkcell">Turkcell</a> (the leader of the Turkish GSM market) has lowered down its intra-network call rates by a third after the creation of <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aria.html" title="Aria">Aria</a>, and divided by two all call rates when Avea has been launched.</p>
<p>Currently, customers pay between 0 and 0.35 <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Turkish_Lira_5ee1.html" title="New Turkish Lira">New Turkish Liras</a> per minute for national calls and between 0.32 and 2.1 <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Turkish_Lira_5ee1.html" title="New Turkish Lira">New Turkish Liras</a> per minute for international calls (for details, see <a href="http://www.avea.com.tr/mps/portal?cmd=staticpage&amp;filename=urunlervetarifeler/index.html&amp;menustate=1&amp;lang=en" class="external text" title="http://www.avea.com.tr/mps/portal?cmd=staticpage&amp;filename=urunlervetarifeler/index.html&amp;menustate=1&amp;lang=en" rel="nofollow">The Avea Tariffs Web site</a>); which roughly corresponds to respectively 0, 0.20, 0.19 and 1.1 <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro.html" title="Euro">Euros</a> per minute. The very common SMS service costs between 0 and 0.06 <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Turkish_Lira_5ee1.html" title="New Turkish Lira">New Turkish Liras</a> per SMS for national SMS messages, and 0.21 <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Turkish_Lira_5ee1.html" title="New Turkish Lira">New Turkish Liras</a> for international ones (which corresponds to 0, 0.03 and 0.12 <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euros.html" title="Euros">Euros</a>) (you can see the <a href="http://www.avea.com.tr/mps/portal?cmd=staticpage&amp;filename=servisler/ucretler/faturali.html&amp;menustate=2&amp;lang=en&amp;pagemenu=ucretler.faturali" class="external text" title="http://www.avea.com.tr/mps/portal?cmd=staticpage&amp;filename=servisler/ucretler/faturali.html&amp;menustate=2&amp;lang=en&amp;pagemenu=ucretler.faturali" rel="nofollow">Avea Service Tariffs Web Site</a> for details).</p>
<p>We can therefore see that the new participants had a positive effect for the users, and that the general call as well as service costs are lower than in most European countries.</p>

<p>The artist spent four and a half years becoming heavily tattooed with his own designs. Raised as a Roman Catholic but with strong influences form Indian members of his family, Wagstaffâs tattoo designs draw strongly on his religious upbringing and consist of symbols and patterns that are found in almost every culture in the world (circles, squares, swastikas, stars etc). <a href="http://www.leewagstaff.com/press.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.leewagstaff.com/press.htm" rel="nofollow">Wagstaff</a> is interested in the migration and spontaneous generation of geometric forms; how the same shapes and patterns can be found in diverse cultures over vast geographic areas.</p>
<p>The artist has used the medium of tattoo to transform his body into a work of âliving artâ, a celebration of form and geometry using the fundamental concept of mark making combined with the creative possibilities of the human body. Wagstaff has become form and content as well as subject and object.</p>
<p>Alongside the large format photographs Wagstaff has also shown âShroudâ; a life size impression of the artist screen-printed using his own blood. Blood is a byproduct of tattooing so it seemed natural for the artist to use this in his work.</p>
<p>âThe emergence of Leeâs image on the Shroud elevates him to the status of a surrogate divine seemingly without the intervention of God. It comes off as both disquietingly heroic and at the same time spiritually arrogantâ - DAVID BOWIE --88.108.91.117 23:05, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am new to this I saw an article on the bbc and it said that wikipedia was a place to put info about things or people that you have info about I am sorry I deleted your comment but you made me feel like I was an idiot and that my info was of no relevance, now I can see that this site is has people like you who don't even identify themselves, dictating what should and should not be on here, maybe Lee should not but Franko B and Sterlarc are internationally known and extreemly relevant to the section about body art but I guess their info won't last long because you know better.

<p>It is one of the un- recognised styles of Karate, being more of a sub- category to Shotokan style. Schools of the style are found in countries like Australia, America, New Zealand, Great Britain and more. It's history spanning more than 40 years ago and has not been recorded, but passed down by mouth. It is a shame, because if the founders do not record the history before they pass, then it'll just become another style with no meaning.</p>
<p>I am a member of this style and I find it a shame that the History will be forgotten unless it is recorded by the founders.</p>

<p>...An analysis showed that carbon is the primary element in sound quality, and the sound is also coloured by body temperature, so this property is called the C37 structure. (Where C = Carbon and 37 = body temperature in degrees Centigrade). Further analysis showed that C37 frequencies lie very close together (at least 10 frequencies per octave) and this structure reoccurs in each octave. <a href="http://ennemoser.com/" class="external free" title="http://ennemoser.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ennemoser.com/</a></p>
