<li><b>Delete</b> The sole attempt at even using context or justifying this article existence is: "An interest in this subject might relate to the topic of heightism, which is argued to play some role in many tall women's lives." It might. It might not. It might be better to give appropriate examples in heightism than to randomly list tall women and leave it to the readers to make the connections. As it stands, it's just an arbitrary collection of women who happen to be tall, "tall" being arbitrarily defined. GassyGuy 19:38, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The tallest female humans are unusual enough to deserve an article. Each claim should have a reliable source. The only 2 issues I see are whether it should be limited to women who are otherwise notable, and how high the bar should be set. Someone 2 standard deviations taller than average is not very tall, since if heights were normally distributed, out of 3 billion women there would be about a million and a half to be listed in the article if they did not have to be otherwise notable. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:27, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - <b>This text is copied from the AfD for List of men</b>. Although I have reservations about the article as it currently stands (incomplete, insufficiently documented, etc.), the reasons for proposing deletion do not convince me.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The article does not violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Of the seven actions listed there that qualify as original research, the fourth--"It provides or presumes new definitions of pre-existing terms"--is relevant to this discussion. However, equating 6'3", 6'5", 6'7", etc. with <i>tall</i> is surely not an original idea--it has been done before, it will be done in the future. Any given cut-off point for <i>tall</i> is not original research; it is simply arbitrary. For a person, tall is defined as "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tall" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tall" rel="nofollow">having a vertical extent greater than average</a>". So, if the average height in the United States is 5'10", then someone who is 5'11" is tall (when considered at the level of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>). Since Wikipedia should not be <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">biased</a> toward any particular nation(s), it seems to make sense to define "tall" in terms of the average global height.</li>
<li>However, a definition of <i>tall</i> that includes 50% - 1 of the population of the world (same applies if it's just a country, city, village, etc.) would make the list useless (or, at the least, VERY incomplete). For that reason, it makes sense to use a high percentile, like 99% or 99.5% or 99.9%. Yes, it is arbitrary! No, it's not original research! In many of the social sciences, results are considered statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. It's an arbitrary choice, but one that is used by <b>consensus</b>. Just because a cut-off point is arbitrary, does not mean it is not useful. I think this could work if the first line of the article specifies something of the sort: "This is a list of men who, in terms of their height, are in the 99th (or some other number) percentile globally".</li>
<li>Finally, and this strays from this AfD somewhat, if the list is kept, perhaps it should include only individuals who currently have articles on WP. Again, it's an arbitrary inclusion criteria, but I don't see anything wrong with that as long as that criterion is reached through consensus. Also, this would address the concern raised in the comment above by <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">User:Edison</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I originally had no particular interest in this article or its AfD, but felt compelled to write this lengthy comment after seeing the reasons for the proposed deletion. To any inclusion criterion, there is (almost) always an alternative. Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_%28people%29_789e.html" title="WP:Notability (people)">notability guideline for biographies</a> is only one of many that could exist. However, it specifies an <b>objective</b> criterion for inclusion ("primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.") and has <b>consensus</b> support. I think this issue should be discussed in the article's talk page. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:32, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
