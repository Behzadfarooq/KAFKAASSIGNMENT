<li>There is one case where you can do that. <i>One</i>. When there are no sources, and there are reasonable suspiscions that no sources exist. You can then say "Delete this, unless someone finds sources". But the people saying "This has remained POV for a month, time to delete" are wrong. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 23:40, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If there's only "one" case where you "can" do that, why do people keep on doing it, hmmm? Why isn't it "stopped"? Quite frankly, I wonder if there are any real rules to this place other than those people just make up out of the blue sometimes to be honest with you. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_H_c9c6.html" title="User:Just H">Just H</a> 03:21, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The "source" is a memorial page on an unreliable source on Angelfire. Since none of these people are otherwise notable, the list should be deleted. —<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 23:47, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I can only find two notable people on the list: <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Brazil_f165.html" title="Scott Brazil">Scott Brazil</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diane_Varsi_0c96.html" title="Diane Varsi">Diane Varsi</a>. I can find nine notable people that Wikipedia claims have ever had Lyme disease (but haven't died). I have had a look in national newspaper obit. pages, IMDB, NNDB, FindAGrave, etc. Nothing. I don't believe this list can expand beyond a few (well sourced) names. A wider "List of people who have had Lyme disease" probably wouldn't be long enough to warrant its own article either. The author's purpose would be better served by finding reliable statistics for mortality and contributing those to <a href="../../../l/y/m/Lyme_disease.html" title="Lyme disease">Lyme disease</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 00:06, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable people. Should be in a database somewhere, but certainly not a wikipedia page. As for the notable people, they can be added as a (short) paragraph in <a href="../../../l/y/m/Lyme_disease.html" title="Lyme disease">Lyme disease</a>. <a href="../../../k/s/h/User%7EKsheka_e2cf.html" title="User:Ksheka">Ksheka</a> 01:23, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. All non-notable people should be deleted from it. That will leave 2 people apparently. There is no point in having a list of two people. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 01:47, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> There might be more out there, but for now an incubator merge is more appropriate, I think a keep won't work with 2 only, and I concur with WJB on that this list isn't notable heavy. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_H_c9c6.html" title="User:Just H">Just H</a> 03:17, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Pare down and <b>merge</b> as above. Non-notable people dying in a fundamentally non-notable way does not make them notable. Wikipedia is not a memorial. That said, it is not unreasonable for the article about the disease to discuss <i>notable</i> people who have had the disease and those (apparently two of them) who have died from it. Should that section become disruptively large in future, it can be split to a daughter article. Now is not that time, however. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 04:02, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as there is nothin in here needed for a merge, and the sole cited source is unreliable.

<ul>
<li>SAVE save svae!!! I DO have death certificates for some of them and Obits for the others. The important thing about them dying of Lyme disease is how many *different* wAYS they died yet all died of Lyme disease- the way they died IS NOTABLE- because they died in SO MANY different WAYS!!!! From the ALS presentation- from the MS presentation- from anoxic encephalopathy to the dilated cardiomyopathy presentation- from the sudden heart attack presentation- from the suicidal presentation- from the lupus presentation- from the Alzheimer's presentation- from the ARDS presentation-&#160;!!!!!!! It is a beautiful example of infectious disease!!! That is the point- it is why there are all the autopsy reports included! It puts forth the myriad presentations in SUCH an illustrative way-- Sarah aka CaliforniaLyme
