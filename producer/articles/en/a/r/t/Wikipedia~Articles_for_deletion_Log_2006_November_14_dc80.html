<li><b>Keep</b> The comment "there is no evidence whatsoever that Koji Yokogawa exists" is refuted by the journal article cited in the Wikipedia article under discussion: "RATIONALITY OF MODULI SPACES OF PARABOLIC BUNDLES. HANS U. BODEN and KÔJI YOKOGAWA. Journal of the London Mathematical Society, Volume 59, Issue 02, April 1999, pp 461-478.doi: 10.1112/S0024610799007061." Also Googling "Ochanomizu University" Yokogawa and I find "Phys. Rev. B 61, 8496 (2000): Kobayashi - Superstructure induced ...Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Ochanomizu University, ... ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank K. Yokogawa for useful discussions and forshowing us ...link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.61.8496" The university site is in Japanese. Too bad no one here is apparenty able to read the faculty listings there to determine whether they list him as a professor. There should be no blocking the article, since someone literate in Japanese might wish to properly document the notability of the professor. The only question is the extent of his notability, not his existence. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:07, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><s><b>WEAK delete</b></s> <b>STRONG AND SPEEDIEST DELETE ASAP AND SALT THE PAGE</b>-- Based on my searches for the subject's name with "Hodge Theory", this sentence from the article is believable: "He is considered one of the world's foremost experts on Hodge theory." But the problem is that I don't know how to find documentation of that assertion. If someone knows a source where this can be proven and provides it on the article, then we should keep. The subject is a living person apparently working in a University in Germany. To those people who are working on the article or want to keep it-- have you considered just contacting the fellow and asking him if he keeps a scrapbook of articles that have featured himself? <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 15:34, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- one of the three founders of the society has an article of his own. The university is one of the world's most notable. The speakers, as MER points out, have often been notable. The ideas discussed at this society (whether on approves of them or not) are focal points of political debate in many nations and, for that matter, at wikipedia.

The ideas discussed at my local pub are also "focal points of political debate in many nations", that doesn't make these debate evenings notable.

<li><b>Delete</b> Just because Oxford is amongst the most notable universities, it does not follow that every society from there is so too.

<dd>Too subjective? There are plenty of scholarly works on the topic. If an expert whom we can cite wrote about it, its a fit topic. Do you know anyone who denies he had an influence?

<li>Even then, though, the article would surely have to be "Shakespeare's <i>Perceived</i> Influence on the English Language". I'm not saying I disagree that WS was the most important and influential writer in the history of the English language (as someone who studied him at Oxford, I'd be a fool to do so), and no, I don't know anyone who denies said influence (save for those who don't believe he was the sole author of his works, and that's a sufficiently large and significant debate that it can't be ignored). Even so, however, that doesn't mean that such people don't exist - and concepts such as "influence" are too abstract and subjective to ever be considered truly <i>factual</i>. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 13:45, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The <i>title</i> is neutral, since it doesn't claim that Shakespeare has a large influence on the English language, or that he had minimal influence on it. The title merely announces that the subject of the article is whatever influence Shakespeare may have had on the language, without passing judgment. It's the article that needs rewriting. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 08:11, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm in the "if it's too unsalvagable, delete and start over" camp I think, most of the time. But I think there's enough goodness here (yes, it's an essay from school) that it's worth a <b>keep</b>. Failing that, userify it and work on it more. But not an outright delete I don't think. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 13:34, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> there's the germ of a good article here, on an important topic but I agree in its current form it is weak. Improve the structure, remove rhetoric, develop some more depth in the ideas. Linguistically, Shakespeare used about ⅔million words. Something like a third of them are first (recorded) usage. He also developed some important elements like metaphor and its generative capability (extension). It's an important topic. Someone does need to do a number on it, though.

GS's military record and NS/SA credentials (and issues surrounding AS's stated ignorance thereof) received considerable attention during the 2003 recall campaign and were legitimate discussion points at the time, not "scandal-mongering", against the background of AS's apparent espousal of naive attitudes about Nazism and his country's past generally (at least earlier in his career). It's also signficant as an example of the Austrian public's being comparativelyless informed about their fellow citizens's (or many of their own family members) active participation in NS politics and war crimes (compared to the record of self-examination in Germany proper, for example.) The article seemed to be factual, balanced, and propertly sourced before I made a few contributions to it myself, which I did because I had heard rumors that GS was a "high-ranking Nazi" and a "war criminal" and that AS paid the Simon Wiesenthal Center to "cover this up", none of which appear to be strictly accurate. So far from scandal-mongering, my hope is that this article will set the record straight. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiskey_Pete_b5ca.html" title="User:Whiskey Pete">User:Whiskey Pete</a> 17:01, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I very rarely vote to keep lists as I believe the vast majority of lists on the Wikipedia are unencyclopedic and unnecessary. This, however, is one of the rare cases that I think we should keep a list. Organizing albums or singles by sales is very common and 'best-selling' lists that cover the entire history of something are rather important. I doubt people would vote to delete a 'best selling movies of all time' or 'best selling American movies of all time.' I can forsee the argument being made that a 'best selling singles of all time' would be acceptable, but not one limited to Japan, however I wouldn't agree with this. Most such 'best selling' lists are going to naturally be US-centric since it has, by far, the biggest market for such things. When countries, like Japan, have their own individual music, or movie, industries then they should be able to have a best-selling list of albums or singles in that industry. A good equivalent would be something like having a 'Highest-grossing Bollywood Film' list. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:20, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> While Wikipedia is not a game strategy guide, it does include content on games, and this is something that deserves to have its own section in the main <a href="../../../t/h/e/Magic%7E_the_Gathering_c994.html" title="Magic: the Gathering">Magic: the Gathering</a> article, as the types are defined enough that the creators themselves use them in their development process. Yet that article is rather large, thus daughter articles need to be created. I suppose it may only be useful to people who play Magic, but this is really no different than having articles like <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flea_flicker.html" title="Flea flicker">Flea flicker</a> or <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hail_Mary_pass_e730.html" title="Hail Mary pass">Hail Mary pass</a>. How are those articles useful to people who don't play Football or watch it on TV? Or <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bunt.html" title="Bunt">bunt</a> for folks who don't play baseball? Sure, those sports may be more popular than Magic, but that's no reason not to include Magic content. That said, the article could use some clean-up. For one thing, too many links. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:24, 14 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>"Sure, those sports may be more popular than Magic, but that's no reason not to include Magic content."</i> I agree we should include Magic-related content but disagree strongly with the notion that articles on Magic strategy are of the same importance as strategy of popular sports. Baseball and football (and cricket, soccer, etc.) all have a larger fan base, far more media coverage and published literature, and a much longer history. The relative importance of the games does matter. I know that I would argue to delete an article on Rich Hoaen or Craig Krempels if we had them, but would keep the article on <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixto_Lezcano_3dfe.html" title="Sixto Lezcano">Sixto Lezcano</a> or <a href="../../../f/%C3%A9/l/F%C3%A9lix_Mill%C3%A1n_205c.html" title="Félix Millán">Félix Millán</a>.

<ul>
<li>Yes, Football, and Baseball and soccer do have more established bases, and there are more players of those sports with articles, perhaps less notable in comparison to the Magic players listed, even those who have been deleted, but as the discussion on Magic players a few months ago established, that doesn't mean we should delete <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kai_Budde_5cee.html" title="Kai Budde">Kai Budde</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Finkel_e67f.html" title="Jon Finkel">Jon Finkel</a> or <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Long_2790.html" title="Mike Long">Mike Long</a>. Not that bringing up players really relates to this discussion, which is about concepts in a game. And that includes strategy. You can see it in the articles on <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">Baseball</a>(with at least three sub-articles that further spread into more articles. The baseball terminology category has at least half a dozen entries I'd say are strategy descriptions), <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football_strategy.html" title="American football strategy">American football strategy</a>(with over a dozen sub-articles), <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">Chess</a> (With one <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_strategy_and_tactics.html" title="Chess strategy and tactics">strategy</a> page and several spin-offs(. Now many of those articles could be improved, absolutely, but I doubt you'd convince anybody to delete all of them. Similarily, we shouldn't delete this page. Especially not because Magic is less popular or established than other, more main-stream sports. That would violate NPOV. I can concur that there shouldn't be pages on *every* deck type, but one describing the fundamental deck types is a different matter. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:42, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, nobody is arguing to delete <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kai_Budde_5cee.html" title="Kai Budde">Kai Budde</a> (which was the first article I ever created); my point in bringing up players as a subject is that even established and successful Magic players are less notable than barely-remembered MLB players, because the deletion-threshold is different for Magic vs. baseball (or football or soccer). This deletion-threshold applies not only to players but also to strategy elements. There have been dozens of books that discuss <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hail_Mary_pass_e730.html" title="Hail Mary pass">Hail Mary pass</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hit_and_run_%28baseball%29.html" title="Hit and run (baseball)">hit and run (baseball)</a> (along with hundreds of websites and newspaper articles and thousands of TV and radio broadcasts spanning over 50 years). Because of the strong potential for OR creeping in, strategy elements of games have in my opinion a very low deletion-threshold, meaning that more than a half-century of thousands of reliable sources is to me just a little bit over the line of "keep." By contrast, the terms "Aggro deck," "Control deck," etc. are about 10 years old (some of the decks mentioned on the page are only 2-3 years old) and the sources leave something to be desired. I guess the only sources that would be acceptable for this subject would be magicthegathering.com articles and possibly <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Flores_dfdd.html" title="Mike Flores">Mike Flores</a>' book <i>Deckade</i> (but possibly not, since it's mostly self-published). For me that falls below the threshold. Also, you'll have to clarify what <i>"That would violate NPOV"</i> means, since NPOV applies to statements made in articles, not to deletion discussions, and deciding what gets deleted and what doesn't does not fall under <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 21:31, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For NPOV, I mean popularity bias. Also possible a bit of age bias. Just because Magic is new compared to sports like Chess or Football doesn't mean we can't have articles on it. Mainstream bias is a bias too. Now I might agree having articles on individual deck types is too much, but that's not what you're asking for here in this AFD. You're asking for the deletion of a page about deck types in general, which is itself is a clear sub-article of the already too large Magic the Gathering article. Why? Because it's a game strategy guide. That's where you fail to convince me, because the fact is, Wikipedia has literally dozens of articles that involve the same kinds of material. The only difference? The game. I see a bias here, and that's why I am concerned about NPOV. And besides the sources you mentioned, I'd add Starcitygames, Scrye, Inquest, Pojo and possibly more. (Is there a Magic: The Gathering for Dummies? Maybe, I dunno, but it's possible for one to be written.) All of them understand and use the concept of Aggro/Combo/Control in their writings. But yes, I would recommend Wizards.com as a primary authoritative source in this case, and since I know where some of the articles are, I'll go add them right now. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:45, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, nobody is saying we shouldn't have articles on Magic; nobody wants to delete <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kai_Budde_5cee.html" title="Kai Budde">Kai Budde</a> or <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Spiral_d685.html" title="Time Spiral">Time Spiral</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/Pro_Tour_%28Magic%7E_The_Gathering%29_d659.html" title="Pro Tour (Magic: The Gathering)">Pro Tour (Magic: The Gathering)</a>. I strongly disagree about the systemic popularity bias and age bias, because I am pretty sure those biases actually work in Magic's favor rather than against it; interest in editing Wikipedia hits many of the same demographic points as interest in playing Magic, especially 13-to-35-year-olds who are technologically adept. The big sports have much broader interest across age brackets, personality types, and social strata, but the same doesn't hold on Wikipedia. Look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:User_mtg&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:User_mtg&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0" rel="nofollow">this</a> vs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:User_Baseball_Player&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:User_Baseball_Player&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0" rel="nofollow">this</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:User_Football&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:User_Football&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which seems to indicate Magic may actually be more popular among Wikipedians than baseball, and almost as much as football. Of course this is far out of line with its popularity among the general population. So I'm pretty sure the popularity bias, on Wikipedia at least, is in Magic's favor. It must again be stressed that <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> <i>only applies</i> to statements made in articles, and redefining it to include the idea of whether specific topics should be given coverage is a dangerous expansion of the concept. It does not violate any policy to give, say, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">Soccer</a> more coverage than <a href="../../../s/e/t/Settlers_of_Catan_5436.html" title="Settlers of Catan">Settlers of Catan</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 22:28, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are saying "Delete this article on Magic Deck types" because it is a game strategy guide but not saying "Delete this article on Chess strategy, or football strategy, or baseball strategy" even though the information is comparable. How is this page any different from <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_Openings_2f16.html" title="Chess Openings">Chess Openings</a>(which by the way, has its own category with over 150 sub-articles!)? I wouldn't say there's a difference in terms of strategy-guide ness. That's where the bias comes in, just like having so many articles on Anglo-American stuff represents a bias and a violation of NPOV which we should work to avoid. I can understand the game guide problem. This article is not a game guide, it's just describing a well-known aspect of the game, one the developers themselves recognize and design for, and in comparison to articles like say <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacrifice_hit.html" title="Sacrifice hit">Sacrifice hit</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bunt.html" title="Bunt">bunt</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trick_play.html" title="Trick play">Trick play</a>, or <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_Opening_e5db.html" title="Napoleon Opening">Napoleon Opening</a> it has sources. Lots of them. Yes, it could certainly be improved, but that's a clean-up issue, and I agree that it could use some. I'm willing to go with you on individual decks not having articles. I'm even willing to go with you on the deck types listed here not having individual articles. But I draw the line at deleting this content which combines them. One article is fine with me. This is not out of proportion with the importance of this material within the game, nor is it out of line with Magic's importance in gaming. 6 million players? I'd say an article on deck-types is reasonable. Especially if you consider that wizards.com uses them in their design, and included them in their theme week coverage. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 23:10, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Nomination for deletion</b> I marked this for speedy deletion as an advert and it was contested by another editor who called for a stay of execution on account that the restaurant had been mentioned by a couple of blogs. Anyway, delete as subject is not an encyclopedically notable restaurant, and no claims are made for notability in the article. I've eaten food from this restaurant many times - its relatively decent Chinese food by Manhattan standards (native Manhattanites - get a grip, your average-joe-level Chinese food, while not as sketchy as Boston's "Combat Zone", is generally not great.), and the restaurant has something of a local reputation for its <a href="../../../x/i/a/Xiao_Long_Bao_5dd9.html" title="Xiao Long Bao">Xiao Long Bao</a> soup dumplings (again, relatively decent by Manhattan standards given most places around there will serve you soggy lumps of dough). But Xiao Long Bao soup dumplings are widespread in NYC and indeed other US cities (not to mention uh, actual Chinese cities). Article consists of listing of 2 locations of the restaurant plus link to a review on a blog, plus a link to the official restaurant website. Remaining 50% of article given over to description of <a href="../../../x/i/a/Xiao_Long_Bao_5dd9.html" title="Xiao Long Bao">Xiao Long Bao</a> dumplings. Bah, try them at Din Tai Fung (an <i>internationally</i> noted restaurant for Xiao Long Bao dumplings) in California/Taiwan/China/Japan/Singapore instead. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 05:52, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> It does have a few minor claims to notability. It was named as the top spot in New York's Chinatown by <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortune_%28magazine%29.html" title="Fortune (magazine)">Fortune</a></i> in 1998 (Lieber, Ronald B. "Top Spots In Chinatowns". <i>Fortune</i>. 2 February 1998. p. 28), and it was listed by <i><a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i> with Lespinasse as one the places NY food critics would send their friends (Shriver, Jerry. "Where local critics send their friends". <i>USA Today</i>. 30 August 1996. p. 6D). Thus, Joe's has received coverage (albeit brief) in a couple of national publications. Also, during the 2003 World Series Michael Bloomberg promised to send Boston mayor Thomas Minino two dozen dumplings from Joe's Shanghia if the Red Sox won the championship (Agence France Presse. "New York, Boston mayors double bets on who will win series pennant." 15 October 2003). I thought that was kind of interesting; it implies that Joe's is seen as one of New York's trademark local dishes. In addition, there were 48 total <i>New York Times</i> hits in their online archive to 2001, including a few articles <i>about</i> the restaurant itself (its history, its owner, etc). I didn't look through all of them, so I'm not sure about the awards claim listed above, but Joe's did appear in a couple of Top Ten Chinese Restaurant lists, FWIW. Overall, I think this article has some potential. If any local New Yorkers want to take a crack at it, go ahead. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 15:39, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I looked through the hits in the NYTimes archive since 1981. Almost all of these hits are 1) restaurant reviews 2) articles about chinatown or chinese restaurants in new york which mention joe's shanghai amongst other restaurants. the only possibly "news" article about joe's shanghai specifically I can find is a single paragraph local news item about a new branch opening in Queens<a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE0D6123AF936A35757C0A96E958260" class="external autonumber" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE0D6123AF936A35757C0A96E958260" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 17:15, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <u>Press coverage does not automatically translate to encyclopedic notability</u>. Apparently we're not even talking about news coverage (apart from trivial mention in a baseball stunt) here either, but <i>restaurant reviews</i> and articles from the <i>dining section</i>. Thousands and thousands of restaurants get good reviews with glowing language about how special a particular dish is or how unusual blahblahblah is (that's part of the fun of reading restaurant reviews) - are we to have articles on each of them as well as every resturant which gets a passing mention in a travel/dining article? (btw, NYTimes gives Joe's Shanghai 2 out of 4 stars (a very good rating but not exceptional at all...). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 17:15, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: The purpose of pointing out the Citysearch page is to show that there is a large cult following and deep admiration for this restaurant. It's not quite as easy as you make it seem to get listed on Citysearch and then get a good rating and review among the superfluous amount of places to eat in New York City. Clearly, Joe's stands out. Here's a "real" restaurant review (by what you say) in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> from <a href="http://events.nytimes.com/mem/nycreview.html?res=9A04E0DE1639F935A15757C0A960958260" class="external text" title="http://events.nytimes.com/mem/nycreview.html?res=9A04E0DE1639F935A15757C0A960958260" rel="nofollow">April 1996</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Restaurants typically get reviewed in the local newspaper. Yes, The New York Times is a major paper, but it does serve New York and this is a New York restaurant. The New York Times would be a significant source of notability in most cases, but for New York locales themselves it is less so. The Denver Post and other Denver papers often review bars and restaurants in town, but I'm in no rush to give them all articles. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 21:36, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Wikipedia guidelines say nothing about what you just said. <i>The New York Times</i> is an international paper, that although may cover local things, is read and circulated widely outside of the city. To say that New York things published in the Times have no merit since "it's local news" is baseless. Quite the opposite, New York things and events gain international recognition because they are published in the paper. Furthermore, relating to your argument, then why is <i>The Independent</i> (a U.K. paper) writing about how great Joe's Shanghai is? You can't have it both ways. I don't understand your argument. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowrealisreal_0e4e.html" title="User:Howrealisreal">Howrealisreal</a> 21:47, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Independent (UK) mentions it in a TRAVEL article about new york. The writer probably looked at existing travel guides or the dining articles in the NYTimes for ideas. Wikipedia is NOT a travel guide. There are many many local interest items in the New York Times every day which have no interest beyond the local area whatsoever e.g. crime incident reports, talk of the town, local government stories, local human interest stories etc etc etc. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 18:57, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh gosh. So now you know what the author of the Independent article was thinking at the time of writing it? You're making very baseless claims here without anything but your subjective feelings to support them. Did you even read that article? The author actually writes about Joe's because he and his lady feel it is a noteworthy stop because of their food, from personal experience. Again, to reiterate, out of all the places to get dumplings in NYC, the article chooses Joe's as the best, and NOTABLE enough to suggested it to the entire Independent paper readership. This has NOTHING to do with Wikipedia being a tourist guide. This article is not saying "come to New York City for Joe's dumplings", it's just recording the fact that this restaurant has been distinguished from the rest because of how good it is. This is not just known on the local level, as Zagalejo and others have pointed out. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowrealisreal_0e4e.html" title="User:Howrealisreal">Howrealisreal</a> 20:32, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I wouldn't say that <i>any</i> restaurant reviewed in the NYT is notable. But I agree that, when looking at the big picture, Joe's Shanghai deserves an article. In addition to the Independent blurb, I found relevant Lexis-Nexis results from newspapers in Singapore, Boston, and Minnesota. Lots of non-New Yorkers have heard about this place, and even though most of the articles are restaurant reviews or travel section blurbs, it's pretty clear that the place has made an impact. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 02:10, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Howrealisreal, you are attempting to undermine my arguments by attacking me as someone who does not frame arguments in terms of policy and acts out of personal whim. I hope in future that you will refrain from misrepresenting other people's arguments with <i>ad hominem</i> criticisms, and from generally being condescending.

<dd>That looks like a <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">Pokemon argument</a> (sometimes it's used for deletion).

<dd>Ok, let me try again - my point here was in relation to a dispute about a policy reading. The claim was made that "Multiple verifiable independent press coverage in major publications" is "more than enough" to satisfy the "standards" for notability. My response was these are guidelines, not standards and that actually, there are cases such as the George Allen Smith case, where "Multiple verifiable independent press coverage in major publications" existed but the article was nevertheless deleted (with deletion endorsed on review). In my response, I make no mention of Joe's Shanghai. It would be an odd comparison in any case, since the prominence of press coverage in the George Allen case greatly outweighs Joe's Shanghai. <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">WP:POKEMON</a> talks about the keep argument that "x should kept because y has been kept". In your exegesis of my comments, you are claiming that I am sneakily using a deletionist twist on the Pokemon test (a novel twist based on your own observations, since it's not covered in <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">WP:POKEMON</a>), in effect arguing that "x should deleted because y should be deleted". I am not - I am saying that (for the umpteenth time), that the assumption that press coverage automatically translates to encyclopedic notability is incorrect, and that here is an example of a case with high profile press coverage which was nevertheless judged unencyclopedic and deleted. Leaving aside the matter of whether a hypothetical deletionist version of a Pokemon test is in fact simply a mirror image equivalence of the Pokemon test, <i>if</i> I was making some kind of deletionist Pokemon argument, the argument would in effect be saying that all subjects with press coverage should be deleted - this is clearly nonsense. What I have been saying (until I'm blue in the face) is that <i>Media coverage does not automatically translate to encyclopedic notability and in case people think I'm making this up, here's a good example of this point in action</i>. This point is <i>not</i> the same as saying that <i>Media coverage shows lack of encyclopedic notability</i>. What it is doing is calling for a higher level of judgement to be exercised beyond blindly following whatever is in the media. I hope this has clarified things for you. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 02:36, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the long response, but it still goes back down to comparing the argument to delete on a different article and very different subject. Greg Allen Smith was/is someone who went missing during a cruise at sea and this is an article of a Chinese restaurant chain with a great amount of differences between the two and even the arguments for keeping (there's more than just "this has lots of press coverage" arguments) and deleting. If your argument was actually included in <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDP_6910.html" title="WP:AFDP">WP:AFDP</a>, then it's valid to cite that argument as such and even in that case it would only cite a precedent, not policy. Your heavily repeated "Media coverage does not automatically translate to encyclopedic notability..." argument might be a good one, but it is not policy and arguably not even precedent but was just used in the discussion on the decision to delete that specific article. You even said yourself above "Even high profile press coverage from major sources [is] <i>not necessarily</i> sufficient for encyclopedic notability..." which correctly demonstrates that there are <i>some</i> instances where that might be the case as all articles and arguments for deletion/inclusion are unique. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 04:09, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh, and just one more thing, I could easily cite the AfD of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jeffrey_Ingram_9f09.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jeffrey Ingram">Jeffrey Ingram</a> as an example of primarily using the "heavy news coverage" argument for reason to keep as that article was kept, as a counter to your argument, but i <i>know</i> you'd throw <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">WP:POKEMON</a> out.

But, I also feel that I must defend myself from your charges. I do feel that your arguments are based on personal experiences and lack foundation in Wikipedia policies. Here are some examples: "The [<i>Independent</i>] writer probably looked at existing travel guides or the dining articles in the NYTimes for ideas," (speculation) or "Yes, I've had their meatballs. They're okay" (trying to undermine published works based on your personal opinion). These are just a few examples of subjective arguments that are not verifiable and not based on any guidelines. I'm sorry, but you equally tried to misrepresent my views and sources. Unfortunately, while I have evidence as to why my arguments hold weight, you have nothing to show for yourself besides the fact you think that the place is overrated. You are right, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and has standards. This is why what gets put in it must be based on facts traced back to non-trivial published works outside of the subject, and ourselves as editors. If you want to express your personal opinion about why Joe's isn't good, do it in your personal blog instead of trying to destroy information that others find notable and worthwhile to include. I do hope that we meet again (as you put in an earlier version of your comment) and who knows, we may find ourselves on the same side of the argument. This is the best part about Wikipedia.

<p>A list page of a regular wrestling TV show isn't needed, and is simply fancruft. This should be put on a wrestling wiki, not here.

<li>The arguments made for keeping were more persuasive from my point of view. Let me quote someone from the TNA AfD that nobody responded to: <i>I honestly have trouble understanding the concept of an encyclopedia that wants to exclude knowledge of this depth just because it can. Yes, it's fairly trivial knowledge, and Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of knowledge, but these articles are not an indiscriminate collection--they're nicely organized, formatted and compartmentalized, and will only get more so as they live on. Even Wikipedia's definition of encyclopedia mentions the word's origin as "the idea of collecting all of the world's knowledge into a single work". M-W says it's "a comprehensive reference work". Why limit ourselves to the length encyclopedias have been in the past? If Wikipedia isn't meant to be a true encyclopedia, then that's fine too, but I haven't seen the Wikipedia is not an encyclopedia page yet. -- Trevyn</i>. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 08:21, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - She seems to be a significant character, and as far as biographies of fictional characters go, this one actually doesn't look half bad.

<li>Attempting to place all the information contained within this article into a larger Harry Potter article would be extremely difficult, not to mention very messy.</li>
<li>This article is an important part of WikiProject Harry Potter, and deleting it would cause more harm than good.</li>
<li>A fictional character in a book does not merit his/her own article? Please see Harry Potter, Artemis Fowl, Peregrin Took, and numerous other fictional characters on Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Extensive research and work has been put into this article by many Wikipedians, and their efforts should be recognized instead of destroyed.</li>
<li>This article is actually a good example of how to write an article about an important character in a fictional novel. I may be wrong, but after being on Wikipedia for over a year, I think this is certainly better than many other articles about fictional characters. It is concise and has an active community of editors who put in time and research into the article.</li>
<li>"Not notable at all if you ask me" is not a good reason for deletion. Not notable for what? Lack of sources? The references are placed down at the end of the article. Not notable as a character? Seeing that <a href="../../../c/h/o/Cho_Chang_04fb.html" title="Cho Chang">Cho Chang</a> played a huge role in the fourth and fifth novels of Harry Potter, and a notable role in the fourth movie, she is, on the contrary, one of the most well-recognized <i>Harry Potter</i> characters. –- <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKungming2_bd1a.html" title="User:Kungming2"><b><font color="#0000FF">kungming·</font></b></a><font color="green"><b>2</b></font> | <a href="../../../k/u/n/User_talk%7EKungming2_b479.html" title="User talk:Kungming2"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk</sup></font></a>·<sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Kungming2_0eb5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Kungming2"><font color="#999999">Contact)</font></a></sup> 06:57, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

That template does nothing more than print: <i>You are a noob. You beg for free stuff.</i> Will interested parties in the AfD take that into account. The lack of a signing signature when nominating this for AfD also signifies that Necrobrawler does not understand <strike><a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDELETE_1b88.html" title="WP:DELETE">WP:DELETE</a></strike> some editing guidelines as well. –- <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKungming2_bd1a.html" title="User:Kungming2"><b><font color="#0000FF">kungming·</font></b></a><font color="green"><b>2</b></font> | <a href="../../../k/u/n/User_talk%7EKungming2_b479.html" title="User talk:Kungming2"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk</sup></font></a>·<sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Kungming2_0eb5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Kungming2"><font color="#999999">Contact)</font></a></sup> 07:03, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Author-removed prod, with a reason featuring the phrase <i>all it needs is a name and recognition</i>, which to me implies that it has neither and thus shouldn't be included here. In its current form, it's only a dicdef and a Google doesn't give me anything to go on regarding the existence of the subculture. The word "Baka" itself seems to be a commonly-used one in anime circles, but I can't find anything saying that it's a term used to describe the subculture here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 06:34, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> It is a guide on how to buy a used car. It will never be encyclopedic. Do an article on car dealer scams as a notable phenomenon, sourced and in line and up to standard with the other consumer fraud articles and we might have something worthy of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 08:06, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please do not misrepresent me. I'm not suggesting that this article is encyclopedic. I am, however, suggesting that it may be worth merging some of this information, pared of its POV and guide-like prose, to an article that is -- and which doesn't yet contain said information. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 08:29, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> preferably, renamed as Consumer fraud in car dealerships. I think there is enough specifically to say about the topic and it should be easy to source some of this. Journalists like Jim Mateja write about this sort of thing regularly (very often the consumers naively let themselves be bamboozled, though). At worst <b>merge</b> with the bare-bones <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_dealership.html" title="Car dealership">car dealership</a> article. My perspective from having a job for a couple of months working inside a car dealership (I was employed by a third party) was incredible shock at what even a high-volume, clean, upscale dealership with a pro-customer reputation (built on friendly advertising) pulled on a daily basis. You have no idea. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 13:32, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia needs such an article as this. If it needs improvement, <b>edit boldly.</b>Car dealer scams have been written up for at least the past 70 years, so add references from Consumer Reports, Readers Digest, and the numerous consumer guides which have outlined scams from rolling back odometers to "only driven by a little old lady on Sunday" to "let me see if the sales manager will approve this price" to "we have a special financing plan for folks like you." <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:23, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is OR, I would support an article that references every scam from the start.

<li><b>Delete</b> - The title of article is inherently POV. The article content is unsuitable as an encyclopedia article, and unsuitable as even the starting point for an article. In a word, unsalvageable. If somebody wants to create a properly cited consumer fraud page for used car sales, I'm all for it, but this article is not the start of such a piece of work. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 21:32, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>If you think it should be merged, you should have proposed a merge on the article pages. What you proposed here is a delete, claiming non-notability. The claim of non-notability is bunk (nothing personal); Linus (creator of Linux) and Tanenbaum (creator of Minix, a previous miniature UNIX-like OS) getting into a major public online argument about what aspects of OSes were optimal and would dominate in the future was major news at the time. The article is terrifically weak / stublike, but it could be expanded into a point-counterpoint listing all the messages in the exchange with full wikilinks to the theories and topics debated. It's sort of sad that my comment here is now longer than the article, but that can be fixed. Destubbing stuff is normal routine fixit process. AFD is for things which clearly aren't notable; WP does not require that we delete all stubs because they don't clearly justify that events/topics are notable yet. The event was notable. If you want to not delete it and merge it into the Linux history or some such, be my guest, but that's not deleting it. Thanks! <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 00:27, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>This "debate" was essentially a flamewar, so I don't think a listing of points/counterpoints would improve the article, and arguments for and against microkernels vs. monolithic kernels are already listed in their respective articles. Maybe it was wrong to call this "non-notable", but again, I don't think it deserves its <i>own</i> article, mentioning it as a curiousity in the Linux kernel article would be enough.

<li>It's easy to say that an article needs expansion, but <i>what</i> would that expansion consist of? Information on how Torvalds fails to "ignore the bait" and goes for some "serious flamefesting"? Or how Tanenbaum tells Linus that he should be thankful that he's not his student? Or that Torvalds goes on and on about perceived flaws in a system that's meant to be simple enough for students to understand (the design of). I see very little notable <i>content</i> in this debate, but I find the debate notable enough to mention, in its right place: the Linux kernel article. Memmke 09:39, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm not sure how either comics violate WP:V as stated by Andrew Lenahan. It would seem to me the best source of material for an article about a comic would be the comic itself.</p>

<li>There's a big push on Wikipedia to have articles be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> using <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. If an article's only sources are from the subject itself, that article is questionable and will probably be deleted unless reliable sources can be found. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 19:33, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So basically the push atleast for webcomics is to cite information from other people writing about the comic as oppose to the comic itself? That's hard for most webcomics to do. <a href="../../../i/v/v/User%7EIvvan_Cain_646d.html" title="User:Ivvan Cain">Ivvan Cain</a> 19:52, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So under that one can could essentially delete all the "web comic" entries as they are all Self Published and the majority of the Source content comes from the Subject themselves.

<dd>Except DC/Marvel/Archie/Dark Horse Comics and so forth meet criterion one, in that they have "been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works." Many of them would probably meet criterion 2 as well.

<dd>I think you're a little bit confused. Marvel (etc.) are not self-published, and there are plenty of reliable sources that cover them: Wizard, Comics Journal, Comics Buyer's Guide, and many others. I don't think trying to compare a powerpuff girls fan comic on the web with <i>Batman</i> and <i>Spider-Man</i> is really helping your case any. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 22:31, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Non-notable losing game show contestant from America's Top Model, was prodded by <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">User:Mikeblas</a>, however, article survived an earlier mass AfD, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Caridee_English_c791.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Caridee English">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Caridee English</a>, which technically means it must be listed here, rather than prodded (I think). The conclusion of the previous AfD was "train wreck" -- essentially, too many articles nominated at once.

<dd>Yeah, you should always check the history before prodding, although if you overlook a previous AfD or prod, it's no big deal, as, in the worst case, the admin will probably just go ahead and convert the prod to a new AfD. I just thought I'd try to save time. As for "train wreck", that was just the closing admin's wry assessment of a discussion where people were listing individual articles as keep or delete, and there was no way to pick-and-choose a clear consensus out of the mess. The important part is that he said, "This closure is not a judgement for or against any one article, please re-list seperately where appropriate." Which is what we're doing now. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 23:16, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>According to the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breaking_Free_993e.html" title="Breaking Free">Breaking Free</a> article, it made #4 in Singapore and we can assume that is the Asian version. I would like to find verification of that but so far I can't find a directory of historical Singapore music charts, even from the last few months.

<dl>
<dd>I don't think we can assume that. It says #4 for "U.S., Singapore." The Asian version obviously didn't hit #4 in the United States. So it is either saying that the original version achieved this position on both charts, or that the original and the Asian cover both happened to peak at #4 on their respective charts. It is not a bad faith assumption to think that may not be true (we needn't doubt the editors' honesty, only their accuracy). This is really reaching for elusive smoke signals of notability. If this article is going to stay, we're going to need something to cite. Unfortunately, Wikipedia articles may not be cited as sources.

<dd>Links to YouTube are generally being removed as so many YouTube videos are a copyright violation. If it could be legitimately shown that the copyright holder placed or authorized the placement of those particular videos, that's fine, but even then 4 or 5 links would be quite excessive. Finally, there is no prohibition against anyone editing during an AfD-in fact, if you examine the AfD template, it encourages editors to carry on editing. This edit does not appear to be any form of bad faith-anyone may remove unsourced claims, anytime. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 21:10, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> well, I want to opine keep, but this article is completely unsourced. The term itself is not sourced; the bands listed as examples are not sourced as being considered part of this genre. To be clear, I've heard this term numerous times, but the problem from an article standpoint is that there are no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to back this up, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> paper doesn't exempt an article from needing to be verified.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:59, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Lack of sources is not, however, a reason to delete an article. There is a difference, after all, between verifiABLE and verifiED. Yes, the article as it stands has no sources, and yes, it needs them. But a quick Google search will reveal that everything in it can surely be sourced given some time and work (which I'm willing to put in). This makes it different, therefore, to an article that is simply pushing original research. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 17:01, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually lack of sources is a perfectly legitimate reason to delete an article. There is a difference between verified and verifiable; right now this article is completely unverified and when I did something more than a quick Google search (I actually followed some of the links, etc.) I didn't see anything that met <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> or provided <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a>, so at least on the surface this isn't verifiable either (at least not from reliable sources). Again I'm not suggesting that sources don't exist at all (that's the reason my above statement was a comment and not a deletion opinion); but the important thing is to find <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources for this article. I wasn't able to find any, but I'm hoping someone does because I am interested in seeing this article retained.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:00, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not according to the <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDeletion_policy_5007.html" title="WP:Deletion policy">deletion criteria</a>, it isn't. If an article appears unverifiable, the solution is not to delete it outright, but to find sources wherever possible. If such sources cannot be found, <i>then</i> deletion may be possible. But I could point you to a hundred articles on Wikipedia that wouldn't in a million years be deleted, yet don't have adequate sources or citations. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 18:04, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is getting off topic, but I'll just leave it that yes I agree with you, there are a number of unverified (and possibly unverifiable) and poorly verified articles that never will be deleted. It's unfortunate, but consensus can trump policy in some cases. In this case however I'd like to see this kept for now sourced if possible (and I've tagged it for needing verification), which looks like where this is headed. If it doesn't get sourced in a few months then that can be dealt with at that point. Besides, I'm the only one grumbling about sourcing... the original deletion reasoning makes no mention of it...--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:20, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>well, o.k. but ... to the extent that discussion is allowed in RfD ... isn't it true that the purpose of "verifiable sources" to ensure accuracy &amp; NPOV, two characteristics that are not at issue here?

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't understand where you get the idea that accuracy &amp; NPOV are not issues when dealing with flash games (they are issues in every single article, including and especially ones on flash games). <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a>, for example is a browser game (though not a flash game), and it's (gasp) full of reliable sources.

</ul>
<p>If some persons from England, Africa or Mumbai or Banglore says that this place is non notable, how can I agree with such foolishness since I'm a native wikipedian. If this place were in America or England, everyone will say that this place is highly notable.(Even smallplaces in England with a population of 1000 are included in this encyclopedia).But News report from <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayalam.html" title="Malayalam">Malayalam</a> Newspapers are not available in google. That's why no google hits..!I'm ready to scan and upload hundreds of news report in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayalam.html" title="Malayalam">Malayalam</a> about this place. Since I'm a Malayalam Language journalists it's not a big task to me. But howmany of u know Malayalam...? I think it's a great challenge to create <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerala.html" title="Kerala">Kerala</a> related or <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayalam.html" title="Malayalam">Malayalam</a> Language related articles. Google hits are not available even to notable places. My humble request in this context is that Google hits must not be taken as a yardstick in Asian related AfD's. Newspapers of Vernacular Languages may have millions of readership. For example, in India every state has its own language. There are more than 20 widely speaking native languages in India. But the news reports from the newspapers of such languages are not available in google search.Take the case of <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayala_Manorama_e08f.html" title="Malayala Manorama">Malayala Manorama</a> Newspaper. Currently this Malayalam language newspaper has a readership of over 9 million, with a circulation base of over 1.4 million copies according to Audit Beureu of Circulations. Manorama is one of the India's largest selling and most widely read news paper. There are more than 50 such newspapers in India. News reports from such dailies are not available in google eventhough it have millions of readership. But news reports from English dailies with 1000 or 2000 copies are available in google search and wikipedians consider it as big big google hits..! <b>Articles from English speaking places will easily pass verifiability test and notability test</b> because of this reason. Is it really misleading..? In this context of notability tests based on google hits may be a worthless, foolish effort. In such circumstances <b>we must consider the words of native wikipedians with more importance in Asian related AFd's</b>.<b><a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENileena_joseph_bcd1.html" title="User:Nileena joseph"><span style="background:#0c0;color:#FFFF66">&#160;Nileena joseph&#160;</span></a></b><sup>(<a href="../../../n/i/l/User_talk%7ENileena_joseph_c9bd.html" title="User talk:Nileena joseph">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nileena_joseph_3551.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nileena joseph">Contribs</a>)</sup> 11:38, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - you make some interesting observations. Clearly, google hits alone are no indicator of notability, and there are certainly challenges in covering non-english speaking countries in the english wikipedia. However, there have to be objective tests and standards for notability, verifiability and the rest. We can't accept the words of "native" wikipedians any more than we can take the words of any other wikipedian.

<li><b>Delete</b> as the article makes <i>no claim of nobility</i>, regardless if that claim is substantiated (which would be another issue).

<p>I have several news articles (hard copies) from local papers about this band. I cant find the same articles online. How can I show that this band is notable? What about ASCAP check stubs? There music was just purchased for "Undercover starlet"(sp?). A very small reality show in N.Y. Its easy to find on the web though. They're negotiating an instrumental mix for a new horror movie being made. If I could get something from the band, should I send it to Wikipedia to show its authenticity? I spend hours a day on this site (just as a reader) and I just want to add to it. Please help me imporve this page. I think this band deserves to have one...I just cant figure out how to show their notability. Should I list quotes from news papers?</p>
<p>...at the very least, they could be linked with a number of other more prominent pages.</p>
<p>Sorry for being a stereotypical noob.</p>
<p>I cant even post correctly. Sorry.</p>
<p><br />
I was uncertain of the deletion policy for bands but tried to clean up the article all the same. I just checked out <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, maybe you should see if you can fill any of the criteria? If not then save what you have and once they get in the horror movie or on the reality show you can repost .<br />
Good luck,<br />

<p>Thanks alot. I really needed some help with this. I appreciate all your work on the page.</p>
<p>I've been reading non-stop. The more I read about "Notability" the more vague it seems. But I'll keep trying. They have the reality show already, I just dont know how to show that. There music is used in episodes but how do you prove that. The individual would have to actually watch the show, ya know. They also have pay stubs from ASCAP for liceasing deals and radio plays.</p>
<p>If the people who want to delete this page just check out Beatpick.com (easiest to navigate) they would see that they're professional, not some random garage band. Although they're no N'Sync and they havent gone platinum from their first CD...ha. Beatpick is just one publisher. They also scored deals through indie911, and other companies as well. They hooked up w/ MTV through T.J. Rising. Beleive me when I say that I'm no fan of MTV. However, even I understand that its a big deal when MTV accepts everyone of your songs for their catalog. They have done all this without a label--completely on their own. It just goes to show you, unless you sign with a label, people will always think your nothing.</p>
<p>How do I show all this though...Argh!</p>
<p>If their music is on an episode can you cite that in the article and point to an external website throught the cite. I assume there should be some sort of credit for that? To do a cite you can check out <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nantucket_ship.html" title="Nantucket ship">Nantucket ship</a> that I cleaned up with some citing - it is pretty simple. I believe you just need to fill one of the criteria not all of them also I think that TJ Rising's connection to MTV is notable - Can you show that connection via a an external link? The more external links you can get to viable sources such as MTV the better you can prove their notoriety. My belief is that not being an "N'Sync" is a positive thing - lol.<br />

<p>Thanks so much- I dont know how to do the links so I'll have to read up about it. Im def going to take your advice and check out your work on that page. Also, I'll go to the web site that plays the episodes of the reality show online. I'll see if they have credits at the end to show (in writting) that A New Ascension music was legally purchased and used. Its going to suck watching every episode...haha. If there are none, I guess I'll still make a link so that, at the very least, those who are familair with the music will recognize it when/if they here it. Linking to T.J. Rizing is a great idea too...you just have all the answers...ha. I was curious...should a put a picture, or their Logo (or whatever you call it) up? Maybe a link to their myspace and purevolume...??? Also, They have the same Web Desginer as TakeOver Records(Ben Harper's-[formerly from yellowcard]- label)...is that notable? haha. I'm looking for anything, anything at all. Ricky Spoons, drummer (A.N.A.) takes lessons and is friends with L.P. (drummer-YellowCard). John Wilkes is a close friend of the band (Drummer-Red Jumpsuit-Virgin)- i mean geeze...theres so many little obscure things about them...haha they KNOW famous people.. does that count?haha</p>
<p>ok time to work. thanks again. If you have anymore suggestions please do not hessitate.</p>
<p>BTW-"Notable" should be defined as any band that is not N'Sync.</p>
<ul>
<li>I cleaned up the formatting a little for you. An external source would be a review in a magazine, or a website, or something. Have they put out an album? Unfortunately, not being <a href="../../../n/27/s/N%27Sync_9530.html" title="N'Sync">N'Sync</a> isn't an argument for inclusion.

<p>Jmylar 20:50, 15 November 2006 (UTC)I didnt get a chance to cite anything yesterday. I hope i get a chance to before anything is deleted. Like i said i have a ton of info. Also, if the fact that Mark (bass) was signed to Virgin makes the band more notable, then It might also be notable that Jared Boice was signed to Vision sound (who discoverd The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus[Virgin]+Escher[no more])...they happen to be a Virgin Records affiliate. Its also where the band records. Plus, the band is professional. The deals they sign are equivelant to those a "Major Label" band would sign. They just make more profit (percentage) then a "major" band would. I dont think they should be over looked just because they MAY (or may not) have more sense then some bands that rush into a major label contract. The "May not," comes from the fact that they might be turned down by Wikipedia simply b/c they've Turned down majors/indie's in the past. Btw-like my SN? Im going for the forum-trendy "rip off" M.Shadows SN. Accept im doing it for J(Jordin) Mylar (we have the same first initial...ha)! yeah- I know I'm lame!</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't see how the subject of this article meets <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a>. The criteria are that the person meets one of the following conditions: 1. The person is regarded as a significant expert in his or her area by independent sources. 2. The person is regarded as an important figure by independent academics in the same field. 3. The person has published a significant and well-known academic work. 4. The person's collective body of work is significant and well-known. 5. The person is known for originating an important new concept, theory or idea which is the subject of multiple, independent, non-trivial reviews or studies in works meeting our standards for reliable sources. 6. The person has received a notable award or honor, or has been often nominated for them. Which of these does Dunin meet? She sounds like she's doing good work, but she's just an ordinary academic, of which there are many thousands in the world.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the author of this article. I do not personally know Elonka but her mother's life and her specialized area of Slavic (Yugoslav) dance ethnology is of interest to me as well as many academics and lay people who study folk dance. I understand that there were a few parts of the article that were not referenced properly but a majority of the article was pulled from actual newspaper articles and magazines as well as websites belonging to prominent folk dance organizations and academic groups; all these are listed in the "reference" section. In addition to her academic notariety, Ivancich has worked in Hollywood appearing in television variety shows, movies ( "A Star Is Born") and live productions. During her long academic career, Ivancich published several articles, papers and books, and has served as chairperson and keynote speaker for several dance organizations and groups. I am amazed to find out how political Wiki has become -- it is very disappointing to witness how quickly people will scrap an article without considering how valuable its content may be to others who are interested in a particular subject matter. I believe Elsie Ivancich Dunin's academic work, notable stage and screen appearances more than qualify her notability and right to keep her article. --Nanusia 05:57, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> the above comment is right on. Verifiability is not the problem here, nor is this a matter of OR.

<li>&lt;Dont delete&gt;": This information and the projects it talks about are of tremendous value and very relevant to issues here in the US. Also dont agree why we should always see issues as they to US. Youth movement around the world, musical responces to AIDS, preservation to world Indigenous cultures and the global information society such as this one in Tanzania is a valuable lessons and links that student, faculty, researchers could use to understand a wide array of issues such as social change, political movements and globalization. These young people like many in this world today are using technology to create local solutions and this is a great initiative. It should be noted that in countries like Tanzania, the ability to create and produce media is not as easy as here in America. Most importantly, these media messages are crucial in disseminating vital information such as AIDS education, environmental destruction, good governance and gender issues.

<li>I'm suprised this even exists, but if it helps and contains valid information (it seems to know more than I do) then leave it be. Take out a bit of crap and the word "enigmatic" and I think it's ok. Enlightened me to "Piss Me Off" and I guess it links other bands to The Libertines, who supported over the time etc.</li>

<p><br />
Thelibertines.org forum has been crucial to the success of both The Libertines and the British music scene over the past few years. Arguably it's importance has waned over the past year or two, but as has been stated on the discussion page the forum has been mentioned in many music books and magazines, as well as other wiki pages and therefore it seems common sense that it should have it's own wikipedia page. It seems to me that those requesting it's deletion are doing so because they have little awareness of the subject's importance. One of the key uses of wikipedia is to educate and so it is illogical to delete this entry because of a lack of knowledge about the forum and it's associated subjects. As has also been previously mentioned, I'm sure that the page will be cleaned up, with references and the such added. 87.86.104.115 22:55, 14 November 2006 (UTC)Sarah</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per WP:WEB.

<p>As you can see from above I clearly stated (and others have done in the discussion page of the actual wiki entry) that it has been crucial to the music scene in this country over the past few years. This is undeniably true when you consider the bands that have had success as a result of promotion/discussion on the forum (see actual wiki article for mentions of these bands), and is supported by the books and magazines in which the forum has popped up - notably the NME and Anthony Thornton's 'Bound Together' bio of The Libertines. The forum stands out as being one on which the members of many bands (Razorlight, Thee Unstrung, Babyshambles, etc), club promotors, music journalists and photographers have frequented. 87.86.104.115 22:55, 14 November 2006 (UTC)Sarah</p>

<p>yes, help or advice would be much appreciated.

<p>Article is full of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Very confusing situation as the talk page says the correct word is <a href="../../../k/e/m/Kemet.html" title="Kemet">Kemet</a>. Article may have been started as a misunderstanding of the whole subject. No sources given, notability rather unclear <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 16:44, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>oppose:</b> your suggestion is unfair to the people who have contributed thus far. 90% of wiki articles have no sources deleted so good luck having them deleted, also on notability: this is simply a specialist topic. We are also trying to pull together a <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemistry_%28etymology%29.html" title="Chemistry (etymology)">Chemistry (etymology)</a> article in which this article may play a modest role. I am not participating directly in this matter because of past run-ins with people eager to delete stuff but why not have the article redirected to <a href="../../../m/i/n/Min_%28god%29.html" title="Min (god)">Min (god)</a>? See also my comment here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chemistry_%28etymology%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chemistry_%28etymology%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chemistry_%28etymology%29</a> <a href="../../../v/8/r/User%7EV8rik_a2ae.html" title="User:V8rik">V8rik</a> 17:59, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The article is about black soil in ancient Egypt. So is the <a href="../../../k/e/m/Kemet.html" title="Kemet">Kemet</a> article. I was reacting to the tagging of the article as original research and the fact that the word Chem appears to be the incorrect word for that subject. If this can play a modest role in your planning of a future article then by all means do so. I do not object to that at all. But the article cannot just sit there as it is now which is why the confusing situation over two articles dealing with the same topic must be resolved. I leave it to my fellow editors to judge that. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 18:08, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>: As I stated on the article's talk page, all this "article" consists of are layers of uninformed speculation that builds upon more speculation that goes back to an old and long discredited error, adding up to a very dense folk etymology. IMO, the article has very little validity beyond showing what can happen if sources are not cited. If there is anything of genuine importance (which I personally doubt, but if...), it can be put on some other article(s)' page. <a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlembles_9d71.html" title="User:Flembles">Flembles</a> 14:38, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per non. A paranormal creature that was only mentioned in a state-local magazine.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I guess.

<li><b>Delete</b> The coverage is not in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> nor is there any indication of general notability. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 00:53, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> 1. Sourcing: the 2 user submitted reports on the website are in addition to actual print coverage mentioned in the article. Furthermore, the reliability of the source is moot. Wikipedia is not a primary source, so as long as sources are properly cited, the reader is more than capable of judging the information for herself. 2. Notability: The subject matter is of a specialized nature that is not necessary interesting or appropriate to a reader interested in reading about the town itself. 3. Deletion as "Chilling Effect" on free speech: It is difficult to find sourcing since most information on subject is transmitted through local anecdote, however deleting the page will effectively deter others who are in a position to contribute more primary source information from contributing. <a href="../../../u/n/d/User%7EUnderdogBA_d125.html" title="User:UnderdogBA">UnderdogBA</a> 01:07, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Among other issues reliability is a problem. Articles should be sourced from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> sources. If they aren't thats a de facto <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> problem and a strong indicator of a lack of notability. Almost by defintion, if something is notable it will have <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that discuss the topic (cf for example <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Foot_1d2e.html" title="Big Foot">Big Foot</a>). Furthermore if "The subject matter is of a specialized nature that is not necessary interesting or appropriate to a reader interested in reading about the town itself" then that is an argument if anything for further non-notability- people who care about the town don't even care at all about this sibject. Finally, the claim that deletion has a chilling effect on free speech has no bearing Wikipedia policy. A) Deletion doesn't have any chilling effect. B) More importantly Wikipedia is not a free speech zone but an encyclopedia, please see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:14, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> The extended ō is often written as 'ou', especially by people that have not formally studied Japanese. There are a handful of relevant hits on a google search for "kaitou anime" if you use quotes, but not enough to convince me that it's in common use (as an anime fan myself, I've never heard the phrase used). <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronfrost_2825.html" title="User:Ironfrost">Ironfrost</a> 04:48, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Trying Japanese, I get 300-odd results for "怪盗アニメ", which mostly seem to be relevant hits using the term to describe series like "Mouse". That said, 300 results isn't many, and it's fairly common in Japan to classify titles with one-off neologistic genres, so the fact that a word has verifiably been used does not necessarily mean that a <i>recognised</i> genre exists.<br />
The real problem with this article, however, is that the list of anime supposedly classified in this genre is unsourced, making this look worrying like <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> - if that's the case, it should probably be deleted. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 10:34, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Invited talks": you must be kidding. These are most prpobably regular talks at conferences, where people of course are "invited". Take for exampe a talk in 1999, a year after graduation. Must be really something, this guy, and he would be all over news as of now if it were something notable. Academics are making themselves "invited" all the time.

<li><b>Delete</b> In reviewing the each of the references, there is not a single reference that supports the claims of the article. Almost all of the "See also" refer to blogs or blog-like sites directed by Tsuzuki san. There is a marked difference between a Mormon having an interest in the occult and Mormons having an interest in the occult as is being portrayed by this single editor. This is a subject which I have studied for many, many years, the thesis is made out of whole cloth. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:15, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b> I checked the history page and find it interesting that those voting to Delete are systematically deleting the article part by part already. It's hard to call this a good faith Afd. Otherwise, it'd be a weak keep, because I have doubts that the secondary sources are available to back up this as a movement within a movement. If they want to take this in the direction of Mysticism as an important element within Mormonism, then this article has real potential. But the abuse of procedure is troublesome--so I'll keep my vote at 'Keep'. 75.18.4.148 01:59, 15 November 2006 (UTC) <small>— 75.18.4.148 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.18.4.148_35b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.18.4.148">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></s> <b>Userfy</b> It's clear no useful work can be done on this article until the vultures leave. 69.155.229.46 01:15, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am re-reading the references, and they do in fact discuss mysticism within Mormonism. They do no describe a group of people who practice such mysticism. In other words, this article is about a club that believes in mysticism. If you want to start an article Mysticism in Mormonism then that is one thing, but to create a wiki page for every yahoo group seems a bit extensive. <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytebear_2aa8.html" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> 03:32, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oak, can you please define "movement" for me? Also, a movement of what: young people, individuals, or Mormons? If they are Mormons, could you please point me to the evidence that convinced you of this position?</dd>
<dd>I have always interpreted a movement as something that is something that is measureable, observable within society, and definitive. Tsuzuki claims on his referenced blog to support this article that he is LDS and is the president of the Mormon club in his educational institution (high school?) and president of the Pagan club. I assure you, from an LDS doctrinal standpoint, this is not acceptable or recommended; it is a significant conflict. However, he/she is free to choose whatever he chooses, but it is not a choice of a Mormon, but as an individual. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:22, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The word "movement" can be subjective, but in this case, from what I can deduce from the sources cited in the article, it seems to be at least a segment of LDS practitioners embrace some aspects of what is defined as mysticism and that can arguably be considered a "movement." I value your perspective on LDS as I'm not a member, but what I do know is that the LDS, like many religions, is varied and has many different perspectives (I'm Catholic and believe me, most Catholics aren't even aware of the literally hundreds of difference branches and philosophies that fall under just the "Roman Catholic" umbrella). It appears from the specific reliable sources (I'm choosing to ignore the sources like blogs and focusing on more standard ones like the Salt Lake Tribune articles), the existence of interest, both scholarly and lay, in Mormon mysticism appears real. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 20:36, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - original research, non-notable, and possible POV fork. Just because because an undefined number of people with a Mormon background find an attraction to mysticism &amp;/or the occult does not mean that the subject warrants an article. Where's the article about <b>Lutheran mysticism</b>? It won't be written because it's just not a noteworthy topic, even though I'm sure that there are probably some number of people that come from that background that are interested in mysticism &amp;/or the occult, just as there probably are some people from every religious (or irreligious) background that are attracted to it. The only reason I can see to keep this article would be to provide yet another place for the tired "Mormonism is a cult" POV pushing, but this time it would presumably be a "safe" place to present that argument, since the article topic is already about cultish topics. I for one hope that Wikipedia will do better than to continue finding additional places to fight over that topic. -- <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishUtah_190e.html" title="User:FishUtah">FishUtah</a> 06:56, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Of course you are correct that <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_mysticism.html" title="Christian mysticism">Christian mysticism</a> exists as a significant topic -- however the "me-too" tact taken on this article <i>does not</i> support it's notability, just as any other article about |Fill in the blank with a denomination| mysticism would not without good, solid references demonstrating it is significant as a distinct topic. I'm also not saying that the article as currently written is inherently anti-Mormon, though I feel that it <i>is</i> an article with an agenda; I'm just warning that it is likely to be hijacked for "Mormonism is a cult" POV purposes. First and foremost this article is Original Research about an obscure topic that doesn't have the support of references that are generally acceptable on Wikipedia, but there is also additional reasons for removing it based on unwarranted POV forking, both within the Mormonism topics, as well as with Christian mysticism, syncretism, comparative religion topics. -- <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishUtah_190e.html" title="User:FishUtah">FishUtah</a> 17:17, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can understand what you are saying, and would like to say that I was not aware that adding a bio of a person of interest was spam. I had been given the task of doing several bios only one of which was a chef. But this was my first article and I am now worried about contributing anything for fear of it being marked as spam-despite the belief that we are contributing encyclopedic copy. Since I have been asked to do this, will all my work be considered spam? and any Biographical material on Mr Scheiman also be? When this was flagged I had not got to his filmography and other particulars. is there a place in here for newposters to learn how to post, What am I missing? "I am doing his PR" should not preclude or eliminate useful encyclopedic information, should it? Is there a way that this information can be edited to adhere to guidlines?</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The article is a rather accurate summation of the argument made by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dawkins_c78d.html" title="Richard Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">The God Delusion</a></i>. Contrary to the nominator's justification, this argument is encyclopedic, and is posed as a rather strong argument AGAINST religion, creationism and the existence of God, by Dawkins, who is a strongly anti-religious atheist. This argument is an expansion of Dawkins' earlier 1986 work in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blind_Watchmaker_97e4.html" title="The Blind Watchmaker">The Blind Watchmaker</a></i>, in which Dawkins rebuts the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watchmaker_analogy.html" title="Watchmaker analogy">watchmaker analogy</a> made famous by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Paley_6c0c.html" title="William Paley">William Paley</a> as an argument FOR the <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existence_of_God_57c6.html" title="Existence of God">existence of God</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 20:52, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>You may wish to go back and look at the article more carefully. That Hoyle and Dawkins used variations on the same metaphor to make contradicting points, <i>that</i> is encyclopedic (if, as the nominator says, "Far too small and specific a topic for an article anyway.") The same <i>cannot</i> be said, I think, of "Obviously p(God|God)=1 and p(God|No_God)=0, which is indeed at least as low as p(X|No_God), but this says nothing useful." -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 21:16, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Even if the analogy of the "Ultimate Boeing 747" <i>was</i> notable enough to merit its own individual article, this article would still be bad, as pretty much everything except the direct quotes is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 21:07, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - When I said "unencyclopaedic rant" etc in nominating this for deletion, what I meant was that the article fails to meet Wikipedia criteria on at least three grounds. (1) As several people have said here, it's a small phrase, a throwaway remark, in Dawkins's latest book which does not deserve to be elevated to article status. (2) It's original research. (3) It seems to me to be an underhand attempt to push a particular viewpoint. The clue is in the title. Dawkins does not use the phrase "Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit", he refers to an "Ultimate Boeing 747". The addition of the word "gambit" is the sneaky bit, and the bit which condemns this article to <i>irretrievable</i> POV-ness. Gambit is "an action or remark that is calculated to gain an advantage" (Concise OED). By inserting this word the creator of this article is attributing motives to Dawkins in an underhand way, and the article itself represents a "gambit" on the part of the creationists. There is <i>no such topic</i> as "The Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit". <a href="../../../g/n/u/User%7EGnusmas_e8c5.html" title="User:Gnusmas">Gnusmas</a> 07:25, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Factual correction</b> Dawkins says (op cit p113) "My name for the statistical demonstration that God almost certainly does not exist is the Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit." <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 13:27, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>In that case I stand corrected (I do not have the book to hand) - but you cannot then say that Dawkins' statement "<i>in its entirety</i>" is as you quote in the article.

<dd>Redirecting to wiktionary seems like a perfect solution. However, I read some of the Redirect information, and I don't think these kind of interwiki redirects are done.

<li><b>Delete</b> Dicdef. I honestly don't know how common the term is, but I've used the word for years exactly as the first sentence defines it (except that I think the words "otherwise unremarkable" don't belong).

<li>It's dictdef, and it's neologism. <b><u>But</u></b> it has escaped from usenet into the broader community -- it is used on a number of fanfic sites (and sooner or later someone will come loking for teh definition) and if it hasn't been used in the <i>Guardian</i> newspaper yet, then it almost certainly will be, repeatedly, in the next six months.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Winger is, in my opinion, the best-known furry artist there is. I acknowledge there's a certain subjectivity to that statement, but he's almost inarguably the best-known furry artist among non-furries. In other words, he's one of the few--perhaps even the only--furry artist to "break out" and be known outside the furry community as well as inside. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 23:45, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>Speedy Keep</b>. If you feel an article is inaccurate or nonneutral, feel free to edit that article accordingly. If you feel an article's title is inaccurate or nonneutral, feel free to propose to have it renamed. But do not circumvent the normal editorial process by creating compeeting version/s of the same entry. Incidentally, this entry could use a lot of expansion: for ex., that many IDF commanders, including the division commander responsible for the firing the shells, were resolutely against using artillery fire precisely due to the likelihood of <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gaza_beach_blast.html" title="Gaza beach blast">these type of incidents</a>, but the Regional Command(?) General Staff/MoD/PM thought otherwise; or operative details, for ex., 12 shells being involved in the incident; or that the death toll is now up to twenty. In other words, no shortage of work, but keep it all in one place, without forking and without employing AfD as an editorial mechanism. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 22:56, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Absolutely, the long-term trends are not good. As a result I very much doubt that any editor will be able to provide reputable sourcing for the basic premise, which should lead to deletion. The only aspect that presents potential cause for optimism is the 'energy superpower' argument - essentially Russia turning into a petro-state. This may or may not come to pass, but either way, 'energy superpower' is a slipshod journalistic term, it does not equate to 'superpower' proper.</dd>

<li>Two little known? I'll agree that I've never heard of the Windows program before, but QuickView (Real and Pro) isn't a small unknown program. how many of you have actually used DOS for playing movies and sounds? QuickView is the biggest in that market. And, <a href="../../../d/o/s/Dosamp.html" title="Dosamp">dosamp</a> can have an article, but searching after that on Google turns up around 3.8 times more hits. I'll guess there are a myriad of programs described on wikipedia that could be removed if you start counting. I just wanted to add mroe information about qv since I saw it in a comparision list here.

<p>This page, as its title suggests, was apparently meant to be a complete list of all mammalian species, except for the marsupials and monotremes. That's crazy! The page is already at 138KB, and isn't even half complete --- probably more like three or four percent complete. The solution is to split it up into one article on <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placental_mammals.html" title="Placental mammals">Placental mammals</a> in general, and numerous articles on <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felis.html" title="Felis">Felis</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canis.html" title="Canis">Canis</a>, and so on. This has been done; probably it had already been done before the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_placental_mammals.html" title="List of placental mammals">List of placental mammals</a> was created.

<li><b>Keep somewhere</b> because this shows off the advantages of a list well; redlinks showing what needs to be done and hierarchical sorting.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I just want to remind all the <b>keep</b>ers that this list is 141 kilobytes, and prints to 53 pages of A4. I question who will be able to manage it. As research continues to shuffle the taxonomy of species, will all those who edit the mammal articles remember to update this list as well? If the Cross River Gorilla subspecies were to be reclassified as a new species, as some researchers would have it, then one would need to update the articles <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross_River_Gorilla_6b57.html" title="Cross River Gorilla">Cross River Gorilla</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Gorilla_151a.html" title="Western Gorilla">Western Gorilla</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Lowland_Gorilla_4701.html" title="Western Lowland Gorilla">Western Lowland Gorilla</a>, and <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorilla.html" title="Gorilla">Gorilla</a> - all of which are linked to each other. Then one would have to remember to update <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_placental_mammals.html" title="List of placental mammals">List of placental mammals</a> (which is orphaned from all the gorilla articles). - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardcavell_48b5.html" title="User:Richardcavell">Richardcavell</a> 12:05, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

WP:WEB specifically states that for such a thing to have Wikipedia notability, it has to have media re-prints of press releases and advertising for the content or site. Bonus Stage has no such thing.

<p>Article is an unreferenced duplicate of a section of an identical paradox called the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supertask.html#Ross-Littlewood_Paradox" title="Supertask">Ross-Littlewood Paradox</a>. The only difference between the two is that the Ross-Littlewood sub-article uses marbles, while the Ping-pong ball article uses ping pong balls. Therefore the Ping-pong ball article can be deleted as duplicate material, with a redirect to the Ross-Littlewood Paradox. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:35, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'd recommend using a redirect, since there are currently articles that link to the Ping Pong ball article. Deleting with no redirect would leave those other articles red-linked. Also, it's possible that some unreferenced texts do indeed refer to the paradox using "ping pong balls", so readers who type that in should be redirected to the Ross-Littlewood_Paradox description. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:59, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete or Rewrite</b> almost all the information is only useful to game players, makeing it fancruft. There is so much that the article would be below "stub" grade if it were removed. It can't stay this way, so remove it or change it. <a href="../../../e/x/a/User%7EExarion_c223.html" title="User:Exarion">Exarion</a> 23:58, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As I feel this article gives even non-players useful information about the nature and feel of the game. It does not only benefit players. <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMamyles_cca1.html" title="User:Mamyles">Mamyles</a> 00:15, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. On the very first edit in 2004, the edit summary was: <i>"new article, to condense articles about locations in runescape"</i>. I think it still serves this purpose -- it <i>prevents</i> the <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">cruft</a> from happening, whilst providing information on a well-known and notable game. I think it's reasonable and notable enough to have one article of its own. (By the way, I've never played RuneScape and barely even know what it's about; this is just how I see things.) --<a href="../../../c/z/j/User%7ECzj_f490.html" title="User:Czj">Czj</a> 00:52, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> bad nomination reason (fancruft should not be used to explain a nomination), and since these locations are hardly any different from any of the other games with discreet locations described, I'm not going to vote delete anyway. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:59, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but do a major rewrite, as the article is badly organized and confusing. I admit, there's a lot of fancruft, but this article is important in explaining Gielnor in terms of locations and landscape. Instead of deleting, why not help with a rewrite?
