Recommend salting. I speeded it and the speedy was ignored and then someone changed it to prod and then the prod was removed without reason by someone without a talk page at this current time. It basically falls under the speedy deletion for Db-repost. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 04:18, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><s>Delete</s> The only reliable source I see is the game's own website and that of the company that makes it. There's no clear evidence of notability, here. I've also tagged it for speedy as a repost, as the editor who removed that tag is not an admin and can't see the old version to judge whether it is substantially different from this one.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 04:29, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> The more I look at some of these sources, the more I waver. There's this magazine article Sean K references below (though a date and page # would be nice). There's also these three sources form the first AfD: <a href="http://telechargement.journaldunet.com/fiche/4316/2/la_quatrieme_prophetie/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://telechargement.journaldunet.com/fiche/4316/2/la_quatrieme_prophetie/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.extremia.org/gazette/20001104c-t4c.php3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.extremia.org/gazette/20001104c-t4c.php3" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://www.mondespersistants.com/mmorpg/news/Quatrieme-Prophetie/9657/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mondespersistants.com/mmorpg/news/Quatrieme-Prophetie/9657/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. The first source is from <i><a href="http://www.journaldunet.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.journaldunet.com/" rel="nofollow">le Journal du Net</a></i>, which seems to be a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. The next two are probably gaming fan sites, but the webhits and number of players (ordinarily bad means of establishing notability, but OK in uncertain cases like this) lead me to opine weak keep.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 05:13, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>There do seem to be quite lot of hits for this <i>in French</i>. I don't speak French sufficiently well that I can tell whether these are non-trivial coverage of the game or not for certain, but they seem to be. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 10:49, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I didn't even realize that the original was deleted, or there was one before. I removed the deletion notice as it seemed to be claiming that this was simply a repost of the same Wikipedia article that was up before, without disagreement, and was to be deleted in 10 days if it was not removed. This one was recreated from scratch by me, referenced, and it is definitely notable. I would have referenced articles stating it's popularity if I found that they were important pertaining to the article. All it takes is a simple google search with quotations around it, and you'll find tons of websites on it <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;hs=E2j&amp;q=%22the+4th+coming%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;hs=E2j&amp;q=%22the+4th+coming%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;hs=E2j&amp;q=%22the+4th+coming%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=</a> The game has had many players, well over 100 000, and has been in existence since around the time of Ultima Online, as I have cited. To what extent of notability, I'm not sure some of you know what you're talking about, as there are tons of other Wikipedia articles with far less notability that aren't subject to deletion at this moment in time. Perhaps IGN making reference to The 4th Coming is notable? <a href="http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/357/357519p1.html" class="external free" title="http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/357/357519p1.html" rel="nofollow">http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/357/357519p1.html</a> I apologize if I didn't get the format of this discussion correct. -Merodies (December 11th/06)
<ul>
<li>No worries about the format; the important thing is that you're participating. I and another editor tagged it as {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-repost_a444.html" title="Template:Db-repost">db-repost</a>}} because we couldn't see the older version. An admin (Proto, below), saw they were different and removed that tag. As to your point about other articles, see <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a>. Because Wikipedia is open content, it's difficult to ensure every article meets our standards, since new ones are coming in all the time.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 05:13, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I find the large number of hits to be persuasive, even if most are gaming sites. Keeping <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> in mind I think we should assume Meodies' good faith. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a> 13:24, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have no idea how to use this wikki as i never have used it before, I am an Sysop for The Trilogy server of this game, There are 10 active servers of this current game currently run under the Dialsoft Corperation. There are over 1,000 players it may not be as new as many as the other games but the bias of the wikki is really sad, Considering the wikki is suppose to be a source of information, there are many servers 5 english and I belive 5 are french and there are lincenses currently being sold and we just had a graphics update so that i can compete a little with newer games. There are sites such as <a href="http://t4cbible.com" class="external free" title="http://t4cbible.com" rel="nofollow">http://t4cbible.com</a> that tells of the community and what servers do what, there is also <a href="http://fountianscroll.com" class="external free" title="http://fountianscroll.com" rel="nofollow">http://fountianscroll.com</a> the orginal post had a list of all the currently active servers and how to connect to them. There as stated above there are far lest notable things on here again what's it matter as long as it's an active currently running game I posted sites you can find information then where you can find the game simply because your asking for validation of a community, from those pages if you want to verify the game please check out the list of game sites and choose one to take a look at, the download is free also gamestationstore.com sells the game if people would rather buy it, like UO or WoW and many others. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.65.145.54 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.65.145.54_625d.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.65.145.54">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>What would really help is references to reviews of this in computer games magazines. If the game is as big as is claimed, this should be no trouble at all for someone who speaks French. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 14:15, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> As I said on the previous AfD page, there was a large (multi-page if I remember correctly) article on this game in the Australian magazine PC Powerplay back when it was released. Sean K 09:13, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> and salt per last discussion. Nothing's changed. If you want to keep it, post a link to a reputable, third-party site (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) that asserts that this is a truly notable game (as per <a href="../../../g/a/m/WP%7EGAMES_2f8a.html" title="WP:GAMES">WP:GAMES</a>).

<li><b>Delete and salt</b> For the same reasons I gave in the last AfD. All the current sources do is establish that the game exists, which is not under contention. Still nothing to establish any notability for the game. A lot of the references are to the main game site.

<li><b>Comment</b> It sure does. People shouldn't be allowed to nominate an article for deletion if they're unwilling to participate in a discussion about it. Why have none of the people who disputed the games notability responded to my claim of it being featured in a magazine? Sean K 00:23, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Basically. One person mentions a guideline that isn't even finalized, and like two others respond quickly after voting for deletion because of the same thing. I'm hoping this article won't be deleted because of people blindly voting without even reading the facts that some of us have stated.Merodies 02:58, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
