<dd>You're skirting Don Paul's many accomplishments in many other areas long before 9/11 ever happened. Don't try to pretend that the AfD isn't being built around the notion of discrediting well established icons that have made their mark long before the internet arose. Don is a legend in running circles, just ask veteran editors Mark Winitz, over at <i>California Track and Running News</i>, or <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Cooper_%28journalist%29_ee5c.html" title="Bob Cooper (journalist)">Bob Cooper</a>, at <i><a href="../../../r/u/n/Runner%27s_World_b34f.html" title="Runner's World">Runner's World</a></i>. His extensive work on behalf of charitable groups is likewise quite noteworthy, from San Francisco to New Orleans. He is quite well known in the San Francisco Bay Area music scene, and his poetry earned him a prestigious <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stegner_Fellowship_3ea2.html" title="Stegner Fellowship">Stegner Fellowship</a> at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_University_8e23.html" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a>, the youngest ever to receive the award.<a href="http://www.sfcall.com/issues%202002/10.7.02/paul_10_7_02.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sfcall.com/issues%202002/10.7.02/paul_10_7_02.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Simply as a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">polymath</a> he deserves an article, or for any of the many disciplines he has mastered, such as when he went under the US and World record in the <a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/~dmd1/metyrs" class="external text" title="http://www.lehigh.edu/~dmd1/metyrs" rel="nofollow">50 kilometer ultramarathon</a>, which (in contradiction to a comment below) was certainly covered in the mainstream New York media between 1980 and 1982 (including the <i>NY Times</i>). It certainly has been mentioned plenty of times in the media, usually every time Don produced another stunning performance, right up until his recent retirement from running. This AfD is way over the top. (added cites 10/4/06) <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 04:24, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So give us sources that back up any of these claims. Give us sources. None of us have been able to find almost any mentions of this person. If you can find the sources that back up these claims he will be kept. Furthermore, your repeated accusations aren't helping matters. I (and I suspect most people currently favoring deletion) would be more than willing to keep the article if you gave back up for this. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:40, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Look, it isn't an accusation to state as a fact that most of the criticism heaped on Don Paul's noteworthiness (already piled below) has been built around attempts at discreditation of his work (i.e., in the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_Truth_Movement_a967.html" title="9/11 Truth Movement">9/11 Truth Movement</a>). A minor exception below is the claim that Don Paul doesn't even meet noteworthiness standards for athletes, and that is just plain silly. Maybe you should <a href="http://www.caltrack.com/features/donpaulinterviewMarApr06.html" class="external text" title="http://www.caltrack.com/features/donpaulinterviewMarApr06.html" rel="nofollow">read the article by Winitz</a> that is already linked in the external links section, "Paul--a notable competitor on the national and California racing scenes for two-and-a-half decades--recently retired from racing." For another thing, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_E._Jones_96d2.html" title="Steven E. Jones">Steven E.

<dd>Ok, so you now have enough sources to maybe justify an article about him as an athlete with maybe a tiny note about his 9/11 related stuff. However, a single source doesn't make him notable as an athlete either. From <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>- "Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activites that are themselves considered notable, including college sports in the United States. Articles about first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate, but only if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad are worthy of articles. Third party verification from a reliable source outside of publications by sponsors of the sport or activity should be provided to demonstrate that the subject is widely recognized as performing at the highest level." and he seems to maybe meet that criterion. So you have enough to write an article about him as an athlete and note the other stuff. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:41, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh. More hurdles. Just keep moving the flaming hula hoops. Fist the article is dismantled, then more tactics fail, and now a chance to thank you for your outright admission of the true purpose of the concerted serial attacks on the article. Whitewashing is whitewashing by any other name. Citations can be found all day, all over the place (outside the discredited walled garden aka the corporate media), concerning Don Paul's notability, that issue is just another red herring. All the citations needed were in the external links section all along, but the delete votes below simply wanted to believe the mistaken assertions used to justify <a href="../../../s/u/p/Suppression.html" title="Suppression">suppression</a>.

<li><b>strong keep</b>: This AfD appears to be yet another distracting attempt at sustaining the scorched Earth campaign to cleanse the Wiki of any and all rational accounts of WTC issues. Don Paul is quite noteworthy as both an athlete and as a scholar, much less for his involvement in the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_Truth_Movement_a967.html" title="9/11 Truth Movement">9/11 Truth Movement</a>. It is getting to the point where the campaign to purge <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rational.html" title="Rational">rationality</a> from the Wiki's 9/11 articles needs to be addressed at a broader level, as the ongoing scorched Earth tactics being used have long since passed the threshold of <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_E._Neuman_e24f.html" title="Alfred E. Neuman">mere annoyance</a>. Instead of an intelligent discourse on what really happened, this campaign seems designed to ensure that discussion, much less editing, never gets past the most essential basics of events surrounding 9/11. There is nothing too hard about understanding that aluminum sheathed jets floating into heavily reinforced giant skyscrapers represent the equivalent of a nerf football impacting a brick wall. WTC 7 collapsed in its footprint without even the distraction of that red herring. Of course, without that, there is not one credible excuse being put forth to excuse the collapse of the building, aside from the entirely unrebutted <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controlled_demolition.html" title="Controlled demolition">controlled demolition</a> explanation, which Don Paul has inconveniently helped place dead center in the controversies surrounding 9/11. For that alone, his bio should stand, his athletic and artistic achievements notwithstanding. It is obvious that the omission commission was stacked with panelists burdened by serious <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_of_interest.html" title="Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a> problems, but that doesn't seem to deter those engaged in the efforts to suppress rationality from the discussion here at the Wiki, who instead chirp 'conspiracy theory', until <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dysphonia.html" title="Dysphonia">hoarse</a>, at the drop of a hat. But even more amazing is the way that the suppression of debate has kept other basic facts from being recognized as the facts essential for <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socratic_method.html" title="Socratic method">rational discourse</a>. The official 9/11 omission commission insinuation that mere carbon chain fuels, which are quite combustible at temperatures <i><a href="../../../f/a/h/Fahrenheit_451.html" title="Fahrenheit 451">in the mid 400s</a></i> (and unstable by their very nature), could even have begun to come close to the quadruple digit temperatures, necessary to melt the structural steel <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alloy.html" title="Alloy">alloys</a> of the WTC buildings, is a total farce. The scorched Earth campaign to suppress the ideas set forth by Don Paul, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Hoffman_a00e.html" title="Jim Hoffman">Jim Hoffman</a>, et al, is little more than the product of a sad campaign to empty the Wiki of rational content that would provide insights into the <a href="../../../f/a/h/Fahrenheit_9_11_5431.html" title="Fahrenheit 9/11">actual reality of 9/11</a>. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 19:25, 30 September 2006 (UTC) <small>— <b>Note to closing admin</b>: <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> (<a href="../../../o/m/b/User_talk%7EOmbudsman_43fa.html" title="User talk:Ombudsman">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ombudsman_192c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ombudsman">contribs</a>) is the creator of the article that is the subject of this AfD.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm about to apply a personal test. I don't know how it will turn out. The issue here is not what happened on 9/11, but whether Don Paul is notable. I'm going to do a search of The New York Times and see whether it has ever mentioned him. If it has, in the context of his being a well-known 9/11 theorist, I'll vote <i>keep.</i> This is not to suggest that everyone ever named in The New York Times merits an article, nor that mention in the New York Times should be a requirement, but it's a good barometer of national notability, and in the case of 9/11 theories a New York paper would <i>certainly</i> be expected to cover anything remotely relevant. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 21:43, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Search for "Don Paul" in The New York Times from 1/1/2000 to 9/29/3006 produces nine hits, none to this Don Paul. Seven are to the motion picture "The Road to El Dorado" and visual effects director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0666802/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0666802/" rel="nofollow">Don Paul</a>, surely someone else. September 9, 2002: "Frankie Albert, a Pioneering Quarterback, Is Dead at 82," mentions "Don Paul, a Los Angeles Rams linebacker who was among the many defenders frustrated by Albert's deception, likened him to Fran Tarkenton." Not the same person. January 8, 2000: "Tom Fears, N.F.L. End and Coach, Dies at 77" mentions "As a former teammate, Don Paul, told The Los Angeles Times..." This is also likely the Rams linebacker. I can't believe that an important 9/11 theorist would not have been mentioned at all by <i>The New York Times,</i> if only in passing. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 21:51, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Give me a good source citation to a nice mainstream source that says he's an <i>important</i> 9/11 theorist and I'll change my vote. I believe such a citation will have more influence in this discussion than expressing your opinions about Wikipedia articles. I spent as much time as I felt was necessary for "due diligence" and it looks to <i>me</i> like he's not important. But I'm open to change. If you can find a citable <i>source</i> showing he's a prominent talking head in network TV documentaries, or has appeared on Larry King, or Rush Limbaugh, or has gotten more than a passing mention in the increasing number of books devoted to 9/11, I'll listen. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:41, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bro, how many New York times articles do you see about <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rusty_trombone.html" title="Rusty trombone">Rusty trombones</a>? Once the movement has been notable, it is up to the movement itself to define what is notable. Sex is notable, people in the sex-industry use the disgusting term Rusty trombone, hence, it is notable. Same to Pokemon, or any other cruft. Do you see Dark Sidius in New York Times? No, but you will find Star Wars. But this principle does not apply to 911TM, you just deleted TerroStorm with 300k hits.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 15:30, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wouldn't apply a New York Times hit count as my personal test on <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rusty_trombone.html" title="Rusty trombone">Rusty trombone</a> because of their famous "ear," "All the news that's fit to print." However, I know of no reason why 9/11 material would be filtered out by that policy. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:27, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Striver, google testing is not as useful for web-related topics, and no, movements do not get to define what is notable within them by itself. (Again, if you want to AfD various sex stuff, go ahead) as for Darth Sidius, he was mentioned in multiple NYT articles including one a while back that discussed political symbolism of the character. Not an especially convincing example (if you wanted to get rid of stuff from the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Expanded_Universe_9ad4.html" title="Star Wars Expanded Universe">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a> you might have a point- again AfD it if you feel that way). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:37, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Don't take offence, but i view that suggestion as "go ahead and get yourself accussed of WP:POINT". I am utterly un-convinced of your argument, and would be very surpised if an afd of those articles would be succesfull. Anyway, i have had enough of this topic.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 17:26, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, btw, i am still waiting for <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lanczos_tensor.html" title="Lanczos tensor">Lanczos tensor</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrov_classification.html" title="Petrov classification">Petrov classification</a> to get NYT coverage... Hey, they should be deleted, right? I mean, its own comunity is not supposed to define what it claims is notable, right? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 17:37, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are being ridiculous. Obviously not every group should be treated the same way. Math or science are reputable areas already with wide coverage and thus can to a large extent self-determine notability (note that even then for articles like the one in question- people- they have some difficulty with just that- see <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>) this is less the case for fringe topics and regardless of what you think of the 9/11 truth movement, they are a fringe and thus their community does not get automatically to decide notability- to put it another way, for something to be notable in a barely notable fringe it needs to be noticed by someone outside the fringe whereas if somethgin is from a mroe or less mainstream area of study it is reasonable to look for notability within that area. As to your comment about <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> it would only be a point violation if you were doing it to prove a point as such. If you a) genuinely think that these articles shouldn't be here, you are more than entitled to nominate them for AfD. Finally, please note that many of the 9/11 conspiracy related articls have stayed on Wiki and have survived deletion or not even been nominated. Some of them meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and some do not. In this case, there is less than compelling evidence that Don Paul does. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:05, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am going to make what I think is an appropriate test for <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lanczos_tensor.html" title="Lanczos tensor">Lanczos tensor</a>. Again, this is my personal test for this particular topic. I'm going to search for it on Google Books.

<dd>Found one highly relevant hit <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9812383077&amp;id=6HkK-lXaGukC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=%22Lanczos+tensor%22&amp;sig=3HB4Lm3Gz6wsW3CwzQPNtr5Tyhg" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9812383077&amp;id=6HkK-lXaGukC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=%22Lanczos+tensor%22&amp;sig=3HB4Lm3Gz6wsW3CwzQPNtr5Tyhg" rel="nofollow">here</a>, in "The Introduction to 2-Spinors in General Relativity." This seems to me to be good confirmation that this is an important concept in the theory of relativity. I'll leave the analysis of a similar <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22Don+Paul%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22Don+Paul%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">search for "Don Paul"</a> to the reader, as it is such a common name that it is very hard to disentangle them, but if you can find a book citing him as an important runner or 9/11 theorist I'll reconsider my vote. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:26, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>For the record, the New York Times doesn't discuss the Lanczos <i>tensor,</i> but it <i>does</i> have a story, March 7, 1936, p. 10, "Einstein Refutes Attack on Theory, in which a letter by Einstein and N. Rosen mention that "Professor C. Lanczos of Purdue University has independently recognized the error in Silberstein's paper," which to me confirms the notability of Lanczos and his status with regard to the theory of relativity. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:35, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
