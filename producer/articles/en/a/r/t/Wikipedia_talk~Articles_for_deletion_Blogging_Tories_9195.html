<ul>
<li>1.1.1 Arguments to delete
<ul>
<li>1.1.2 Notable members don't make notability, 1.1.6 Not notable only, 1.1.5 Non notable plus<br />
Thirteen editors whow had previous community involvment felt this way.</li>
<li>1.1.3 Covered under "self published authors""<br />
One editor felt this way.</li>
<li>1.1.4 Sockpuppet concerns<br />
Ironiclly, this was contributed by a very new member of the community.</li>
<li>1.1.7 No argument presented<br />
Discarded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1.1.8 Arguments to keep
<ul>
<li>1.1.9 Philosophical, 1.1.10 Keep for symmetry,1.1.11 Systemic bias<br />
As these do not address the issue of <i>this</i> article, discarded. Wikipedia is not consistant.</li>
<li>1.1.12 Notable due to number of members or notable members<br />
Two editors whom had signifigant conributions felt this way.</li>
<li>1.1.13 Notable in more words, 1.1.14 Just "notable"<br />
Three editors with any signifigant edit history felt this way.</li>
<li>1.1.15 No argument presented<br />
Discarded if there had been any.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1.1.16 Arguemts of broader nature</li>
</ul>
<p>It is worth noting that it is difficult to prove a negative, so an argument could be made that saying "not notable" is a claim without evidence. In the absence of any credible counter argument that demonstrates notability this claim carries some weight. Fifteen "not notables" are easily canceled by a single "notable, per [link to new york times] and [link to gaurdian]". This did not occur.</p>
<p>Once editors who failed to present any argument were set aside, as well as those whose arguments were claims without evidence, and those whose arguments did not adress the merits of this article, there does exist a clear consensus to delete.</p>

<p>This article was marked for AfD by an anon for reasons that seems to be making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>, but then blanked (apparently the anony thought better of it). But the AfD tag was still on the page when I went over to see if it was worthy of being deleted, and I think it is. So I'll save the anonymous guy the trouble of being branded a point'er and nominate it myself. It's a not extraordinary blog group, and though it has some interesting members it doesn't make the group notable in of itself. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 22:09, 15 November 2005 (UTC) )</p>

<li>Its ridiculous to say that large blog groups like the Blogging Tories are not notable. Take this recent quote from the globe and mail talking about the upcoming election, "there are some who think the Internet and Internet blogs may play a bigger role." Blogging Tories is the biggest force there is in the Canadian political blogosphere, so at the very least, we should wait and see before we say it isn't notable.--<a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEsto_fd28.html" title="User:Esto">Esto</a> 19:45, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think I know why people don't find the membership to be convincing. These people could be members of a local supper club too, right? Does that make the club significant? The blogging torries is a website who aggregrates content from people's blogs. Couldn't there be any number of such websites? What makes this one special? I could make a website tomorrow that aggregates content from these people's blogs. Their best claim to fame seems to be when newsworthy events happened which were leaked on the Internet.

<dd>Other articles are not the concern here. Web stuff is overrepresented here at Wikipedia, so it's not surprising that unverifiable and insignificant websites sometimes have articles about them.

To answer your specific question, Daily Kos appears to have significant traffic compared to the other ones, even if adjusted by a factor of 5 for the populartion difference between US and Canada. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 04:26, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>For starters, as I've stated before, a larger country by <i>definition</i> generates a higher volume of Internet traffic than a smaller one, which is precisely why the notability of a website has to be defined by its <b>own context</b>. Argument by Internet traffic alone, by definition, <i>is</i> an assertion that Canadian stuff has less notability just because it's Canadian — the arguments are <b>inseparable</b> from each other, because Canada's smaller size means a site of Canadian-specific interest <b>inherently</b> can't generate the traffic to compete on raw numbers. And statistically, simply multiplying the lesser site's traffic volume by the population differential <i>isn't</i> a mathematically reliable comparison of influence. The questions of the site's influence in Canadian politics, its notable members, its media presence, etc. have already been answered numerous times. The only valid measure of influence is whether this and ProgBlog are <b>as notable within Canadian politics as <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Kos_042a.html" title="Daily Kos">Daily Kos</a> is within American politics</b>. The contextual relationship <b>has</b> to be taken into account. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:58, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. First thing, I can’t understand how someone can say the Blogging Tories are “not notable” when there are prominent Members of Canadian Parliament as part of the group. I think those people are grossly mischaracterizing the Blogging Tories or wrongly mistaking them as only being two or three random blogs. Blogging is fast becoming an important medium in politics and the Blogging Tories have become one of the largest forces in the Canadian political blogosphere. There are even numerous examples where they have had a direct impact in Canadian politics.

<li>Its ridiculous to say that large blog groups like the Blogging Tories are not notable. Take this recent quote from the globe and mail talking about the upcoming election, "there are some who think the Internet and Internet blogs may play a bigger role." Blogging Tories is the biggest force there is in the Canadian political blogosphere, so at the very least, we should wait and see before we say it isn't notable.--<a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEsto_fd28.html" title="User:Esto">Esto</a> 19:45, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. First thing, I can’t understand how someone can say the Blogging Tories are “not notable” when there are prominent Members of Canadian Parliament as part of the group. I think those people are grossly mischaracterizing the Blogging Tories or wrongly mistaking them as only being two or three random blogs. Blogging is fast becoming an important medium in politics and the Blogging Tories have become one of the largest forces in the Canadian political blogosphere. There are even numerous examples where they have had a direct impact in Canadian politics. There is no reason why an important website like the Blogging Tories shouldn’t be on Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEsto_fd28.html" title="User:Esto">Esto</a> 02:20, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think I know why people don't find the membership to be convincing. These people could be members of a local supper club too, right? Does that make the club significant? The blogging torries is a website who aggregrates content from people's blogs. Couldn't there be any number of such websites? What makes this one special? I could make a website tomorrow that aggregates content from these people's blogs. Their best claim to fame seems to be when newsworthy events happened which were leaked on the Internet. By having a connection to that leak, they claim they're significant. This is crazy.

<dd>Other articles are not the concern here. Web stuff is overrepresented here at Wikipedia, so it's not surprising that unverifiable and insignificant websites sometimes have articles about them. Let's judge each article on its own merits, or maybe use the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guideline for websites. To answer your specific question, Daily Kos appears to have significant traffic compared to the other ones, even if adjusted by a factor of 5 for the populartion difference between US and Canada. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 04:26, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>For starters, as I've stated before, a larger country by <i>definition</i> generates a higher volume of Internet traffic than a smaller one, which is precisely why the notability of a website has to be defined by its <b>own context</b>. Argument by Internet traffic alone, by definition, <i>is</i> an assertion that Canadian stuff has less notability just because it's Canadian — the arguments are <b>inseparable</b> from each other, because Canada's smaller size means a site of Canadian-specific interest <b>inherently</b> can't generate the traffic to compete on raw numbers. And statistically, simply multiplying the lesser site's traffic volume by the population differential <i>isn't</i> a mathematically reliable comparison of influence. The questions of the site's influence in Canadian politics, its notable members, its media presence, etc. have already been answered numerous times. The only valid measure of influence is whether this and ProgBlog are <b>as notable within Canadian politics as <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Kos_042a.html" title="Daily Kos">Daily Kos</a> is within American politics</b>. The contextual relationship <b>has</b> to be taken into account. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:58, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Systemic bias in favor of all things internet-related has been identified on Wikipedia also. Countless flash movies, personal websites, blogs and myspace users get articles written about them, when they <i>generally</i> shouldn't. Individual politicans may be encyclopedic, but their blogs rarely are. This article is about a website that aggregates content from a bunch of different blogs. Surely the "notability" of a few noteworhty politicans does not automagically transfer that far up the chain? What's next, an article about the physical server that this website runs on?</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. One of Wikipedia's recognised strengths is that it is up-to-date, especially on recent phenomena. We have articles on every single imaginable video game, most music albums you care to mention, practically every single piece of software out there, a number of <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">usenet</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsgroups.html" title="Newsgroups">newsgroups</a>, Wikipedia did better than the regular news media on recent events such as the London bombings and Hurricane Katrina, and so on. Where else but Wikipedia can people find hopefully neutral information on the recent and increasingly important phenomenon of blogging, especially political blogs, which are not neutral by their very nature. NPOV articles on Blogging groups (not necessarily individual blogs, mind you), perform a vital service to the world at large. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigizanasi_db83.html" title="User:Luigizanasi">Luigizanasi</a> 04:06, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm willing for my suggestion to count as a <b>merge</b> as well if it helps build consensus. I don't believe this should have its own article, but it's possible it could be mentioned elsewhere. However, the article you've suggested as a merge target is on Afd also, and I believe it's original research. I wonder if <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Canada_67dc.html" title="Politics of Canada">Politics of Canada</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_Culture_of_Canada_660f.html" title="Political Culture of Canada">Political Culture of Canada</a> is a good place for this stuff.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_Blogging_Tories_9195.html" title="Edit section: Bias by inclusion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bias by inclusion</span></h2>
<p>I have some concern about the fact that the issue I raised in my comments has ended up being exactly what happened here, namely that this got deleted but <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Bloggers_eb23.html" title="Progressive Bloggers">Progressive Bloggers</a> got kept. Firstly, it constitutes bias by inclusion to treat them differently from each other. Secondly, if one actually wanted to argue for treating them independently, by any objective measure (Alexa ranking, number of members, number of notable members, etc.) Blogging Tories would be the <i>more</i> notable of the two. So there's simply no criterion under which one could possibly make a case that ProgBlog is notable enough to stick around but the Tory group isn't.</p>
<p>I've discussed the matter with a couple of other people who were involved in this discussion, and we're all in agreement that it's inherently POV to allow an article about one but not the other, and the two therefore <i>have</i> to be treated in tandem. Although my own position on both debates was to keep, and although <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a>'s preference was to delete, he and I <i>both</i> agree that the status quo is an absolutely unacceptable result...and we <i>both</i> would rather see the <i>opposite</i> of our original preferences happen than this.</p>
<p>I'm thus asking for some input on which approach people would prefer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nominate <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Bloggers_eb23.html" title="Progressive Bloggers">Progressive Bloggers</a> for its third AFD.</li>
<li>Nominate <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogging_Tories_edf8.html" title="Blogging Tories">Blogging Tories</a> for undeletion.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of those two options must be pursued; the status quo of having one article kept and the other deleted cannot stand. They must either both stay, or both go; it's an inherently unacceptable POV-by-inclusion to permit only one of the two to have an article. So which is it gonna be, guys? <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:12, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This argument is based upon several assumptions, all of which are false.
<ol>
<li><b>Wikipedia is consistant.</b> Not only is this not true in practice, it's not even true in theory. Each discussion is, to some degree, isolated from every other. Closing admin's standards, to use an example, vary wildly.</li>
<li><b>These articles are connected.</b> No evidence has been presented that these articles form any sort of matter-anitmatter pair.</li>
<li><b>That NPOV extends beyond the article level.</b> This is another way to insert point one, and is just as false. To have a factual balanced article about <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire.html" title="Fire">fire</a> does not <i>require</i> that we have one about <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice.html" title="Ice">ice</a> as well.</li>

<p>Fire vs. ice does not raise a question of political bias. Ideologically-based blogging groups (especially ones which <i>explicitly</i> define themselves as existing in direct competition with each other) do. This is not comparable to fire vs. ice; it would far more comparable to saying that the Democratic Party deserved an article but the Republican Party didn't, based on some mysterious alternate criterion which failed to take into account their <i>inherent</i> contextual equivalency to each other.</p>
<p>And your comment entirely fails to address my second point, that while it would be technically possible (albeit wrongheaded) to formulate an argument that <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogging_Tories_edf8.html" title="Blogging Tories">Blogging Tories</a> were notable enough to be here and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Bloggers_eb23.html" title="Progressive Bloggers">Progressive Bloggers</a> weren't, the notion that ProgBlog is notable enough but Blogging Tories isn't is a <b>complete non-starter</b>. The Blogging Tories have a significantly higher Alexa ranking. The Blogging Tories have a larger member base. The Blogging Tories have far more members who are already notable enough for other reasons to have Wikipedia articles in their own right. It's simply not <i>possible</i> to claim that ProgBlog is <i>more</i> notable than Blogging Tories. There isn't one single criterion on which that argument stands up to two seconds' worth of scrutiny.</p>
<p>And your claim that <i>no evidence has been presented that these articles form any sort of matter-antimatter pair</i> is entirely wrong; their interconnectedness was quite explicitly spelled out in both articles, in both AFD debates <i>and</i> in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_blogosphere.html" title="Canadian blogosphere">Canadian blogosphere</a>. That's five different places in which it's been made abundantly and unmistakably clear.</p>
<p>And, for the record, I'm not some frustrated Tory trying to raise a ruckus because my pet article lost; I'm ideologically on the ProgBlog side of things. I should technically be <i>happy</i> that "my side" survived, but I'm not -- because selective inclusion constitutes a <i>major</i> POV problem. The status quo just cannot stand; that this is coming from somebody who's on the side of the article that <i>survived</i> should <i>underline</i> how problematic the situation is POV-wise. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 23:16, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Two Canadian political blogging groups. One is left-wing. One is right-wing. Both explicitly define themselves as each other's ideological counterweights. Both articles explicitly <i>discuss</i> the fact that they exist as each other's ideological counterweights. The article <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_blogosphere.html" title="Canadian blogosphere">Canadian blogosphere</a> is in large part <i>about</i> the fact that the Canadian blogosphere is largely divided into two ideologically-counterweighted blogging groups called <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Bloggers_eb23.html" title="Progressive Bloggers">Progressive Bloggers</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogging_Tories_edf8.html" title="Blogging Tories">Blogging Tories</a>. What more evidence is needed or even possible? And can the inherently absurd red herring comparisons; a Greek mythological figure has no bearing on the equivalency or non-equivalency of two symbiotic Canadian political blogging groups whose interrelationship is <b>already explicitly spelled out in the articles</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 07:17, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ok, this really isn't that hard - <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. The articles don't do it, you're not doing it. I can't yet looked at the <b>one</b> link that has been provided, but please actually go and <i>read</i> <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and WP:CITE. Do you think that we would simply accept <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Ray_871d.html" title="Gene Ray">Gene Ray</a>'s word on something, or would we want citations, references, etc? I'm like a broken record here, but it is one of the most fundamental precepts of Wikipedia, and you <i>just don't seem to get it</i>.<br />

<dd>Oh, there's nothing I'm failing to get. Let's try a metaphor here:
<ol>
<li>Somebody nominates <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Democratic_Party_b5cb.html" title="United States Democratic Party">United States Democratic Party</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Republican_Party_faa7.html" title="United States Republican Party">United States Republican Party</a> for deletion.</li>
<li>On some weird technicality, they end up with opposite results to each other <i>despite</i> the fact that their contextual interconnectedness has <i>already</i> been repeatedly spelled out, so one of the two gets deleted but the other one gets kept.</li>
<li>A person who's ideologically on the side of the article that got <i>kept</i> expresses concern that the conflicting result creates a POV issue against a group he <i>doesn't even politically agree with</i>, and asks for input on a list of options that explicitly includes <i>deleting</i> the article on the group that's actually in line with his own personal POV. And he even manages to get agreement from a person who voted to <i>delete</i> both articles that keeping both would <i>still</i> be a vastly preferable resolution to the one that actually occurred.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Given those three conditions, does one somehow need to provide external links to <i>prove</i> that the two parties have an inherent contextual relationship to each other, or is it sufficient that the two articles already link to each other, that several people in the AFD debates repeatedly spelled out the contextual relationship, and that <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_the_United_States_4c15.html" title="Politics of the United States">Politics of the United States</a> already discusses in exhaustive detail how the two are inherently related to each other as the "left" and "right" poles of the political spectrum in their particular context? And if somebody <i>does</i> provide you with an external link, is it somehow valid to continue acting as though the evidence doesn't exist just because you haven't personally <i>looked</i> at it?</dd>
<dd>This discussion is really a moot point now anyway; somebody else <i>already</i> VFU'd this article and got it recreated while I was wasting my time responding to red herrings about Nereids. So we're now sitting here arguing about the past. I guess that makes this EOD. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 08:45, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
