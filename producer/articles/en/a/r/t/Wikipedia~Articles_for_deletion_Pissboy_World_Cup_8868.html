<dd>You'll probably find that this article doesn't actually come under any of the things listed in "Why this is wrong" on that particular page, Thesquire. It is not a made-up word, nor is it seeking hosting, nor is it the first instance on the net of its existence. The Pissboy World Cup is a competition with a growing fanbase in central Scotland, and its cult popularity is spreading due to advertising campaigns in the form of posters and flyers. Also, referring to what cookiecaper said, why does a website that is hosted by Bravenet automatically get a bad mark against it? Does the Pissboy World Cup have to pay for hosting before it can be accepted as part of Wikipedia? I don't think that's outlined in any Wikipedia rules anywhere. Radioshed

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't dispute that. However, that doesn't give you an easy excuse to simply pass off my arguments just because I'm the author of the article, which is what I think you're implying with that last comment. If you really need it, I'll bring in other people who'll happily argue this case for me.--Radioshed 09:13, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I mentioned that you were the author to inform others who may or may not consider your comment on the situation. If you can bring in others who can vouch for this sport's "popularity", fair enough, but I doubt it would swing many of us. I don't doubt you have a few friends that invented the sport with you. If the sport was really gaining popularity, it would have more than the three results displayed <a href="http://www.google.de/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22pissboy+world+cup%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.de/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22pissboy+world+cup%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You're right, a Bravenet site doesn't deserve to be automatically shrugged off, but the event itself is inherently non-notable. Prove its notability (other than saying that it is growing) and I'll change my vote. Until that time, it remains delete. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamyskis_2c95.html" title="User:Jamyskis">Jamyskis</a> <font size="-3"><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamyskis_5b40.html" title="User talk:Jamyskis">Whisper</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jamyskis_a771.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jamyskis">Contribs</a></font> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" class="image" title="Germany"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/25px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png" alt="Germany" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" /></a> 10:01, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I actually take offense at this. For a start, there is nowhere that claims that the Pissboy World Cup is a "sport", as you have accused. The Pissboy World Cup is nothing more than a game, and doesn't claim to be anything more. Also, the Pissboy World Cup was invented by one person and one person alone - me. The fact that you're already making assumptions as to how this competition came into being shows how arrogant you are, and that you've most likely already made up your mind before anyone can say anything against you. The fact is, none of the creator's "friends" had anything to do with this. On top of this, the fact that you base your confirmation of something's existance on google search results just shows that you are also narrow-minded. There's more to something than just what a typical search engine claims. Did the Olympics exist before Google came into being? If we were to go by your train of thought, then no, the Olympics must not have existed until 1996, when Google was created. What do you need before you confirm something's existance? And even after you confirm this, that something is "notable"? Do you want me to give you a free trip to Scotland so you can gather information on the popularity of the Pissboy World Cup? Unfortunately I don't think that will be happening. Radioshed</li>

<li>This helpful reference definately must be kept for posterity. In years to come your children will be saying "Daddy, what were you doing during the pissboy world cup" and you're reply will be that you were trying to cover up it's existence for no other reason than to gain status in your ridiculous web community. Look this nonsense, it's all is written in HTML. You are worthless people, keep your grubby paws off our competition and your opinions to yourselves. I assure you the pissboy world cup is not a 'hoax competition' it is a highly organized event which provides much employment in the East Lothian area. People have worked very hard to make something of this and if you want to destroy all that then you will have to deal with them. Personally.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm getting seriously sick of this. I've moved your little essay to the end here. You have provided no evidence whatsoever of this event's notability. You cannot provide a single verifiable source of information to back your claims up. Like any other, this "ridiculous web community" has rules, and you will abide by them. This is a forum of discussion and as such there is no need to "keep our opinions to ourselves". I find it very unlikely that this competition is known to anyone beyond the select group of individuals mentioned on the website. Also, if this event is so important, I fail to see why it is so critical that this article stays. How exactly are we "destroying the hard work" of these people? Is Wikipedia the only basis for this "competition"? That alone would be criteria for deletion. Another thing: don't try play on people's consciences, and certainly don't go threatening members on here. It will bring you nothing, trust me. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamyskis_2c95.html" title="User:Jamyskis">Jamyskis</a> <font size="-3"><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamyskis_5b40.html" title="User talk:Jamyskis">Whisper</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jamyskis_a771.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jamyskis">Contribs</a></font> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" class="image" title="Germany"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/25px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png" alt="Germany" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" /></a> 14:52, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I make no idle threats sir. But perhaps I did go a little too far. I merely mean to demonstrate that we take this competition very seriously and any publicity to the wider world is a tremendous boon for us. The suggestions made on this discussion board that the competition is a hoax deeply anger myself and my associates.</dd>
<dd>I myself work for a group of 'notables' in the East Lothian county who are very much concerned with the history of the area as well as the ongoing cultural contributions of the younger generation. Such things have far reaching effects, that could even be of benefit to the wider scottish community. Having looked at the wikipedia regulations that have been highlited with regard to this entry, and after much discussion with my employers, the creator of the site and pissboy world cup officials, It has been decided that we may have to make some concessions.</dd>
<dd>Beginning from today I shall be preparing resources with which to begin the writing of an academic paper which will detail the strong links between the cultural phenomenon of the pissboy world cup and rich and vibrant history of Scotland. I will be in discussions over the next week with the foremost representitives of East Lothians cultural elite who have in their extensive studies compiled an unrivalled knowledge of the land and it's people, covering topics such as the battle of prestonpans, the popular music of the Proclaimers, the strange circumstances behind the Tennent's brewery fire in 1979, and of course the Sammy Burns mythos.</dd>
<dd>I ask only for your continued patience in this matter, I hope that this will go some way to satisfying your demands. I see it as my priviledge to be working on this project and will certainly be happy to provide some provenance of the pissboy world cup and it's distinguished roots.</dd>

<dd>That said, I still think that this is non-notable, and unfortunately does not meet the standards of Wikipedia. I am pretty sure that no comments on this page are meant to be insulting or inflammatory; they do not read that way to me. The fact remains that there are no outside sources to back up this claim, and therefore this article should be deleted as non-verifiable. --<i><a href="../../../d/c/r/User%7EDCrazy_776f.html" title="User:DCrazy">DCrazy</a></i> <span style="font-size: 8pt"><a href="../../../d/c/r/User_talk%7EDCrazy_1571.html" title="User talk:DCrazy">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DCrazy_4983.html" title="Special:Contributions/DCrazy">contrib</a></span> 18:39, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> Yes, delete it. Go on. If none of the Wikipedia people have heard of it, then it obviously doesn't exist, and it wouldn't even be worth taking notice of if it did.

<li><b>Comment:</b> You still don't seem to get it Radioshed. The minimum requirement of any article is that its content be relevant beyond a small group of people. People on here have invited you time and time again to present proof or sources related to this. Your answer has been to verbally insult anyone who challenges the legitimacy or notability of it. You have turned up nothing, except a Bravenet website and three Google links, two to your own site and one to a forum you posted to. If this was such an important event, it would have garnered at least a mention in a regarded weblog, a newspaper, or at least a number of fan sites. But there is nothing.
