<p>Very little information, nothing useful. Been stubbed for eons, and no one I know on Wikipedia has the info to expand it. It's better to delete it until we can recreate it, and even then, I'm unsure of it's notability. I have a plan to make a List of Dragonlance Sourcebooks, where this could one day be incorporated. <i><b><a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoomsDay349_6323.html" title="User:DoomsDay349"><font color="darkblue">Dooms</font></a><a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoomsDay349_7ac1.html" title="User talk:DoomsDay349"><font color="lightblue">Day349</font></a></b></i> 01:34, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Deleting articles just removes the work and research by those that started the article. What a waste of time. I agree some articles need to grow, but just deleting them does not help. People need someplace to start, and creating stubs, ideas, and other elements let Wikipedians work off of something. When you delete you leave nothing to work with. I view it as highly disruptive to the project. I know it is harder to create than destroy, but I hope you can be a creationist. Good luck to you. 13579create 06:29, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Redirect and Delete</b>. What work? That single sentence and plugging info into a cut-and-paste template took what, about ninety seconds? If someone actually wants to create a useable article on the subject - to the degree anyone bothers, because the entire series consists of similar stubs at best - more power to them, but since this stub was created, it (and the other related stubs) hasn't been touched in nine months. If there's that little interest, it should be merged into a larger article. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 15:27, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Um, you do know there's no point in redirecting and deleting, don't you? Once you delete a redirect it's gone. No more content. If your concern is with the history of this article being kept, it's really a minor concern, the disk space concerns are below minimal. And I assume you find either the proposed <b>List of Dragonlance game products</b> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons_modules_7f14.html" title="List of Dungeons &amp; Dragons modules">List of Dungeons &amp; Dragons modules</a> acceptable for the redirect target.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge/redirect</b> There's no official policy on game module articles as far as I know, but this does seem to be a notable product from a significant publisher. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 19:51, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'll address a lot of the comments here in one. My point is, while it is notable, yes, I agree, but there's no information and no one I know on Wikipedia has the knowledge or willingness to expand them. I'm suggesting to delete them for now, and recreate when we have more information in a new list that I'll create in a little while. Right now, though, it's completely useless, and there's no point in keeping an article such as this. A very wise, wise person once said, "The proliferation of mediocrity is never its own excuse." Take that to heart, please. <i><b><a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoomsDay349_6323.html" title="User:DoomsDay349"><font color="darkblue">Dooms</font></a><a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoomsDay349_7ac1.html" title="User talk:DoomsDay349"><font color="lightblue">Day349</font></a></b></i> 20:42, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Compromise</b>. I realize where this is leaning. Therefore, to compromise. Take the images and put them on the List of Dungeons &amp; Dragons modules, and then redirect the articles there. Is that an acceptable resolution? <i><b><a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoomsDay349_6323.html" title="User:DoomsDay349"><font color="darkblue">Dooms</font></a><a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoomsDay349_7ac1.html" title="User talk:DoomsDay349"><font color="lightblue">Day349</font></a></b></i> 20:56, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The thing is, there's no reason to delete them simply because "I'll create a better article later" as the contents of the articles, while minimal, are nonetheless valid. So, the worst that happens by leaving them up is a few kilobytes of disk space. Big deal. This discussion alone is probably using up more time and energy on people's part than could possibly be saved by deleting them. And to counter your proverb another wise person once said "Don't fix what ain't broken" . These pages aren't broken. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:23, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I see your point. I just feel like there's something better than can be done in transition for these articles until I can improve them. I guess I'll just move them to the List of DL sourcebooks I'm gonna make..when I get more DL sourcebooks. <i><b><a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoomsDay349_6323.html" title="User:DoomsDay349"><font color="darkblue">Dooms</font></a><a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoomsDay349_7ac1.html" title="User talk:DoomsDay349"><font color="lightblue">Day349</font></a></b></i> 01:33, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I see inclusionism's taking over...

<p><b>Comment'</b> For all the arguments as to notability, the fact is, this was a product of a notable gaming company, and part of an unquestionably notable series. (If you need proof that Dragonlance is notable, just ask yourself if something not notable would have over 100 books involving it. I'm sure somebody could tell you the sales figures and such, but I don't think there's a reason to try). This is, and the other modules which have been nominated, were part of the initial series that introduced Dragonlance to the world. Thus some coverage of it is appropriate, even if it were just to mention its name and a brief description in a discussion of Dragonlance products or the adventure series it was in. I'm willing to say there is a valid question in how best to cover the subject of this article, however, outright deletion, is not the best way. There are other options. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:52, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see the point in overzealous deletionism, if you don't want to read about this topic don't come here. The only <b>Compromise</b> I would see as acceptable is to <b>Merge and Redirect</b> <i>with other modules in the original DL series</i> (Not a general Dragonlance modules article but specifically the intial series of 14), with a section in the article for each of the modules. This would allow each module to be re-created as it's own article when the combined article got too large, and would also mean that there is then a good summary article for the series refering to each individual article. Merging or putting images into List of Dungeons &amp; Dragons modules is not a good idea as this article is long enough already and does not need to be expanded (That it is why it refers to individual module articles). I think there are better things to spend effort on than a merger and redirect, but if someone realy wants to spend the time and do it properly it would be acceptable, provided no information is lost from existing articles. - <a href="../../../w/a/z/User%7EWaza_937d.html" title="User:Waza">Waza</a> 22:39, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
