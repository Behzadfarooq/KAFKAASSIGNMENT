<p>I disagree with it being non-notable. Brian Flemming is a notable director of a very notable documentary which has been featured in Newsweek Magazine, the LA Times and countless other prominent publications (see <a href="http://www.thegodmovie.com/press.php" class="external free" title="http://www.thegodmovie.com/press.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.thegodmovie.com/press.php</a>). This is no less notable than anything Michael Moore has done, just perhaps more controversial given that most people aren't athiest whereas there are far more Democrats. As to the length of the article, I will work on fleshing out the article more robustly tonight. -- <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeroverse_1fd3.html" title="User:Zeroverse">Zeroverse</a></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> it doesn't matter how notable Flemming is; that does not confer any notability to a one-off publicity stunt unless major media outlets cover his "War on Easter". to use your example <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeroverse_1fd3.html" title="User:Zeroverse">Zeroverse</a>, if Michael More took a dump in a paper bag, walked it up to the front porch of Bush's Crawford Ranch, lit the bag on fire, hid in the bushes, filmed George Bush stomping it out, and them someone created an article called Crawford Ranch Flaming Poo on Bush's Hush Puppies I'd still say delete. If this is important information to you and you can source it then add it to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Flemming_4943.html" title="Brian Flemming">Brian Flemming</a>, but right now I see no strong case for this to exist as a standalone article.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:40, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Dunno</b> The site 404s for me and it isn't googling well. Maybe turn this into more than just about Brian Flemming as Bill O'Reilly has gone on at least one War on Easter rant on his radio show. Kotepho 17:57, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> I understand that Bill O'Reilly will be featuring The War on Easter very prominently tonight on his TV show. This isn't a non-issue. Thought I do agree that the "War on Easter" can and should be about more than Flemming's and the Rational Response Sqaud's movement. There is a BIG article here...it just hasn't been written yet. As I've said earlier, when I have more time tonight, I'll get to it. My hope was that others might be able to contribute in the meantime...that is the whole point of wikipedia right? <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeroverse_1fd3.html" title="User:Zeroverse">Zeroverse</a> 19:46, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I stated "household name" meaning his name is common knowledge among most Americans. You can have a conversation with any half-wit on the street and they are highly likely to know who Michael Moore is. Whereas this Flemming fellow cannot claim the same. I'm sure he's a nice guy but not notable. Media coverage does not make an individual notable. The individual's achievements make them notable. There are standards to judge this but as I said before, no one here cares if Flemming is notable. You are not arguing along the lines of this AfD which is concerns if War on Easter is notable. It is not. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 21:01, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I appreciate that you are trying to be objective, but I think it's incorrect to say that "the individual's achievements make them notable." What exactly has Michael Moore achieved that Brian Flemming hasn't (other than make more money)? While all your other points about moving/merging this article may be valid, I don't think they should be done under the cloak of "notability." If the article is insufficient at this time, fine...but saying that something isn't notable because Flemming hasn't "achieved" as much as say, Michael Moore, is a poor reason to exclude this article from the public...especially as Easter 2006 is only a few days away and there is very little critism of the holiday in general. The very fact that someone vehemently opposses Easter is notable in itself, and the fact that a growing group of people are committed to this effort is notable on its own merit, Flemming or no Flemming. Brian Flemming is an extremely notable individual in the atheist community anyway. He might not be a "household name" to religious folk that prefer not listening to opposing perspectives, but that doesn't discount his importance to rational thinkers in the freethought community. The War on Easter is extremely important to atheists and freethinkers, and calling it "not notable" because the relative size of the freethought community is miniscule is really just a form of mob rule and bullying. <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeroverse_1fd3.html" title="User:Zeroverse">Zeroverse</a> 14:29, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>What exactly has Michael Moore achieved that Brian Flemming hasn't (other than make more money)?</i> Well, there's making several internationally released movies, winning an Oscar, producing and hosting two TV series (one in primetime), writing a few internationally best-selling books, and popping up as a pop-culture reference everywhere from <i><a href="../../../w/o/r/Team_America%7E_World_Police_9d91.html" title="Team America: World Police">Team America: World Police</a></i> to <i><a href="../../../2/4/_/24_%28television%29.html" title="24 (television)">24</a></i> to <i><a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Guy_f6a0.html" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a></i>.

<li><b>Do NOT Delete:</b> My home, snailmail and email boxes are spammed with religious propaganda weekly. Some people trying to share an alternative point of view should be applauded. I recently became a fan of the Rational Response Squad, and through them, found this movie. The fact that atheists are giving out copies of their movie for free seems a very "christian" thing to do.<small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.180.80.74 (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.180.80.74_1270.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.180.80.74">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Isotope</b> like I suggested twice in my previous comment on the article, the "The war on easter" article should be merged with either brian flemmings article or one of the correlating Rational Responders biographies. --Animefreak1390 01:58, 12 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then lets agree to agree. Someone who is interested in this can just go ahead and boldly merge the content into <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Flemming_4943.html" title="Brian Flemming">Brian Flemming</a>'s main article.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:20, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b>, at least for the next couple months. This topic may ultimately justify it's own web page, or be more appropriate for a section in TGWWT. It all depends on how Christians respond. If today's DoS attack on Flemming's web sites is any indication, this could be significant in it's own right. In summary, my vote is KEEP. Human455 04:04, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Come on. Are personal attacks really necessary to justify your position? Brian Flemming had nothing to do with the addition of this article and he certainly doesn't make films or spread rational thinking for an ego-boost. A distinctly minor movie-maker? Your unsubtle bias completely undermines any valid points you may have had and frankly didn't add anything constructive to this discussion.

The reason there is a concurrent AfD of 2 "Atheist" articles is coincidence (I'm too lazy to count but there are probably about 600+ articles on active AfD right now... meaning "Atheist" articles make up 0.3% of articles on AfD) and more due to the fact that the 2 articles make no strong case for meeting their respective guidelines.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 02:53, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
