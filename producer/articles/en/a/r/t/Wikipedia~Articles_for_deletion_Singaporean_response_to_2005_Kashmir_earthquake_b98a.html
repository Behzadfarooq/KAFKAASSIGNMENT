<li><i>Such a minor branch of a subject that it doesn't deserve an article</i>. For Katrina, it might be justifiable because the article is too long. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Kashmir_earthquake_6a28.html" title="2005 Kashmir earthquake">2005 Kashmir earthquake</a> is quite short compared to <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>. Kashmir is just 18k while katrina is almost 60k. And yes, there's a way to incorporate the article's subject without unbalancing the main article. We could removed the condolence speech and simply state what kind of aid is being offered, just like other entry for other countries that are offering aid. <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarth_4e50.html" title="User:Earth">__earth</a> 10:11, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> IMHO, we should start out with a separate "International response to Kashmir earthquake" article, and only when <i>that</i> gets too big to contain all the information, should separate articles be created for individual countries. Also, what is so special about Singapore's response among all other countries, that it warrants a separate article? --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerkut_1f38.html" title="User:Berkut">Berkut</a> 01:37, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Kashmir_earthquake_6a28.html" title="2005 Kashmir earthquake">2005 Kashmir earthquake</a> is in a {{flux}} edit mode with rapid changes, so spliting out specific, well-defined sub-topics is a common practice to help contributors keep the main article focused on the overall rescue and relief operation. The relief effort is a significant event in Singapore, because of the large Pakistani, South Asian and Muslim community in the country. As we strive for a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">broader, global perspective in wikipedia</a>, prejudging and suppressing X-Country's perspective at this stage is counter-productive. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 03:05, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I doubt its systemic bias. If there were, wouldn't larger countries like the US which offers $50 mil + several military equipment and China which offers $6.2 mil + dogs have pages of their own? The point is, the main article is sufficient. If there were a bias, this nominee is because it's the only page of its kind concerning Kashmir earthquake. <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarth_4e50.html" title="User:Earth">__earth</a> 06:18, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: The article can be kept as of now, but it will make no sense till either - 1. it is a part of <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_response_to_2005_Kashmir_earthquake_0396.html" title="International response to 2005 Kashmir earthquake">International response to 2005 Kashmir earthquake</a> like <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> says, or 2. someone takes the initiative to write simialar articles for other countries. If this remains the only article of its type, then there won't be much point. In this regard, the corresponding articles for Hurricane Katrina are not "brilliant prose" themselves, IMHO. <a href="../../../s/a/k/User%7ESaksham_03f6.html" title="User:Saksham">Saksham</a> 03:37, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I respectfully disagree with the comments that this article can only exist on condition that other "Country-X reponse" articles are created. There is no wikipedia policy and guideline that impose such a condition. While I can easily satisfy it by creating another article, I disagree with such a condition that is based on editorial preferences, which are not grounds for <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">AfD</a>. Let me state clearly the reasons for keeping this article:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The content is NPOV, factual, verifiable and notable.</li>
<li>The presented facts received wide coverage not just in local news media, but also reported by AFP, Reuters, Xinhua, as well. <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=&amp;q=Singapore+earthquake" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=&amp;q=Singapore+earthquake" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
<li>Keep in mind that there isn't just one perspective looking at this event. There are X-country's perspectives as well. And I don't deny that this article is about Singapore's perspective. That's nothing wrong with it as we strive for a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">comprehensive, global perspective in wikipedia</a>.</li>
<li>This article is related not just to the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Kashmir_earthquake_6a28.html" title="2005 Kashmir earthquake">2005 Kashmir earthquake</a> event, it is also part of the comprehensive coverage to provide the <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge.html" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/d/Understanding.html" title="Understanding">understanding</a> on the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Singapore_15c3.html" title="Demographics of Singapore">demographics</a> (which has large number of foreign residents), the importance of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_Singapore_0a53.html" title="Foreign relations of Singapore">foreign relations</a>, and the preoccupation with <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Defence_2319.html" title="Total Defence">internal security</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Civil_Defence_Force_86c6.html" title="Singapore Civil Defence Force">civil defence</a> in the small country. The relief effort are therefore significant in Singapore. I cannot say for other countries, but they may or may not relate as much to the event in South Asia. Therefore, whether there exists other articles is irrelevant.</li>
<li>If you only want to read summarized description of the main event, then of course this article is of little interest to you. But for others who wish for a detailed understanding of the disaster or to study the politics of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_East_Asia_e921.html" title="South East Asia">South East Asia</a>, they would find this full article more useful than just a one-paragraph abstract.</li>
<li>This is not a loop-sided contribution by a user, I have contributed much more to the main article <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Kashmir_earthquake_6a28.html" title="2005 Kashmir earthquake">2005 Kashmir earthquake</a> than this one; and many entries in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Kashmir_earthquake_6a28.html#International_response" title="2005 Kashmir earthquake">2005_Kashmir_earthquake#International_response</a> were added by me. We may wish there are other countries' articles as well, but deleting this article is really a step backward, not forward. There are alot more work to be done as we aim for a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compendium.html" title="Compendium">comprehensive coverage</a>; but as long as this content is <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedic</a>, there is no reason to remove it.</li>
<li>In its currents state, there is no way to merge this article into another without deleting most of the content.</li>
<li>Finally, the stated reason for this nomination is really <i>not</i> valid for AfD, according to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 17:30, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
