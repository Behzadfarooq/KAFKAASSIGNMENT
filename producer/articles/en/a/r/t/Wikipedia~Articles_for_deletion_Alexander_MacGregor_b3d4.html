<p>This was originally created as a vanity article (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_MacGregor&amp;oldid=14213623" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_MacGregor&amp;oldid=14213623" rel="nofollow">content as written by original author</a>). Rather than VfD it, an editor apparently ran MacGregor through Lexis and found a couple items, which were added to the article (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_MacGregor&amp;oldid=14214122" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_MacGregor&amp;oldid=14214122" rel="nofollow">result</a>). The content added casts MacGregor in a rather negative light, and a complaint has been made to the Wikimedia Foundation implying the possibility of legal action.</p>
<p>Considering the complaint, we should only have an article on MacGregor, if at all, that we are confident meets our standards and is unimpeachably relevant and factual. I reviewed the article and removed the biographical material from the original author because it is not verifiable. For similar reasons, I removed information about his educational credentials that cannot be traced to a verifiable source without original research, and a paragraph whose only source has retracted the story. None of this content is acceptable for an encyclopedia — see <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Dubious_sources" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability#Dubious sources</a>.</p>
<p>What is left is the present article (and <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Institute_of_Pharmaceutical_Technology_084e.html" title="Toronto Institute of Pharmaceutical Technology">Toronto Institute of Pharmaceutical Technology</a>, included in this request). The verifiable facts about this man boil down to: 1) he runs a vocational school; 2) he was sued successfully by an employee for firing her when she was pregnant; and 3) he was found guilty of a domestic violence assault shortly before he was supposed to receive a local civic award. I submit that an article that amounts to nothing more than this is not one we should keep. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 02:57, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> both articles. The school, although not a liberal arts college, is post-secondary, so it seems notable, without reference to the ongoing schools debate. I lean toward thinking that the head of such a school would always be notable, but even if some or most of them aren't, a school official who's managed to get into so many publicized scrapes is. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 08:10, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. As it stands the article is too partial (in both senses) to be NPOV. Brief research suggests that the preparation of an acceptable article would involve interviewing the subject or consulting archives in several countries. The former is unverifiable and the latter is improbable. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 09:29, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete the existing article but leave open the possibility of recreating the article in a form which avoids the use of news reports of matters which were alleged but not proven.

<li><s><b>Keep</b>. Preferably the wife-beating conviction story should be sourced directly to the court report, but the newspaper article doesn't seem like an unreasonable source in view of the criminal conviction. Michael Snow removed some general biographical information; this was a very bad move in my opinion and the information should be restored. The details of his Scottish birth, his distinguished academic career, and emigration to Canada, at least, should not be omitted without good grounds. If the article is partial, it should be edited, not deleted. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 13:49, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</s> <b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b> - It seems to me that aside from the legal scrapes, there's nothing notable here and even less that's verifiable. I was unable to find much of anything factually relating to either article. For Alexander, I found mention of the human rights issue and the wife beating. There was no indication of any research articles, lectures, conferences, or other items of scientific value that's come from him. And not a shred of biographical information to be found. The school doesn't seem notable to me... no mention of research or great academic achievements, although maybe it's notable because of it's post-secondary education? Not sure exactly what the policy on that is. Overall it doesn't seem like it will be possible to produce an article of the appropriate quality. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirGeneral_34ab.html" title="User:SirGeneral">SirGeneral</a> 17:57, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>For what its worth, there *is* some biographical detail about him available on the web, though perhaps of limited usefulness <a href="http://visionsofscience.org/Visions%202005%20Bio%20of%20Presenters%20Official.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://visionsofscience.org/Visions%202005%20Bio%20of%20Presenters%20Official.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. "Toronto Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences" yields 22 Google hits, of which 12 are unique. One is its own web-site (it trades as Pharmacy Prep), and the rest are directory/portals. They all read "Offers preparation courses and study books for Canadian phamacology exams (PEBC)" and the contact information on the Institute's web-site includes a mobile telephone number. It is not to be confused with "Toronto Institute of Pharmaceutical Technology", which yields 985 Google hits. I am not convinced that an evening class school with no notable alumni is encyclopedic but I am stone cold certain that the president of such an institution is not encyclopedic when his only verifiable achievement may be a conviction for a crime unrelated to the school. [For the record, I was also born in a country, gained several post-secondary academic qualifications, and lived in several countries; I look forward to reading my Wikipedia entry any day now]. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 16:21, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> MacGregor and <b>merge</b> the school into it.

<li>Threats of litigation are a dime a dozen.

<li><b>Delete</b> the "institute", for the reasons given above by Theo. (Incidentally, I note that the "reference" cited in the article is to a page whose main text is written in the first person.) <b>Delete</b> MacGregor, who is of no note as the head of an "institute" of no note. The award he won seems rather obscure. The allegations made against him are -- very unfortunately -- routine, so he doesn't cut it even on grounds of notoriety. ("Want to get into Wikipedia?
