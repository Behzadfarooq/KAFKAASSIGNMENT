<p>James Marcinkowski was an unsuccessful candidate for Michigan's 8th congressional district. As per <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a>, it is preferable for articles created for congressional campaigns to be removed and included under an article about the campaign, which has been created at <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_8th_congressional_district_election%2C_2006.html" title="Michigan 8th congressional district election, 2006">Michigan 8th congressional district election, 2006</a>. Contents of the Marcinkowski article have been copied to the destination article for future revising. The debate is whether Marcinkowski represents a notable person in his own right, outside of the congressional race, as per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> guidelines. It should be noted that <strike>Marcinkowski did not have an article until his run for Congress, and that</strike> the majority of the article's content comes from his Congressional campaign. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffness_f8de.html" title="User:Jeffness">Jeff</a> 23:22, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: the statement that "Marcinkowski did not have an article until his run for Congress" is false, as I noted below.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Marcinkowski had a bio page up before he announced his run for Congress. As you can see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michigan_8th_congressional_district_election%2C_2006&amp;diff=20508981&amp;oldid=20508370" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michigan_8th_congressional_district_election%2C_2006&amp;diff=20508981&amp;oldid=20508370" rel="nofollow">here</a>, it was active in 2005 (though barely a stub). Unfortunately someone moved the page without consensus to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_8th_congressional_district_election%2C_2006.html" title="Michigan 8th congressional district election, 2006">Michigan 8th congressional district election, 2006</a> instead of AfDing it first, so the link I gave has the wrong page title. In any case, Marcinkowski was known for his work with the CIA and for his outspoken response to the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plame_affair.html" title="Plame affair">Plame affair</a>. He testified about it to the Senate well before his unsuccessful congressional run. Prior to that, he was known for prosecuting suicide <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Kevorkian_c2f9.html" title="Dr. Kevorkian">Dr. Kevorkian</a> when he was a prosecutor in Michigan. He may not be the most well-known person to ever run for Congress, but he is not an unknown, and his congressional run was not the only reason he was considered notable enough for a BLP. His testimony to the Senate committee is <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?pid=7948" class="external text" title="http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?pid=7948" rel="nofollow">here</a>; David Corn called it "perhaps the most powerful rebuttal of and rebuke" of the testimony that day; the testimony is quoted in numerous places, including Todd Gitlin's book The Intellectuals and the Flag excerpted in The American Prospect.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 00:22, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If a person is only included because of one event, and the only thing worth writing about them is in relation to that one event, it's logical to redirect their name to that one event. The question of whether this guy has notability <i>other</i> than the election is a content dispute, and not an issue that needs to be brought to AFD. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 07:41, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>The question of whether this guy has notability</i> other <i>than the election is a content dispute, and not an issue that needs to be brought to AFD.</i> Odd, I thought that the point of AfDs was to determine notability, and that "content dispute" occurs when editors agree on notability but disagree on wording. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 14:13, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nevertheless, I agree that simply moving the article was a bad idea. An article about an election needs a fundamentally different structure from a biography and we'd be better off with a decent article written from scratch to cover the election (or just a paragraph in the page on the district).

<dd>With all due respect, the article on the campaign - <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_8th_congressional_district_election%2C_2006.html" title="Michigan 8th congressional district election, 2006">Michigan 8th congressional district election, 2006</a> specifically says <i>the information below [which is about Marcinkowski] will be edited down and will become part of a full article about this race</i>. My intent is to turn that draft into a decent article - in fact, I'm setting up a wikiproject to recruit editors for this and a number of other races. While I'd love to be able to instantly create a complete article for the Michigan 8th race, I'm putting most of my efforts into the wikiproject, which hopefully will result in almost 100 good articles about House races in 2006.

<dd>I hope you won't use the same methods to create the rest of the articles; these moves just lead to a mess. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 18:00, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did 15 or so of these moves, trying to be judicious - almost all the articles were short and the candidates clearly non-notable. This one was probably the longest and the most "on the cusp"; with hindsight, I probably wouldn't have done what I did, despite <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">WP:BB</a>. I do note that no one has objected to any of the other moves, as far as I know. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 21:17, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And my move didn't make things "way screwy" - what made things "screwy" was the copy/paste done by Commodore Sloat; he could have just done a move to put the article back where it was. Or he could have asked me about my move, and I could have told him him how to reverse it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 14:13, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The more I look at this the worse it gets. The election article needs to be moved back to the guy's name to restore the history.

<dd>May I ask why you put the word encyclopedia in quotes, as if to suggest that it's not a real encyclopedia? So, from your perspective, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, but this one isn't, right?&#160;:) That's nice. Now, the history of the article you mention was started by Zereshk, and if he's involved with wikIran, the copyvio issue is a bit moot. But there's another thing, which makes that point even more moot. It's released under the GFDL as well, just like Wikipedia, so someone can easily go there and put the attribution there if it's missing. Right? I mean, that is the entire purpose of the GFDL, is it not? <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloodlands_6a95.html" title="User:Floodlands">Floodlands</a> 20:17, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW, also please note that linking WikIran (being a small wiki) "should be avoid", according to our policy.

<dd>Which policy is that? I've been looking through the policy pages, and can't find anything that says Wikipedians aren't allowed to link to small websites or wikis. That's nonsense. As an admin, you're really shouldn't make things up. If an editor incorporates text from wikIran or another public GFDL corpus provider, they can also add an attribution link. By virtue of that fact alone, your claim is incorrect. By the way, why the antagonism? You want to delete this article, that's fine. But please do not make false accusations of "spamming" against other users. Assume good faith, and leave your sarcasm at the door.

<dd>Actually judging from the history of articles User:Fesenjoon looks to be the more active user. But this is a moot point. The importance of any website is the quality of its content, <i>not</i> the quantity of users involved. What's interesting is that this wouldn't even be an issue if this site experiences what another editor here calls the "Slashdot effect" and achieved significant notability. I'm sure you would still use that "one-man-show" bit as an excuse for deletion, but you would never be able to dispute the notability criteria. What is nice to see are the other editors here who are positive in their outlook, desiring to delete now, but recreate later when notability is attained. And it is also of note to mention that these editors refrain from making accusations and the use of a sarcastic tone. Wikipedia needs far more positive, level-headed editors like that. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloodlands_6a95.html" title="User:Floodlands">Floodlands</a> 20:26, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>: Some so called admins are already taking it upon themselves and deleting all links to WikIran articles on WP. Note <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">User:Bogdangiusca</a>'s edits for example. His deletions are not "policy" as he claims, but <i>guidelines</i>, and he knows it. Yet he persists. Sad part is that if you take a closer look, most WikIran articles are more complete in content than their WP counterpart. I see such moves as purely intentional and obstructive.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 22:41, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That comparison is totally out of line. There is no way you can pass off adding links to wikIran as "spamming" especially considering both the nature of the site and the fact that Zereshk has been by far the most active editor in the sphere of Iranian articles here on Wikipedia. Respect and manners go a long way in this world. Before his arrival, the vast majority of Iran articles were mere stubs. Accusing a long-term editor of his class, expertise and sincerity - not to mention all the incredible amounts of time he has dedicated to Wikipedia - of spamming is in, to put it bluntly, incredibly bad taste and is a borderline personal attack. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloodlands_6a95.html" title="User:Floodlands">Floodlands</a> 01:04, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Vanity article about a college TV show. Unverifiable. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 20:12, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete.</b> No indication why this TV show is supposed to be notable. One source is actually a mirror of the Wikipedia article, two are associated with the show, one is a college newspaper article that briefly mentions it.

<p><b>Strong keep</b> This show, it's guest list, and some of it's subject matter dig surprisingly deep into college and professional sports as well as entertainment, particularly in the Pittsburgh region. I do agree that some details are a bit overkill, but as a whole, this show provides a meaningful look into the regional sportscape as well as the opinions and perceptions of those who are/were a aprt of it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.60.153.103 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.60.153.103_128a.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.60.153.103">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<p><b>Strong keep</b> This show was the flagship of a once dead University television station, and pretty much single-handedly brought it back to life. It laid the groundwork for a station that is still functioning to this day. Also, the show had on many regional guests and even a few national guests, rare for a local talk show. It allowed viewers to see local personalities in a way they normally didn't see. There are many sources online related to the show. It was available every week online long before networks began carrying shows online. It is an important piece of local programming history and reruns can still be viewed online to this day. Definitely deserves to keep the entry.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 12.46.6.70 (<a href="../../../1/2/2E/User_talk%7E12.46.6.70.html" title="User talk:12.46.6.70">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.46.6.70_2935.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.46.6.70">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per prior precedents on AfD, college or university broadcast stations which ONLY broadcast to their particular university do NOT deserve separate articles (though they can and should be mentioned on the article about the university itself). An article about a TV show on a college station that is only seen by students of said college is doubleplus not notable. The lack of verifiable third party sources confirms this. If multiple references in reputable press (unconnected to the show or college) about this show can be provided, I would change my vote. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 05:51, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>We've been fighting this one off and on for almost a year now. Article was unanimously deleted as advertising in February 2006, and attempts have been made off and on to recreate it ever since. A quick {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-repost_a444.html" title="Template:Db-repost">db-repost</a>}} tagging has taken care of it each time, until now, when the creator managed to get an admin to back him up on it. So back to AfD it must come. My rationale will remain exactly the same as it was the first time, as the new article has the exact same problems today as the old one: <b>"Pure advertising. No links to any other Wikipedia pages."</b> (Except pages related to the last AfD, anyway <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/CHR_Global" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/CHR_Global" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.) <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 05:58, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a> and this list appears to be <a href="../../../l/c/_/WP%7ELC_690f.html" title="WP:LC">listcruft</a>. There is no good definition of what a "watch manufacturer" is and listing every brand name is not appropriate.</p>
<p>This article was under proposed deletion, but it was disputed with the claim that it "Should be a fairly trivial excercise to decruftify this." On the contrary, I think it will be very difficult to decruftify.</p>
<p>First off, note that there already is a Category:Watchmakers, I'm sorry for failing to mention this in the prod. Many of the problems with this list, however apply to that category also.</p>
<p>Secondly, I confess I was hoping this list would go away quietly because an explanation of why it is a bad idea is not simple nor obvious.</p>
<p>Watch manufacturing goes back about 500 years. The listcruft article says that any "list of something" that doesn't have a definition for that "something" is highly questionable. The closest thing to a defintion of a watch manufacturer is a <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watchmaker.html" title="Watchmaker">watchmaker</a>, but as noted in that article, this includes most people who just repair watches. Imagine if people who repaired cars were called <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automaker.html" title="Automaker">automakers</a> rather than <a href="../../../a/u/t/Auto_mechanic.html" title="Auto mechanic">auto mechanics</a>, or anyone who assembled <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_box_%28computer_hardware%29.html" title="White box (computer hardware)">white box</a>, repaired or upgraded computers was a computer maker.</p>
<p>For the last couple hundred years, a "watch manufacture" could be anything for one person to a large company. A "watch manufacture" could produce almost all parts of a watch assemble, test and finish them, but never have its name put on the dial or be sold under its name. Or, a "watch manufacture" could do little more than contract with others to produce a, possible stock, watch with their name on it. Or, a "watch manufacture" may produce a few watches, but mostly resell other watches under their name. Or, a "watch manufacture" might make only a few easy to make parts, such as the case. Or, a "watch manufacture" might not make all the parts, but do all the work required to turn a rough movement (or an <a href="../../../%C3%A9/b/a/%C3%89bauche.html" title="Ébauche">Ébauche</a>) into a usable timepeice. Or, a "watch manufacture" might take a fully working movement and add a few flourishes. Or, ....</p>
<p>If you removed all current "watch manufactures" that didn't just buy generic quartz movements or ETA mechanical movements, you would eliminate almost all the names in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_watch_manufacturers.html" title="List of watch manufacturers">list of watch manufacturers</a>, and end up with a handful such as Swatch and Rolex. However, in order to do that, you would need to know a great deal about the actual watches, something that many "watch manufactures" try very hard to keep private. The watch industry makes heavy use of branding, and has for hundreds of years, with effectively idencial watches selling for 10 or even 100 times as much with one name as another.</p>
<p>Because of long historical and legal precedent, basically any name that has ever appeared on a watch face has a solid claim to being a "watch manufacture". Attempting to apply more modern defintions/ideas of what qualifies as a true "manufacture" will result in strong resistance from both those companies and loyal customers.</p>
<p>There are whole books that just list "clock/watch manufactures". For example, look at some that are still in print on <a href="http://www.shentonbooks.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.shentonbooks.com/" rel="nofollow">shentonbooks.com</a>: "WATCHMAKERS AND CLOCKMAKERS OF THE WORLD: 21st CENTURY EDITION" at 720 pages, "GREATER MANCHESTER CLOCKS AND CLOCK/WATCHMAKERS" at 344 pages, "COMPLETE CHECKLIST OF AMERICAN CLOCK/WATCHMAKERS 1640-1950" at 52 pages, and several others from just that one book seller.</p>
<p>A complete <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_watch_manufacturers.html" title="List of watch manufacturers">list of watch manufacturers</a> would easily contain thousands of entries.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> There are more than 40 links to WP articles in that list, which suggests that there is a fair amount of interest in watch makers/manufacturers/sellers.

<li><i>"There are whole books that just list "clock/watch manufactures""</i> — This is a pretty strong <b>Keep</b> argument.

<li><b>Comment/questions</b> My argument is not that there isn't interest, nor that the list would be short, but rather that the list will be effectively unlimited and unmaintainable. <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html#Appropriate_topics_for_lists" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)#Appropriate topics for lists</a>. Remember, any name that has appeared on a watch face, any person who has or had a career as a "watchmaker" would qualify. Right now, this list is primarily external links to small companies that most likely manufacture very few, if any parts of the watches they sell, along with internal links to things like <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diesel_%28clothing_company%29.html" title="Diesel (clothing company)">Diesel (clothing company)</a>, <a href="../../../d/k/n/DKNY_acaf.html" title="DKNY">DKNY</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorinox.html" title="Victorinox">Victorinox</a> which do not actually manfacuter watches, or internal links such as <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roamer.html" title="Roamer">Roamer</a>, <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skagen.html" title="Skagen">Skagen</a>, Xemex (redlinked in the list) which don't link to articles related to watches. Is there any criteria for what does or does not belong here that can make it less of a website directory? For example, there are things like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people.html" title="List of people">list of people</a>, but those lists seem to be restricted to internal links. Would that be a reasonable restriction? Remember, there already is a <a href="../../../w/a/t/Category%7EWatchmakers_fdb3.html" title="Category:Watchmakers">category for watchmakers</a>, which automatically restricts the list to internal links. I will keep an eye on this, and if people can convince me that this list can be "easily decruftified", I will withdraw my AfD. Originally, I was just going to delete what I thought were inappropriate entries, but realized that would delete almost everything. <a href="../../../w/r/s/User%7EWrs1864_30eb.html" title="User:Wrs1864">Wrs1864</a> 15:03, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you see any bad entries of non-watch manufacturers, the solution is to delete those entries, not this list. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:14, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, but that is kind of my point, what qualifies as a "watch manufacturer"? <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">WP:lists</a> explicitly says "For example a list of brand names would be far too long to be of value" and the historic definition would include a huge number of brand names. For example, I have a <a href="http://elginwatches.org/databases/Private_Label.html" class="external text" title="http://elginwatches.org/databases/Private_Label.html" rel="nofollow">web page</a> that lists a couple hundred names that I could add to this article, and this list is only for one particular "real" manufacturer that has been defunct for decades, it was known for *not* selling watches under other names, and I collected the list over a relatively short time. I think that if I either deleted 90% of this list, or added hundreds of new entries, that I would violate <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../w/r/s/User%7EWrs1864_30eb.html" title="User:Wrs1864">Wrs1864</a> 18:07, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This list isn't for <b>all</b> watch manufacturers, it's for <b>notable</b> watch manufacturers (the "notable" is implicit in all lists on Wikipedia). A good rule of thumb is that, if it wouldn't deserve a Wikipedia article of its own, it doesn't deserve inclusion in the list. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 18:22, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ok, fair enough. Would it be acceptable to delete all external links? Also, I'm not sure how well <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> works when applied to companies from the 1500s-1700s. Would anyone who has been a member of the British <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worshipful_Company_of_Clockmakers_10c3.html" title="Worshipful Company of Clockmakers">Worshipful Company of Clockmakers</a> (est 1631) qualify? (Of course, that would be a very small subset of all watch/clock makers) <a href="../../../w/r/s/User%7EWrs1864_30eb.html" title="User:Wrs1864">Wrs1864</a> 03:24, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your question is something that can resolved. For example, by removing any entries that are just brand-names labels that buy from another source with their labels put on. (Though I'd make a distinction with those that assemble from stock components). For another example, take a look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_automobile_manufacturers.html" title="List of automobile manufacturers">List of automobile manufacturers</a>. Obviously the details would require some knowledge of the subject, but I suggest taking it to the list's discussion page, and seeking input from other informed persons. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:09, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I said in my AfD commentary, I don't think trying to apply modern concepts of what a manufacturer is will work. As <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> points out, any such new definition would be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. I mentioned carmakers in my AfD so, yeah, I have looked at it quite a bit. Compared to watches, cars are a very modern invention and have a comparatively modern definition of what a "manufacturer" is. Also, as I mentioned in my AfD, these companies try very hard to hide just how much or how little they actually do to qualify as "manufacturers", which will make <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a> very hard to do and result in a lot of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> for each company. There are far too many examples of "watch manufactures" that really were nothing other than a shell that sold watches with their name on it. See below where I talk about the "Advance" name. <a href="../../../w/r/s/User%7EWrs1864_30eb.html" title="User:Wrs1864">Wrs1864</a> 03:24, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, you seem confused about what OR is. Deciding the criteria on this list is not necessarily original research. All we really need is a reliable claim about the company that they make watches. Anything else is just a convenient restriction to what's useful for Wikipedia. Where that would be on Watch manufactures, I don't know, but this AfD is hardly the place to decide. If a company is just a "shell" then I think it would be clear they should be mentioned at most under the original company, assuming the brand itself is more or less notable. If something else, then that can be determined on a case by case basis. What you talk about Elgin doing with Advance is really no different than what many electronics and appliance companies do today. (For example, Sears has several brands, including Kenmore but they are manufactured by other companies from Maytag to LG). In any case, none of your arguments add up to deletion. They are merely concerns for the individual entries on the list itself. All of which can be resolved, if you commit yourself to doing so, not just giving up and throwing it in the wastebin. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:48, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Funny you would use <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sears.html" title="Sears">Sears</a> as an example. R. W. Sears started out selling watches and hired a watchmaker named Roebuck. Their late 1800s-early 1900s advertising, at best, implied that they were watch manfacturers, even though they just resold things like Elign watches. Again, this would be considered acceptable at the time they did it. So, Sears certainly should be in a list of "watch manufacturers". I kind of doubt they would could reasonably be placed in a list of "washing machine manufacturers". <a href="../../../w/r/s/User%7EWrs1864_30eb.html" title="User:Wrs1864">Wrs1864</a> 05:29, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sounds like information to be added to this article then(at least in summary form). It might also help to round out the information in the article on <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sears.html" title="Sears">Sears</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/g/Elgin_Watch_Company_663c.html" title="Elgin Watch Company">Elgin Watch Company</a>. (The Sears article does mention Watches, but not Elgin, or why Roebuck was hired, the Elgin article is itself pretty bare of content. And if somebody made a list of home appliance manufacturers, they would be silly not to put Kenmore on the list in every place that it was appropriate. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:47, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the long AfD to the contrary, none of the arguments presented indicate a grounds for deletion. All of this information should, if true, be included in the article on <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watchmakers.html" title="Watchmakers">watchmakers</a> or possibly at the top of this list, to inform folks. Deleting this list would accomplish nothing except the removal of potentially valuable information to folks. I don't know about you, but I prefer lists to categories myself.

<li>What a nauseating linkfarm. The only way I can see this list being of any use whatsoever to Wikipedia is if inclusion criteria limiting it to companies which already possess articles on Wikipedia were both adopted and enforced, with the list page primarily serving as a <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honeypot_%28computing%29.html" title="Honeypot (computing)">honeypot</a> to find newly-spammed articles. <a href="../../../w/a/t/Category%7EWatchmakers_fdb3.html" title="Category:Watchmakers">Category:Watchmakers</a> is and would remain the tool that both our readers and our editors use; this unadorned list is harder to maintain, comparatively quite incomplete, and ridiculously prone to self-promotion.

<dd>Oh, <b>Advance</b> is a great example! You dismiss it as if it wasn't a "watch manfacturer, but it almost certainly was represented as such. The <a href="../../../e/l/g/Elgin_National_Watch_Company_6a62.html" title="Elgin National Watch Company">Elgin National Watch Company</a> made about 115,000 watches using the Advance name betwen 1875 and 1900. During this time, there were several recessions in the US and recessions hit watch companies hard since a good watch will last many decades and they are expensive. These Advance watches were made to much lower standards than Elgin's normal watches. Elgin also had a distribution system with jewelers such that everyone expected that Elgin would *never* sell direct to the public. Now, was the Advance name simply a name that Elgin used in order not to damage their own good name and sell direct to the public? Or, was it a shell corporation? Or, was it another company that contracted with Elgin? Besides the Elgin manufactured Advance watches, there are also examples made by the Trenton Watch Company. This could be evidence that the folks selling the Advance watches were separate from Elgin, or it could be that there were two companies with the same name.</dd>
<dd>All this happened "only" around 100 years ago. Lots of people are interested in this kind of trivial and have investigated it, but I am reasonably certain that no one alive today knows the answers to the above questions. What is clear to me, however, is that any list of "watch manufacturers" would need to include Advance, and that Andy Warhol watches are no less qualified to be in that list than Advance. <a href="../../../w/r/s/User%7EWrs1864_30eb.html" title="User:Wrs1864">Wrs1864</a> 03:24, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advance.html" title="Advance">Advance</a> is dismabiguation page for a generic word. I pointed the approach this list was created - copy something, link every word, forget about it. If kept the list should be separated into the true manufacturers (they aren't that many - here's one from Czech lands <a href="http://www.prim.cz/en/company/company-foundation" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.prim.cz/en/company/company-foundation" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>) and list of watch brands where marketeers could promote and battle. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 04:52, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with the Advance link being incorrect, in fact, I'd say there are rather a lot of them on this page once I converted it from external links to internal ones, but I felt it was more important to have it done and make it right than check each and every name for an existing article. Obviously, this list needs to be fixed even if kept, but that's a job for another day. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:06, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry for not getting back to this sooner. I have taken a hack at trying to clean this list up. Those that wanted to keep this list, please look at it and make sure what I did was acceptable. Those that wanted to delete this list, please look at it and see if it now is worth keeping. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> had previously gone through and replaced all external links with redlines, but I don't think that is a good idea because he didn't check to see if the external links were even notable watch companies. I think just creating redlines will simply encourage people to create advertising articles about the non-notable companies. Instead, I reverted his changes and removed all external links. I then went back and added in some of the more obvious notable watch companies and reorganized them into parent companies and brand names. I also deleted any internal links to articles that weren't about watch companies, but added in a few internal links to ones that had been omitted. I am certain I did not do a complete nor flawless job. However, I think this makes a much better basis for moving forward. <a href="../../../w/r/s/User%7EWrs1864_30eb.html" title="User:Wrs1864">Wrs1864</a> 16:12, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>So, why pick this one for AfD out of like a kajillion commuter railway station articles? Anyway, there's enough room in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Pacific_West_Line_3a39.html" title="Union Pacific/West Line">Union Pacific/West Line</a> to <s><b>merge</b></s> the individual stations except for any particularly notable ones (eg: <a href="../../../o/g/i/Ogilvie_Transportation_Center_c25a.html" title="Ogilvie Transportation Center">Ogilvie Transportation Center</a>) into a list or table. <b>Weak keep</b> as there's already plenty of precedent for individual stations on <b>notable</b> rail lines having their own articles, although I still think a list merge wouldn't be a bad idea.

<li><b>Delete</b> Bus stops and train stations are not inherently notable unless multiple independent news stories or other indices of notability are provided which talk about the station in a nontrivial way. No function is served by copying everything from every directory in the world into a Wikipedia article which is soon out of date.

<dd><b>Reply</b>: I think that an important thing to note is that bus stops almost always get deleted at AfD, while train stations don't. Further, I agree that dumping the timetable into a Wikipedia article is unwise, to say the least.

<li>Actually it did come up. It is not a restatement of the list of airports, since that list (supposedly) has every airport in the world. This is intended to show only those which have commercial service, and it serves both as a list and as a guideline for how to list airports in other destination lists. There is a discussion on moving it to project namespace. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">DB</a> (<a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbinder_633d.html" title="User talk:Dbinder">talk</a>) 20:01, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. Fails to point out the policy it does not follow which is requried as a second nomination. Also the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airports.html" title="List of airports">List of airports</a> was disucssed in the previous nomination. Anyone voting delete should first read the previous discussion and address the keep reasons there before voting delete. From my first comments <i>A category is not a list and a list is not a category. The article serves several purposes. One is a list of airports that have had commerical service and not all airports. This is covered in the intro. The other is a source for listing an airport in other articles. Because of location and naming issues, it is not possible to create a guideline that covers this. So this list functions a source for this information. It also serves as a common point on the location of an airport in other destination articles. The order in this article is still being adjusted after several months of discussion as consensus is achieved. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 06:21, 25 October 2006 (UTC).</i> Issues raised during the first discussion about size are being worked on but it takes time to set this up and achieve consensus. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 20:14, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>; this was just proposed and rejected <i>two weeks ago</i>, and pretty much every substantive issue came up in that AfD. Again, I'd urge renaming to List of cities with commercial airline service or List of airports with commercial airline service, probably the former. This is not at all synonymous with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airports.html" title="List of airports">List of airports</a>; only a small subset of airports have airline service. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 21:54, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - a meaningless list, and one which is unmaintainable. It's hard enough to keep per-airport and per-airline lists up-to-date.

<dd>As I mentioned in the first discussion, it's easy to maintain, since airports aren't constantly shifting back-and-forth from having and not having commercial service. It's much more difficult to maintain the individual lists within the airports, but few have argued that those should be removed. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">DB</a> (<a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbinder_633d.html" title="User talk:Dbinder">talk</a>) 00:48, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep... pretty weak, but still a KEEP</b> -- There's a few concerns I have about this article, now that i look through it, but both Vegaswikian's arguments and a few things stated in the last afd have convinced me to keep it. I'm mostly concerned with the accuracy of the article. It's really a very difficult subject to really keep track of, and it will be very challenging for whomever moderates it to keep it accurate considering destinations are dropped left and right in the worldwide airline industry and in some low profile countries/airflines this may not be known for weeks. Also, the article's a bit large to scan through and comes off as disorganized, but that part can be fixed easily with some work. Still, I do see people coming on here to look for this information... the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airports.html" title="List of airports">list of airports</a> category and article contains every airport, commercial or not, while this list contains airports with commercial service, something I know is of interest to regular joes, and that itself makes it worth a keep; it's weak one on my part, but I may not change my vote unless something drastic happens. -- <a href="../../../s/m/t/User%7ESmthManly_78cd.html" title="User:SmthManly"><font color="black">SmthManly</font></a> / <sup><a href="../../../s/m/t/User_talk%7ESmthManly_fa27.html" title="User talk:SmthManly"><font color="blue">ManlyTalk</font></a></sup> / <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SmthManly_7bda.html" title="Special:Contributions/SmthManly"><font color="blue">ManlyContribs</font></a></sup> 03:19, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>heh, ironically, firefox froze on me and had a shutdown error when I pressed the back button after posting my vote here because the list was that much of a burden on it.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>, wasn't it just a few weeks ago when I saw this on AFD? Useful and encyclopedic list, lists are not categories and vice versa.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This <i>was</i> on AfD recently and the result as of 3-Nov-2006 was to keep it (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Airline_destinations_d0a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Airline destinations">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Airline destinations</a>). As for the argument that it is a "restatement" of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airports.html" title="List of airports">List of airports</a>: First, that isn't a list at all, it just contains links to other lists such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airports_by_IATA_code_f126.html" title="List of airports by IATA code">List of airports by IATA code</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airports_by_ICAO_code_7878.html" title="List of airports by ICAO code">List of airports by ICAO code</a> and categories such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_airports_0979.html" title="Category:Lists of airports">Category:Lists of airports</a>. Secondly, many countries do not yet have their own list of airports and the existing lists don't always indicate which airports have scheduled commercial airline service. I might support deleting this at some future date when every country has its own list of airports and those lists indicate which airports have scheduled airline service, but we're not there yet. I agree with the comments about the list being too large - it should be split into smaller lists, probably by continent. - <a href="../../../z/y/x/User%7EZyxw_6d94.html" title="User:Zyxw">Zyxw</a> 12:46, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>Google turns up few (more precisely no, that I can find) hits aside from fan sites.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This article is just getting started, as work is progressing on all of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Category%7EMariah_Carey_tours_89c1.html" title="Category:Mariah Carey tours">Category:Mariah Carey tours</a> articles. Having an article on a major artist's tour is no different than having an article on an album or a hit single, of which Wikipedia has zillions. There are about 275 tour articles now on Wikipedia, see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Category%7EConcert_tours_eacf.html" title="Category:Concert tours">Category:Concert tours</a>. Mariah Carey tours as a whole are in fact more notable than many, because she tends to play outside her native country more than most U.S. artists and she tends to play in unusual regions of Asia, the Middle East, and so forth for a U.S. act. There is no reason to delete this article; with it, it completes the coverage of the six Carey tours to date. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 14:15, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment, and disclaimer</b>-I'm also strongly against "albums are notable enough for an article just because the person who wrote them is." A lot of albums would be better handled on the artist's page. However, that aside, it doesn't seem that this tour is notable or reliably sourced, even though her later ones seem to be. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 14:24, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> In fact, there <i>are</i> non-fan-page sources on this tour, since it was given poor reviews by newspaper critics and written about in the Shapiro <i>Mariah Carey</i> biography. The <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariah_Carey_467b.html" title="Mariah Carey">Mariah Carey</a> main article mentions this and gives a book cite for it. The bad reception is part of the reason she avoided playing in the (continental) U.S. for several subsequent tours, and so is important to describing the arc of her career. This article has just begun and needs work, but that is no reason for deletion. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 14:51, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Further comment</b> Please note that I now have a significant number of non-fan-page sources for this article, and I believe I have also conclusively demonstrated the tour's notability, as it gained a lot of national media attention at the time as well as having an effect on Carey's subsequent career. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 00:57, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've linked the previous afd above; it was typo'd on the article's talk page. Of the two keep votes (omission of&#160;! deliberate) there, one is a classic <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> from a user of the site, claiming that it was "fast-growing" (i.e., not yet notable, but someday it may be!) and that it's "heavily linked" (though it should not be linked to from Wikipedia <i>at all</i>, as <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html#Links_normally_to_be_avoided" title="WP:EL">we should not link to copyright infringements</a>). As for the other, I'd repeat Uncle G's mantra that counting google hits isn't research, but this vote didn't even bother to count them. Of the 98 unique results that Google found for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=kiwilyrics" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=kiwilyrics" rel="nofollow">kiwilyrics</a>, I didn't notice a single one from a reliable source. Plenty of forum posts, blogs, and <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine_optimization.html" title="Search engine optimization">SEO</a>, though.
<p>Were it not for the previous afd, the article as it currently stands would be a clear <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#A7</a> candidate, as it makes no assertion of any sort of notability. Nor does it cite any third-party sources. There isn't even any <i>primary</i> source linked for any of the article except for the digression in the third paragraph. With the site gone, and nothing promising showing up on google (did I miss something at all usable?), the article is and seems likely to stay <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> A lower level competition to the IMO, like this one, may be also a top-level competition in the region.

I believe I can establish at least three publications which have written about it, including the homeschooling magazine and the NYT, how many would you consider to be neccessary?--<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigCow_5aad.html" title="User:BigCow">BigCow</a> 23:43, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The magazine article is not about the company itself. It's about the use of computers in homeschooling, and it just gives the company a passing mention. The NYT article is essentially the same thing, and the only mention of this company is: "...said Mr. Hinrichs...who founded Escondido Tutorial Service close to five years ago." Two of the references in the article are not third-party sources, and the third one doesn't mention this company at all. That doesn't cut it for <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. --<a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat"><font color="#6699FF">desat</font></a> 23:59, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The failure to make the most trivial investigation of this program that is derided as a "unique program" solely because of its non-English name seems to be blatant prejudice. Questioning the existence of teh program only proves that this entire vote is baseless. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 10:12, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Reading prejudice into a factual statement ("A non-English [school] name does not constitute a unique program") is a personal attack, and shows bad faith. Desist. As for the program, as you are very well aware, there was no evidence within the article that one existed at the time I cast my&#160;!vote, and I reject your attempt to obscure the issue through barely-veiled accusations of racism. Furthermore, I do not feel that any reliable sources have yet been provided that show it is in fact a "unique program."

<li><b>Comment</b> You can try to spin "A non-English name does not constitute a "unique program" -- if there is in fact such a program" as being a good faith disagreement with the qualifications of the article, but to any reasonable person it comes off as a patronizing dismissal of the schools' program. I sincerely hope it's mere ignorance and not prejudice, and I hope that your protests are justified. Unlike the far more thoroughly developed WP:SCHOOL, WP:SCHOOLS3 has received no review or any consideration whatsoever from Wikipedia users as a guideline. As it has made no attempt at all at reaching consensus within the Wikipedia community, it can't possibly be justified for use as a guideline, and the extreme deletionist bias it demonstrates makes it unlikely to ever be a basis for a consensus guideline. Do the facts provided in the current article satisfy your concerns? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 10:43, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>There is no spin involved, but since you've already shown you're not prepared to assume good faith, I won't waste my time with you further. I simply ask that you refrain from any and all speculation upon my motives in the future, and repeat my request that you cease to use such terms as "ignorant" and "prejudiced" to describe me. On the other topic, as you realize, SCHOOLS3 is newer than SCHOOLS; this does not mean it is not valid, and, unlike SCHOOLS, it has not been rejected. <i>When</i> it is presented, then we will see. Finally, I thought I had made this clear, but no, the current article does not meet my concerns.

<dd>The "news coverage" is all local papers and it's a given that any school is going to get some sort of mention in their community papers.

<dd>The coverage is from both the Alaska state capital's largest newspaper and the state's largest publication. Where is this "no local coverage" criteria you've presented come form?

<dd>Wow! You can't read the articles at all, but you can divine they're content from the titles. Read the article first, and then you can question their validity. I will acknowledge that if any of the sources include constitute trivial coverage, then I would be unable to use them to prove notability. See <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> for the definition of trivial coverage as "newspaper articles that simply report extended shopping hours or the publications of telephone numbers and addresses in business directories."

<dd>(edit conflict) First, if you have not read the sources, you should not speculate on their contents. I have read both articles, and the school is either the exclusive or primary focus of both. Second, there is no policy basis for your comment on "local sources". I sugggest you review WP:RS. Third, your characterization of these sources as "local", implying that they are somehow subpar, is inaccurate and highly disrespectful to residents of Alaska.

I will ask that you: (i) point me to the policy, guideline or essay (yes, even including your schools3 essay) that precludes "local" sources; (ii) provide some proof that Alaska's leading newspapers (all available worldwide through the internet) qualify as "local" sources not suitable for wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 21:13, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Like most schools, this one does not appear to the primary subject of multiple (or any) non-trivial sources that show notability. Several points: (1) Yes, it received a California Distinguished Schools award for which it was <a href="http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:Zwd9-V0muZoJ:www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_3751906+%22six+local+schools+earn+state+award%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" class="external text" title="http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:Zwd9-V0muZoJ:www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_3751906+%22six+local+schools+earn+state+award%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" rel="nofollow">recognized</a> in the local paper. No, this recognition does not confer encyclopedic notability. The local paper article itself is trivial (&lt;100 words), 5 <i>other</i> schools were recognized in the same article for receiving the same award, and the only material concerning Valentine Elementary is a 2-sentence quote from the principal. Because there is no non-trivial independent coverage of Valentine receiving this award, it doesn't show notability. (2) Now, it might be argued that all schools receiving the California Distinguished Schools award are somehow intrinsically notable, whether non-trivial sources exist or not. I would argue strongly against that. 377 California schools received it in 2006 alone, and a school can re-apply to receive it every four years. The award doesn't truly distinguish its recipients a la the Oscars; it's a pat on the head from the California state government to well-performing schools. No wonder there is no non-trivial independent coverage of Valentine receiving this "award." (3) Finally, yes, there is a <a href="http://www.san-marino.k12.ca.us/sa/sarcs/valentine0304.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.san-marino.k12.ca.us/sa/sarcs/valentine0304.pdf" rel="nofollow">government report</a> on this school (filled with statistics, bromides, and mundane facts). Regardless of content, government reports don't show notability, as their publication has nothing to do with notability, but with accountability of government schools. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:00, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> also has the participation of some school inclusionists. What you fail to note is that this project represents the work of those inclusionists and deletionists who seek some kind of common ground and an end to the divisiveness the schools issue has caused. The proposal is neither arbitrary nor meaningless: the criteria have been well thought out to ensure they meet the same standards as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and other standards that ensure that aricle subjects meet certain basic criteria. It keeps in motion a process that began over a year ago, and is most explicitly not designed to "ensure that no school articles will exist in Wikipedia". What it does seek to ensure is that those school articles meet certain standards, and there are plenty that do. I would also note that proposals become policy in part through use. I intend to continue to refer to this proposal in school-related AfDs, and I intend to keep pressing the Wikipedia community for a resolution to an issue that is being kept alive in part through bloody-minded stubbornness. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green"><small><sup>talk</sup></small></font></a> 19:36, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It's hard to take you seriously when you refer to the completely meaningless <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> as an excuse for deletion, while blithely brushing off <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>. <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is the only productive attempt at achieving consensus, and failed solely because of the interference and obstruction of school deletionists. WP:SCHOOL3 is a pointless, non-viable effort that makes no effort at achieving consensus and will never be useful for any purpose if there is meaningful movement towards reflecting the views of the overwhelming majority of Wikipedia users who have a broader definition of school notability than the hyper-narrow definition concocted at WP:SCHOOL3. Pointing out that the nominator misread the article and that two sheep blindly followed along is evidence of a basic violation of AfD practice, not an attack on the individuals. If you have an alternative explanation for this blatant discrepancy I'd love to hear your story. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 10:07, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>You're entitled to your opinions, but I suppose we can now count out any good-faith efforts to contribute to reaching that consensus at SCHOOLS3. I'd hoped for better from an editor of your stature, especially after you seemed to acknowledge that that WP:SCHOOLS4 disruption of yours was counterproductive. And "Two sheep blindly followed" is "not an attack on the individuals"? As for the "discrepancy," it might be because <i>the article itself claims "There is only one teacher,"</i> maybe? It seems perhaps <i>you</i> didn't read the article. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 10:49, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've tried to make constructive suggestions there, and will continue to do so in the vain hope that anyone will listen, but it's clear that <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> is NOT a serious effort to reach consensus; it's a fig leaf for deletionists to concoct what has the appearance of a guideline that is developed by the most extreme elements who believe that only a handful of schools in the world might be notable. <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is still the only serious effort to reach a middle ground. Do you truly believe that these two "per noms" read the article in question? Of course I saw the statement that "There is only one teacher". I read it and interpreted it to mean "per class". Others saw several hundred students and misinterpreted it to mean "in the entire school". Which interpretation did you come to and which makes more sense? At least you had the intellectual integrity to ditto the nomination of someone who did his homework in evaluating the quality and merit of the article. You can't possibly tell me that the two "per noms" did the same. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 14:15, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Because, fact is, they're not, any more than all ships, all roads, all people, or all buildings are notable. It is completely ridiculous to include articles on schools which have no significant history, no notable students or staff, no non-generic programs, and no notability beyond "that's where my kids go to school". I would also point out that <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> was not torpedoed by deletionists - I was part of the discussion and I know. It was sunk by the intransegence of inclusionists such as <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus_22d6.html" title="User:Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a>, who were unwilling to compromise beyond the point that it =might= be acceptable to merge schools with their parent boards, and in the end refused to participate at all. Several deletionists were involved in the discussion, but for the most part, all were willing to cede that there were some schools which were worthy of articles. This issue will not be resolved by calling names or adhering to a policy that "all schools are notable". You can choose to be part of the discussion or you can choose not to. Regardless, it is still going on, and <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> is the best compromise at the moment. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green"><small><sup>talk</sup></small></font></a> 19:52, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>(Reply to Alansohn's original comment) (1) Your argument to keep relies on WP:SCHOOL, which does not enjoy consensus approval. The fact remains that there is no non-trivial independent coverage of either this school or of its receiving the "award." (2) "<i>Use of 'scare quotes' to denigrate this 'award' are unjustified and offensive</i>" -- first, I didn't <i>denigrate</i> the "award," I demonstrated that it's really an indicator of a good school; it's not a truly distinguishing award. But hey, don't take my word for it--look for non-trivial independent coverage of the school's receiving it. Such coverage doesn't exist. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 16:42, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> article on worthwhile topic. There's sufficient history to sustain an article (though doing so, takes time). Not all information instantly appears with Google, which the nom seems to assume. Also, I'm disturbed that the nom hasn't admitted to stating falsehoods, even though these falsehoods were identified before the nom's last comments. This is a public school, but the nom claimed it was private. It has 30 teachers, but the nom suggested it had only one. It seems the nominator based his nom on these two facts. Now anybody can make a mistake, and the nom's free to claim other reasons for deletion. But the nom hasn't properly addressed his errors. Simply saying "I was mistaken" would have earned some respect. Its not the mere fact of mistake (which we all make), but the fact he's had these errors pointed out, and has failed to acknowledge them, but has instead made other comments since. Also, the nom needs to understand what types of "attacks" are not allowed. *Personal* attacks are not allowed. However, attacking false information is certainly allowed. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:27, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Any misdeeds the nom may or may not have done are irrelevant to whether the article should be kept, and I suggest we drop the topic here and let anyone who wants to carry on go to the nom's talk page. Now as to your arguments to keep--"worthwhile topic"? why? Following a thorough search of Google and Lexis-Nexis, it seems that no independent publisher thought this topic worthwhile enough to publish a non-trivial work on this school. So I don't know what you base "worthwhile topic" on. Next, if by "sufficient history to sustain an article" you mean that since the school is pretty old there must be local sources that have written about it over the years, I would say, first, you would have to actually find those sources to justify keeping the article, but second, local sources should be regarded as trivial, otherwise we'd be keeping articles on local businesses which are written up in local papers all the time. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 17:44, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> My name is Jeffrey Wolfe and I own Moosejaw. Really sorry to hear that people think my work should be deleted. Nonsensical marketing is a totally legit form of marketing and you will hear more and more about it. As seen in all the articles I posted as references, Moosejaw has used nonsensical marketing to grow the business over 100% for five years in a row. The whole point of nonsensical marketing is that it's non-traditional but it sounds like all of you want to only keep things that are traditional. I think that is a mistake and I ask that this page be given a chance. If you think I'm doing this simply to promote my business, you are wrong. If you know my business, you know how passionate we are about the relationship we have with the customer and that's what nonsensical marketing is all about -- it's the opposite of the boring, unemotional, overused marketing that most companies use. It would be one thing if I was just making this up but I have been using this form of marketing for over five years, I have references that show you it's legit and my competition like REI and EMS have already tried to replicate it. Please give this a chance and don't be so quick to judge.

<li><b>Delete</b> I speedied it originally. There are hundreds of these pageants in just about every country worldwide.

<li><b>Comment</b> - While it fair to note that there certainly many pageants worldwide that is actually not the case in Canada - there are a handful of pageants that survive more than one year, and seeing as Canada is a very muliticultural country there is an emphasis placed on the celebration of culture and heritage. Much of what is mentioned pertaining to pageants on wikipedia are a result of media history coverage. If you are able to understand Spanish, then it would be best to note the international media coverage given to Canada regarding this event. It would appears that their winners travel to South America to perform philanthropic duties. There is only 2 other Canadian pageants that may do this - Miss World Canada, and Miss Universe Canada - which are notably on wikidpedia. This organization is the only one of its kind for the Latin community at this time - there is no prior history of any such event or organization offered to this community. I have checked with the Ontario Buisness Bureau - the company was registered in the Province of Ontario in 2004 as a special event planning company. Liscening reviews show that the trademark for the International franchise is indeed registered with the U.S Patent and Trademark Office, registered under a Dawn Ramos Productions since 1992. Resaerch on the international company does direct you to this woman who is carrying the Canadian franchise rights. The local media contact for the Latin Community known as TLN (TeleLatino), and Toronto Hispano, have both confirmed that there is no other pageant for Latin-Canadians where they represent the country, aside from this one operated by a Miss Singh. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 74.121.44.36 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.121.44.36_83ec.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.121.44.36">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I note that the Miss India-Canada hits higher on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=beauty+pageants+canada+list" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=beauty+pageants+canada+list" rel="nofollow">google</a> than this pageant. As does Miss Canada Teen Global and Miss Canada International. Let's not forget Miss All Canadian, Miss Canada Plus... I don't see any of these articles listed in Wikipedia. For good reason. They are just non-notable. As is this one. Plus add to this the ugly fact that it is likely just a vanity article.

<p><b>Delete</b> for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The article appears to be a vanity piece:
<ul>
<li>The article is entirely the work of Drtcbear, who contributed the full article text in a single edit, signed "Thomas Cox PhD, RN", and with one exception two days later has not contributed to Wikipedia again.</li>
<li>The reference list is entirely the work of 24.250.251.228 in a single edit, and are all from the work of "Cox, T.", alone or in combination with others.</li>
<li>Except for wikifying links, there has been no contribution to the article by any other editor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The article is full of weasel-worded statements and opinion statements.</li>
<li>The article reads like text from a professional magazine or a conference presentation, although I have not been able to locate it in any publicly available online sources.</li>
<li>The article is an orphan - there are only four links, none from other articles.</li>

<p>I thought that "original research" related to unpublished research presented by an editor, not to published research. I wrote the treansreal numberl line article to support a longer article I was planning to write on transreal numbers which, in turn, would link to the page <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perspex_machine.html" title="Perspex machine">perspex machine</a>. Whilst the article on the perspex machine relates to my research, I did not initiate that page, nor did I write more than a very small fraction of it. Most of what I contributed to the perspex machine article was corrections. If there is an article on transreal numbers then it can be used to clarify the perspex machine entry and to present a more neutral view in various mathematical pages. However, if it is policy not to accept articles written by the original author of external material then I will refrain from initiating any article that relates to my research. Please do advise me on this point before I go to any more effort on this.</p>
<p>Please note that it is SPIE policy to allow web publication, as cited, pending publication on paper. But it is certainly possible to wait for paper publication before supplying a linkg to the web version. But if it is policy to avoid neologisms then I could simply wait a few years to see if secondary sources become available.</p>

<li>In general, what we wish to document is established knowledge in science, not newly presented thought. In five years, this may be considered established teaching, or may not. Right now, it is not widely accepted (or even used at all, it seems) terminology. Its publication here is premature. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 21:45, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would agree with James that it is a bit of a stretch to call this <i>original research</i>, given that it's accepted for publication. There is no policy not to accept articles written by the original author of external material, but most of us are deeply suspicious about such articles and therefore it is strongly discouraged (see <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a>). It is however policy to avoid neologisms (see <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms</a>). However, the real problem with transreal number line, as Fan-1967 indicates, is that the term is not used at all. In my opinion, one paper in workshop proceedings of the International Society for Optical Engineering is not enough to support a Wikipedia article on a mathematical concept. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 06:22, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, the concept is not new, but the name seems to be a neologism. Computer science guys have versions of this, with lots of different NaN's. I am certain I heard of the thing in grade school, but don't know what name it was given then. I take Φ to be a <a href="../../../n/i/m/Nimber.html" title="Nimber">nimber</a>, namely <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conway%27s_star.html" title="Conway's star">Conway's star</a>. (Just in case its not obvious why Φ is star, refer to Conway's book, wherein division is defined through an axiomatic system for numbers and games, and zero divided by zero is indeterminate, its star. Among other things, you'll find a proof that star is greater than -1 but less than +1 and is incomparable to everything in between. Sadly, we have no articles on this in WP, but I would prefer that such concepts be treated in terms of the sound, well-developed, commonly accepted axiomatic footing, rather than invented from scratch, on a whim). I'm not convinced there is a need for the current article, it seems awfully simplisitic. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 15:59, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I see this as <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> at least until the paper is published. Even though "original research" is sometimes used as an epithet indicating that something is unverifiable, in this case, I am not saying that at all. Rather, the research is original, and Wikipedia, being an encyclopædia, prefers to be a secondary source. By publishing your research here you are turning Wikipedia into a primary source. <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.140.173.15.html" title="User:69.140.173.15">69.140.173.15</a> 17:27, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree that we should <b>Keep</b> it so long as it is expanded upon per some of the comments above. I remember this campaign being a really big deal at the time and am quite certain it had an impact on the release. I think in its current form its full relevance is not well articulated to someone who wasn’t in the scene at the time like I was, or who isn’t completely familiar with the circumstances of the CD release. I think that is the underlying problem, not its importance. I know there’s enough content/knowledge out there to expand the article, so placing a notice up asking for expansion of the content would be the best course. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.200.116.199 (<a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.200.116.199.html" title="User talk:207.200.116.199">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.200.116.199_c598.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.200.116.199">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> There is no particular proof that this campaign, among others, had any impact on the release. The difference between this campaign and others concerning <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lillywhite_Sessions_bd23.html" title="The Lillywhite Sessions">The Lillywhite Sessions</a> album, was that it got national attention, mainly in Rolling Stone and Entertainment Weekly. This national press coverage, although cited, is not enough, I believe to warrant its own article. If there is proof that this one particular campaign had an impact on the end means, which wasn't the release of the unreleased material, but a rerecording of most of those songs, released as <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busted_Stuff_7db7.html" title="Busted Stuff">Busted Stuff</a>, then maybe it should remain. If not, it should be mentioned that there were campaigns and communication by fans on the articles for The Lillywhite Sessions and/or Busted Stuff. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilchama_b61a.html" title="User:Milchama">Milchama</a> 21:04, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I disagree with that argument, based on the well thought-out response that was posted on the discussion page for the article. First of all, there is no proof of any other campaigns - so the "among others" comment is misleading. I'm pretty sure there weren't any others, perhaps just a generic web petition or two at best. Second of all, the relavance of the article is not based on if it clearly resulted in the release of the CD - that is not the right standard to hold it up to, as other articles of this nature aren't held up to that standard. Yes, the CD was indeed newly minted and fully-produced recordings of the shelved materials .. which was the goal of the campaign... I know, because I was one of the 20,000+ people who signed it and had my feedback delivered directly to RCA. It is 100% clear this campaign a) captured the attention of the press b) received the attention of the producer/band c) had a very high potential for being influential. Just because the band/producer/publicist would not go on the record confirming or denying the campaign's role in the decision to indeed release the CD doesn't make it unworthy. In fact, the very fact that this specific campaign reached them by name makes it notable. I strongly agree with the majority of the comments posted on the talk discussion of the article's page that the article should stay and be expanded upon... this campaign really meant a lot to the fans, and was a grassroots effort that many believe played a big role in the decision. It would be a shame to not expand on this article considering its part in DMB history.

<li><b>Response</b> It is not clear that the campaign <i>received the attention of the producer/band</i>. Nobody involved with the production of The Lillywhite Sessions or Busted Stuff have acknowledged this one particular campiagn's existence and/or role in the decision made to produce and release Busted Stuff. Please find a citation to prove me wrong. This Nancies.com fansite interview with Busted Stuff producer Steve Harris (<a href="http://www.nancies.org/news/2002/10/interview-with-steve-harris/2/" class="external free" title="http://www.nancies.org/news/2002/10/interview-with-steve-harris/2/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nancies.org/news/2002/10/interview-with-steve-harris/2/</a>) does not confirm, deny or acknowedge that the band knew about this particular <i>Release Lillywhite Recordings Campaign</i>, or other pro-Lillywhite fanmail that was unrelated to the campaign. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilchama_b61a.html" title="User:Milchama">Milchama</a> 23:32, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Response (Keep)</b> Few things. First, please provide citations for any other notable campaign(s) you stated may have existed/also influenced the situation - based on your prior assertions. Second, it is clear that the campaign recieved the attention of the producer, since the creator and the campaign itself was mentioned/linked in that very <a href="http://www.nancies.org/news/2002/10/interview-with-steve-harris/2/" class="external text" title="http://www.nancies.org/news/2002/10/interview-with-steve-harris/2/" rel="nofollow">Steve Harris interview</a> you reference!!! The citation is right there in the reference via a direct question asked, and arguing the campaign's "lack of existence" is quite silly at this point considering the sources. The email response from Steve Lillywhite regarding the campaign was posted on now-defunct Minarets.net (just as the email responses from Steve Lillywhite to Craig Knapp were posted online which led to the leak; refer to Lillywhite Sessions leak history or the article in Rolling Stone covering this topic if you're unaware of the history). And finally, to your last point, nobody has argued 100% certainty that this campaign led to the release -- the best you'll see are <a href="http://articles.campushook.com/article.php?id=39" class="external text" title="http://articles.campushook.com/article.php?id=39" rel="nofollow">some articles saying that it may have</a>, as many in our community believe it did. What others have argued is that point alone is not grounds for deletion. The correct response would be to say that it is not clear, but that the potential was clearly there due to the large following (20,000+ supporters), delivery of all supporter comments directly to the record company, sizable media exposure of campaign (article in ICE Magazine from few years back is a good one too, look for the print copy for some good quotes regarding the campaign), and the fact that the campaign (and other fans) did indeed get what they wanted since the mission was accomplished - one way or another. Those factors alone, for me, are compelling reasons to keep and expand upon the article as I would with any other article that had similar drivers behind it.</li>
<li><b>Response</b> The campaign in that Steve Harris interview was mentioned by the interviewer, not the interviewee. Harris himself did not comment on the campaign. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilchama_b61a.html" title="User:Milchama">Milchama</a> 01:43, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Response (Keep)</b> The campaign in the interview, which is the campaign we are discusssing, was indeed mentioned by the interviewer with the added comment "it appears to have worked." And, Steve Harris' response to the question was "I can't answer that" - which was the typical response. However, in his defense, he also commented that the decision was made before he was pulled in; this is all fully congruent with everything that has been stated. Looking forward to your citations/references on any other notable campaigns that supposedly existed and had the potential for influence.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> There were no other campaigns aside from this one. In fact, there were no other movements that had the amount of appeal as this one, if there were any other movements at all (references please??). I am in full agreement with the second post (keep) that the underlying problem is the article needs to better articulate its references/impact because those who are "not in the know" don't realize how big of a deal this was (There's a reason why it was mentioned in so much of the mainstream press as well as why it reached the band). Milchama, while I'm sure your intentions are good - your original reference claim was proved wrong, and based on your comments I strongly feel that your argument is based on some incorrect assumptions/a loose understanding of the events that took place prior to the album release. Its a bit misleading - but I don't think that's your fault, I instead agree that the article needs to be expanded to further convey the influence of the campaign to those who weren't as active in the DMB community at the time. To reiterate some key stats: a) Campaign was quoted in mainstream media (Rolling Stone, MTV [Kurt Loader made a quick mention on MTV News and showed a screenshot of the site], VH1, Entertainment Weekly, E!, and others) b) Camapign was directly referenced by producer and publicist - although of course they had to act as if they can't comment on if it played a role ... they could have said No It Didn't, but they instead dodged the question, which adds more fuel to the fire c) Feedback from 20k campaign signees was delivered directly to RCA Records d) Songs were indeed fully produced and released shortly thereafter, as the campaign intended. e) I, like many others at the time, believe the campaign was successful and played a big part in conveying fans wishes, but I also think it became a big enough deal even if it were to have failed. I'm more than willing to add more content and legitimate references to the article to better explain why this really did matter based on much of what has been said, if that would help others understand the full history. Thanks. 131.107.0.102 23:01, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep/Question</b> I appreciate your middleground, sounds reasonable in theory. However, in addition to what you stated, I would also propose the possibility that there's enough additional information/background/context/controversy on the campaign and the entire endevaor/uprising that would justify keeping it seperate and expanding upon it. I feel that I, as well as some others who have commented, appear to be knowledgable enough to provide that. It was quite an interesting time!</li>
<li><b>Suggestion</b> It was definately an interesting time. Maybe the focus of the article can be changed from this one campaign to the whole controversy surrounding <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lillywhite_Sessions_bd23.html" title="The Lillywhite Sessions">The Lillywhite Sessions</a> and how it led to <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busted_Stuff_7db7.html" title="Busted Stuff">Busted Stuff</a>. The article could be renamed something like The Lillywhite Sessions Controversy. However, the majority of The Lillywhite article is about the controversy, but that could be moved to this new article. That would allow to to create a better, more definite history of this very interesting time in DMB history. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilchama_b61a.html" title="User:Milchama">Milchama</a> 03:09, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep/Suggestion</b> That's not a bad idea. However, per previous comments - I think there's enough information sorrounding this campaign to justify another article as well, and I think it was of enough importance as it relates to the subject to be seperate. Also, the Lillywhite Sessions article already is trying to be the article you propose - it just needs some work. I think keeping the reference to the campaign article in the Lillywhite Sessions article, to not make it so campaign-centric, and expanding the Lillywhite Sessions article to cover everything you propose at a higher level would be the best of both worlds! I like that idea, not exactly what you proposed, but best of both worlds getting both accomplished... and its reasonable. When I get some time (soon), I'll start expanding the campaign article to go into some of the nitty gritty details of the time that were important and add some more references - but I will also start expanding The Lillywhite Sessions article to go over all the other aspects of the controvery as you suggested, and clean it up a bit. Thanks for the insight!!</li>

<dd><b>Comment (last two posts):</b> As far as I can see, none of the external references mentioned in the article as it exists now can validate any claims that this campaign had anything to do with the decision to release the album. As the article stands at the moment, it is non-notable, and as such doesn't warrant an article by itself. If more information can be added to the article, confirming that the campaign was notable, and also proving that it actually can be connected somehow to the decision to release the album, then it might deserve an article on it's own. But for now, it isn't really notable, and as such should be referred to in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lillywhite_Sessions_bd23.html" title="The Lillywhite Sessions">The Lillywhite Sessions</a> and/or <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busted_Stuff_7db7.html" title="Busted Stuff">Busted Stuff</a>, but little else. If the focus can be changed, that's also fine, but unless the article grows to an unreasonable length, it should still be included in the existing articles regarding the records, and not by having a seperate article. <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjelleklang_549f.html" title="User:Bjelleklang">Bjelleklang</a> - <a href="../../../b/j/e/User_talk%7EBjelleklang_ea22.html" title="User talk:Bjelleklang">talk</a> 04:33, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Keep/Comment</b> Just thought I'd chime in. Keep in mind, that point may never be able to be fully validated - record company wasn't upfront on discussing all the real reasons behind the release, or even shelving... if you look at past media, it was kind of an elusive and evolving story. I think the article can be expanded and include some of the elements you suggest, and make the case as to why it was a notable and influential campaign, because I know for a fact it was (I didn't hand out flyer's in the cold before three shows if I didn't think it was worth it as a fan supporting the campaign) regardless of any other uncertainty. I think that makes more sense then merging as I believe it is notable and improving the article can help communicate that - and so there isn't redundant content in the Dave Matthews Band, Lillywhite Sessions, or Busted Stuff articles -- allowing the details to be explained, but at a reasonable length. I'd be willing to help contribute to this task as well, you have to be a true fan to understand!&#160;:-) 24.19.189.5 04:49, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> As a matter of fact, I am a fan of the band, and have a more or less complete collection of their albums! But still, there are other ways of indicating the notability of the campaign, but basically, if this cannot be done, then the article doesn't deserve to be there, and is better off referenced in the articles about the various albums! First of all, find a source that can say something about the scope of the campaign...some has been mentioned in previous posts here, but the article doesn't really reference it in any way! If this had been a subject I didn't have much knowledge of or interest in to start with, I'd say delete due to non-notability. If someone can find sources that prove this to be notable enough, then fine! But if not, it should be referenced in other articles as being unconfirmed, and not in a separate article! <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjelleklang_549f.html" title="User:Bjelleklang">Bjelleklang</a> - <a href="../../../b/j/e/User_talk%7EBjelleklang_ea22.html" title="User talk:Bjelleklang">talk</a> 04:55, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Additions &amp; Edits</b> Bjelleklang - Per your comments the following has been done thus far. 1) Additional sources have been added supporting previous assertions further. 2) A screenshot of the campaign, a link to the <i>Archive.org</i> cache of the campaign, as well as a supporting quote directly from the campaign has been added to the article. 3) In terms of scope, the number of campaign members recruited is now also mentioned in the article per prior discussion. This can be cross-referenced with the linked cache of the campaign itself, which -- as previously mentioned -- is now cited. Additionally, there are further external sources that also validate this (in addition to some that already may have been cited), including an article in a state newspaper. However, the newspaper article I'm referring to had a misinterpretation of how the sessions were leaked, thus I'm looking for different sources. What that said, what is listed now and the sources - both external and the campaign itself - is probably already sufficient in that regard. Regardless, I'll keep looking for new additional sources to add to further strengthen the article. 4) The Entertainment Weekly link has been updated to a better formatted version of the article mentioning the campaign. Please look forward to more additions/content updates/sources in the coming days and/or weeks. Thanks.

<dd><b>Merge with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lillywhite_Sessions_bd23.html" title="The Lillywhite Sessions">The Lillywhite Sessions</a></b> In my opinion, the additions do not show the notability of this campaign per Bjelleklang's request. All that was added, besides the cache of the old site, are more articles proving the campaign's existance, but NOTHING proving that RCA, DMB, etc were influenced by the campaign in the decision to record Busted Stuff. Unless that is the case, I would like to see it merged with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lillywhite_Sessions_bd23.html" title="The Lillywhite Sessions">The Lillywhite Sessions</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilchama_b61a.html" title="User:Milchama">Milchama</a> 23:16, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Keep - As Discussed</b> Per discussion above with Bjelleklang and previous comments - showing notability in other forms such as scope of campaign is indeed acceptable. Please see his comment on 04:55, 19 November 2006 (UTC) regarding discussing scope of the campaign. The edits that were made and will continue to be made are intended to show notability via scope and publicity; they will not be an attempt to prove the campaign caused the release per comments and discussion above. Thanks.</dd>
<dd><b>Comment:</b> still, with only 10.000 signatories (or thereabouts), I'd say that the campaign is non-notable. DMB had sold around 20 million copies of pre-<a href="../../../b/u/s/Busted_Stuff_7db7.html" title="Busted Stuff">Busted Stuff</a> records. As such, I cannot agree that 10.000 signatories makes this campaign notable in any way! Unless a source can be found to prove either a) that this number is a lot higher, or b) that there is a connection between this campaign and the decision to record Busted Stuff, I still say merge with Busted Stuff and delete! <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjelleklang_549f.html" title="User:Bjelleklang">Bjelleklang</a> - <a href="../../../b/j/e/User_talk%7EBjelleklang_ea22.html" title="User talk:Bjelleklang">talk</a> 00:00, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Response</b> There were some sources that said it ended up reaching over 20,000 -- but I'm not sure how many signatories would be enough. Considering the nature of the campaign - I'm not sure if comparing it to the number of CDs sold makes sense; I'm not sure what the rule of thumb should be in this case. As for your point B) As previously mentioned, there is speculation by several sources stating that it may have played a role ... but that is a point that will never be proven since the record company won't address all factors that led to their decision on this CD, or any others for that matter (standard practice has been not to comment on such matters in most cases). In that case, what more needs to be added?
<dl>
<dd>Although it doesn't nescessarily have to be compared to the number of CD's sold, that number should have some importance. I'd say that it would have to reach a significantly higher number of signatories than 10-20.000 in order to be notable by this alone. If the connection between <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busted_Stuff_7db7.html" title="Busted Stuff">Busted Stuff</a> and the campaign cannot be proven, and the number of signatures cannot be proven to be a lot higher, I'd have to say that the subject is at best non-notable and unverifiable, and thus not conforming to Wikipedia's policies on <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a>. It could still be referenced in <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busted_Stuff_7db7.html" title="Busted Stuff">Busted Stuff</a>, as well as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lillywhite_Sessions_bd23.html" title="The Lillywhite Sessions">The Lillywhite Sessions</a>, but in my opinion it is not notable enough to have it's own article. <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjelleklang_549f.html" title="User:Bjelleklang">Bjelleklang</a> - <a href="../../../b/j/e/User_talk%7EBjelleklang_ea22.html" title="User talk:Bjelleklang">talk</a> 00:14, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Point taken, but let me say the following regarding Wiki policy. One, I believe everything stated in the article is verifiable as its all cited in sources. The article does not state that the campaign caused the release of the CD - in fact it states what is known to be the truth and verified by the independent sources linked. I think the topic of notability is the appropriate one, and in which case the Wikipedia policy is as follows:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Notability is not subjective</p>
<p>Notability does not equate to "I've heard of it."/"I've never heard of it." or "I think that it is notable."/"I don't regard it as being notable.". A Wikipedian who judges an article based upon those subjective criteria is not employing a notability criterion. None of the notability guidelines contain any such criteria.</p>
<p>Notability is not judged by Wikipedia editors directly. As is the case in other aspects, when it comes to notability Wikipedia is a reflection of what exists in the world. The notability of a subject is judged by the world outside of Wikipedia: a subject is notable if people in the world deem it notable enough to publish non-trivial works about it.</p>
<p>The application of the aforementioned primary notability criterion allows Wikipedian to determine whether the world has judged a subject to be notable. If someone independent of the subject has gone to the effort of creating and publishing a non-trivial published work about it, then that someone clearly deems the subject to be notable. Thus by applying the primary criterion Wikipedians determine whether a subject is notable not by considering whether they themselves think that it is notable. They determine whether a subject is notable by looking for the existence of multiple non-trivial, independently sourced, published works on the subject. &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>With all of that quoted, I would argue that there are multiple non-trivial mainstream press sources that mention and/or address the campaign. By my objective interpretation of Wikipedia policy, I don't see why this article wouldn't meet that standard. I would also argue the Wikipedia policy does not ask for arbitrary measures of relevance based on metrics such as how many joined the campaign or even if it was successful... but rather, the fact that several independent non-trivial sources (Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, MTV, etc.) deemed it important enough to mention/discuss in articles is the reason why it is notable.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ask a casual fan about the Lillywhite Sessions, and they may or may not know about it. Ask them about this campaign, and I doubt you'll get an answer. This article still feels like it is a small section of a larger <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lillywhite_Sessions_2068.html" title="Lillywhite Sessions">Lillywhite Sessions</a> article. I just did a rewrite last night to incorporate all of the aspects of the album's recording, distribution and its influences behind the decisions to record Everyday and Busted Stuff. I suggest that you take a look at it an incorporate the campaigning aspect to it. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilchama_b61a.html" title="User:Milchama">Milchama</a> 12:22, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Keep</b> I consider myself just beyond a casual fan, and I've heard about both. Besides, per the user's comments above quoting Wikipedia policy - notability is not subjective and not to be based on statements such as "feels like," "I think," or any other anecdotal arugments. There are several meaningful sources mentioning the campaign directly, they are indeed independent (and mainstream); this passes standard tests of notability as several others have stated. The objective criterion must be used, not subjective feelings/thoughts of any editors. I suggest linking the article from your well-done rewrite via a brief summary, keeping Wiki objective policy in mind. 131.107.0.71 15:57, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result was <b>NO CONSENSUS TO DELETE</b>. One of the Delete comments was "per nom", but since the nominator later withdraw his nominating statement, you have to wonder if that doesn't put that comment into limbo... another Delete comment appears based on a malformed Google search as is pointed out. There is really only one unambiguous Keep comment, so I don't think closing this as a straight-out Keep is in order. The Keep commentor makes good points, though, although on the other hand he doesn't provide actual cites... a relist would perhaps be in order, but a NO CONSENSUS close can be relisted at anyone's discrection. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:47, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- If you google "David Britton author" you don't receive that many hits because it's an odd literal. If you google <i>"David Britton" author</i> you receive 10,200 hits. That's not notable? The guy has written a number of controversial books and comic books over 30 years, he's been a partner in a successful publishing firm in the UK, he's helped "rediscover" musicians such as P.J. Proby. How is that not notable? I don't get it. I'm looking at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> and it specifically declares this as "notable": "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work." David Britton more than meets this criterion... I disagreed when you deleted my Supervert entry, but now I feel like you're just hunting down any entries I've made. These may be "alternative" interests but they seem perfectly notable to me and to the other users who've edited the David Britton page. I'll sign this with my four tildes but I feel like one very discouraged, disappointed Wikipedian who's starting to think that the guys over at Wikitruth have some grounds for their rancor Crawlspace 15:06, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you were to actually look in the past logs, I've nominated <i>several</i> articles in the past for deletion besides yours, and I nominated only two of yours weeks apart. And not because you specifically wrote them. I <i>do</i> have problems with several users here, but you're not one of them, and even if I did I wouldn't deliberately sabotage Wikipedia just to settle a score.</dd>
<dd>The <i>only</i> connection between the articles I nominate for deletion is that they're all in the horror genre, a section that I usually browse here. I recently nominated <i>several</i> Saw character articles for deletion, and most of them were by the same user. I did it not because I didn't like the editor, I did it because I felt the characters were not notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> When I nominated Britton for deletion, I was under the impression that Britton was only a minor cult writer like supervert was. I just did a google search, and while I still don't find him notable, I no longer believe that he is on grounds for deletion as there are numerous sites on him. And I think the <i>subject of non-trivial published works by multiple separate sources that are independent of that subject itself.</i> rule is pretty strict; for example, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Pike_f770.html" title="Christopher Pike">Christopher Pike</a> has his own article and I don't think he has any works written about him.

Its true that wikipedia is not a memorial, but the amount of sources produced after the propD shows that information about him is more than a memorial. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 01:07, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I certainly see your point. But in fact, Michael Swain (who goes by "The Swain" in his flash works, which is why you got so few hits) is quickly getting more popularity as time goes on (I would've been on the fence on this in May or June, definitely not now). I guess that was kind of a response to the below comment.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but shorten - the article is too long, especially the plot summaries, and it is divided into too many categories.

<li><b>Delete</b> not anywhere near notable. the person above me is incorrect. First off, for all episodes of blockhead there is around half a million, and popularity for the series has been dimming as time goes on. the previous episode received half the views as the last one. clearly it is not going anywhere. Second thing - There are literally dozens of series that have collection pages that wikipedia would delete their articles in a hot second, this is definitely one of them. A collection page on newgrounds is no basis for legitimacy. And lastly, I could name more than half the people on the top 50 rated artists that do not have wikis, and many flash artists are not on that top 50 list that have wikis, like IllWillPress. This also rules out the top 50 rated artists being a deciding factor in the legitimacy of this wiki.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: Not counting the few Blockhead flashes by other artists, the Blockhead episodes have been viewed 1,224,098 times as of today. Presence on the Newgrounds top 50 is certainly not a guarantee of having a wikipedia article; however, 7 out of the top 15 (not including this article, which would make it 8/15) have one or more articles devoted to their work: <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Farr_471a.html" title="James Farr">1a</a> <a href="../../../x/o/m/Xombie.html" title="Xombie">1b</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/SamBakZa_9d60.html" title="SamBakZa">2a</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/There_she_is%21%21.html" title="There she is!!">2b</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Phillips_%28animator%29_3777.html" title="Adam Phillips (animator)">3a</a> <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brackenwood.html" title="Brackenwood">3b</a>, <a href="../../../o/l/a/Ola_Bergner_66d3.html" title="Ola Bergner">7</a>, <a href="../../../8/-/b/8-Bit_Theater_2a8a.html" title="8-Bit Theater">8</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stone_Trek_4499.html" title="Stone Trek">14</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Firth_155c.html" title="David Firth">15a</a> <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salad_Fingers_e87c.html" title="Salad Fingers">15b</a>. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 03:04, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Stone Trek and 8-bit Theater? I'm surprised those are still around. Regardless, an individual episode averages around 100,000 views (12 cartoons divided by your figure), and the previous episode has half of that average. Series such as Xombie, Brackenwood and animators like David Firth often receive millions of views per cartoon rather than all submissions as a whole. Regardless of the numbers, the all-around spread of Blockhead is lightyears behind a series like Salad Fingers and Brackenwood. You're not going to find people outside of Newgrounds that know about Blockhead, and Newgrounds is an extremely limited audience. Its notability beyond Newgrounds is minimal if not anything at all.
<dl>
<dd>The previous episode has fewer views because it's been out for far less time than the other episodes, which would be obvious to someone who isn't just tryign to bash the article. LegendaryFrog's also been on the way down, why not just delete his article since it fits your standards for deletion? Of course that would not happen, that's my point. I've never heard of Stone Trek ever actually, so notability based on hits is subjective. I don't mind the deletions, I just mind when the reasons for them are full of holes.--<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman">Wizardman</a> 03:36, 25 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's exactly why I said basing this on views per cartoon is regardless to the fact that no one has heard of Blockhead outside of Newgrounds, and a Newgrounds fanbase is not a valid reason to keep an article. All I'm hearing are numbers, and if we were to base a flash artist's validity by views per cartoon there'd be dozens of articles on wikipedia that are illegitimate, much like this one.</dd>

Initial Google searches were inconclusive due to the film's common name, but search on "villain +Benfer" yeilds only 127 unique out of 591 total, which is fairly low, and only about half of those unique actually refer to this film. With the exception of a passing reference on the FilmThreat website, no other mentions are from major sites.

<dd><b>Keep</b>. Let us see the criteria at <a href="../../../n/f/_/WP%7ENF_43ef.html" title="WP:NF">WP:NF</a>. <i>"Has the film actually entered production or is it just rumored or expected to be made?"</i> The people involved with the film (not just the director) have made independent statements about their work on the film, so it would seem that the film is more than a rumour. Some links: (<a href="http://zombie-pirates.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=70" class="external autonumber" title="http://zombie-pirates.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=70" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> <a href="http://www.animateclay.com/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=402" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.animateclay.com/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=402" rel="nofollow">[51]</a>) <a href="http://www.spatulamadness.com/blog/?p=53" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.spatulamadness.com/blog/?p=53" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> <a href="http://www.huntergomez.com/huntermainpage.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.huntergomez.com/huntermainpage.htm" rel="nofollow">[53]</a></dd>
<dd><i>"Will the film be notable upon release?"</i> It will be, because according to IMDB it will feature work by several notable people, including <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warwick_Davis_8483.html" title="Warwick Davis">Warwick Davis</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1549341/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1549341/" rel="nofollow">Hunter Gomez</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0299115/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0299115/" rel="nofollow">Nathan Furst</a> (music), <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0709453/" class="external text" title="http://imdb.com/name/nm0709453/" rel="nofollow">David Rand</a> and <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm1179446/" class="external text" title="http://imdb.com/name/nm1179446/" rel="nofollow">Jason Yanofsky</a> (visual effects). It is also being partially produced by <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> (Tom Fulp is the CEO).</dd>
<dd>Perhaps the problem here is that those notable people haven't yet made official statements confirming their roles in the film <i>(EDIT: with the exception of Hunter Gomez - see "further comment" post below)</i>. However, neither has any of them tried to get it removed from their profile on IMDB, and some of them have been there for months now (Warwick Davis has been there since September, I think). You would think that ONE of them would have noticed and tried to get it removed by now if it wasn't true. Of course, I'm not sure exactly how the IMDB system works - perhaps I'm wrong and they wouldn't be able to.</dd>
<dd>So it is established that the film IS being worked on, but its notability rests on the trustworthiness of IMDB. I think that we should take a wait-and-see approach here. <i>It can be mentioned in the article that those people have not yet independently confirmed that they are in the film.</i> However, it could well be a big waste of many people's time to delete this article now. Being UNSURE if something is notable or not is not the same as being SURE of its non-notability, and in this case it is the former which is true. Until more information appears, I believe that this article should stay, but with "citation needed" notes for the involvement of those people who give it notability. As I see it, <b>there is not currently enough information to judge whether it is notable or not per wikipedia standards</b>, but there seems to be more likelihood that it is notable at the moment than the opposite. We SHOULD NOT make such a decision until the information becomes available, one way or the other - it is far better to err on the side of caution and wait. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 09:17, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I can't seem to find that passage. However, I've looked at <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> and found this: "Repeated re-creation of an article by previously unassociated editors may be evidence of a need for an article, but repeated nominations for deletion are not necessarily evidence that an article should be deleted, and in some cases, repeated attempts to have an article deleted may even be considered disruptive. <b>If in doubt, don't delete.</b>" There's another reason to doubt here, which is that the director, Robert Benfer, may in fact be notable. The admin who deleted his entry and prevented its recreation this october (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Robert_Benfer" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Robert_Benfer" rel="nofollow">page logs</a>) based his judgement on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Robert_Benfer_d693.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Robert Benfer">this deletion vote</a> in February 2005. A review of his notability since that time has not been undertaken despite the release of a feature film in 2005 which (according to Filmthreat <a href="http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=interviews&amp;Id=1048&amp;archive=&amp;match=&amp;page=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=interviews&amp;Id=1048&amp;archive=&amp;match=&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>) sold 2000 copies in its first month despite being sold only online. According to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, "a large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following" and "Name recognition" may be signs of notability. It would seem to me that he satisfies those criteria: he's the <a href="http://newgrounds.com/users_most_bookmarked.html" class="external text" title="http://newgrounds.com/users_most_bookmarked.html" rel="nofollow">6th-most bookmarked</a> artist on <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> (a website with over 1 million members), he's recognized within the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stop_motion.html" title="Stop motion">stop motion</a> animation community (a search for "knox", on animateclay.com results in <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?domains=Animateclay.com&amp;q=knox&amp;sitesearch=Animateclay.com&amp;sa=Search&amp;client=pub-3752360164901045&amp;forid=1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;safe=active&amp;cof=GALT%3A%23FFFFCC%3BGL%3A1%3BDIV%3A%23383D4C%3BVLC%3A000000%3BAH%3Acenter%3BBGC%3A4A4E65%3BLBGC%3A383D4C%3BALC%3AFFFFFF%3BLC%3AFFFFFF%3BT%3AFFFFFF%3BGFNT%3ACCFFFF%3BGIMP%3ACCFFFF%3BFORID%3A1%3B&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/custom?domains=Animateclay.com&amp;q=knox&amp;sitesearch=Animateclay.com&amp;sa=Search&amp;client=pub-3752360164901045&amp;forid=1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;safe=active&amp;cof=GALT%3A%23FFFFCC%3BGL%3A1%3BDIV%3A%23383D4C%3BVLC%3A000000%3BAH%3Acenter%3BBGC%3A4A4E65%3BLBGC%3A383D4C%3BALC%3AFFFFFF%3BLC%3AFFFFFF%3BT%3AFFFFFF%3BGFNT%3ACCFFFF%3BGIMP%3ACCFFFF%3BFORID%3A1%3B&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">369 news &amp; forum entries</a> - to compare, a search for "<a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallace_and_Gromit_9b93.html" title="Wallace and Gromit">Wallace and Gromit</a>" results in 755 entries), his <a href="http://www.knoxskorner.com/home.php" class="external text" title="http://www.knoxskorner.com/home.php" rel="nofollow">home page</a> has been visited about 13 million times and his films on Newgrounds <a href="http://newgrounds.com/portal/search.php?terms=Knox&amp;kind=a&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" class="external text" title="http://newgrounds.com/portal/search.php?terms=Knox&amp;kind=a&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" rel="nofollow">had been viewed</a> 10,959,036 times as of Oct. 12, 2006.</dd>
<dd>I realize that this is not the place to vote for undeletion of the Robert Benfer article - I am just pointing out here that there seems to be more evidence leaning in favour of this film being notable than the opposite. To review what we have so far:</dd>
<dd>1) The film IS already being produced - this by itself fulfills one of the requirements of <a href="../../../n/f/_/WP%7ENF_43ef.html" title="WP:NF">WP:NF</a></dd>
<dd>2) The film would be notable if the cast list on IMDB was true</dd>
<dd>3) The film would be notable if the director (who was last checked for notability on wikipedia over a year and a half ago) currently fulfilled the requirements on notability. This deletion discussion will finish soon, and there is not enough time to get a proper deletion review on the director, so I am presenting the evidence that I would have presented over there here for your judgement.</dd>
<dd>4) <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> says "If in doubt, don't delete." Not only are we in doubt, but there seems to be more likelyhood currently that this film is indeed notable.</dd>

<dd><b>Further comment</b>: Sorry, I said before that "those notable people haven't yet made official statements confirming their roles in the film".

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Benfer's notability has been discussed much more recently than February 2005. See AfDs on name variations <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Knox_%28flash_artist%29_00ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Knox (flash artist)">here</a> (2/06), <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Robert_Benfer%2C_Jr_8af9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Robert Benfer, Jr">here</a> (3/06), and the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Villain_%28Knox_movie%29_6a45.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Villain (Knox movie)">original AfD</a> on the <i>Villain</i> film and Knox together (2/06). And for reference sake, a Google search (a better reference point than animateclay) on "Wallace and Gromit" brings back nearly 1.2 million returns - a striking difference to the 591 I got on "Villian +Benfer". Also, without an independent verification, site counters, especially on sites like this bent on self-promotion, are easily modified or misleading - it the counter for hits or actual visitors? The site doesn't say. Also, "views" on sites like Newgrounds are misleading as well, because, if say one person watches a video 100 times, that counted as 100 views, not 1 viewer. Totals can be run up that way. However, all of that is beside the point - we're discussing the notability of <i>Villain</i>, and based on reputable secondary sources, right now, it has no notability and does not need an article. Should the thing actually get released and achieve some level or notoriety, come back then. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeWazowski_3925.html" title="User:MikeWazowski">MikeWazowski</a> 03:19, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b> My bad, I did not notice those later nominations. However, the first of them at least only seems to prove my point - most of the responses are favourable to the article, and the nomination was withdrawn. The reason given by the admin for deleting the article in that case was that it had been recreated many times and always deleted based on that decision on Feb 13, 2005. The admin explains it in the talk page <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_Knox_%28flash_artist%29_4785.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Knox (flash artist)">here</a>, and it should be noted that there were some reasonable arguments made against his decision there. The March, 2006 deletion review featured two "keep" voters whose arguments were not adressed by any of the other users who voted "delete" (none of the "delete" voters gave much reason for their votes except to say "per nom" and none of them attempted to discredit the points made by the two "keep" voters). <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Villain_%28Knox_movie%29_6a45.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Villain (Knox movie)">This 2/06 AFD</a> was made when the article was considerably more crystal-ballish than it is now. There is now confirmation from several different sources that the film is indeed being worked on, and there seems to be a probability that the film will indeed be notable when it comes out (if Benfer is telling the truth about the people involved on his website - and so far, what he's said has been eventually confirmed by other people). Your comment about the unreliability of the counter seems a little dubious, considering that he uses a regular free counter from <a href="http://freelogs.com/" class="external text" title="http://freelogs.com/" rel="nofollow">freelogs.com</a> to count the hits on his website (unless you're suggesting that he bribes the company to get it to show ~13,500,000 hits). As for Newgrounds, it is true that every single view is counted, not every single user. However, he has ~11,000,000 views on Newgrounds, spread out among 101 films. That's about 110,000 views per film - someone would have to have a LOT of time on their hands in order to fake that many views. Even if each film was watched twice by the average user, that's an awful lot of views. Also, as of this date, there are 30,885 individual reviews for his films on Newgrounds (about 300 a film on average - far more than most submissions to Newgrounds, which typically get about 20). But you're right, that's besides the point. My point is that I disagree with your opinion about the notability of this article, based on all of the evidence that I've presented so far. I'll leave it to other wikipedia members to decide which of us presents the best argument. (by the way, just as an extra note: a google search for "villain +knox" turns up 125,000 searches, but things are made difficult because even though Robert Benfer is known as "knox" more often than as himself, "knox" is a fairly commonly used word in general) <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 04:41, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Non-notable filmmaker. Initial Google search inconclusive, due to somewhat common name.

<li><b>Comment</b> Why does Villain get a page, but Benfer doesn't? Why should Charlie get a page but not Steele? I totally agree on a merg under "Film Cow" or just the delition of Charlie. If Villain gets into theaters or gets it's "million dollar budget," both Jason and Benfer (who each already have large fanbases) will become known film makers/voice actors. What about Lemon Demon? He is an independent musician and film maker, just like Jason. When his first films/ albums came out, were people this excited to destroy his wikipedia article? Now Neil even has his own wiki! What is the difference between an early Lemon Demon and Jason Steele? Besides, I dn't see Lemon Deomn making any full length films, but Jason's making two in the same year. 00:39, 20 November 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETingle_f6b8.html" title="User:Tingle">The Hero of Time</a></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> There is an "informal rule", invented by JzG and others, that things that are offensive to some autistic should go. Look here: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Neanderthal_theory_of_autism_3_f1d9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Neanderthal theory of autism 3">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Neanderthal_theory_of_autism_3</a>. Not only that, the same admins also forbid me to keep it on my private user-page and blacklisted the url for no other reason than to keep this out of Wikipedia. What CAN is now trying to do is to create a huge set of articles on Wikipedia to push their views, that are largely offensive to most autistics. The article at hand is more or less a stub, with no actual information other than pushing a personal web-site and placing links to it from various autism-articles.--<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 20:40, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fighting autism is offensive to most autistics I now, which is several hundreds. Fighting autism is the same thing as fighting us. Would you accept an article about fighting blacks with a prenatal test for Afro-American heritage? This is exactly what Athletes Against Autism is putting their sponsor money into, but not for eradicating blacks but for eradicating autistics. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 20:43, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Keep in mind, please, that the goal here is merely to document the subject's existence, <i>not to promote it</i>. Just because the subject may be offensive (I'm still not really sure how this could be considered offensive, but hey, what do I know?) is not a reason to delete the article. I, for instance, am highly offended by this article: <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Saloon_League_1dd1.html" title="Anti-Saloon League">Anti-Saloon League</a>, but there's nothing I can do about that.

<dd>I see. Well, an organization can participate in offensive, and even uncondonable actions, can still merit an encyclopedic article. The <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazis.html" title="Nazis">nazis</a> are a prime example. The issue at hand here is the notability of the group. If you oppose genetic screening to prevent autistic children from being born that is your opinion, and your welcome to it. But I am afraid it is not a valid reason to delete the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> College radio shows should be allowed to have pages on here if other radio shows can have them. Winthrop University is not a big school, but it is certainly NOT a D-list university. Since WINR and several other college radio stations are streaming, people might want to find out about some of the shows they can hear online.</li>

<li>I'll give you that one, to an extent. I got the idea from people talking about spamming wikipedia. But I did notice all the show pages that I mentioned earlier before I made the page. There is a very inconsistant policy regarding which radio show pages get to stay and which are deleted. A very large chunk of the radio show pages hold no academic value, and many are simply advertising for a show. The only difference is that I admited to this fact somewhere. Without that post, there would be no evidence to show that was my intent, which it wasn't 100%. So if nothing else, please use this as an example of the inconsistant editing of Wikipedia. There are tons of pages that hold no academic value and are put up simply for advertising. Please take care of them as well. In addition, the same three people who are supporting the deletion of the A &amp; J Show are the first three people who supported the deletion of this page. The AFD tag was not put on this page until I showed it to Joyous and asked why that page was appropriate and mine was not.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Wikipedia is not for attracting notability; it's also not UScollegecruft.wikipedia.org.

<p>No claim was made that records were not self-published. We are a non-profit singing group at a small university. We are in no way trying to advertise a product. If this is a problem, mention of the records can be deleted. A simple track listing is all that has been posted thus far, as there have been time constraints in updating the page.Daniel2Hs 21:06, 19 November 2006</p>

The UWA has been in existence for approximately 5 years while owned by Mr. Grubb, which is notable itself considering the current wrestling climate in the U.S. It is true that major wrestling stars wrestle in many indy feds, however in 2006 alone the UWA has promoted matches featuring 8 former WWE stars (including former WWF tag team champion and executive Tom Prichard, who performs for UWA every week), 6 former WCW stars (including Ricky Morton and the original Midnight Express), and 6 stars currently contracted by TNA wrestling (most notably A.J. Styles and Chase Stevens, who reigned as UWA champion for 5 weeks). It was the home promotion of current WWE-contracted developmental talent Devin Driscoll, and several Ohio Valley Wrestling stars compete in UWA semi-regularly. Furthermore UWA is the premiere promotion in the region surrounding Knoxville (3rd largest city in Tennessee). To my knowledge it is the only wrestling organization in Eastern Tennessee (10,000+ sq. mi.) that promotes over 52 live shows each year. In addition to the DVDs, UWA is televised on cable television in the Knoxville area. STFmaryville 00:56, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Do you have <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> these claims you've made about the promotion?

<li><b>Comment</b>. As I stated above: having former stars (or current stars of TNA or WWE) doesn't make it anything special. They appear on indy cards all the time. A cable show isn't that helpful either in my opinion, many indy promotions have gotten TV shows... it doesn't make them all notable. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 20:31, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. As a worker on the indys, and of the United Wrestling Association, I can verify that they do run over 52 shows a year. You can check my schedule on cmsigmon.com to prove that I am there each week. UWA was also the key factor in the Ricky Morton Benefit Show which you can purchase on Highspots.com It had a ton of names on the card and was filmed at UWA. If you really need more proof, I will dig and get you some. cmsigmon 14:29, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The "effort" is mine, and naturally I disagree with you. These people are notable because of their office, just as military commanders and senior civil servants are notable because of their office. We consider politicians notable because of their office, we consider professional sportsmen to be notable because they play professionally, yet you claim we should not consider senior police officers to be notable because they run big policing organisations that affect many thousands of people (millions in the case of London)? This is not logical. I fear that notability is being confused with recognisability. They are not the same. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 02:25, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>My contention is that this person did not reach a senior enough position (third ranking officer) for <i>ex officio</i> encyclopedic notability - and not that all senior police officers are non-notable. Same goes for civil servants and military officers who do not reach the very highest positions. And no, I don't confuse notability with recognisability - while I've long said that a WP:MANDARIN guideline is needed for public servants, I've been even more vocal in asserting that media coverage does not automatically translate to encyclopedic notability. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 03:10, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>You are conveniently ignoring the fact that he was also a Chief Constable and an HM Inspector of Constabulary. But that aside, are you saying that only the Chief of the General Staff of the British Army is notable and none of his juniors are? Are only military officers who reach the rank of full general notable? If more junior military officers are notable then why does this not apply to police officers? What exactly is the "very highest position"? Chief Constables of other police forces often give up that position to be appointed AC of the Met, which is considered an equivalent rank even though it is not the highest rank in the force, such is the prestige of the job. So, by your reckoning, Chief Constables are presumably not notable, or suddenly become non-notable as soon as they become a "lowly" AC. You are also ignoring the fact that, for instance, WP:BIO states that sportsmen who play in a fully professional league are notable. So, a footballer who plays in the lowest professional division in a country is notable, but the third most senior police officer of a city of millions is not? This all sounds like severe discrimination against public servants who may not be well-known to the public but are still notable in their own fields. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 16:47, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am the creator of this article and others in the series. The Assistant Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police, of whom there were only four at any one time, were among the six most senior officers of the London Metropolitan Police, after the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner. The force was between 20,000 and 30,000 men strong, policed one of the largest and most important cities in the world, and led policing innovation throughout Britain, the British Empire, and often the world. The ACs wore (and still wear) effectively the same rank insignia as a Lieutenant-General in the British Army and are equal in rank to the Chief Constables (i.e. the chiefs of police) of every other police force in the United Kingdom. Allan had previously served as a Chief Constable himself and then as one of HM Inspectors of Constabulary, of whom there were only two in the whole of England and Wales and whose job it was to inspect every other police force on behalf of the Home Office. And yet people claim he's not notable?! Of course someone of that rank is notable, by virtue of his rank and position alone. If people like this are not considered notable and minor soap stars, athletes, models and singers are then I shall begin to give up on Wikipedia. It's simply getting to the stage when the attitude of the deletionists is making it not worth writing for this encyclopaedia, since hard work and attempts to create coherent series of articles are gleefully proposed for deletion by people who obviously have little knowledge of the subject and little idea of what constitutes notability, particularly as regards anything that predates the internet age. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 01:58, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sorry, but I am frankly sick and tired of defending articles (not usually mine) in AfDs against rampant deletionism. I joined Wikipedia to create articles, and it seems to me that an ever increasing number are here only to destroy. Destroy rubbish. Destroy articles about minor so-called celebrities. Fine. Do not destroy articles about significant people who would probably have had plenty written about them had the internet existed in their time. This is not what Wikipedia is all about. Not to me anyway. And incidentally, I <i>do</i> believe the police chiefs and other senior officers of all largish cities are notable.

<li>Thanks. I feel that police officers are severely under-represented on Wikipedia, and the comments here sadly show that people would much rather have articles on minor celebrities and politicians than people who made a real contribution to the world. Presumably even the Commissioners are not notable by the reckoning of some, since they just held a senior rank. Didn't do anything of note, like kick a ball around a field for a living, sit in a parliament for a few months or record a moderately successful song, all of which would qualify them for an article with few questions asked. No, all they did was get to the top of their profession.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The fact he doesn't have an article yet is irrelevant. He should have. And eventually, hopefully, he will have. What is "public notability" anyway? Notability is not decided by how many people in the street have heard of them, but by how significant they are. And I would argue that a police officer of that rank is most definitely significant enough for an article. A directory? If I listed every officer, that would be a directory. Writing articles about a handful of senior officers is most certainly not. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 13:53, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I can see where you guys are coming from when you say all this...I am completely new to wikipedia, but I was reading about this theory one day on the internet and was very curious about it. A lot of people beleive it and I don't want you to beleive that it's all true, however, it's what some people beleive, and the points are all true. For example...Heaven may not be real...but it will still be in wikipedia under what some people beleive, not necessarily as a fact. For reference. They aren't made up. Jesus DID have white hair- (Rev. 1:14). I wish someone who is good at this could recreate the page since I obviously didn't do so well.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I've read some of the web pages equating Santa Claus with Satan, while I do not think the theory particularly notable (as I see it, the logic required to come to the conclusion is excessively contorted at best, but <i>some</i> folks believe it), you ought to retitle the article (say, "Theories that Santa is a version of Satan" .. "Satan Claus" is going to get vandalized and put up for AfD, to, ahem, beat hell), spell and capitalize properly (that's a red flag for people looking for hoaxes) and reference everything to, ahem, beat hell. Point out that this is a belief that enough folks have to make it <i>notable</i>, don't try to <i>prove</i> it.

<p>Non-notable garage band. As the article itself notes, they have yet to record an album. Also, as the creator of the article is named Rayfieldband there is a seriously high probability of a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> here. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 23:59, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, I am a fan of the band, and wanted to chronicle their story as it happens through Wikipedia. They have a following in Newfoundland, Canada, and have toured the country. This is not a promotion for the band, and it states the facts with as little bias as possible. Nothing is exagerated, and I stuck as closely to other bands pages formats as possible. With time, I planned to put links to the keywords that could be liked to (such as Aliant, Warped Tour, Bedouin Soundclash, etc). The band have yet to record a full length, but as stated in the article, they made it known that they do plan on recording one in the new year. It would seem a waste to delete this article now, when it would have to be recreated then. I again, ask that you please do not delete this article. Thank you. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Rayfieldband (<a href="../../../r/a/y/User_talk%7ERayfieldband_08a5.html" title="User talk:Rayfieldband">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rayfieldband_3d41.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rayfieldband">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country,[1] reported in notable and verifiable sources</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The band toured from Newfoundland to Vancouver, which was reported in many newspapers, news shows and radio shows in Newfoundland. Scans are available if needed. Which also ties in with "Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers (although university newspapers are usually fine), personal blogs, etc.)"</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Has won or placed in a major music competition.</b> Rayfield won the Aliant Garage Band Contest in 2005, (www.aliant.com/youth101), beating out all other bands in Newfoundland, and 3 other Maritime bands.</li>
