<dd><b>re comment</b> I really don't have strong feelings toward this article and my opinion would change of course in case no serious sources are brought. I just believe that this article should never be a list. I totally agree w/ you in that if it is kept as a list it would be biased but i am supporting it as an article; a discussion on how Islam regards cults. Mainstream Islam classifies many other <i>beliefs/sects/doctrines</i> as cults and that is a fact and we should only bring sourced facts like who says X is a cult and why. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="DarkSlateBlue">Szvest</font></font></a></i> - <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: gold"><sup><i>Wiki me up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 12:32, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>re comment</b> No credible sources describing <i>Islamic cults</i> have been brought forward, instead this article has expanded chaotically and is now labelling significant historical Muslim communities as <i>cults</i>. Even when viewed against developments in the Islamic world, this article goes against the Muslim spirit of respect, moderation and rational dialogue. By contrast, recent endeavours among Muslim authorities of all interpretations have been aimed at increasing mutual respect.</dd>

It brought together scholars, leading authorities and representatives from eight Shia and Sunni schools of thought (Madhahib): Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi‘i, Hanbali, Ja‘fari, Zaydi, Ibadi and Thahiri (each of the so-called <i>cults</i> on this page typically adheres to one of these schools).

<dd>In Islam there is no concept of a <i>cult</i>; it is a term borrowed from western, orientalist lexicon. Its application in the context of Muslim communities is tantamount to an accusation of appostacy. By its nature, this article will sew discord and disagreement and undermines the building of mutual respect between communities. It neccessarily promotes fictitious propaganda issued by people without authority or standing, because those who do have legitimate authoity in the Muslim world are committed to reaffirming respect and setting aside disagreement (as noted above).</dd>

<dd>From a wikipedia standpoint, this all boils down to three things:
<ol>
<li>This article contains <b>no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a></b> (and one would be hard pressed to find any), and the claims asserted by this article are <b><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">not verifiable</a></b>;</li>
<li>The title and very nature of this article <b>precludes a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a></b>. It is a <b><a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">POV fork</a> of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a></b>;</li>
<li>The article inherently engages in inventing or asserting new information (<b><a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a></b>) by its declaration of the existance <i>Islamic cults</i>, which have no basis in the history or traditions of Islam; and by unilaterally applying the term to any group the editors wish to malign. Currently, the article appears to condemn the entire <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shia.html" title="Shia">Shia</a> community as a cult (see the main article under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamic_Cults&amp;oldid=99941680#Jaffri" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamic_Cults&amp;oldid=99941680#Jaffri" rel="nofollow">Jaffri</a>).

<dd>Thanks for this comment; it helps to illustrate that there is unity within the <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a>. When I saw this article &amp; afd, I expected that the article will contain a list of Islamic groups that are not listed on <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a>. A closer inspection shows that Islamic Cults is a bad start at that. However, a quick comparison of the two articles shows that many of the "groups" on Islamic Cults are not found on <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Assassins_ede3.html" title="The Assassins">The Assassins</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/h/Wahabi.html" title="Wahabi">Wahabi</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haruriyya.html" title="Haruriyya">Haruriyya</a>, <a href="../../../z/i/n/Zindikites.html" title="Zindikites">Zindikites</a> ... to list a few that WP has real articles about). Are any of these likely to be added to <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a>? If so, I think a quick <b>merge</b> is in order, and then the Islamic Cults article can be deleted. Of those I have listed, which are not candidates for the <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a> article; what would you call those "groups" that fall outside of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>?

<dd>Your suggestion is well-intentioned, but a careful examination of the groups that you mentioned reveals that many are pejorative names of groups that are already listed in <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a>. For example, <i>Assassins</i> or <i>Hashshashin</i> are pejorative references to the 12th century <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html#Ismailiyah" title="Divisions of Islam">Ismailis</a>, and the <i>Wahabi</i> prefer the term <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html#Salafism" title="Divisions of Islam">Salafi</a>. Both groups are already listed in the <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a> article - it is quite comprehensive.

<dd>Actually the <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a> article already addresses this. It includes an <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html#Other_sects" title="Divisions of Islam">Other Sects</a> section describing those that consider themselves to be Muslim but are not recognized as such by the mainstream, and a <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html#Related_Faiths" title="Divisions of Islam">Related Faiths</a> section of groups who do not consider themselves to be Muslim, but who have a historic connection with Islam.

<dd>This still doesnt address the perceived gap I am talking about. If <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a> is to be NPOV, it should be possible to reach all sects from it.

The problem is that there is bound to be some Islamic groups that are not "sects" (i.e. they are radical deviations from "core" values) and as such I doubt belong on <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a> -- however they are often notable (similar to <a href="../../../b/r/a/Branch_Davidian_0995.html" title="Branch Davidian">Branch Davidian</a> listed on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_groups_referred_to_as_cults.html" title="List of groups referred to as cults">List of groups referred to as cults</a>) -- personally I think a list of these groups would be a good idea, as it draws a line between Islam and those groups, with intelligent explanations of why they are a "cult". That new page can then be added to the <i>See also</i> section of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a>, and watched like a hawk to ensure it stays in reasonable shape. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 01:48, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The difficulty here is that there are attempts by individuals to invent groups, make baseless claims about their beliefs and practices, then assign their invented moniker to communities practicing valid, historic interpretations. It generates propaganda, confusion and mistrust. These groups are further maligned through labels such as <i>cult</i>, <i>apostate</i> etc in an attempt to narrow the historic pluralism of Islamic interpretation.</dd>
<dd>Radicalism is the antithesis of Islam and has nothing to do with it as a religion. Of course there are radical political movements that seek to use religion as a vehicle; however, this phenomenon is not exclusive to Islam. And unlike Christianity where there is a clear separation between Church and State, Islam does not traditionally make such a distinction; so it becomes difficult to distingish a radical religious movement from a political one.</dd>
<dd>So the dilema: is it possible to create a credible article, with reliable sources, a neutral point of view, and free of pejorative monikers and invented <i>sects</i>, that justly situates certain groups outside the boundaries of mainstream Islam? Given the fluid, pluralist and inclusive nature of Islam and its history, I think that would be very difficult. If we refer back to the <a href="http://www.jordanembassyus.org/new/pr/pr07062005.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.jordanembassyus.org/new/pr/pr07062005.shtml" rel="nofollow">statement of the International Islamic Conference</a>, it is inclusive, affirming the fundamental beliefs of those who are Muslim.

<dd><b>Comment</b> John Vendenberg's hope for an "Islamic" term that could be used instead of "cult" strikes at the very heart of the matter of why this article must be deleted permanently. There is no word in Islamic languages that adequately translates as "cult." The reasons for this are many, one of which is historical. Unlike in Christianity, which had a central church to define an "orthodoxy," there is no such institution in Islam. While there have always been very vigorous debates in the 1400 years of Muslim history over which interpretation of Islam is correct, the idea of "cults," in the negative English sense of that word, has not arisen. The terms commonly used to describe different groups within Islam (or even accused of deviating from Islam) include "hizb" (Arabic حزب), which generally falls much more within the realm of political parties; firqa (Arabic فرقة), which simply means division; tariqa (Arabic طريقة), which means "a path"; and al-milal wa'l-nihal (Arabic الملل والنحل), which basically means "communities and groups". None of these can be construed to mean "cult" in the sense that it's being used in this article. In fact, the Encyclopaedia of Islam (2nd ed, published by E.J. Brill), which is the standard scholarly reference work for subjects such as these, never uses the term "cult" in this sense in any of its thousands of articles dealing with Islam, nor is a single Arabic, Persian, Turkish or Urdu word in the extensive glossary of the Encyclopaedia of Islam translated to mean "cult" in this sense. The term simply does not exist in the major Islamic languages, and it carries cultural baggage in English that does not translate into the historical experience of the Muslim community. Dr. D. Gimaret, in his article on "al-milal wa'l-nihal" in the Encyclopaedia of Islam, even suggests that the word "heresy" is inappropriate, let alone "cult," and instead prefers to call this branch of religious polemics as "doxographical" rather than "heresiographical." In short, we cannot impose a category such as "cults" on Islam, when that category simply doesn't exist in Muslim works written in Islamic languages, any more than we can force Christianity to be studied in terms of Islamic concepts that may have no relevance to the Christian tradition. 74.12.145.234 21:41, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>* In todays world we in the United States see bombings between Sunnis and Shias in Iraq and than witness all kinds of individuals stating that they are the main stream Islam, while in fact Mainstream muslims who constitute over 99% of Islam in Shia and Sunnis but people dont know who to look at. In fact, if one is to look up the suicide bombers it is clear that most of them are members of a sect that follows extremist views such as going to heaven by killing innocent people, while vast majority of muslims are clearly opposed to this. In order to understand Islam and the mainstream Islam it is incumbent upon the editors to have these cults and sects in one section where it is all for see what these small sects really beliveve in. For instance, the Qadianis claim they have 200 million followers while in fact they have less than 10 million members, the Aga Khanis are less than 5 million members, the Nation of Islam maybe one half million, these sects are not mainstreams.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as in Christianity there are the cults such as David Koresh's Branch Dravidians, and the Chritian Identity up in Idaho, those cults do not represent mainstream Christianity, and these cults are listed separately. If one is to look up th Encyclopedia of American Religion, Fourth Edition by J. Gordon Melton, The Encylcopedia lists every single religion in America, including each of the cults mentioned in this article. Thus to delete this article would be unfair.</p>
<p>In fact it would be the same as deleting on the Nation of Islam article the critisms of Nation of Islam. In fact if one puts up anything in the Ismaili article the users who are followers of that particular brand of Islam call it vandalism, while in fact it is a viewpoint which is different than that held by the followers. In one instance a statement was added to the Wahabi sect and a user from Israel objected, eventhough, I doubt very much that Israelis have a very deep understanding of Wahabis, the user called it vandalism, while in truth and fact the United States Government and in particulara the FBI has stated that Wahabis are extremists and that the 9/11 hijackers were all wahabis and that Osama Bin Ladin proclaims himself to be a Wahabi, but the reference was deleted as being untrue and as vandalism.</p>
<p>Here if one is to listen to the argument put forward by the adherents of the view that Islam is a pluralistic religion and all are accepted, than we would not be witnessing over 90 dead bodies in Iraq everyday. In fact my own nephew who was with the 4ID in Iraq was a victim of the cultish violence, in fact he won a purple heart for his bravery. We have to identify the cults in Islam so that the world can see that these cult followers even with their billions of dollars who have bought our Government in Washington, do not in fact represent Islam.</p>
<p>Obvioiusly, the Mormon cultist who was marying off 12 year old girls also did not consider himself to be a cultist. If only the viewpoint of the particular follower of the cult or sect are listed than Wikipedia cannot be called an Encyclopedia but rather a proponent of only the views of the sects or cults that want to propogate their own viewpoints.</p>
<p>I hope that the editors are mindful of the viewpoint that to make a complete encyclopedia all viewpoints must be published.</p>

<p><s>*<b>Keep</b> Exposing cults is not the point, the issue here is that both sides of an issue must be represented. Thus, if former members of certain cults believe that the subject cult is a cult who is a third party to say, therefore it should be included.

<dd>The notion of <i>cult</i> has its origins in Christanity, and the word and its connotations have evolved in the Western milieu. By contrast, the traditional languages of Islam do not have a word analogous to "cult". Islam is an inclusive tradition, and has evolved multiple schools of interpretation, each distinct but mutually respectful of one another. This pluralism, which is central to the Muslim ethos, is founded on the Qur'anic injunction, and provides no basis for the notion of <i>cult</i> in an Islamic context.
