<p>The Strawberry Studios were opened as a recording studio in 1971, and owned by members of 10CC. It became a famous recording studio, and was used not only by people like Paul McCartney and Wings, but also St Winifred's School Choir.</p>
<p>Strawberry studios is famous in Manchester and Stockport for a multitude of reasons. The much quoted and influential Joy Division album 'Unknown Pleasures' was recorded at Strawberry, as was the first Smiths single 'Hand in Glove' , followed by their self titled debut album. The Stone Roses recorded their first single 'So Young/Tell me' during a Strawberry session that also produced an early version of 'I Wanna Be Adored' and all the tracks recorded during this session eventually ended up on the 1995 'Garage Flower' album. Last but not least the studio was owned and run by Kevin Godley and Lol Creme of 10cc fame ,and is responsible for the recording of perhaps their most famous song "I'm Not In Love ', a masterpiece in record production for the time, in which they used as many as 250 voices for the famous choral backing! These are just a few reasons why this hidden gem is much heralded in musical folklore, dig a bit deeper.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-18_df59.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Chartism&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Chartism"</span></h2>
<p>In “Chartism,” Carlyle deals with Chartism in the abstract. Even if Chartism per se is dead, he claims (which it was not), “the living essence of Chartism has not been put down.” What he means is that Chartism is not a one-time insurrection, but rather a manifestation of working-class discontent as well as of social and economic instability. Because this discontent is a reaction to laissez-faire by a starving and uneducated populace, it is likely to remain as long as conditions persist and to occasionally explode in violent uprisings (references to the French Revolution are frequent in “Chartism”). The nation needs to respond to Chartism by developing a national purpose (it’s as vague as it sounds) that provides work and food for the working class. Although he largely refuses to discuss legislation, Carlyle does recommend a dual program of Education and Emigration (led by pioneers from the upper classes)</p>
<p>Carlyle blames working-class discontent on laissez-faire. His use of the term is questionable, since he is referring to the New Poor Law as a piece of laissez-faire legislation. The New Poor Law was a Benthamite measure, and the Benthamite Radicals were not entirely advocates of laissez-faire. Since for Carlyle, “Work is the mission of man in this Earth,” the New Poor Law seems fair enough to him. However, he ironically suggests extending the compulsion to work to all strata of society. In a more frank tone, he claims that ruling classes need to take charge of the governance of the working class. He is particularly referring to the middle class, since it is more involved in the nation’s “work” than the aristocracy; however, Carlyle is not as vehement about the demise of the aristocracy here as he is in Past and Present.</p>
<p>Taking charge of the working class means, not Parliamentary relief in this case, but rather developing some vaguely defined Ideal on the part of a “real Aristocracy.” This “real” aristocracy must replace “the sole cash nexus” with more meaningful bonds of love, faith, and common interest. The new rulers must be “strong men.”</p>
<p>Over the course of “Chartism” Carlyle makes reference to the revolutionizing of work by the steam-engine and to the global economy. He is mainly interested in the tendency of machines and the global market to create devastating ups and downs in labor demands, as well as to level down wages (or more accurately standards of living). Regarding the global labor market he uses the example of the Irish (or “Sanspotatoes”). The Irish problem is at the same time a parallel to and a part of the Chartism problem. He claims that the invasion of Irish workers has become such a problem that soon England will either have to arrive at a solution or be completely overrun. According to Carlyle, the globalized, mechanized economy reduces the majority of workers to the state of being of reckless gamblers, though at no fault of their own.</p>
<p>Carlyle employs incendiary rhetoric, but is anti-revolutionary and anti-democratic. He associates the latter with “the sole cash nexus” and leveling and “the national Palaver.” For him, it is more important that “the great dumb, deep-buried class” be governed and, through education, rendered articulate (and perhaps gradually enfranchised?). Carlyle sees Ideals rather than Revolutions as the forces that drive history. Sometimes, though, revolutions become necessary to awaken the nation to the necessity of striving towards the new Ideal. “Events are written lessons,” and are to be ignored at the peril of the entire nation. Carlyle hopes that England can learn from the French Revolution and from Chartism, and avoid a violent English Revolution. Change must come. But through the recognition of the Ideal on one hand, and the awareness of the consequences of tardiness on the other, Carlyle hopes the English “may be able to transact it through argument alone!”</p>

<p>Seat pitch is a measure used to show the amount of space between seats in a cabin such as on an aircraft or in a train. To measure seat pitch, one must measure from any point of a seat to a seat behind at the same measurement location. For example, it you measured from the back of the seat in row seven, measuring from the back of the seat in row seven to the back of the seat in row eight would give the seat pitch in a given cabin. Seat pitch doesn't exactly mean legroom, but the more seat pitch, the more roomy the seat will feel.</p>

<p>The process by which steel is surfaced hardended by a chemical process. Nitriding introduces nitrogen onto the surface of steel at temperature ranges of 930 - 1020 degrees F (500 - 550 degrees C). This hardens the steel surface and provides the steel with the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>To obtain high surface hardness</li>
<li>To increase wear resistance</li>
<li>To improve fatigue life</li>
<li>To improve corrosion resistance (except for stainless steels)</li>
<li>To obtain a surface that is resistant to the softening effect of heat at temperatures up 930 degrees F</li>
</ul>
<p>For Nitriding to occure the steel must be in a ferrite condition. The ferrite condition of steel (iron) exits at it's low temperature range, below 1350 degrees F, and is one of the many states of the steel.</p>

<p>The Antioch Chamber Ensemble debuted at the gala opening of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in 1997, and quickly emerged as one of the New York Metropolitan area’s finest vocal ensembles. In recent seasons, critics have called Antioch “stellar,” “flawless,” and “an exceptional group.” Seeking to present as diverse a program as possible of the world’s greatest choral literature, both sacred and secular, Antioch has performed works ranging from William Byrd’s <i>Mass for Four Voices</i> to Brahms’ <i>Liebeslieder Waltzes</i> to Frank Martin’s <i>Mass for Double Choir</i>, with a core group of only eleven singers.</p>
<p>Since their debut as the ensemble-in-residence at Trinity Church, Wall Street in 2001, Antioch’s performance highlights have included feature performances for Carnegie Hall’s Neighborhood Concert Series and the Trinity Wall Street “Noon-Day” Concert Series in New York. They will appear for a fifth time in May of 2006 at the renowned Piccolo Spoleto Festival in Charleston, South Carolina for the “Spotlight on Choral Music” series. They have performed feature concerts for numerous venues, including the Hayes Mansion in San Jose, California. As part of their commitment to music education, Antioch also conducts master classes for young choral artists, such as the Bernardsville High School Madrigal Ensemble in Bernardsville, New Jersey.</p>
<p>The 2005-2006 season will mark Antioch’s third season as ensemble-in-residence at Calvary Church in Summit, New Jersey. The debut of their independent “Concerts at Calvary” series was met with acclaim by Classical New Jersey, which raved, “The intonation was pure, the blend exquisite, the voices ethereal in the church's sympathetic acoustics.” Further, Antioch’s first full-length recording, <i>Winter Songs</i>, featuring the Mid-Winter Songs by contemporary American composer Morten Lauridsen, was released in December of 2003. Mr. Lauridsen has said of the recording, “Antioch is certainly in the top rank of a cappella choirs in the United States… I recommend this CD most highly, especially to choral aficionados". In June of 2005, Antioch toured for the first time, in beautiful Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The eleven exceptional musicians who comprise Antioch are music educators and singers who have performed with ensembles such as the Choir of Trinity Wall Street, Vox Vocal Ensemble, Cantori New York, Philadelphia’s Bridge Ensemble, and the world-renowned Westminster Choir. They are led by artistic director Joshua Copeland.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-18_df59.html" title="Edit section: (Tovrea Castle)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">(Tovrea Castle)</span></h2>
<p>Torvea Castle</p>
<p>He was only ten years old when the “Angel of Death” made his first visit to the Castle. Freddie Tovrea, the son of rancher E.A. Tovrea, former owner of The Tovrea Castle died of appendicitis. His parents were devastated and heart-broken as they delivered his body to the Pioneer Cemetery for burial.</p>
<p>A 20-year old former caretaker at Tovrea Castle, also called the wedding cake house is hardly skeptical when it comes to ghostly apparitions. The wedding cake shaped structure sits silently on a hilltop between Washington and Van Buren Streets, just west of the Red Mountain Freeway watching the thousands of cars that stream by daily unaware of the ghosts that watch their passing.</p>
<p>He was hired as caretaker and housekeeper for the 1931 vintage castle that had its share of sadness, a feeling which many who visit the house experiences. He was sweeping the floor on the second story when he experienced something that almost stopped his heart. As he looked down on the dusty floor he saw footprints moving toward him. He threw down the broom and ran for the door. Unsure of what to do, he called his father who came immediately with a friend and met the young man outside the castle.</p>
<p>He took them inside and there in the dust were the footprints, just as he described them. They were obviously a woman’s step and they concluded that they probably belonged to Della Tovrea Stuart, the reclusive mistress of the castle who lived in the basement for many years and believed to reside in the castle even after her death.</p>
<p>The castle began with a dream of Alessio Carraro, an Italian immigrant, a sheet metal merchant. After selling his business in California in 1925, he moved to Phoenix on the insistence of one of his friends who told him Phoenix was the next hot spot in the nation and that a lot of money could be make, buying property before the tourist boom. Believing his friend’s prediction, he checked out an area that stretched eastward to the outskirts of Phoenix.</p>
<p>The city of Phoenix was already working on the tourist boom with the The Arizona Biltmore Hotel, Hotel Westward Ho, the San Marcos Hotel in Chandler and the Wigwam Resort in Litchfield Park. Hotel rooms were going to be at a premium when the snowy, cold weather in the northeast would bring tourist by the thousands to the Valley of the Sun.</p>
<p>The owner of the property he wanted was a widow, Lillie Warner Smith. She inherited the land and had a frame house on the corner of the property. Carraro bought the land for $250 an acre that went from Van Buren Street to the middle of the Salt River bed, a nice legacy for his young 15-year old son, O.Lee. His legacy was to be a spectacular hotel called “El Castillo (the castle). He not only planned to make money on his hotel but also by selling off all his excess land at a hefty profit.</p>
<p>Carraro and his son moved into her old house as they built their dream. It was here when they met a man from Russia who offered to build a cacti garden to landscape his hotel. Believing that this might be just the tourist draw he need, he hired him. The Carraro Cacti garden was the design and labor of love of M. Moktatchey. The garden had 300 varieties of cacti while Carraro began building his dream hotel in 1929.</p>
<p>Being a thrifty Italian builder, he crushed his own granite, blasted from his own land to make the cement used to create a full basement with vaulted tunnels, a system of cooling the air in the house. With the help of 18 workmen, he framed the castle in wood and then covered it with stucco.</p>
<p>The castle rose higher and higher as they completed the second and third floors and crowned the castle with a cupola surrounded by windows reached only by a narrow inside stairway that gave the residents and the ghosts, a magnificent view of the valley.</p>
<p>The ground floor held a large lobby, the kitchen with cobalt blue sink. Teller cages, he salvaged from a closed bank, served as the kitchen cabinets. From the bank, he also bought a large vault, which he built into the basement wall to keep valuable for himself and his guests, and late used as a wine cellar.</p>
<p>A sitting room and dining room surrounded by windows include a fireplace decorated with a replica of the “Dancing Woman” featured in the Orpheum Theater. This gives rise to the idea that the same workmen also built the Phoenix Theater. The second floor has six odd-sized bedrooms with one bathroom and the third floor has two large bedrooms with one bath. Salvaged wood flooring covers most of the floors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although Carraro and his son loved the house, his wife hated the heat and dust of the desert and refused to leave California where she lived with her youngest son, leaving room for rumors that being Italian with money, he must have been connected with the Chicago gangsters and that Mafia money really built the house for Al Capone.</p>
<p>Carraro wanted to add property to his castle and attempted to buy forty acres of adjourning property but lost the property to Edward A. Torvrea. He wanted the land to pen up his sheep close to his slaughterhouse, which was nearby. The smells and sounds forced Carraro to put his castle up for sale, which was promptly bought by Tovrea and his second wife Della, twenty-seven years his junior.</p>
<p>In June of 1931, he sold the castle and 43 surrounding acres sold for about $22,000 and after selling or donating the rest of his acreage, Carraro, divorced and died in 1974 as he lived in an small trailer in Yarnell. His dreams of the future, lost because of some sheep.</p>
<p>The joy of owning the castle didn’t last long for Edward died the following year. Della eventually remarried. Her new husband was William P. Stuart, publisher of the Prescott Courier. They spent half their time in Prescott and half in the castle until Stuart died in 1960. Della was seventy-two years old and lived alone in the castle as a recluse. She was a little fearful, perhaps a bit intuitive and kept big English Mastiff as guard dogs and some 100 plus peacocks to serve as watch cocks.</p>
<p>On a cold winder November night in 1958, two men entered the castle and according to reports, they climbed in through the cupola. They came upon Della asleep in the kitchen. Their footsteps awakened her. They overpowered her and tied her to a chair and beat her severely. Della lost over $20,000 in silver, jewelry and cash that night but more important she lost her will to live. She died in a nursing home two months later but most people still she still resides in her “dream castle” as she dreams an unending dream.</p>

<p>New wife of radio talk show host <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Bell" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Bell" rel="nofollow">Art Bell</a>. On April 15, 2006 the website of the "Coast to Coast AM" program announced that Art had gone to the Philippines and had married Airyn Ruiz, a 21-year-old recent college graduate. Ruiz had contacted Art Bell through his personal e-mail address concerning Art Bell's late wife shortly after her death. Ruiz was given Bell's contact information from a ham-radio friend in a relationship with Airyn's sister. After dating via Internet videoconference for "hundreds of hours," the two married one week after Bell arrived in the Philippines to meet her in person. Bell also footed the bill for his ham-radio friend to travel to the Philippines to marry Airyn's sister, Kairyn Ruiz, and the two couples wed in a double marriage on April 8, 2006. The following Saturday, Bell shocked listeners when he revealed on the air that he had remarried. He was not planning on telling Coast to Coast listeners about the wedding for another year, but decided against this. He also announced that he had decided to relocate to the Philippines near Manila and continue hosting Coast to Coast via an ISDN connection.</p>

<p>The followup NFL game to the infamous <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounty_Bowl_II_5553.html" title="Bounty Bowl II">Bounty Bowl II</a> matchup between the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Eagles_04d3.html" title="Philadelphia Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>.</p>
<p>Even though almost a year had transpired since the infamous "<a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounty_Bowl_0c0f.html" title="Bounty Bowl">Bounty Bowl</a>" games, the vitriolic rivalry between the two teams was still firmly in Cowboys' fans memories. And this was the first encounter since Cowboys' players and coaches were relentlessly pelted by snowballs during that last matchup at Philadelphia's <a href="../../../v/e/t/Veterans_Stadium_4b72.html" title="Veterans Stadium">Veterans Stadium</a>. The week before game day in Dallas, Philadelphia head coach <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_Ryan_bc15.html" title="Buddy Ryan">Buddy Ryan</a> and Ted Plumb, his offensive coordinator were out for dinner. Coach Ryan was dining on pork chops and started to choke. Fortunately, Plumb quickly initiated the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heimlich_maneuver.html" title="Heimlich maneuver">Heimlich maneuver</a> and saved Ryan's life. Word of the incident spread in Dallas, and hatred by Dallas fans was so fevered towards Ryan that Cowboys' president <a href="../../../t/e/x/Tex_Schramm_b7b5.html" title="Tex Schramm">Tex Schramm</a> dubbed the pending game on October 28, 1990 the "Porkchop Bowl". When the game began, Dallas fans tossed pork chops and similar simulated meat products from the stands toward the Eagles bench.</p>
<p>The final score was 21-20 in favor of the Eagles.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-18_df59.html" title="Edit section: Chapter 15 United States Bankruptcy Code on Cross Border Insolvency">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Chapter 15 United States Bankruptcy Code on Cross Border Insolvency</span></h2>
<p>It happens with increasing frequency that a bankruptcy proceeding in one country has a connection to assets or information located in another. Because of the involvement of multiple jurisdictions unique problems arise. In order to solve some of these problems, the United States enacted Section 304 of the US Bankruptcy Code in 1978. Section 304 has recently been repealed and replaced with Chapter 15, titled "Ancillary and Othe Cross Border Cases". This section has increased the range of options available in the United States in support of foreign bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>Chapter 15 incorporates the Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency drafted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade and Law. The law provides solutions to problems which arise in connection with cross-border bankuptcy, allowing US courts to issue subpoeanas, orders to turn over assets, the issuabnce of stays on pending actions, and orders of other types as circumstances dictate. The ancillary proceeding permitted under Chapter 15 is often a more efficient and less costly alternative to initiating an independent bankruptcy proceeding in the United States. It also avoids the conflicts which could arise between the jurisdictions involved in two independent bankruptcy proceedings initiated in connection with the same debtor.</p>
<p>Chapter 15 also establishes mechanisms for the cooperation bwteen US and foreign courts and representatives regarding proceedings which involve the same debtor.</p>
<p>Whether the US courts will extend the "additional assistance": sought in connection with a foreign proceeding under Chapter 15 is a matter of discretion.</p>
<p>The main consideration the US courts will take into account in making this decision is whether the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in connection with which the additional assistance is sought violate the laws or public policy of the United States and if the foreign courts conduct their proceedings according to basic rules of procedural fairness.</p>
<p>Among other factors the US courts will consider how the foreign jurisdiction treats creditors, whether it prevents the fraudulent transfer of debtor's property, if US creditors are protected against prejudice in the processing of their claims there, and the manner in which assets are distributed.</p>
<p>The court may conduct an evidentiary hearing, including the hearing of expert testimony, to determine whether the proceedings of the foreign forum are sufficiently just to grant the assistance requested.</p>

<p>Born in the squalor of west Wales in the SEVENTIES, Gareth was forced to learn the hard way. By the age of thirteen he was used to using force to solve problems, once killing a wild boar with his teeth. His imfamy spread before him throughout the land. By the age of twenty-one he had many fearsome enemies, none more so than the notorious Dan 'Ger' Clarkey. They met one fateful night at Aberystwyth Castle where the rivalry was to be settled. A great battle commenced, raging for many days and nights. Emerging as the victor Gareth turned his back on the defeated Clarkey. However Clarkey had one final throw. He used his magic nun-chucks to summon an enormous ox. The ox captured Pughe using her horn so........ They married. Gareth moved from Wales with his ox to live a normal life. As for Clarkey...... No one knows.....</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-18_df59.html" title="Edit section: Camgirl">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Camgirl</span></h2>
<p>Camgirl is a term used to describe mostly young, attractive females on the internet with personal sites, a webcam, and requests for money/gifts. A camgirl can also be known by less flattering terms such as a "camwhore" which would be someone who craves attention through their webcam. Camgirls were pioneered by people sites such as Jennicam and Ana Voog. While both of these women had/have webcams, neither of them would be considered camgirls by today's cultural definition.</p>
<p>The most popular webcam portal was once the webcam portals on the stileproject <a href="http://stileproject.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://stileproject.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> where non-nude images of young women were portrayed. Stile's cam portal started off as people mostly in their early to mid 20s with webcams that were only on while they worked. In 2000, Stile's cam portal included such cam illimunaries as Jackie <a href="http://electronicwhore.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://electronicwhore.com" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, Puce, Meenk, and Dawn Marie. As 2001 came, the stileproject started featuring younger and younger girls, some of which were underage.</p>
<p>Though there were already several highschool aged (and younger) girls with cams and personal sites on the net, the stileproject featuring some of these younger girls on the camportals helped propel them into a sub-culture of their own, which is the Camgirl sub-culture that we have come to recogonize today.</p>
<p>In reaction to the newfound popularity of this sub-culture, Daign <a href="http://daign.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://daign.com" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> started a camgirl review site, where he would visit each site and provide cynical commentary of each camgirl's site.</p>
<p>2001 marked the rise of the camgirl, as camgirls started to be featured in mainstream media such as salon.com, and culminated in 2003 with an appearance by a 16 year old camgirl on the tv news show "48 hours." This period saw a rise of camgirls, and a decline in centralized camgirls. After this period -- the Camgirl Era, camgirls became less significant as more and more people began to have personal sites with webcams.</p>

The down and s key makes the vehicle drill downward. The left arrow key and the d key makes the vehicle drill obviously to the left and of course, the right arrow key and the a key makes the vehicle drill to the right. Keep in mind you can't drill upward.</p>

<p><br />
Minerals</p>
<p>Minerals are the game's money makers. They can be redeemed for money that can be used to buy upgrades. In order to find valuable minerals, you'll need to dig deep into the Martian soil. More valuable minerals are heavier than less valuable minerals. When you find the valuable minerals, there will be hardly any when you first find them, but the deeper you go,the more common the minerals are.</p>
<p>Ironium- The first type of mineral you'll see. It isn't worth a lot and nearly worthless when you can find more valuable minerals.</p>
<p>Bronzium- The second type of mineral that you'll find. It's worth more than ironium.</p>
<p>Silverium- The third type of mineral you'll find. It is worth more than ironium and bronzium, but it is worth very little.</p>
<p>Goldium- The fourth type of mineral you'll find. It is worth more than silverium, bronzium, and ironium. Even though it's in the game's title, its worth pales in comparison to the more valuable minerals in this game.</p>
<p>Platinum- The fifth type of mineral out there. Platinum is more valuable than the first three minerals. It is harder to find the than the first three minerals because you'll need to drill deep into the Martian soil. Platinum is a light purple block.</p>
<p>Einsteinium- The sixth type of mineral that can be found. It is one of the more valuable minerals. It is found usually at depths of 2,000 feet or more, but it can be sometimes be found at depths of 1,800-1,900 feet. Einsteinium is a blackish mineral.</p>
<p>Emerald- The seventh type of mineral that can be found. It is more valuable than einsteinium. Emerald is a green mineral.</p>
<p>Ruby- The eighth type of mineral you'll find. It is more valuable than emerald. Ruby is a red mineral.</p>
<p>Diamond- The ninth type of mineral that you'll find. It is more valuable than ruby. Diamond is colorless mineral.</p>
<p>Amazonite- The tenth and final mineral you'll find. It is the more valuable than any other mineral. Amazonite is a mineral that looks like a bunch of sparkles.</p>
<p><br />
The Value of Minerals</p>
<p>Ironium- 30 dollars</p>
<p>Bronzium- 60 dollars</p>
<p>Silverium- 100 dollars</p>
<p>Goldium- 250 dollars</p>
<p>Platinum- 750 dollars</p>
<p>Einsteinium- 2,000 dollars</p>
<p>Emerald- 5,000 dollars</p>
<p>Ruby- 20,000 dollars</p>
<p>Diamond- 100,000 dollars</p>
<p>Amazonite- 500,000 dollars</p>
<p><br />
Upgrades</p>
<p>Upgrades can be bought with the cash you earn from mining. The upgrades will help you dig deeper to find more valuable minerals. They will definitely be needed. Upgrades include the Silvide Drill, the Liquid Compression Tank, and the Einsteinium Hull. Drills help the vehicle dig easier. The radiators protect the vehicle from heat. Fuel tanks keep the vehicle going. Cargo bays store many minerals. The engine helps the vehicle go faster. Hulls protect the vehicle from harm.</p>
<p><br />
Other Items</p>
<p>Dynamite- This item creates and explosion which destroys rocks and minerals. Use with caution.</p>
<p>Quantum Teleporter- The Quantum Teleporter transports the player to the surface . Unfortunately, it teleports the user somewhere, it can be the safely on the ground or in the air. Be prepared if you use this.</p>
<p>Matter Transmitter- The Matter Transmitter is an improved version of the Quantum Teleporter. It safely transports the user to the surface.</p>
<p>Plastic Explosives- An improved version of the dynamite.</p>
<p>Reserve Fuel Tank- The Reserve Fuel Tank refuels the tank by 25 liters. Hull Repair Nanites- The Hull Repair Nanites restore the hull by 30 points.</p>

<p>Initially self-taught and then guided by others in the profession, Morrow never felt the need to seek photographic qualifications. However, even experience must give way to the need for formal recognition and for this reason he decided to go back to the beginning and take on photographic courses, partly to prove to others he was capable and also to see how things have changed over the years.</p>
<p>Over those years he has had the pleasure of photographing: Keiran McKeown, co-founder of the 'Peace People' in Northern Ireland, John Alderdice, former leader of the Alliance party and former Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, Geoff Martin, one-time editor of the Belfast News Letter, Barry Douglas, International concert pianist, David Ervine, Leader of the Progressive Unionist Party and Colin Watson, friend and recognised local artist.</p>

<p>Jewish Mafia</p>
<p><br />
[ Bugsy Segal ] [ Charles Polizzi ] [ Meyer Lansky ] [ Louis Buchalter ]</p>
<p>The Jewish Mafia (Allegedly referred to as the Kosher Mafia) was formed in North America in the late 1930s / Early 1940s. The architect of this formation was the infamous Meyer Lansky. Meyer Lansky had the know how and influence to organise many powerful Jewish gangsters around the country under the umbrella of the emerging 'national crime syndicate'.</p>
<p>Lansky worked closely with the likes of Lucky Luciano and aided him in his fight against the old-line Italian mafiosi then under the competing leaderships of Joe the Boss Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano. These old-world Sicilians, especially Masseria, hated gangsters of other ethnic derivation, he worked with them only when absolutely necessary and looked forward to the day they could remove them from the equation. Luciano and Lansky realized there was no room in the underworld for such counter-productive bigotry, and they plotted to get rid of both Masseria and Maranzano.</p>
<p>After a very bloody war that ended in 1931, both Masseria and Maranzano had been removed. it then became necessary for Lansky and Luciano to "sell" their program of "brotherhood" to their Jewish and Italian followers.</p>
<p>Lansky set about the task of uniting the Jewish gangs across the country. His work brought in the Purple Gang from Detroit and the Moe Dalitz forces operating in Cleveland. He followed this up with a meeting of East Coast forces at the Franconia Hotel in New York City NY on November 11, 1931. Those attending included the likes of Bugsy Siegel, a longtime partner of Lansky and Luciano; Louis "Lepke" Buchalter; Joseph "Doc" Stacher; Jacob "Gurrah" Shapiro; Hyman "Curly" Holtz; Louis "Shadows" Kravits; Harry Tietlebaum; Philip "Little Farvel" Kovalick; and Harry "Big Greenie" Greenberg.</p>
<p>Lansky explained to the attendees that Luciano had successfully united the Italian mafiosi, and that the Lansky-Luciano partnership or national crime syndicate was the only way forward. Everyone agreed, and the Franconia conference established a firm base, "The yids and dagos would no longer fight each other," the quotation attributed to Bugsy Siegel.</p>
<p>Various Jewish gangsters who were thought to be unsuited to the new way of shared wares, such as Waxey Gordon, the bootleg king of Philadelphia, were eliminated. www.gangland.net/Jewish</p>

Stoke Aldermoor is a suburb of <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coventry.html" title="Coventry">Coventry</a>. Houses were first built on the estate in the 1930's. It is in the South-East of the city and borders the <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binley%2C_Coventry_4c73.html" title="Binley, Coventry">Binley</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernesford_Grange_4edb.html" title="Ernesford Grange">Ernesford Grange</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitley.html" title="Whitley">Whitley</a> and Stoke Green areas. It has the Administration centre for <a href="../../../p/e/u/Peugeot.html" title="Peugeot">Peugeot</a> which was also the home of <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talbot.html" title="Talbot">Talbot</a> cars before being bought out by <a href="../../../p/e/u/Peugeot.html" title="Peugeot">Peugeot</a> in the 1980's. The same works was originally used by <a href="../../../r/o/o/Rootes.html" title="Rootes">Rootes</a> (a division of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chrysler.html" title="Chrysler">Chrysler</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humber.html" title="Humber">Humber</a>-<a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillman.html" title="Hillman">Hillman</a>.</p>
<p>Streets are named after the motor and aviation industries (<a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitworth.html" title="Whitworth">Whitworth</a> Avenue, Siddeley Avenue, Armstrong Avenue and after the contents of the fields of the farm land the estate was built on (The Farmstead, The Green Field, The Linfield, The Moorfields, Pinley Fields, The Barley Lea, Jasmin Grove, The Coppice, Yew Close, The Cornfield, Acorn Street).</p>
<p>It is bisected by the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> Main train line to Euston station and is infamously known for having hosted the filming for the 60's <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> Blockbuster "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Italian_Job_3d8f.html" title="The Italian Job">The Italian Job</a>" <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mini.html" title="Mini">mini</a> sewer chase scene. The cars were lowered into the under construction sewer in Stoke Aldermoor and were retrived at the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finham.html" title="Finham">Finham</a> sewer works.</p>
<p>Very visible across most of the estate and dominating a large part of land not actually in Stoke Aldermoor is the site of a <a href="../../../g/e/c/GEC_137f.html" title="GEC">GEC</a> works now owned by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marconi_plc.html" title="Marconi plc">Marconi_plc</a>, easily identified by it's large transmission aerial mast.</p>
<p>The river Sowe flows through part of Stoke Aldermoor, and some of Stoke Aldermoor was redeveloped by the construction company Fairclough during the 1980's to build a new road called Allard Way which bridges the river Sowe and separates Stoke Aldermoor from <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernesford_Grange_4edb.html" title="Ernesford Grange">Ernesford Grange</a>.</p>
<p>One border of Stoke Aldermoor is a small shallow brook that borders onto Stoke and partially runs under Stoke Aldermoor. The border to Ernesford Grange is the river Sowe and Allard Way. The border to Whitley is the train line. The Border to part of Stoke Green is the Peugeot Works.</p>

<p>3D is an American R&amp;B group originating from Atlanta, GA. The group consists of Calliope Jones (Calliope HELLO!), Thalia Jackson (Thalia HEY!) and Erato Jenkins (Erato HI!)</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-18_df59.html" title="Edit section: HISTORY">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">HISTORY</span></h3>
<p>Calliope, Thalia, and Erato all met while in elementary school in Atlanta. They became close friends and all wanted to become singers. Under the name 3D (Three Divas) they took voice and dance lessons as they performed at talent shows, weddings, funerals, birthday parties, baby showers, and any other outlet they could get at. By the time they graduated high school, the three girls were disappointed in themsevles since they could not get a record deal.</p>
<p>After high school, Thalia went to Houston, Texas for college. Erato left for New Orleans for the same reason, but Calliope wanted to continue getting a recording contract. She sold most of her possessions, bought a small car, and drove it all the way from Atlanta to Los Angeles. With no money for the expensive apartments there, she found a tiny one-bedroom apartment in Compton, a community outside of Los Angeles known for its crime and drugs.</p>
<p>Not to be stopped, Calliope then sent demo tapes to studios, but she never heard a reply. She was about to give up after she sang at a talent show in a small town called Oakwood, near Los Angeles. Rex Nollington, the ex-heir of the Nollington Hotels Empire, was highly impressed by her singing talents. He asked her is he could be her manager, which she agreed to. The two of them were distress when Rex's wife, Regina Nollington, would not allow such a union. It would be months until Rex and Regina were able to come to an agreement. Rex would be allowed to manage Calliope, but Regina's sister(snap snap) Renée had to be a part, and auditions had to be held for another singer. Also, Rex was NEVER to be alone with Calliope or the new singer.</p>

<p>After auditions, a young Mexican-American woman named Marta Garcia was chosen. Calliope was secretly angry, because she didn't think a Mexican-American and a Japanese person could have the same R&amp;B flavor has black women. It wasn't until long before the new 3D fell apart. The did in fact gain local success, but Calliope and Regina did not get along, Renée didn't want to be in the group in the first place (she wanted to concentrate on her lucrative fashion business and return to Japan), and Marta did not feel as if she fit in. In less than three months, 3D ended.</p>

<p>Still without a contract, and now without a manager, Calliope did not want to give up hope just yet. She performed at talent shows and other outlets by herself in hopes of getting a new manager, but she was never contacted. She then tried to re-start the group again with tow new singers, but just as before, the trio fell apart within two months. As a result, Calliope was the butt of many jokes. The most-used one was when townspeople referred to her as "1D," (One Dummy)</p>
<p>By this time, Calliope decided to return to Atlanta and attend college with a major in Music Education. She planned on becoming a music teacher and help other people reach their goals.</p>

<p>Without warning, Rex and Regina divorced and Rex was released from his inheritance. With no income, he decided to live out his dream of managing a famous singing group. Without Regina or his father to hold him back, he first decided to take a break in Japan before returning to help Calliope. In the meantime, Calliope summoned Thalia in Houston. Neither had heard from Erato since Hurricane Katrina eight months prior, so they assumed she had perished.</p>
<p>Thalia arrived in Oakwood, and she and Calliope decided to replace Erato. The both of them began writing songs and making dance steps while waiting for Rex to return from Japan. They were pleasantly shocked when they got a call from Erato, who informed them that she was well, though homeless. Rex's sister, Jade, paid for Erato to fly out of New Orleans to Oakwood to join her friends. Now, Calliope, Thalia, and Erato write and practice while waiting for ther manager to return from Tokyo. Because of a threatend lawsuit from Regina for spelling the group's name "3D," the ladies changed it to "3ree D."</p>

<p>CPZ is an abbreviation for Criminal Protection Zone.</p>
<p>CPZ refers to a business that has banned firearms from their premises, usually by displaying a "No Guns" sign at the entrance.</p>
<p>The CPZ name is a result of the signs having the effect of disarming all law-abiding gun owners. While having no effect on criminals who wish to carry guns. Thus creating a safer environment for criminals who can be assured that they will not be met with armed resistance.</p>
<p>The term likely originated in Ohio after the state passed it's Concealed Carry law and many businesses put up "No Guns" signs.</p>

<p>The Great American Stew Pot may be a more appropriate description of the cultural heterogeneity that is now openly visible in the US. A stew is a single dish in itself, yet the ingredients within retain their shape/texture/identity. A melting pot incorrectely connotes a vision of a blend where the prior ingredients can no longer be identified.</p>

<p>John F. Mullins - Born in Southwest Oklahoma in 1942. Joined the U.S. Army out of high school, quickly becoming first a paratrooper, then a medic in the rapidly-expanding Special Forces (Green Berets). Served his first six month tour on an “A” Team in the Republic of Vietnam in 1963. Commissioned an Infantry Second Lieutenant in 1964, attending Ranger School in 1965, Lieutenant Mullins then once again served on an “A” Team in Vietnam during the 1966-67 period, as a Studies and Observations Group (SOG) officer in 1968-69, and as a Provincial Reconnaissance Unit (PRU) Advisor in 1969-70.</p>
<p>By then a Captain, John Mullins returned to the U.S. for advanced schooling in tactics and languages, returning overseas for assignment in Europe as a Special Operations Officer. Throughout the 1970s he ran training and operational missions in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Central and South America.</p>
<p>Retiring from the military in 1981 after twenty-one years service, nineteen of it in the Special Forces, Mr. Mullins offered his services to government and civilian customers, returning to the Middle East for three years, then performing missions in Central and South America, Europe, Africa, Afghanistan, and various countries in the Far East. These missions ran the gamut: training, VIP Protection, asset recovery, hostage negotiation and rescue, advising, and occasionally leading foreign police and military personnel in high-risk operations.</p>
<p>In 1990, Mr. Mullins founded Longbow, Incorporated, a company that specializes in the manufacture of Non-Toxic Frangible ammunition, marketing this product (built upon his patent) to law enforcement and military customers throughout the United States and the rest of the world. Mr. Mullins also founded W.C.B. &amp; Associates, a company specializing in the construction of tactical firing ranges, and is the founder and president of the Tallgrass Center for Advanced Tactical Training (TCATT), which presents live-fire training courses for the police and military.</p>
<p>Mr. Mullins is an author with one published novel (Days of Fire, Berkeley Press, 1991, soon to be reissued by Soldier of Fortune Press), two more novels to be published in 1998-99, and magazine and trade journal articles too numerous to mention. His teleplay for Soldier of Fortune, Inc., the syndicated series, was aired during the 1997-98 season. Another teleplay has been purchased for the second year of the series. In addition, his second novel, “Iceman and the Tracker”, has also been optioned for a major motion picture.</p>
<p>Mr. Mullins has a BA in History from the University of Maryland, and an MBA from Midwestern State University. He speaks four languages, is a frequent panelist and guest speaker for conferences and seminars conducted by government and corporate entities, in particular those dealing with First Responder Training for Incidents Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction. Mr. Mullins also serves as a consultant to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in matters of Law Enforcement Training for response to WMD.</p>
<p>Combat awards include the Silver Star, Bronze Star with three Oak Leaf Clusters, and several Purple Hearts. Military schools are too numerous to mention, but run the gamut from Military Free Fall to Underwater Demolitions to Counterterrorism. Other specialties include VIP Protection, High-Risk Installation Security, Aviation Security, and Intelligence.</p>
<p>Mr. Mullins has also been Raven Software's exclusive "SOLDIER OF FORTUNE" consultant during the making of this video game. His character is very specific and well-developed. His background is similar to that of the real John Mullins, whose bio has been presented here.</p>

<p>The Man who Shot Cane Skretteburg is the 19th episode of the animated TV series "King of the Hill"</p>
<p>Hank, Dale, Bill, and Boomhauer are belittled by an old man when they use Bill's new leafblower. Meanwhile, a group of teenagers in Hank's neighborhood try to form their own band. None of them are very good musicians and Hank and the others try to sort them out but the punks simply redicule them.</p>
<p>Later, Hank, Dale, Bill, and Boomhauer go to the local driving range, while Bobby and Joseph go to play paintball in the nearby woodsball field. Bobby and Joseph are quickly drenched in paint by another team, who turn out to be the band. Hank and the others challenge them to a paintball match to teach them a lesson, but are quickly ambushed by the teenagers, who force them into sight of the driving range and "execute" them in front of the other drivers.</p>
<p>Hank feels embarrassed after this, and Peggie suggest that he may be suffering post traumatic stress disorder. After a nightmare about the ordeal, Hank and the others decide to settle the score and challenge the band to a rematch. The band replies that they can't play because their car is broken down. Hank and the others fix the car and resume their challenge, but once again, they are defeated horribly.</p>
<p>The four friends finally succumb to the feeling that they are getting old and star to hang around with the old man, but after the punks take pot shots at them, Hank soon realizes that they can defeat their opponents if they figure out how a teenager's mind works. After some research, they conclude that teenagers are cruel, clumsy around girls, and paranoid around head shops. They cahllenge the punks once a gain, this time betting Bill's leafblower against their amplifiers. Using their newfound knowledge to their advantage, they defeat the punks and claim their amplifiers.</p>

<p>The Pillnitz Declaration, or more commonly The Declaration of Pillnitz, was a carefully worded statement issued by the monarchs of Austria and Prussia in June 1791. It declared that the two nations would be willing to intervene in France in certain circumstances, but was not intended to provoke war but to mearly have a sobering effect on revolutionary France.</p>
<p>The Declaration was made because while at first the absolute rulers of continental Europe were pleased with the revolution as undermining a competing power, they became frightened when they listened to the tales of the French nobles who fled France during the early days of the French Revolution. When Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were arrested during their attempt to flee France in June 1791, Austria and Prussia decided it was time to act, producing the Pillnitz Declaration</p>

<p>Fitcorp was founded in 1979, with the establishment of its first fitness center in the heart of Boston’s Financial District. Founder and President Gary Klencheski set the goal to provide Boston-area companies with a fitness benefit designed to positively impact businesses and their employees. From improving company morale to enhancing the health status of workers, Fitcorp was Boston’s first organization to provide fitness and health promotion programs as an integrated component of a company’s overall employee benefits package. Today, Fitcorp is one of America's largest and most experienced providers of fitness and worksite wellness services. From that first single location, Fitcorp has grown into a network of fitness centers that are open to the public through which serve over 175 corporate clients and nearly 15,000 members. Additionally, Fitcorp manages over twenty private centers located within corporations and organizations. At both its public and private centers, Fitcorp remains focused on providing high quality fitness and worksite wellness services delivered by the industry's finest professionals. Fitcorp, over the years, has received numerous industry and business awards. In 1991, Club Industry named Fitcorp one of the top five health clubs in the United States; in 1992, Fitcorp received the International Award of Merit from the Association for Worksite Health Promotion; and in 1993, Fitcorp received the Tufts Associated Health Plan 10K Award as the top-rated corporate wellness program in Massachusetts. Fitcorp was a 1996 finalist in the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce’s Small Business of the Year award and was recognized as one of the “top small companies in America to work for” by Inc. Magazine. More recently, Fitcorp was voted the best fitness club by Boston Magazine and received the Readers Choice award from the Boston Tab.</p>
