<li>Comment. It isn't so much mathematics of the quran, but mathematics of the quran according to a small sect of islam, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Submitters_International_a69f.html" title="United Submitters International">United Submitters International</a>, a break-off sect of <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an_alone.html#Dissident_Submitters" title="Qur'an alone">Qur'an alone#Dissident Submitters</a> and some individuals who agree with it. The majority of muslims and non-muslims don't see what they see because of inconsistent counts, etc. There might be some counts of nineteen that are accurate, but to most they are not <i>significant.</i> <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 18:00, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>If you guys are so determined to delete this article please go ahead..I don't care.. The IP edit 202.69.193.66 is my friends and we use the same internet connection as we work in the same office. Our effort was not to promote anything but to share our knowledege on the subject matter. As we have come to understand that there are too many opinionated Admins and users. I cant be bothered to fight all these people to share my knowledge. (<a href="../../../a/r/s/User%7EArsath_05ad.html" title="User:Arsath">Mystic</a> 08:40, 24 February 2006 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>If you want it to stay, you should work on it. The second section doesn't follow from the first. What does a count of 24 occurrences of the word Rejul/Man have to do with 19? Why is it significant (should we count how many times "man" is used in every book?). Also, were the arabic words counted, or were the english words counted? A translation might use the word man for more words than just rejul, and might sometimes translate rejul as something other than man. Additionally, the translations sometimes add words that aren't in the arabic because they are somehow implied by the other words, which they'll put in (parenthesis). <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 22:50, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If we decide to keep the article, does anyone know of a verifiable source for the numbers? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 06:55, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Hey The Ringess why dont you read the quran and verify for your self.. (<a href="../../../a/r/s/User%7EArsath_05ad.html" title="User:Arsath">Mystic</a> 10:44, 26 February 2006 (UTC))
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> Perhaps I could have phrased my question better, because either I'm projecting or you seem to have taken my comment in the wrong way. Unfortunately, I cannot verify for myself. I do not speak Arabic. As far as English translations go I have only read bits and pieces. A quote comes to mind: <i>The heart of the believer is the highest heaven</i>. I cannot remember whether that's from the quran or one of the poems of Hafiz or Rumi. I have read several volumes of English translations of Hafiz and several dozen by Rumi. I find both men's stories fascinating and love the poetry. That is neither here nor there though. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 12:24, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Clarification</b>. I feel that most if not all of the references are to primary sources, such as the Koran/Quran, and as such it appears to violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. However, I have revised to a weak delete after some consideration. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 14:34, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not opposed to a merge or slight merge either. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 14:35, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My Dear Friends can we clean this up please.. I guarantee you all that this article will grow fast with more resourceful references. Have we finished voting? (or does it go on forever? Can you please tell me I am new to wikipedia) my opinion is some of the earlier votes cannot be counted. Because as you can see the article has changed quiet significantly (or completely) since it was voted for deletion. I accept the fact that initially the article did not have any references or proper structure. But now it has changed. So all of you who voted before 26th feb 2006 can you kindly reconsider your votes. (<a href="../../../a/r/s/User%7EArsath_05ad.html" title="User:Arsath">Mystic</a> 03:30, 1 March 2006 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>All the above counts, people don't have to change them unless they feel changes to the page warrant it. It isn't over until an admin closes it. I think if the page remains it should be renamed. I deleted a disinguous quote that was added suggesting <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Gardner_3269.html" title="Martin Gardner">Martin Gardner</a> was impressed by the claims, which was decidedly untrue; see my talk page for more. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 03:52, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
