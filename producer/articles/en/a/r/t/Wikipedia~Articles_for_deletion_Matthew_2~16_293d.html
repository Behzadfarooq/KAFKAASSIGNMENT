<li>I note that that one was simply a quote without any analysis.

<ul>
<li>There are currently 16 different articles for the first 16 verses of Matt. 2. If these are all allowed to remain, this means that articles analyzing every single verse in the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> would be allowed. That would easily be thousands of articles for Bible verses alone. And then people would be doing the same analyses on verses in the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Koran.html" title="Koran">Koran</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Mormon_f6c8.html" title="Book of Mormon">Book of Mormon</a>, and so forth. This would cause havoc.

<li><b>Keep</b> Articles on individual verses of the Bible are quite acceptable. Much can be/has been written and said about individual verses, enough to create an article for many of them. Quite possible to create rich annotated articles for most passages in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>. -- <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDecumanus_9e44.html" title="User:Decumanus">Decumanus</a> 04:01, 2005 May 21 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki and Redirect.</b> Isn't this part of the Wikipedia project just a verse-by-verse annotated copy of two public domain translations of the bible? Wikibooks takes annotated works. Leave the redirect as a interproject navigation aid for those who don't know of Wikibooks. The use of the exact same two references on so many verses gives me a copyvio scare, though. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused">Unfocused</a> 04:45, 21 May 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Both versions of the bible, YES, both books used to annotate? NO. I think the annotations may be copyvio, not the bible verses. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused">Unfocused</a> 18:59, 21 May 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>There was no accusation. I said copyvio <b>scare</b>. I did not claim that there is a copyvio, but I am by nature cautious. When I next make a trip to the library, I will check to see if these titles are available to compare. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused">Unfocused</a> 00:34, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Extreme Keep</b>, and I don't do "extreme keeps" often. Some of these articles on individual Bible verses are amazing -- they cite great works of scholarship and really understand the text well. Having articles on individual Bible verses or individual <a href="../../../a/y/a/Ayat.html" title="Ayat">Ayat</a> from the Qur'an would "cause havoc?" That's so wrongheaded that I don't even know where to start! Just a simple quote of a verse should be deleted, but if you read this article, you'll see that it deals with scholarship and really gives the reader an understanding of the context. Articles like these are what make Wikipedia great. --<a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZantastik_9813.html" title="User:Zantastik">Zantastik</a> 06:18, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Matthew_4c10.html" title="Book of Matthew">Book of Matthew</a> or <b>delete</b>.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: scholarly commentary on a work of literature dominating Western civilization for the last couple of thousand years is a more valid subject than Pokemon monsters, fictional kings from Tolkien, or Klingon warships, all of which are much more likely to be forgotten and have lost any relevance to people a 100 years from now than the Bible. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 07:31, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> informative and interesting. As long as the articles on individual verses have this level of information, I see absolutely no reason why they shouldn't be kept. There is too much for them all to be merged into articles on books, and most of the time too much even for articles on chapters. Articles go well beyond quotes. Wikipedia is not paper. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> 07:33, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>- In my opinion, a complete article, as opposed to a simple reproduction of a verse in Bible, should qualify for a Keep. This applies to similar other works of same importance. I think that the possible number of articles arising out of this shall not deluge wikipedia, rather it will increase its worth. Verses in religious texts like the Bible and others comparable to the Bible are finte, say few thousand. On the other hand, just to take an example, there are 45000 asterioids in our solar system - out of which about 3000 merit attention. There are trillions of other celestial objects, and they are being discovered each day - an article on each one of the important discovery shall surely appear in wikipedia, but articles on Bible verses shall remain limited, as new verses cannot be invented or discovered. Please keep the article so that one who knows little about the significance of any particular verse of the Bible may come to wikipedia to understand the matter. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 18:41, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>-- There are multiple problems here. First, while the scholarship on the verse is fine by me, the article is lodged at a verse name, where it will never, ever be sought. This allows for someone with a POV interpretation of scriptures to use this, essentially, as reinforcement by being the only one to like to <a href="../../../1/6/_/Matthew_2%7E16.html" title="Matthew 2:16">Matthew 2:16</a> instead of [[Book of Matthew]] 2:16. If there is a Wikigloss project, this belongs there, but not in name space. The scholarship should be at <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacre_of_the_Innocents_aac6.html" title="Massacre of the Innocents">Massacre of the Innocents</a>, and I have a sinking feeling that, in fact, it came from there as the product of an edit war. Regardless, it can't stay as it is. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:48, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>But if you search for <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Matthew_4c10.html" title="Book of Matthew">Book of Matthew</a>, there are links to each of the chapters of the book, which in turn leads to links to the verses. Saying that it will never, ever be sought as simply <a href="../../../1/6/_/Matthew_2%7E16.html" title="Matthew 2:16">Matthew 2:16</a> is dubious, but even assuming you are correct, a searcher could find the article in the way I've described. If someone uses it in a POV way, we should change what they write to make it NPOV, but the possibility of someone using it improperly is not a reason to delete this article in the first place. - <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko">Jersyko</a> 15:17, May 22, 2005 (UTC)</li>
