<p>Page nominated previously, but critical corrections have not been made. Page is now 60K of original research, violating <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, without a single citation. Much of the content appears to be fancruft and notable messiahs-in-fiction are better served by having it in the individual articles, rather than this long list. <a href="../../../j/r/p/User%7EJrp_d96f.html" title="User:Jrp">JRP</a> 04:00, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom and <b>Move to <a href="../../../b/j/a/BJAODN_feba.html" title="BJAODN">BJAODN</a></b>. Messiahspeculationcruft / OR list. An appropriate list could be created (better to knock the current version down completely and restart though) if a <i>very particular definition</i> of "messiah" was used that could prevent the mishmash of vague OR speculations here. As it is, we have no <i><a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_of_Brian_e306.html" title="Life of Brian">Life of Brian</a></i> - a highly notable and famous comedy about someone whose literal Messiah status-or-not is the whole point of the plot - on the list but we do have a whole bunch of vague musings about video game and anime plots which fit in the excessively broad "single protagonist who is expected to save the world and has special powers - kind of like Jesus!" category (this sounds like the majority of video games out there...) rather than messiahs as such. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:56, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Some of these entries appear to have been made by people who have no idea what messiah means at all e.g.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiahs_in_fiction#Command_.26_Conquer" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiahs_in_fiction#Command_.26_Conquer" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (and don't get me started on the ridiculous entries like the ones comparing the <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samurai_Jack_b751.html" title="Samurai Jack">Samurai Jack</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/g/Lego.html" title="Lego">Lego</a> <a href="../../../b/i/o/BIONICLE_d9b0.html" title="BIONICLE">BIONICLE</a> characters to Jesus Christ?

<p>This "list" does seem redundant, as all Messiah characters would theoretically already be categorized by Category:Fictional messiahs and could therefore be found easily. But I'd vote yes to a strictly-defined LIST, without any descriptions (thereby discouraging all the blather) <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETAnthony_9e0c.html" title="User:TAnthony">TAnthony</a> 06:29, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep and cleanup.</b> I get the general impression from recent AfDs that articles of the form "(motif/device/archtype/whatever) in fiction" are considered unencylopedic. Or that they are required to be part of a heirarchy under the works that use them rather than being top-level articles of their own that use individual works as examples. Is there really is consensus on that, or are recent deleted articles along these lines special cases somehow?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This article in specific is in bad shape. It is a big list of examples with little explanation of how they are all tied together. It is in need of sourcing. But these are usually not sufficent for deletion on their own. Cleaned up, this seems like the sort of article that should exist on Wikipedia, unless there's some reason to believe that no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> can be found to back it up. That seems unlikely--don't most universities have entire departments dedicated to the art of fiction? <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBCoates_04d2.html" title="User:BCoates">BCoates</a> 09:29, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and tag for cleanup</b> per above. The topic is good, and the examples are good. The article just needs some massaging and de-POVing. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 20:03, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, tag for cleanup, tag as OR if you must. If somebody was too lazy to add proper references, it's not a reason for deletion. Laziness of the original editor is not an excuse to destroy informative, interesting article. Or is it. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValters_f0ad.html" title="User:Valters">Valters</a> 20:26, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b>, definition of messiah is blatant original theorising and <b>completely contradicted</b> by the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messiah.html" title="Messiah">messiah</a> article, which states categorically that a messiah is one who is annointed by <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>. Looking at the list, only <a href="../../../a/s/l/Aslan.html" title="Aslan">Aslan</a> comes close to this. --<strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas"><font color="blue">Nydas</font></a></strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User_talk%7ENydas_f93e.html" title="User talk:Nydas"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk)</sup></font></a> 20:57, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - the messiah article does actually say it's used to describe a 'saviour or liberator' - although this raises the question of why the article isn't named Saviours in fiction. Nonetheless, this article is essentially a collection of personal musings more suitable for blogs, forums or personal websites.--<strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas"><font color="blue">Nydas</font></a></strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User_talk%7ENydas_f93e.html" title="User talk:Nydas"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk)</sup></font></a> 21:05, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> as unmanageable OR listcruft. The problem is that there is no solid qualification for being Messiahistic. As a result basically every main character in videogames and shows who saves the world from evil can (and from the looks of things, has) be added to that list. I was about to say create a Category:Fictional messiahs if a standard can be set for what qualifies as a Messiah, not just "they saved the world" when I found out one already exists. That makes this page redundant. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKoweja_a591.html" title="User:Koweja">Koweja</a> 21:01, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Overabundance of people that have died and resurrected and a lack of actual messiahs make this article craptastic at it stands. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 23:08, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, crufty and speculative. I also agree with Nydas that messiah definition in this article is too far from classical. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxSem_bf93.html" title="User:MaxSem">Max<font size="+1"><i>S</i></font>em</a> 06:16, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, I've been trying, but outside of individual <i>fan readings</i> of the films, games, etc. themselves there are very very few characters that have external, <b>reputable</b>, sources that make this comparison. <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> is one, but that's the only one on this list that I can find. I think many of these could be categorized as Category:Fictional characters who have returned from the dead and Category:Fictional characters who have saved the world, neither of which are speculative (nor encyclopedic, but that can be decided in a CFD down the way). Being a "chosen one" is such a common fictional conceit that it's hardly worth making a list of. <a href="../../../j/r/p/User%7EJrp_d96f.html" title="User:Jrp">JRP</a> 10:47, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Probably an encyclopedic topic, but this is idiosyncratic DIY <a href="../../../e/x/e/Exegesis.html" title="Exegesis">exegesis</a> and thus textbook original research. An article like this needs secondary sources, and this doesn't have any. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 12:36, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b>. This article is so crufty, it's insalvageable. Since so many others have provide reasons to delete for me, I'm going to debunk some of the arguments of the "keep" votes:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>There may be reliable sources.
<dl>
<dd>Actually, aside from blogger rants, there are no reliable sources about this topic, emphasis on reliable.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>"There's a lot of nonsense and OR here, but..."
<dl>
<dd>These are actually reasons to delete (see CSD:A1 and NOR)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>"...the page is interesting and potentially useful"
<dl>
<dd>Useful for what? An argument with your friend about why Sailor Moon is stronger than Buffy the Vampire Slayer? Also, "interesting" is not a reason for having an article.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>"topic is good... examples are good"
<dl>
<dd>How so? Potentially every single being in fiction could be included in this list since saving the world seems to qualify someone as being a messiah. That would make this the longest page on Wikipedia with rampant OR and POV.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>"if it's good enough for a category it's good enough for a list"
<dl>
<dd>Apparently not. See <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_December_7_56bd.html#Category:Fictional_messiahs" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 December 7">Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 December 7#Category:Fictional messiahs</a>. Besides, that argument makes no sense. If it has a category, then a list would be redundant anyway.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Well, I think that's it. Oh yeah, last thing, the article is so POV it makes my eyes bleed. Just thought you'd like to know. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 21:41, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>strong Keep</b></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>First of all, it is a compilation and not OR, being obviously based on the descriptions of the books given in WP, with links provided. Links are documentation. The events in the book are documentation. It would be possile to do a much more scholarly version, but I don't think it would add much here. The citations to such discussions should be at the original articles, not here.</li>
<li>It brings useful material together, and is therefore notable</li>
<li>I cannot perceive any POV whatsoever--the heros are diverse, and the readers are obviously expected to form their own opinions from the material presented, which is just what an encyclopedia should do. Of the works I know, I consider some of the instances very clear, some more remotes, and Iannticipate a good deal of interest in adding others, as it is one of the great themes in story-telling.<a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 01:13, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I'd just like to point out to you that interpreting characters as messiahs "based on [their] descriptions [in] the books" is the very definition of original research. I don't see how being a "compilation" has anything to do with the fact that it's original research. Also, being useful does not equal being notable. My shoes are useful. They keep my feet dry in the rain, but I'm not going to write a Wikipedia article about them. Finally, are my eyes bleeding? Yes, they are. Therefore, the article must be POV. In all seriousness, if you can't see the inherent POV of calling someone a messiah when you're not God (who seems to be the only person who can anoint messiahs), then I suggest you reread <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. On second look, no one seems to have mentioned that this article is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> so I'd just like to throw that into the mix. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 04:27, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
