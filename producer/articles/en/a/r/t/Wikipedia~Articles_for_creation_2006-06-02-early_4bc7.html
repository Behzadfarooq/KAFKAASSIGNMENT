In recent years its GCSE rates have slipped below the national average ,and it is subsequently in the lower ranks of the local league tables.

<p>The "Snaps Guys" are a group of 12 friends from many walks of life, all of whom hail from Chicago. Their nome de guere was acquired in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Haven%2C_Michigan_c7a2.html" title="South Haven, Michigan">South Haven, Michigan</a>, aboard The Idler riverboat in 1995 after amazing the customers of the bar with the snaps game. They return to The Idler every second weekend of June to decompress from their gruling lives, consume loads of rum cocktails and Bell's beer, and of course, to wow the crowd with the snaps game. They fly into <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Haven%2C_Michigan_c7a2.html" title="South Haven, Michigan">South Haven, Michigan</a> from six different states and are all quite handsome. While hailing from elsewhere, they have become the adopted sons of South Haven and The Idler, having put many of its young waitresses through college thanks to their outlandish bar tabs, and even more ridiculous tipping. Stop in to see them for yourself during the second weekend of June and prepare to be amazed and aroused!</p>

<p>The snaps game is a seemingly mystical and magical game perfected by the Snaps Guys. You, the unseeming bar patron need only whisper the name of a celebrity into the ear of one of the Snaps Guys, and by merely snapping his fingers a few times, the others will guess the name of that celebrity. If you think that's impressive, our you think you've figured out how the game works, try whispering the name of your dad! Or a band! Or a movie! Or some word you just made up!!!! The snaps game can be viewed live aboard The Idler riverboat in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Haven%2C_Michigan_c7a2.html" title="South Haven, Michigan">South Haven, Michigan</a> during the second weekend of June every year.

<p>The BRR (Bit Rate Reduction) Compression Format is a widely used <a href="../../../d/a/t/Data_Compression_a660.html" title="Data Compression">Data Compression</a> technique that is widely used today in many file formats. The most commonly used applications are in the <a href="../../../m/p/e/MPEG-1_d5f4.html" title="MPEG-1">MPEG-1</a>, <a href="../../../m/p/e/MPEG-2_353d.html" title="MPEG-2">MPEG-2</a>, and <a href="../../../j/p/e/JPEG_907e.html" title="JPEG">JPEG</a> formats, or mostly any Audio/Video media.</p>
<p>Essentially, when a program uses BRR to compress data, the file being compressed is analyzed and all the redundant (If you're creating <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lossless.html" title="Lossless">lossless</a> formats) or reappearing (Mostly for <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lossy.html" title="Lossy">lossy</a> formats) data is removed to a certain degree, so as not to completely obscure the original data.</p>
<p>This was a great thing for the era when <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> first began to really boom in popularity, as TV companies could compress video, which was normally very large by broadcasting standards, and send it across their networks much more easily and efficient. This lead to a new generation of compression technology, and remains rooted deep within many compression standards to this day.</p>
<p>Other applications that use the BRR format includes the <a href="../../../s/n/e/SNES_f6df.html" title="SNES">SNES</a> <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gaming_console.html" title="Gaming console">gaming console</a>, which it's <a href="../../../c/o/-/Co-processor.html" title="Co-processor">co-processor</a> named the "SPC-700" utilized. However, it does not use a specific file format. The data is sent through the SPC-700 as a form of "raw data" that has been compressed in BRR format. This was due to the many limitations the SPC-700 had in terms of <a href="../../../r/a/m/RAM_e536.html" title="RAM">RAM</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/v/Wavelength.html" title="Wavelength">wavelength</a> capabilities.</p>

The <i>Operationszone Adriatisches Küstenland</i>, comprising the provinces of Udine, Görz, Trieste, Pola, Rijeka, Kvarner and Laibach, was established on the same day. Both operation zones formally belonged to the <i>Repubblica Sociale Italiana</i> (RSI, Italian Social Republic), which governed those areas of Italy administered from Salò at Lake Garda and not yet contended for by the Allies. The Italian influence was resisted and dismantled by the Germans, who decreed the restoration of the provincial borders of 1919, and forced the resignation of the Italian mayors (Podestà) who were replaced by German-speaking mayors recruited from the local population identified with the Third Reich ("<i>Optanten</i>"). In South Tyrol the Italian names of streets and localities were replaced by German names or returned to former German names. The effect was a rapid and draconian reversal of the stringent policy of Italianization which had been imposed on the region by the Italian government beginning in the early 1920s.</p>
<p>The Operationszone was administered by High Commissioner Franz Hofer, who banned political parties and disenfranchised Italian administration in the region, replacing it with "suitable representatives of the German group of peoples." Military units in the region came under the <i>Befehlshaber Operationszone Alpenvorland</i> commanded by <i>General der Infanterie</i> Joachim Witthöft.</p>
<p>Primary enforcement of German regulations was performed by the SOD (<i>Südtiroler Ordnungsdienst</i> or South Tyrol civil police), which had been recruited from the ADO (<i>Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Optanten für Deutschland</i> or Labor Union of Those Choosing Germany). The SOD was also actively involved in the pursuit of the Jews and the well-known “<i>Dableiber</i>” (those who had chosen Italy when they were compelled to declare their allegiance), like Michael Gamper, Friedl Volgger, Rudolf Posch and Josef Ferrari. Many of the <i>Dableiber</i> were current or former Catholic priests and were persecuted by the Germans.</p>

<p>Benjamin Grandy, more commonly known as Ben, is a man that currently resides in Sacramento, California, and attends Rio Americano High School. He is entering his senior year at rio, putting him into the graduating class of 2007.<br />
<br />
Ben is often considered a creationist of sorts. He often expresses his own individuality through means of his own. Such forms of expression include photography, musical expression, and individual writing. Though he is not yet an author, he aspires to be one and continues to learn based on the inspirational writing of such people as Brian Greene. In all, Benjamin can be sumed as a man whose capacity to learn is limitless and inspirational visions know no boundries.</p>
<p>He is known to use a computer with the IP address 66.205.132.156 to post vanity entries to Wikipedia, although many choose to excuse this behavior, citing his admiration for the comedy troupe Stella, which can do no wrong.</p>

'Savi0r' has released two cds in Sacramento, one titled "Defection Droid" consisting of 15 powernoise tracks, and 2 years later his latest cd titled "Futures End" consisting of 10 electro-industrial tracks was released. 'Futures End' prooved more crowd pleasing than 'Defection Droid', and has been played in clubs across the Sacramento area. Savi0r is currently working on a new album (no album title at this time) hopefully to be completed within the next year.</p>

<p>These four guys from Durban, South African have been pumping out a spine chilling breed of positive and progressive energetic hardcore since 1998. They are the countries first and longest running hardcore band. Today the band are best described as playing a brutal synthesis of metal and hardcore with a positive, relevant message. They're not making music to be famous, or because it's a good career, they're making music because they need to, because it's etched somewhere deep in their souls.</p>
<p>In a world where heavy music is slowly being embraced by a wider audience, many bands have watered down their message to suit the listener. Where it used to be about an uncompromising message in response to societal problems, these days it seems to mostly be about the sound, with any sort of message being secondary. Crossingpoint have stayed true to their roots by playing creative, energy-driven music with a message that demands application. It's hard to go to a crossingpoint show and leave unchanged. Whether you're screaming your lungs out with the band or following their lyrics on their lyric sheets handed out before each show, theirs is a power and a passion that few bands consistently achieve.</p>
<p>Crossingpoint recorded &amp; released their self-titled album independently in october 2004. All stops have been pulled out in terms of its recording, production and presentation. In what is a first for a South African band, it comes as an eye catching 6 panel 'digipak' package!</p>
<p>Real change happens in the minds and hearts of individuals who can go on to affect others. Crossingpoint's urgent and honest message deals with issues such as sexism, loyalty and personal responsibility, and is aimed at reaching the individual in a thoughtful and inspiring way.</p>

<p>Taz Incorporated was established in 2006 as a Political activist party in Australia. They stand beside the Australian Labor Party on most policies but skew away on technological policies. Taz Inc. are very much a modern party and believe that modernism and technology are the ways of the future. Taz Sessel, the current leader of Taz Inc. has always stood strong for what he believes and since the establishment of Taz Inc. he has dedicated his life to the party.</p>
<p>Taz Inc. today stands for much more than a political party. Some even consider Taz Inc. a religion which in a recent survey shows that the number of Taz believers in Australia has passed Jedism. Taz Inc. also stands as a business incorporation that provides investment strategies for people with high incomes and lots of money. Taz Inc. guarantees a 15% interest rate on your investment with a 5% commission where all profits are reinvested into the company itself.</p>

The St. Augustine's Tour is an annual event that has been in place since 1962. Held between sister schools <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villanova_College_03e7.html" title="Villanova College">Villanova College</a> Coorparoo (Brisbane), and <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Augustine%27s_College%2C_Brookvale_b823.html" title="St. Augustine's College, Brookvale">St. Augustine's College, Brookvale</a> (Sydney). The tour is hosted at each school annually, and requires approximently 60+ students, ussually from years 11 and 12, to travel from the guest school to the host school to compete in Rugby, Soccer, Debating and Basketball. Being that the schools are from differing states, the levels and rules of competition slightly vary, and thus the tour opens both schools up to competition they do not ussually encounter. Each competition is named after an ex-principle of one of the schools, or a person of significant importance to the Augustinian heritage shared by the schools.</p>

<p><b>Jean Rigaud</b> is a well-listed French artist. He was born on June 15, 1912 in Bordeaux, France to the well-known painter, Pierre Gaston Rigaud (1874-1949). The Rigauds moved to the village of Guyenne in 1914, shortly after World War I began. It was during this time that Jean Rigaud received his first formal training under his father, Pierre Gaston, who was also a well-respected teacher. During this time, Jean was encouraged to develop his own style and talents, which utilized “pure color tones (ochres, yellows and red cadmium) which [stood] out triumphantly against… grey skies.”<b>[1]</b></p>
<p>In 1925 Jean Rigaud was invited to exhibit his works at the Salon d’Art Ancien Espagnol in Paris, where he became a regular. Jean also continued his formal education at l’Ecole de Beaux-Arts in Paris at the Atelier Andre Dewambez. While at Atelier, Jean Rigaud began to develop his unique impressionistic style and techniques. He also began painting marine subjects for which he became known. However, this did not mean that he did not paint other scenes. As “a painter of instinct,” who focused on scenery, villages and abodes were not out of the realm. Examples of these works include “Tolede: Contre Jour” a 28 ¾” x 19 ¾” oil on canvas painting and “Ker Guerin, Ile d’Yey.” However according to a brief biography by Banks Fine Art, Rigaud “saved little room for precise depictions of the human figure in his works.”</p>
<p>From 1938 to 1976, Jean Rigaud participated in 53 one-man exhibitions, including at The Galerie Durand Ruel in which he was featured every other year from 1956 to 1974. Furthermore, as a tribute, The Galerie Durand Ruel featured Rigaud’s work in their final exhibition as a “Grand Finale.”</p>
<p>During his lifetime, Jean Rigaud was invited to exhibit his work at all of the leading Paris Salons, which included the Societe Nationale de Beaux-Arts, Salon de Comparisons, Salon du Dessin et de la Pentine a le’au and the Salon de is Marine. Rigaud also exhibited his works in Casablanca, New York, and Strasbourg. He also received a Gold Medal at The International Exhibition in Paris in 1937, the Prize of Messageries Maritimes in 1952, the Prize of Maroco in 1953, and the Prize of Charles Cottet in 1957 as well as “Painter of the French Navy” honors in 1956.</p>
<p>Jean Rigaud’s works are featured in many private and public collections across the world. His paintings are also permanently exhibited at the National Museum in Paris, Musee de la Marine, Musee de Niort, Musee de Tours, Musee de Poitiers, Musee Mulhouse, Musee Chalet, Musee Pontoise, and Musee Strasbourg. Jean Rigaud is also well listed in over a dozen prestigious books on art.</p>
<p>Jean Rigaud died in 1999 at his island home just off the coast of France, and immediately after his passing, the Musee de la Marines mounted a one-man retrospective of his work, which was met with great critical acclaim. ”Jean Rigaud is placed without doubt in the great tradition of realist and impressionist painters.”<b>[2]</b></p>

<p>This working Georgian flour mill is located on the River Dour in the village of River, on the outskirts of Dover, Kent. The existing building was erected in 1812 on the site of an existing mill and continued working until around 1895, after which it was just used for storage. It was rescued from demolition in 1973 and partially restored and opened periodically to the public. The Crabble Corn Mill Trust was formed in 1987 and took ownership of the Mill in 1988. Major renovation and restoration work was completed and Crabble Corn Mill opened to the public in 1990.</p>
<p>Records indicate that there has been a water-driven mill at Crabble since at least 1227, when Henry III granted a "Charter of Confirmation" to St. Radigund's Abbey. Although the structure is primarily Georgian the machinery within is Victorian and still, mostly, in working order. It is now a Grade II* listed building and considered to be the finest working watermill of its type in Europe.</p>

<p>WHAT IS A SUPER HEATED STEAM CLEAER? Quite simply it’s a machine that emits pure steam at a temperature that is higher than that of boiling water. This is achieved by sealing up the water in a boiler and boiling it. The steam that is give off has nowhere to go and thus creates a pressure in the boiler. The higher that the pressure is allowed to climb the higher the boiling point of the water becomes. Thus making the steam much hotter than the normal boiling point of water. The DUPLEX JET STEAM range of steam cleaners operate at about 1.5 times boiling point ie. 150deg C. and at those temperatures the pressure of the steam is over 60p.s.i. At that pressure the steam is expanded to approximately 2000 times the volume of the water, so that one litre of water has the ability to make 2000 litres of steam. This makes one tank of water on these machines last for over one and a half hours. HOW DOES A SUPER HEATED STEAM CLEANER WORK? This can be quite simply explained by looking at what you must do to water to make it clean anything. As you know water on its own is very poor at cleaning anything. We have to put detergent into it to help in breaking down the surface tension or “skin” on the water thus enabling it to penetrate and mix with the dirt. This makes it fairly effective at dispersing dirt. Not all the surface tension, however, is broken down and that is why large amounts of water are needed to cleaner relatively small amounts of dirt. SUPER HEATED STEAM, however, behaves exactly like a gas and has NO surface tension whatsoever thus breaking down dirt far more efficiently than even the most heavily detergent laced water. In the case of GREASE it is slightly different. Because of the lack of surface tension or “skin” with steam it penetrates the grease completely and forms an emulsion with the grease. When the grease has been emulsified it will wipe off leaving no residue behind whatsoever. SOME GENERAL WORDS ABOUT STEAM CLEANING</p>

<p>Slop-Core is a style of punk rock exclusive to the city of Rockford, Illinois. The term was coined by Jay Decay to describe a demo cd by The Hard Cocks, a local band from Rockford. It has become a mini-movement in the area, with other local bands such as The FNA's and The Transylvanian Honkies playing a slop-core style of music.</p>
<p>Style: The significant difference between today's punk rock bands and a slop-core band is the lack of musicianship. Slop-Core is played at a fast pace. Slop-core bands have also been known to not use a consistant drum line throughout a song, instead hitting different pieces of the drum kit at random, although at a consistant speed. Slop-Core guitarists usually don't use more than 4 chords. The Slop-Core style was first played by The Hard Cocks on a song titled "I Hate Relationships," which consisted of a 2 chord guitar riff, screaming, repetative vocals, and gibberish being sung in the background thoughout the song. The song is on the band's first demo, "The Titanic Sank."</p>

<p>Bencher is the name given to a member of the governing body (the Bench) of one of the four Inns of Court in London, of the Inn of Court of Northern Ireland and of King's Inns, Dublin. Benchers are also known as Masters of the Bench. They have the authority to admit students to the membership of the Inn, and, subject to modern regulatory statutes, to authorise the call to the Bar of a student who has met the relevant educational requirements. In the Middle Temple, standing orders require that all Benchers refer to one another, in the context of the business of the Inn, as "Master". This title should not be confused with the title of the minister of the Temple Church, the Master of the Temple, who is an ordained clergyman of the Church of England, appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Benchers of the Inner and Middle Temple.</p>

<p>Under the constitution adopted on June 28, 1992, Estonia has a parliamentary system of government, with a prime minister as chief executive. Parliament also elects a president, whose duties are largely ceremonial, although the first holder of this office, Lennart Meri, sought to assert his independence. The constitution also governs the work of a legal chancellor, an auditor general, and the National Court.</p>
<p>The constitution opens with a set of general provisions and a forty-eight-article section establishing the fundamental rights, liberties, and duties of citizens. Freedom of expression and assembly, freedom of information, the right to petition the courts, and the right to health care are all guaranteed. Censorship and discrimination on the basis of nationality, gender, religion, or political belief are forbidden. The official language of Estonia is Estonian. However, in deference to heavily Russian areas of northeastern Estonia, the constitution allows for the use of other languages in local government where the majority of the population is non-Estonian. Article 9 of the constitution guarantees equal constitutional rights to both citizens and noncitizens living in Estonia. Noncitizen permanent residents are also allowed to vote in local elections. Noncitizens may not, however, join political parties or hold elected office.</p>
<p>The Riigikogu (State Assembly), which replaced the transitional Supreme Council in 1992, has 101 members, who are chosen every four years by popular election. Members must be at least twenty-one years old. Each member may belong to only one committee. The president of the republic is elected to a five-year term by a two-thirds majority of the Riigikogu. The president nominates the prime minister, who must receive a vote of confidence from the Riigikogu. The Riigikogu passes legislation as well as votes of no confidence in the government. The president can dissolve parliament if there is a prolonged delay in the nomination of a prime minister or in the adoption of a state budget, or after a vote of no confidence in the government.</p>
<p>The president promulgates all laws after their adoption by the Riigikogu. However, he or she may also refuse to promulgate (i.e., veto) a law and send it back to the Riigikogu for reconsideration. If the Riigikogu passes the same law again by a simple majority, the president's veto is overridden. In 1993 President Meri vetoed seven laws, most of which were later modified by the Riigikogu. An early string of vetoes in the spring of 1993 especially angered members of the government coalition in parliament who had helped to elect him. Meri declared it his obligation, however, to protect the balance of power in government. His involvement was particularly critical during the domestic and international crisis surrounding Estonia's Law on Aliens.</p>
<p>The legal chancellor is appointed by the Riigikogu to a seven-year term and provides guidance concerning the constitutionality of laws. This official has no powers of adjudication but can issue opinions and propose amendments. Both the legal chancellor and the president may appeal to a special committee of the National Court for a binding decision on any law, national or local, that they consider unconstitutional. The court system comprises rural and city, as well as administrative, courts (first-level); district courts (second-level); and the National Court, the highest court in the land. Criminal justice is administered by local first-level courts as well as by second-level appellate courts. Final appeal may be made to the National Court, which sits in Tartu.</p>
<p>Central government policy at the regional level is carried out by the administrations of Estonia's fifteen counties (maakonnad ). These counties are further subdivided into 255 local administrative units, of which forty-two are towns and 213 are townships (vald ). Local councils are elected for a three-year term by permanent residents of the towns and townships</p>

<p>Proposed definition for "Planet"</p>
<p>Planet: Any material body that exhibits ALL of the following characteristics.</p>
<p>1. Too small to fuse Deuterium under self-gravity.</p>
<p>2. Spherical under self-gravity in the absence of an annual freeze-thaw cycle (as modified by rotational effects and recent impact history).</p>
<p>3. Uniformly differentiated (as modified by rotational effects and recent impact history).</p>
<p>4. Any baricenter is outside any co-orbital, non-stellar object.</p>
<p>All values shall permit of small non-uniformities. Earth is a planet even though the surface layer (oceans and continents) is not uniformly differentiated, but if the crust is included to a deeper depth it becomes more so.</p>
<p>The first defines the high end. The second two define the low end. The fourth distinguishes between a planet and a moon.</p>
<p>This definition does not require that a planet orbit a star. Rogue planets are permitted.</p>

Agents increase your agent skill.</p>
<p>Credits With the credits you produce every turn you can go to the merchant and trade it for metal, wood or stone. with these recources you can buy assault weapons or defence Items from the arsenal to increase your attack or defence skill, buy upgrades to your constructions, upgrade your agent training or upgrade your Advertising.</p>
<p>Constructions you can upgrade you fortification, do offensive upgrades or upgrade your credit production. your fortification will add a percentage bonus to your defence depending on the level of the fort. offensive upgrades will add a percentage bonus to your attack depending on which upgrade you bought. and by upgrading your credit production you increase the amount of credits each miner produces each turn.</p>

<p>The Grog bowl serves as the central point of ceremony for certain military functions, most notably the dining in. The grog bowl usually sits besides or opposite the head table. At the closing of the receiving line, but before the formal toast have been given, the grog bowl is filled in a ceremony known as the ceremony of the charges. Selected personnel, usually key leaders and senior non-commission officers, will each present a large pitcher of mixed substance called a charge. Each charge is unique in it’s color and content, and a small speech is given with the presentation, telling of the importance of that color to the unit, the branch of service, tradition, or the country as a whole. Reviewed by the head table for approval, these charges usually contain extremely strong liquors as well as other mixed un-pleasantries such as</p>
<p>Hot sauce and other condiments Gun powder Chalk dust Axel grease Gun oil Spoiled milk Maple syrup Sardines Glue Pigs blood Baby food Cat food Toothpaste Aftershave Food coloring Etc.</p>
<p>Once all charges have been added to the grog bowl, the formal dinner begins. The now filled grog bowl is supervised by an individual known as Mr. (or Madam) Vice. At any time during the meal and entertainment that follows (with the singular exception of during a speech), any individual may stand at any time and call upon Mr. Vice, who may or may not recognize him. Once recognized, the challenging individual may make a point of order- bringing to the attention of the assembled body and Mr. Vice a discrepancy of another individual in the strict protocol of the evening. This discrepancy may range from improper wear of the uniform and appearance, to deviance from traditional rules governing the event, to a poor choice of conversation or something as miniscule as not using the proper cutlery for the current course. Mr. Vice then deliberates, and passes judgment with a penalty that usually involves the offending party taking and drinking a cup dredged from the grog bowl, but may entail anything he can come up with such as telling jokes, singing, or performing an impromptu dance.</p>

<p>Muckspreader Productions is an independent production company formed in 2003 by producer/director Mike Ward.</p>
<p>[potted history] Mike had noticed the lack of representation available to UK underground rock acts on newly emerging satellite rock music channels. A keen musician and fan of the UK extreme music scene, Mike used his connections within the television and postproduction industry to produce and direct a string of promo clips for bands. These promos were submitted and broadcast. Recently, the company has moved towards live multi-camera concert filming and has made a number of concert dvds.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the bands Muckspreader has worked with recently: The Dukes of Nothing Murder One Landmine Spring Orange Goblin Sikth Charger Keelhaul Mendeed Capricorns Beecher Pelican My Ruin Eden Maine &amp; Hate Eternal</p>
<p>The frenzied production values of the live shoots give the resulting videos an energetic quality, providing a fan's eye view of the concert. The use of four or five handheld cameras with one or two camera operators stationed within the pit or crowd makes for exhillerating footage. The is a unique look that only fans of the music could obtain.</p>

<p>History of Northwest Medical Center-Thief River Falls</p>
<pre>
 The History of the Medical Community in Thief River Falls
</pre>
<p>The following historical highlights of the medical community in Thief River Falls are just a portion of our rich history. We regret that we could not include all events and everyone that has played a roll in the history of Northwest Medical Center. Our hope is that you enjoy reading the information that we have presented to you.</p>
<p>In the late 1800's and early 1900's, before Thief River Falls had many established practices, doctors would come from Crookston and Grand Forks one day a week to care for any patients. Up until 1920. "traveling" doctors would also come to Thief River Falls. These doctors often set up someplace in town and stayed days or weeks and treated patients free of charge or for a small fee.</p>
<p>Dr. Doran, "America's most popular specialist", came to the city on the first Wednesday of almost every month in the early 1900`s, and was located at the Hotel Rushford for consultation at $1 per visit. A portion of his 1906 ad read: "Dr. Doran has no superior in diagnosing and treating disease and deformities. He treats all curable medical and surgical diseases, special diseases of the eye, ear, nose, and throat, lung disease, early consumption, diabetes, bladder, obesity, disease of the brain, pain in the bones, tumors, cancers . . . No incurable cases taken. "In 1915 Dr. Doran was still coming to Thief River Falls but was located at the Hotel Evelyn. He had now added the interesting regulation: "Married ladies must be accompanied by their husbands and minors with their parents."</p>
<p>Many ads were seen in the newspapers describing medicines and treatments for everything from sore eyes to dropsy. Many of these medicines were available at local druggists. Vapor baths seemed to cure almost everything. One such ad for stomach trouble read: "lf you are having trouble with your stomach, write for my SYMPTOM BLANK so that you can describe its action, then my HOME TREATMENT will be sent you, with what to eat and you will get better after taking the first dose."</p>
<p>The first medical doctor in Thief River Falls, Dr. Henry Grundy, came in 1892. Due to lack of space he set up his practice in the same building with the newspaper office, Stebbins Drug, and the C. J. Knox land office on Main Street. It was a jolly crowd. By 1895 Dr. Grundy had his own office in the Hotel Ogamah, located on the west side of LaBree Avenue, between First and Second Streets.</p>
<p>Dr. Grundy was the first health officer of the city. One of his notices posted in regard to spring cleaning read in the Thief River News, "All manure and garbage must be hauled out by May 1st. All dead animals must be buried. The dump ground is situated north of the sand pits behind the brush. Anyone convicted of dumping anyplace else so as to cause a nuisance will be fined according to law." Dr. Grundy also served as mayor of Thief River Falls for two years beginning in 1906. Dr. Grundy left in 1911, but was remembered as the man who built a modern business block on the north side of Third Street, just east of the alley between LaBree and Horace Avenues.</p>
<p>The second doctor to come to Thief River Falls, Dr. H. O. Gilbertson, had his practice well established on LaBree Avenue by 1895. His Scandinavian background was evident by his professional card which read:</p>
<p>H. O. Gilbertson, M. D. Saninavisk Laege Office-Love Apotek</p>
<p>In 1896 Dr. C. W. Merrill came to Thief River Falls and was located above the Polk County Bank. Dr. Merrill was elected the second health officer of the city by decision of the president of the city council after a 2-2 tie between Dr. Gilbertson and him.</p>
<p>On April 25, 1899, Dr. Henry Francis opened up his office in the Gilbertson building, north of H. Lewn's Store on LaBree Avenue. Dr. Francis had come from St. Hilaire, Minnesota, and was a member of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Ontario.</p>
<p>In 1901 Dr. George Tuppar, who had been a resident physician and surgeon at the Passport Hospital in Chicago for 16 months in 1899 and 1900, opened an office above the First State Bank. In 1906 Dr. Tuppar built a two-story building on Third Street, just east of the First National Bank, which was on the corner of Third Street and LaBree Avenue.</p>
<p>Dr. F. H. Gambell came to Thief River Falls in April of 1902 from Alaska, where for a number of years he had been in the service of the government. Dr. Gambell was a graduate of the medical department of the Univ. of Illinois. His office was located above the New Drug Store. In 1903 Dr. Gambell gave Thief River Falls' doctors a good reputation by spending a year studying surgery in one of the large hospitals in Chicago. In 1905 Dr. Gambell built a new office building and in 1912 had his offices over the First National Bank, of which he was one of the first directors. Dr. Gambell was active with the education in Thief River Falls, serving as a member of the board of education, and was also elected mayor in 1915.</p>
<p>In June of 1902 Dr. Peter L. Vistaunet, who immigrated from Norway in 1858 attended Concordia College Moorhead, MN, from 1895-98; and graduated from the college of Medicine and Surgery, Univ. of MN, in June of 1902; formed, a partnership with Dr. Tupper above the First State Bank and later formed his own clinic at 522 Red Lake Boulevard. Dr. Vistaunet was a member of the Red River Medical Society, American Medical Assn., and different orders.</p>
<p>In 1903, because of the arrival of many doctors to the city, Miss Boen, a missionary nurse, organized the first hospital of the city. It was named Bethany Hospital and was located at Dr. Vistaunet's Clinic at 522 Red Lake Boulevard. Dr. Vistaunet was the first doctor in the eight-bed hospital and Miss Boen was both the superintendent and the nursing staff. According to the Thief River Falls News-Press of October 14, 1915 Bethany was "called a hospital, but it was more where the sick and injured could be treated because of the meager equipment available."</p>
<p>Dr. Vistaunet moved his offices to the Evenson Block when 522 Red Lake Boulevard was made into a hospital. His clinic was equipped with the leacodescent lamp, oxoline machine, electric light-bath cabinet, electric vibrator, etc., for effective treatment of all disease and cure if a cure was possible. In the early 1900's this was quite up to date. An ad in June, 1912, read: "Do you know that a number of people from your city and vicinity as well as from far off . . . have been relieved or cured of their various ailments by the Modern Physical-Therapeutic Methods used at Dr. Vistaunet's Clinic." Dr. Vistaunet also served as city health officer in later years.</p>
<p>Dr. Oscar F. Mellby came to Thief River Falls in August of 1907, when he was 31 years old. He was born in New Richland, MN; graduated from St. Olaf College Northfield, MN; and in 1901 graduated from the College of Medicine and Surgery Univ. of MN. Dr. Mellby served a year of internship at Ancker Hospital in St. Paul, and then practiced for a short time in Willmar, and as an associate to a distant relative. Next he practiced in Warren, MN, for four years, substituting for Dr. Theodore Bratrud who was studying in Europe, and then in Argyle, MN, for one year, while Dr. H. C Stuhr was in Europe. When Dr. Mellby came to Thief River Falls he opened up offices in the Jackson and McGinn Block.</p>
<p>It was necessary for Dr. Mellby and the other early doctors to visit sick people by horse and buggy before there were hospitals in town. It was not uncommon to go a six hour drive to see a patient. Dr. Mellby's toughest experience was in January 1912. At 2:00 a.m. in 35 below zero weather he was called to sew together a man who had been in a fight 12 miles beyond Middle River. Dr. Mellby used plenty of robes and hot bricks and returned to his office late that day, where there was another emergency waiting for him on the east side of Thief Lake. It was 40 below zero but Doc went and didn't return until the next day. When he got back there was still another call waiting near Gatzke, not more than seven miles from the place he'd just been. The temperature was 45 below zero and Doc's spirits were just as low but nevertheless, the call was completed.</p>
<p>Besides being a well-known and respected doctor, and often one who did not get paid but was too good-hearted to demand payment, Dr. Mellby was an active leader in political and civic affairs. Dr. Mellby served on the school board from 1910 to 1921, was a member of the Civic and Commerce Association, and was part of a national guard unit. In 1923 Dr. Mellby was appointed by the governor to the State Board of Health. Also active in church affairs, Dr. Mellby was trustee of Trinity Lutheran Church and president of the board of deacons, President of the Northern Minnesota Lutheran Brotherhood, and was a member of the union committee which worked out amalgamation of Norwegian Lutheran denominations in Thief River Falls.</p>
<p>Dr. Mellby enjoyed outdoor sports such as hunting, fishing, and camping, and gave his leadership to the Boy Scouts. Dr. Mellby was honored on June 30, 1947, for 40 years of service to the community.</p>
<p>Dr. H. G. Hieber was a graduate of the medical department of Northwestern University in Chicago. In May, 1908, Dr. Hieber moved to Thief River Falls from Cedar Falls. Iowa. He was a member of the city board of health, served as city physician, and served as secretary of the County Committee.</p>
<p>Dr. J. C. R. Charest came to Thief River Falls in 1913 and opened offices above the First National Bank on the corner of Third Street and LaBree Avenue. In 1914 he moved his offices and residence to the Union Block.</p>
<p>Dr. J. E. Douglass was a graduate of the Univ. of MN and was located in St. Paul before coming to Thief River Falls in June of 1913, when he opened up offices in the McGinn building.</p>
<p>Dr. J. A. McCabe, an osteopathic physician who worked with bone therapy, came to Thief River Falls in 1913 and opened up offices in the Union Block over the Cooperative Store.</p>
<p>In November of 1914 Dr. H. W. Froelich, a graduate of Hamline University, came to Thief River Falls after being located at Crosby on the Cuyana Iron Range in Crow Wing County. He opened up offices in the Scandia Block. Dr. Froelich was an active civic leader. He served six years on the school board, three years its president; was a member of the Commercial Club, seven years its president; was a leader in Boy Scouts; served eight years as city health officer and twelve years as city coroner; and was elected president of the Red River Valley Medical Association twice.</p>
<p>On September 20, 1909, citizens called a meeting to discuss ways of establishing a modern hospital. Nothing became of the meeting. In June, 1912, the need of a hospital resulted in a second mass meeting. A hospital association was formed, and a decision was made to build a $25,000 facility. With the increase of physicians coming into the city, the Commercial Club of Thief River Falls submitted hospital plans for a "nonsectarian hospital, open to all physicians and surgeons and conducted as a municipal institution."</p>
<p>A hospital committee was formed and a campaign was started to raise hospital funds. There was a vast amount of interest. Most businesses gave a certain percent of their week's sales; and individuals, groups, and clubs contributed. There were benefit performances, donations, concerts, and basket socials.</p>
<p>Along with support, however, was opposition. This opposition caused the county commissioners to submit the following question for vote: "Shall the County of Pennington, in the State of Minnesota, erect a county hospital, with equipment, to be located at the city of Thief River Falls, at a cost, including equipment, not to exceed the cost of $50,000.</p>
<p>Once this was published the opposition became apparent, the three main areas being taxes, location, and economic considerations. Many editorials were written to reduce the opposition, but in the 1914 election, the "hottest election contest in years the hospital issue was defeated by less than one hundred votes.</p>
<p>The need for a hospital being great, the local doctors got together and incorporated the Physicians Hospital Company on February 16, 1915. The corporation was capitalized at $25,000, divided into 250 shares of $100. To finance the hospital Drs. Gambell, Hieber Douglass, Mellby, and Froelich each contributed $2000, the county gave $4000, and groups and individuals contributed items and money. Ed. A. Krohn was awarded the general building contract, Wiste-Thompson was given the heating contract, and the city of Thief River Falls was given the electrical contract.</p>
<p>The Physicians Hospital opened formally on August 31, 1915, at a total cost of about $20,000. An open house was held and over 1000 people came to visit and inspect the new facilities. An orchestra gave a program and lunch was served. People were well pleased with the new facilities.</p>
<p>The hospital, built at the corner of Fifth and Duluth (now 219 West Fifth Street), was a three-story building with an exterior finish of dark green stucco and white trim. The interior was painted white enamel, and every corner in the building was rounded, thus making it easy to keep the walls clean. In the basement were the general kitchen, dining room, laundry facilities, quarters for the hospital assistants, and a vacuum steam heating system including a Bernhard boiler, one of the first in the state.</p>
<p>First and second floors each had a large ward to accommodate eight patients. The hospital could hold twenty-five patients but could be increased to hold thirty-five if the need arose. Connecting each room to the main hallway was a buzzer system, making it convenient for nurses to be called by patients. A linen closet, lavatories, medicine cabinets, and diet kitchens were also on each floor.</p>
<p>In the northwest corner of the second floor was the operating room. The walls were white enamel and the floor was made so that it was possible to hose the entire room down when necessary. The room, furnished by the Class of 1914 contained one of the latest pattern sterilizing apparatus, and wash basins and sinks of the latest design.</p>
<p>The hospital had a south entrance with a large reception hall. It was constructed so that an addition could be built on the rear if necessary. With the fine equipment and building, the hospital became known as one of the best and most modern hospitals in the northwest. The Physicians Hospital provided ample facilities for the city for 15 years.</p>
<p>The staff and also incorporators of the hospital were Dr. J. E. Douglass, president; Dr. O. F. Mellby, vice-president; Dr. H. W. Froelich, secretary; Dr. F. H. Gambell, treasurer; and Dr. H. G. Hieber, director. Beulah Grout was matron of the Physicians Hospital; Miss Ruth Aus, a graduate of the Swedish Hospital in Minneapolis, was the highly recommended head nurse; and Miss Nina Rock was the first director of nurses at the Physicians Hospital. The doctors of the hospital still had their own clinics at various places in town.</p>
<p>Dr. Jacob Biederman came to Thief River Falls on June 1. 1915. Although he came to the city too late to be in on the organization of the Physicians Hospital Company, he took an active interest in the hospital and was a well liked and respected physician. Dr. Biederman graduated from the academic departments of Science, Literature, and Arts in 1901, and the medical department in 1904, all of the Univ. of MN, and had been located at Argyle, MN.</p>
<p>In 1915 Dr. Kirby came to Thief River Falls and set up a practice in his home two miles southeast of Thief River Falls. His common method of healing consisted of painting some portion of the patient's anatomy, usually the throat, with a combination of chemicals. It has been said that it was easy to see who had been to Dr. Kirby, because those people walked around with brown stripes on their necks. These chemicals treated goiter, and people came from far and wide to see him. Dr. Kirbys method of healing was both complemented and criticized.</p>
<p>Dr. Kirby played an important role in community affairs. He served as president of the school board, president of the Jaycees, and was a member of the Lions Club. Despite local businessmen asking him to stay, Dr. Kirby moved to Northwood, ND, in October of 1921, where he was promised freedom from criticism. In 1922, however, the death of a man whom Dr. Kirby had treated in Northwood resulted in Dr. Kirby being indicted for practicing without a license and manslaughter. The jury's verdict was Not Guilty for the charge of practicing without a license, and the manslaughter charge was dropped. After that Dr. Kirby moved back to Thief River Falls and continued to practice medicine.</p>
<p>In 1916 Dr. A. J. Paulson, a graduate of Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia, came to Thief River Falls. He had first practiced in Flaxton, North Dakota, where he had established a hospital that became famous. Dr. Paulson remained in Thief River Falls for five years, until he received the high honor of becoming a surgeon at Lutheran Hospital in Watertown, South Dakota.</p>
<p>In 1920, along with Dr. Vistaunet returning to Thief River Falls and opening up offices in the McGinn building, two new doctors, Dr. A. W. Swedenburg and Dr. C. M. Adkins, came to Thief River Falls. Dr. Swedenburg had just returned from WWI, and he and Dr. Adkins both opened up their own practices in the First National Bank building on the corner of Third Street and LaBree Avenue. In 1922 Dr. Swedenburg purchased the former Telemarken Hotel on Knight Avenue and moved his practice there. The Swedenburg Hospital Clinic gave special attention to eye, ear, nose, throat, and fitting of glasses. Dr. Swedenburg married Miss Nina Rock, director of nurses at Physicians Hospital, who became superintendent at the Swedenburg Hospital and delivered anesthetics there.</p>
<p>During the flu epidemics of 1918 and 1920 the hospitals in Thief River Falls were all filled up, so an emergency flu hospital was opened in a three-story former hotel building on Knight Avenue and Fourth Street that the city rented. Doctors could not reach all their patients during these emergency times, and hundreds died. Dr. Mellby did not sleep more than a wink now and then for 15 days and nights. After 15 days he collapsed and spent six days in bed.</p>
<p>In 1920 Drs. O. F. Mellby, A. J. Paulson, H. W. Froelich, and L. F. Fisher operated The Clinic in the Citizens Bank building on the corner of Third Street and LaBree Ave. , now Ekeren Drug. In August, 1921, the doctors split up; Dr. Paulson continued to operate The Clinic, while Drs. Mellby, Froelich, and Fisher opened up the Thief River Clinic in the same building.</p>
<p>In 1921 the Physicians Hospital admitted 759 patients with 530 of those requiring surgical treatment. In 1921 plans were formulated for the enlargement of the Physicians Hospital. An identical building would be built on the east side of the hospital making an L shape. However, these plans were never carried out.</p>
<p>In 1923 John P. Bowers joined the Swedenburg staff after completing a post graduate course in Chicago. Before that he had built and operated a hospital at Gully, Minnesota, in the pioneer days of that village. Later in 1923 he moved his own practice to the First National Bank and in 1924 installed x-ray and a special fluoroscope.</p>
<p>In 1926 Dr. L. B. Foster, an osteopathic doctor, moved to Thief River Falls and set up in the Citizens Bank building at the corner of Third Street and LaBree Avenue, now Ekeren Drug.</p>
<p>In 1930 the start of St. Luke's, the first community non-profit hospital association in Thief River Falls, was organized, and a board of five trustees was elected. They were H. A. Brumund, Rasmus Oen, H. E. Nelson, Robert J. Lund, and Carl Christofferson. Broaten and Foss of Fergus Falls were hired to be the architects of St. Lukes, and the Dickenson Construction Company of Bemidji was contracted to build St. Luke's</p>
<p>Construction of St. Luke's began in August of 1930 along First Street, on the land that Northwest Medical Center is now located. The building, 102 feet by 40 feet, was four stories high with a full basement, and could hold 75 patients. It was thoroughly fireproof and modern in every aspect. Its exterior was of light colored brick texture with trimmings of Bedford stone. Inside conveniences were automatic elevators, automatic stokers for stable temperatures, and "open-air porches" for desired coolness or fresh air. Also, each room was wired for radio, telephone, and x-ray. The hospital represented a real estate investment of more than $85,000, and with equipment it was worth about $110,000. The building formerly on the hospital site was moved back and was used for laundry at St. Luke's.</p>
<p>St. Luke's Hospital was officially dedicated on February 7, 1931, with an open house at the hospital, a program at the city auditorium, and a banquet at Trinity Lutheran Church. Over 3000 visitors from almost every community in northern Minnesota toured the hospital facilities. On the first floor of St. Luke's Hospital was the Bratrud Clinic. It was to be started by Drs. Edward and Theodore Bratrud, who had been persuaded to leave their practice in Warren, MN, but Dr. Theodore Bratrud died suddenly on the evening of his coming to Thief River Falls. The Bratrud Clinic was equipped with instruments from the practice in Warren. Dr. Edward Bratrud became chief of staff, Dr. David Berge was in charge of the obstetrical department, and Dr. Archie M. Smith headed the x-ray and physiotherapy departments. The clinic was started in 1931 when St. Luke's Hospital was built. A bronze memorial plaque was installed in St. Luke's Hospital in honor of Dr. Theodore Bratrud, and an endowment fund for charity patients was also set up In his name.</p>
<p>Other doctors working at the Bratrud Clinic included Drs. L. C. Culver, 1932; Charles M. Froats, 1932; V. L. Evans, 1933; Joseph F. Malloy, 1937; Homer H. Hedemark 1937; P. J. Ancker, 1940; A. G. Janecky, 1944; Robert M Watson, 1947; William Feigal, 1948; and Neil Nickerson, 1949.</p>
<p>In 1947 the Bratrud Clinic wanted to expand and also give St. Lukes Hospital more room, so the Bratrud Clinic moved to a building just west of the hospital, which was remodeled and added to in 1948. The Bratrud Clinic existed there until 1957.</p>
<p>In 1931 the Northern Clinic was opened in the Swedenburg building on Knight Avenue. Doctors of the clinic were Drs. A. W. Swedenburg, O. G. Lynde, who had come to Thief River Falls in 1930, J. E. Bowers, and all members of the Physician Hospital Staff. This clinic only lasted until 1932, when Dr. C. M. Adkins took over the Swedenburg building.</p>
<p>In 1935 Dr. O. G. Lynde opened up the Lynde Clinic at the corner of Third and LaBree, what is now Ekeren Drug. Harold C. Johnson joined him in 1935. Dr. M. D Starekow took over the clinic in 1942 as a result of Lynde's absence during the winter months, because Lynde's wife's health could not take the cold. The clinic was renamed the Starekow Clinic. Dr. Dan Greene joined the clinic in 1949, Dr. J. H. O'Leary in 1950, Dr. A. J. Lund in 1951, and Dr. George Martin in 1954. Dr. Ernest Thorsgard joined the group in 1958.</p>
<p>On April 30. 1938, the Physicians Hospital became Mercy Hospital. The change resulted from a turnover in hospital associations in which the new association took over the management. Serving on the board were C. D. Gustafson, president; C. W. Vgrachek, secretary-treasurer; Alf Bredeson, vice-president; M. P. Erickson; and Joe Homes. The reason for the transfer of ownership was to place the hospital on the same tax basis as others, as well as to stimulate community interest.</p>
<p>The newly-formed Mercy Hospital, the second nonprofit association in the community, provided sufficient medical facilities until the late 1940's when an expansion in facilities was greatly needed. Both St. Luke's and Mercy Hospital were planning extensive expansion and remodeling programs. In April of 1947 the issue arose at a civic and commerce meeting, and efforts were made for expanding. It was reported that an addition to St. Luke's Hospital would be the least costly method of providing bigger facilities. At a later meeting, the association favored the idea of forming a community hospital. There was a question whether to build an entirely new facility or to make an addition to the St. Luke's Hospital building.</p>
<p>With the idea of a community hospital known to the public, a board of seven trustees (F. E. Tunberg, president; Gunsten Skomedal, vice-president; Archie Hensrud, secretary; Roy J. Oen, treasurer; Vivian Copp, A. B. Stenberg, and Frank Hardisty) was selected to influence people to be in favor of the hospital. The following proposal was published to inform everyone of the action which would be taken:</p>
<p>That a new community hospital association be organized to operate the hospital facilities of this community as a nonprofit, charitable community enterprise. That rules of practice be established by which the community hospital association will guarantee to the public: (a) That the hospital shall always be an open community hospital. (b) That the facilities of the hospital shall be open for the practice of all doctors who are now members of either hospital and to any future doctors of this and other communities who meet the requirements of practice as shall be laid down by the community hospital board. (c) That no special privileges be granted to any doctor or group of doctors. That when the association has been formed and foregoing assurances given, we invite the present hospital association to merge into the community hospital association. That the community hospital association undertake a nurses' training program. That all earnings of the community hospital association be dedicated to continued improvement of our hospital facilities with a view to making this community a medical center. That the community hospital association cooperate with the state hospital board and the University of Minnesota with a view to qualifying for the proposed federal hospital grant. To secure enough members in the community hospital association as to make it truly representative of the area it serves. That the women of the community be given proper representation. That we enlist the support of our community clubs and farm organizations in order that the project may truly represent the wishes of the entire community. While steps were being made for a community hospital, Mercy Hospital in 1947 built a quonset type addition to accommodate 20 beds. This caused quite a heat, for people thought that this would end hope for a community hospital, but the board of trustees at Mercy Hospital made a statement: "No money out of the pledges to the new building will be used in this temporary construction. From now on it is our determination to go ahead . . . for the NEW HOSPlTAL</p>
<p>Plans for the new hospital were continued, and James Hamilton and Associates of Minneapolis were hired to conduct a local survey to study the medical needs of the community and to make a recommendation for the development of a community hospital. On June 13, 1950, after this survey was completed, the Mercy and St. Luke's Hospital associations voted in favor of a merger and formed a joint association to assume full ownership, control, and operation of the two existing hospitals. Mercy was used for sub-acute and chronic care, and St. Luke's was used for more acute care, pediatrics, and obstetrics. In 1951 the second floor of Mercy Hospital and its 17 beds were vacated after being declared unsafe in case of fire. In 1951 Drs. William Feigal, Neil Nickerson, and George Van Rooy started the Falls Clinic on LaBree Avenue North, where the Northwest Eye Clinic now is. Drs. Paul Wendt, Robert Watson, Alfred Nelson, Ernest Thorsgard, and Rollie Anderson later joined.</p>
<p>In 1951, after the decision of the merge, a fund drive began for the new addition. Dr. O. F. Mellby was made honorary chairman, Judge Paul A. Lundgren was named general chairman, Mrs. H. F. Harrison was chairman of the women's division and Les lhle of the men's division, and Pat Culkins was chairman of the area organization. The goal of the fund drive was $250,000. This amount would enable construction of an addition onto St. Luke's which would provide adequate hospital facilities and modern up-to-date equipment. The addition of a new wing would include two 32-bed wards, new surgical suites, a new out-patient department, new x-ray department, physical therapy department, new kitchen, and a new heating system.</p>
<p>It was announced at the first hospital drive dinner that doctors and the board of directors had contributed $67,500. A portion of the liquor store profits went to the hospital, and the rest of the sum was donated by individuals and groups. In February of 1952 the goal was reached.</p>
<p>Hospital plans to add onto St. Luke's Hospital were approved, and bids were opened on July 16, 1953. The general contract was awarded to Dahlquist lncorporated of Mora, MN, and the total cost of the addition was near $1 million. Construction began in early August of 1953, and was completed in November of 1954. Open house was held on November 28, and patients were transferred into the new addition on November 30. The community now had Northwestern Hospital with 110 beds. The original St. Luke's building was remodeled after the open house was held, and Mercy Hospital was sold to the Masonic Lodge.</p>
<p>Membership of Northwestern Hospital Association Medical Staff in 1954 included Drs. Edward Bratrud, Jacob Biederman, M.D. Starekow, Dan Greene, George Van Rooy, William Feigel, H. Paul Wendt, and George Martin.</p>
<p>In 1959 Drs. Leo Herber and Stanley Pollman bought out the Bratrud Clinic building which had been vacant since 1947, and opened the Thief River Clinic. Dr. Pollman left and Dr. Duane Davidson joined the clinic in 1964. Dr. Harley Miller joined in 1961 and Dr. Glenn Kerr in 1974.</p>
<p>In 1954 the Women's Auxiliary Organization was formed to help Northwestern Hospital provide the best possible care for the sick and the injured. The first president of the organization was Mrs. Rudolph Sagmoen. This educational and service type organization has greatly contributed its services to Northwestern Hospital. The Women's Auxiliary has set up candy stripers, served lunches at the hospital's open houses and Christmas parties, sewed drapes for the new hospital additions, organized a lending library and a gift shop, entertained patients, made pajamas and slippers for hospital patients, and donated new equipment to the hospital.</p>
<p>Dr. Starekow of the Starekow Clinic died in 1962. Dr. Martin was the only one left at the Starekow Clinic so he merged with the Falls Clinic in 1963. The clinic was named the Falls-Starekow Clinic. The Falls Clinic was made up of Drs. George Van Rooy, H. Paul Wendt, Ernest Thorsgard, and Rollie Anderson.</p>
<p>Northwestern Hospital provided one of the best medical facilities in the area, and in August of 1958 plans were made for an addition of a rehabilitation center. Bids for construction were taken and work was awarded to Dean L. Witcher of Minneapolis. Construction began on March 22, 1963, and total cost was estimated at $849,000. The addition included a rehabilitation center of 36 beds for physical medicine and rehabilitation, new services of occupational therapy, improvements in the Department of Radiology, six new beds in the lntensive Care Unit, and remodeling the existing hospital facilities. The purpose of the rehabilitation unit is to treat the physical and mental damages resulting from accidents and illnesses, with the intention of helping repair and retain injured muscles, nerves, and joints, and where necessary teach patients to substitute undamaged or less damaged body resources for that which can no longer function. In the department of radiology floor space was tripled, providing an additional diagnostic room, dressing rooms, waiting room, file space, conference room, isotope laboratory, and improved office facilities. Open house of the new rehabilitation center was held in June of 1964.</p>
<p>Dr. Miland E. Knapp was a pioneer in consulting. At the request of the Northwestern Hospital medical staff and administrator who recognized the need for rehabilitation in the community, Dr. Knapp was a consultant in physical medicine at Northwestern Hospital from December of 1961 to 1983. Through the statewide teaching and consulting program, he spent one day and evening at Northwestern Hospital every four to six weeks.</p>
<p>When Dr. Knapp first came to Thief River Falls in 1961 he traveled by train on the Soo Line. He would leave Minneapolis at night and arrive in Thief River Falls at 4:00 a.m. He would spend the next day lecturing to the medical and nursing staff and seeing patients, then board the train at night and go back to Minneapolis to work the next day. As a result of the first two years experience of consulting, the program expanded to four other communities. When train passenger service died, Dr. Knapp took the plane to Thief River Falls, but said that he preferred the train because it fit his schedule better.</p>
<p>Dr. Knapp was the first physiatrist in Minnesota and was certified in physical medicine in 1947. He was a 1929 graduate of the Univ. of MN and interned at the Minneapolis General Hospital from 1929 to 1930. He received fellowship in surgery at the Minneapolis General from 1930 to 1933, and was chief of physical therapy at Minneapolis General from 1930 to 1933. Dr. Knapp was chief of physical therapy at Minneapolis General Hospital until 1970 and was director of physical medicine at the Kenney Institute from 1948 to 1964. He has worked with the Veterans Administration, and practiced with the Metropolitan Medical Center. Dr. Knapp had been a stimulant to local physicians, showing them what could be accomplished through a training program for physical therapists, occupational therapists, and nursing service personnel.</p>
<p>In July of 1968 another addition of Northwestern Hospital was started. A 90-bed Long-Term Care Unit was built on land just south of the hospital. This three-story addition provides highly skilled nursing care for both bed and ambulatory patients, giving patients closer medical supervision and making more efficient use of medical facilities. The two upper floors are patient floors of 45 beds each. This CNC unit provides 24-hour professional nursing services and medical and dental coverage, regular and specialized diets. regular hair wash, laundry of personal clothing, free cable TV hookup, pastoral services, physical therapy, occupational therapy, social services, medical care, and activities for the residents. The architectural firm who developed the plan of the CNC unit was Bettenburg, Townsend, Stolte, and Comb of St. Paul. Cost of the unit was $1,616,000, plus equipment and furnishings adding $100,000.</p>
<p>Also added at this time was a day-night psychiatric unit, a one-floor addition to the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation. This psychiatric unit provides service for a seven-county area in the northwestern part of Minnesota as an element of the Comprehensive Community Mental Health Program, including the counties of Kittson, Marshall, Polk, Red Lake, Norman, Mahnomen, and Pennington. The psychiatric unit provides in-patient and out-patient services, partial hospitalization, emergency services 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and therapeutic programs. These services meet the emotional handicaps that accompany such problems as alcoholism retardation, adolescent adjustment, geriatric adjustment, and parental and marriage difficulties. The cost of this unit was approximately $425,000.</p>
<p>In October of 1969 the day-night psychiatric unit was opened and by January of 1970 the 90-bed nursing care unit was completed for public viewing. Open house was held January 16, 17, 18, 1970. Many people viewed the new restorative and rehabilitation programs, and also the other services which made Northwestern Hospital complete in all branches of medical facilities. The total cost of the two units was $2 million.</p>
<p>Hospital ambulance service was organized in 1969. Previous to that time the undertakers directed the ambulance service. Operation of the emergency services included two ambulances for emergency out-patients and all emergency services for in-patients The ambulance service was provided by combined efforts and skills of the medical staff, nursing staff, and emergency service personnel. Ambulance vehicles are equipped with radios to communicate back to the hospital what to prepare and when the patient will arrive.</p>
<p>In 1970, while the CNC unit was being built, an emergency helistop landing was made on top of the roof. This was to be used if patients need to be picked up and transferred quickly from Thief River Falls to another specialized hospital. This service was very costly and was never used. The helistop was marked on all aviation maps.</p>
<p>In 1972 an emergency snowmobile rescue sled was added to the ambulance service. This sled, built by Les Vigness, engineer of Northwestern Hospital, was light weight and could go places where ambulances could not reach because of snow or storms. Parts for the sled were donated by Arctic Enterprises of Thief River Falls, and this unique sled was the topic of an article printed in the March 1973 issue of Popular Snowmobiling. This sled is no longer in use, but was used about five or six times for emergency purposes.</p>
<p>In 1972 Mrs. Edwin (EM) Olson retired from service. She was a graduate of the former Physician's Hospital, became a staff nurse at Mercy Hospital in 1944 and with the merger of the two hospitals in 1950, continued on as a staff nurse at Northwestern Hospital.</p>
<p>On March 1, 1972, Miss Lydia Dahlen retired as Director of Nurses. She was replaced by Miss Ruth Bloom.</p>
<p>In 1982 $1200 worth of new ambulance service equipment was added, but in 1984 Northwestern Hospital ended its control of the ambulance service. The service had been operating at a loss, and selling the service would cause the least financial hardship on both the hospital and Pennington County, while still providing a quality emergency transportation service to area citizens. Midwest Ambulance Service took our management of the ambulance service in Thief River Falls.</p>
<p>After the addition of the CNC unit and psychiatric unit, there was only one missing service at Northwestern Hospital -- a modern, well-equipped clinic. In June of 1974 the chairman of the Northwestern Hospital Board of Trustees, Dr. Earl Dagg, introduced this issue to the Chamber of Commerce. He stated that in a 1972 meeting, the Falls Clinic, the Thief River Clinic, Drs. Jerome Bray, Robert Carter, himself, and the hospital board of trustees began to study the possibilities of a joint medical clinic. Dr. Dagg said that the National Association of Medical Clinics was contacted to make a survey. When the survey was completed, the following recommendations were made:</p>
<p>There should be a single building to house all doctors and interested dentists. The building should have a physical connection to Northwestern Hospital. Further study should be undertaken to explore the possibility that the hospital and medical office building share some services. All methods of financing the project should be studied. Public forums were held to address questions the community might have regarding the building of a new medical office building. The TRF Times was used by both sides of the issue to get the message to the public.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce accepted the recommendation and decided that the best site for the new medical office building would be west of the hospital, across from LaBree Avenue. In November of 1974 the city council approved the hospitals request to close LaBree Avenue so the medical office building could be built there.</p>
<p>To finance the project, a $2 million loan would be taken from the Farmers Home Administration at 5% interest if voters passed the bond issue. This would transfer the title of Northwestern Hospital to the city, but Thief River Falls would not assume obligation for debts or operating expenses. This savings in interest would reduce the overall cost of the new medical building. The loan would be paid back in 30 years by lease payments of those who would occupy the building. There was much controversy on the subject of the loan and many editorials were written in the newspaper, but on April 15, 1975, the bond issue passed three to one at a special election.</p>
<p>Once the desired site was obtained for the new medical building, bids were taken to build the addition which had been designed by Bettenburg, Townsend, Stolte, and Comb architects. Bids were higher than expected, so a supplemental bond issue election was set up to decide whether to allow an additional $800,000. The issue was passed and construction began. The building contract was awarded to Witcher Construction Company of Minneapolis for $1,628,000; mechanical work was awarded to Lee Plumbing and Heating of Thief River Falls for $593,455; and electrical work was awarded to Roley Electric of Warren for $296,000. The building is a three-story structure; two floors provide enough space for a total of 25 doctors, and one floor is used for expanding laboratory, x-ray, and emergency facilities. The Thief River Clinic building was removed to allow construction and surfacing of a parking lot. In December of 1976 the new medical building passed federal review, and the new public entrance and reception space area was opened at a total cost of $2.8 million.</p>
<p>By January 2, 1977, enough of the new office building was completed for occupancy. Occupants of the building then were Drs. Leo Herber and Duane Davidson, family practitioners; Jerome Bray, surgeon; Ernest Padilla, urologist; Donald and David Peterson, podiatrists; A. Davidson, ophthalmologist; Earl Dagg and Robert Carter, radiologists.</p>
<p>On August 17, 1977, the eight physicians from the Falls Clinic at 309 LaBree Avenue also moved into the medical building. They were Drs. Arnold Berg, Allen Scheuneman, Ernest Thorsgard, H. Paul Wendt, Peter Johnson, and George Martin, family practitioners; and Richard Heinrichs and George Van Rooy, internal medicine. Now all physicians in Thief River Falls could practice under one roof with hospital wards only a short walk away.</p>
<p>Since the doctors moved into the new medical building, obstetrics and gynecology, and orthopedics were added to Northwestern Hospital Services. On February 1, 1985, three separate practices within the building, Thief River Clinic, Bray Surgical, and Genito Urinary Clinic, merged with the Falls Clinic, so now all doctors were under the same organization. The convenience and efficiency of the hospital and doctors sharing services would hold down costs for patients.</p>
<p>In December, 1977 public interest in the performance of abortions at Northwestern Hospital in TRF and public involvement in attempts to change hospital policy resulted in selection of that situation as the number one news story in the local community for 1977.</p>
<p>In 1978 Evadell Tangquist became the first woman elected to the Board of Trustees of Northwestern Hospital Services. Ms. Tangquist served two three year terms.</p>
<p>May, 1981, Northwestern Hospital prepared for what would have become the first strike by LPN's in Minnesota. Settlement on the two year contract was achieved late the evening before the strike.</p>
<p>NBC news crews from Chicago were in Thief River Falls in January of l980 to film a segment to be aired on the NBC Nightly News in a review of the national nursing shortage and how hospital were attempting to meet those needs.</p>
<p>Northwestern Hospital contained modern and up-to-date equipment and continued to progress and make improvements. As part of Northwestern Hospital's modern equipment was a blood analysis unit. It was capable of conducting 680 individual blood tests per hour -- 17 different tests on each sample from 40 different patients. In 1973 psychiatric services were brought to the hospital, and in 1978 the first cornea transplant was performed. In 1983 Northwestern Hospital bought a van with a wheelchair lift with funds received from a Department of Transportation Grant, received a new x ray screen film system in the department of radiation which cut the amount of radiation received in half, and started a mobile computed tomography (CT) scanning unit to come to the hospital three days a week. This unit used precisely directed radiation to take photographic cross sections of the body and provides information not as well obtained by normal x-ray or ultra sound procedures.</p>
<p>In January of 1982 long-time hospital administrator, Norm Peterson announced his intent to retire from his position as president and chief executive officer of Northwestern Hospital Services by May of 1982. In a letter to Peterson from the hospital's board of trustees, signed by chairman Terry Courneya, the board extended its sincere thanks for Mr. Petersons 26 years of service and stated "under your direction and leadership the hospital has steadily grown to become an excellent institution providing top quality health care to people from Thief River Falls and the surrounding area." Mr. Peterson passed away November 2, 1991.</p>
<p>Richard Spyhalski began duties as President and Chief Executive Officer of Northwestern Hospital Services in September of l982. Mr. Spyhalski succeeded Norm Peterson as head of hospital operations. Mr. Peterson retired in May of 1982 and Tom Mattson served as interim administrator from May to September of 1982. Mr. Spyhalski continues to serve as Chief Executive Officer of Northwest Medical Center today.</p>
<p>On December 10, 1983 a head-on collision on Highway l near Thief River Falls claimed the life of Dr. Duane J. Davidson. Dr. Davidson, 52, was a partner in the Thief River Clinic and a physician here since 1964.</p>
<p>In 1984 a new $65,000 cardiac monitoring system was purchased. Also in that year a home emergency system. Life Alert", was started. "Life-Alert" provides 24-hour medical services at the push of a button for elderly home patients and enables them stay at home for a longer period of time without worrying about needed medical care Another new program started that year offered a "celebration dinner" for parents before they take the newborn babies home.</p>
<p>The year 1985 brought several more changes to Northwestern Hospital. New cooperative ventures with our medical staff led to the formation of a Joint Marketing Committee made up of physician and hospital representatives. The purpose of the committee was to make the public more aware of the health care services offered here. Some of the projects this committee was involved in was: Colon Cancer Screening, Mammography Screening, Optifast Weight Loss Program, Cataract Surgery Promotions and several running/track events for the community.</p>
<p>A complete renovation of one of the delivery suites allowed mothers the option of laboring, delivering, and recovering in the same room. The Birthing Room, which was completed in 1985, provided a relaxed family atmosphere for safe, yet not institutionalized care.</p>
<p>Computer equipment, at a cost of $65,000, was installed to regulate heating and ventilation systems throughout the hospital. First-year energy savings were estimated at $30,000.00. The largest energy management project to be undertaken was to retrofit a 300 horsepower low-pressure boiler to burn an alternative fuel source, sidewinder burner was installed, which is capable of burning many types of alternate fuels. Future Fuels lncorporated of TRF manufactures the fuel that is used. The boiler carried the entire heating load for the hospital and clinic. This unit was completed in 1986.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1985 the Northwestern Hospital Services Board of Director Strategic Planning Committee identified a need to consider a corporate facility name change for the purpose of more clearly communicating the facility's role and mission as a regional health care provider to the residents residing in northwestern Minnesota. NORTHWEST MEDlCAL CENTER was identified as the preferred facility name, which was approved by the hospital's membership in the Fall of 1985. On December 1, 1985, the Minnesota Secretary of State granted the final official approval of our facility corporate name change and Northwestern Hospital Services officially became Northwest Medical Center. A corporate logo, letterhead, and facility exterior signage was developed in conjunction with the official name change.</p>
<p>St. John's hospital in Red Lake Falls was purchased by Northwest Medical Center and closed on November 30, 1985. Alternate uses for the building were discussed, but, ultimately it was sold back to the city of Red Lake Falls and later utilized by the Global Studies Institute.</p>
<p>On December 9, 1985, Northern Lights Community Residence opened its door to receive its first residents. Northern Lights is a 15-bed transitional living facility for persons who are experiencing chronic or enduring problems with mental illness. It is owned and operated by Northwest Medical Center and was developed by the Mental Health Division in cooperation with Pennington County. The purpose of Northern Lights is to provide residents with a therapeutic living situation designed to enable them to function at their highest possible level.</p>
<p>Also, in December of 1985, the Falls Clinic announced plans to merge with the Dakota Clinic in Fargo, North Dakota. The merger guaranteed the continued availability of high quality specialty medical services in Thief River Falls. The Dakota Clinic is a large medical referral center providing a full range of medical specialty and subspecialty care. The clinic network includes over 160 physicians in virtually all specialty areas. One of the advantages of this merger was the ability to provide a prepaid health care system through an HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) On July 1, 1986, this merger took effect. The clinic will now operate as Dakota Clinic - Thief River Falls.</p>
<p>November 21, 1986 Northwest Medical Center instituted new smoking restrictions. New signs were placed restricting smoking only to designated areas and for the first time smoke-free lounges for patients on all floors were provided. Classes were provided for employees wishing to stop smoking.</p>
<p>The Fall of 1986 showed no reports of AIDS cases in Northern Minnesota "but if a case occurs, Northwest Medical Center will be ready", according to Dr. Donald Mestery, Internal Medicine Specialist. The hospital recently adopted guidelines for isolating and caring for AIDS victims. Hospital personnel have been educated as to the proper care and isolation of AIDS patients.</p>
<p>The Joint Marketing Program continued to offer programs for the community such as the new Arena Walking Program which used the Sports Arena as a location for community members to walk - eight laps around equaled one mile. Awards were given to walkers logging 10, 100 and 500 miles during the winter season. Other Programs that were very popular were the Cross Country Ski Clinic, Health in the Long Run (2.1 Mile and 10 K), Turkey Trot and the Medical Update newsletter which is distributed to approximately 26,000 homes in northwestern Minnesota on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>In the Spring of 1987, Dr. Jerome Bray, introduced Laser Surgery to the area. The Falls Clinic obtained a 30 watt carbon dioxide laser manufactured by the Minnesota Laser Corporation. Staff was trained and used the laser for a variety of conditions such as moles and warts.</p>
<p>During the Fall of 1987, the Northern Lights Book and Craft Store opened in downtown Thief River Falls. Northern Lights Book and Craft is an extension of the Northern Lights Community Residence.</p>
<p>March 1, 1988 Northwest Medical Center became a "smoke-free" facility in action by the Northwest Medical Center Board of Directors which unanimously voted to make NWMC a smoke-free facility. As of this date no smoking was allowed within the hospital by patients, visitors or employees. The sole exception to this is when smoking is ordered for a specific patient or C&amp;NC resident by his/her physician by prescription when it is deemed that the patient/resident's addiction to nicotine is such that abstinence from tobacco products is seriously deleterious to the health and/or care of that patient. A facility wide task force composed of smokers, nonsmokers and ex-smokers was established in order to research and make recommendations as to the effective implementation of this policy.</p>
<p>October, 1987 Dr. Ashok Patel presented a community program on influenza and pneumonia vaccines at the Heritage Community Center in TRF. Senior citizens were encouraged to attend as these vaccines are recommended for all individuals over 65. Other community education programs offered were the I Can Cope (classes for cancer patients and their families) at the C&amp;NC chapel and a Breathe Free Stop Smoking Class. Also, Growing Older and Healthier by Internal Medicine Specialist, Dr. Jim Langland, Laser Surgery by Dr. Jerome Bray, Cooking and Eating on a Low Cholesterol Diet by Dietitians Annette Hendricks and Karen Heher and Managing Stress by Dr. Steve Levinson. The next series addressed Spiritual Aspects of Healing by Hospital Chaplain Paul Bortnem, Coping with Arthritis by Steve Young, Physical Therapist, AIDS by Dr. Ashok Patel, Treating Infertility by Dr. Juho Krepp and Teenage Pregnancy by Dr. Betty Sugden.</p>
<p>The first Adolescent Health Week was scheduled for April 25-29, 1988. Funding for this project included contributions from NWMC and the Falls Clinic, the March of Dimes and a grant from Quinn County Community Health Services. The issues covered in this special week were death and illness in teenagers from substance abuse, sexuality and pregnancy, psychological disorders (including suicide and depression), violence and accidents. A series of talks were given by nationally known speaker, Dr. Sol Gordon on Thursday, April 28 at Lincoln High School. Also, a continuing education conference called "Adolescent Pregnancy, An American Tragedy" for health and human service professionals, clergy and educators was provided.</p>
<p>July 1, 1988 Dr. Allen Scheuneman returned to practice in TRF. Dr. Scheuneman, is a well known physician in the Warroad area from his practice there in the early 60's and he practiced medicine in TRF until 1983. At that time he joined the Oral Roberts City of Faith and worked in teaching and medical practice for the Oral Roberts University School of Medicine. Dr. Scheuneman returned from a practice in Paynesville, MN, where he and his wife, Connie, had resided for two years.</p>
<p>The first Advanced Cardiac Life Support class was offered in June of 1988 and offered twice a year thereafter. Pat Buckta, RN, ACLS Coordinator was in charge of the sessions for nurses and physicians.</p>
<p>Dr. Ernest Thorsgard retired from practice on June 17, 1988 after thirty years in medicine. Dr. Thorsgard graduated from the University of North Dakota in 1954 with a Bachelor of Science degree and attended Vanderbilt University Medical School in Nashville and graduated in 1957.</p>
<p>The use of sound waves to study the heart, or echocardiography was introduced to patients at Northwest Medical Center in 1989. According to Dr. Ashok Patel, "Advances in computer technology now give high resolution heart images using sound waves and this new equipment is going to be quite useful to our patients particularly in evaluating heart and blood vessel diseases."</p>
<p>In March, 1989 the NWMC Board of Directors authorized a 2.5 million dollar renovation/remodeling project. This project resulted in new inpatient and out-patient surgery areas, a new Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and a relocated Physical Therapy area. In addition, patient care areas were updated.</p>
<p>The NWMC Auxiliary donated $26,000 towards the purchase of new urodiagnostic equipment. This equipment was to be used primarily by Dr's. Padilla and Krepp. The unit measured bladder pressure, urethral pressure, intra-abdominal pressure, intrinsic bladder pressure and is capable of performing electromyography studies of the urethral sphincter (EMGs) and Cystometrograms (CMG). This new equipment is computer based and is state-of-the art in assessing urinary tract function. (1989)</p>
<p>The Thief River Sports Medicine program began in 1989 with the recruitment of a certified athletic trainer. This program has developed into a high quality, coordinated and multi-disciplinary service. The focus of this venture is to provide direct, sport-specific care to athletes in the Thief River Falls area. The TRF Sports Medicine team presently serves Thief River School District #564 (Lincoln High School) and Northland Community College. Each school has a weekly visit by the team as opposed to requiring the athletes to make an office visit. The program is administered by the Physical Therapy department at NWMC and is under the direction of the Sports Medicine Committee; Dr. James Langland, Steve Young, Director of Physical Therapy, Bonnie Davidson, PT, George Judd, ATC, Dan Olson, Associate Administrator, and Jan Nyflot, Clinic Administrator.</p>
<p>Laparascopic hysterectomies offer advantages over standard abdominal hysterectomy. Dr. Juho Krepp, MD, F.R.C.S. (C), F.A.C.O.G., introduced this surgery to the area in 1991. This surgery offered many advantages over the standard abdominal or vaginal surgery, such as: less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, more rapid recovery and faster return to normal activity, greater precision in dealing with pathology. During the Summer of 1991, Dr. Jerome Bray introduced laparascopic cholecystectomies to this area. Many laparascopic procedures are now being done at NWMC. Laparascopic cholecystectomies, hysterectomies, hernia repair and appendectomies are all provided.</p>
<p>The Respiratory Therapy Department acquired a new pulmonary function testing machine in the Fall of l99l. Pulmonary Function testing is a painless diagnostic tool and is administered by a respiratory care practitioner and involves the patient performing various breathing maneuvers. The test takes approximately one hour and the results can aid the physician in determining whether a patient is suffering from any restrictive or obstructive lung disease.</p>
<p>Senator Paul Wellstone visited Northwest Medical Center on December 4, 1992 to meet with medical staff and the hospital board of directors to share their concerns related to federal healthcare legislation.</p>
<p>June 5, 1992 NWMC made available continuous emergency physician coverage on weekends during which there will be an Emergency Physician in the hospital. These treating physicians are responsible for seeing and treating patients who come to the NWMC Emergency Room on the weekends. These physicians are here due to an agreement with National Emergency Services, Inc. to provide emergency coverage.</p>
<p>NWMC was awarded a $49,905 grant from the U.S. Government to create a geriatric behavioral health program for northwestern Minnesota. The grant was made by the Health Care Financing Administration under its Rural Health Care Transition Grant Program (1992).</p>
<p>The C&amp;NC renovation project began in February, 1993 and was completed in July of 1993. The areas renovated were dining rooms, nursing/report station, bathing area, commode washing, and beauty shop. The south lounges were converted into a lounge and a family conference room. On the ground floor the Riverside Conference Room and Chapel received new carpeting, draperies, new ceiling and lighting. All floors of the C&amp;NC Unit had sprinklers installed and a new nurse call system was also installed. Residents, families, and staff are enjoying the result of the project. Soon the furniture in the lounges will be replaced using funds donated by the NWMC Auxiliary.</p>
<p>In 1993 the NWMC Foundation was incorporated. The Foundation is a separate legal organization established to receive charitable gifts and disburse funds to NWMC for the maintenance and improvement of health care for this area.</p>
<p>In July of 1994, Dr. Al Scheuneman retired. Dr. Scheuneman had practiced in Thief River Falls since 1965, except for five years from 1983 to 1988.</p>
<p>Dr. Randall Bolar, General Surgeon joined the medical staff in June of 1994. Along with broad experience in general surgery, vascular, thoracic, laparoscopic and pediatric surgery, he brings with him ten years of experience in bariatric surgery (gastric bypass) which is a new service to this community. Gastric bypass surgery is for people who are severely overweight.</p>
<p>2006 has brough new administration to Northwest Medical Center. Chris Harff leads the charge as CEO and other members of the Executive Team include Rob Lovejoy, Organizational Support Officer and Janell Hudson, Clinical Services Offer. The facility has leased it's CNC property to St. Francis Health Services which operates an 85-bed nursing home dba Thief River Care Center.

<p>Earthquakes. I have spoke to a couple people in and around the California region in reference to earthquakes in California: But according to my findings the largest fault on our planet is in the Midwest territory of the United States. Could this be true? If so, when would the big one happen? Could this be the big one that all speak of when mentioning our last days? This is not a scientific fact that I know of. But this same fault had many earth quakes 10,000 some years ago. The quakes were at or larger than a maganitude of 6. I live in Ohio where we occasionally get a 3 or 5. But, history does repeat itself. All faults are active once they become active...true? If so, the Midwest part of the U.S. just may experience something that is truly unbelievable. Could this fault possibly create earthquakes large enough to split our country in 1/2. True or not...I do not want to be the first to witness that!</p>

<p>Jakub Egit (1908- ) was a <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist.html" title="Zionist">Zionist</a> leader and <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">Soviet</a> soldier. In 1945 Egit began an experiment to relocate 50,000 Jews in the town of <a href="../../../d/z/i/Dzier%C5%BConi%C3%B3w.html" title="Dzierżoniów">Dzierżoniów</a> (formerly Reichenbach a recovered territory from the Third Reich) near <a href="../../../w/r/o/Wroc%C5%82aw.html" title="Wrocław">Wrocław</a> in <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silesia.html" title="Silesia">Silesia</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>. Initially Egit was supported by the communists in his endeavour to ensure that "here in this land, which Germans had cultivated for so many years, the Jews could exact retribution and justice by making the former <a href="../../../g/e/r/German.html" title="German">German</a> territory a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> settlement". Egit's plan to set up a <a href="../../../y/i/s/Yishuv.html" title="Yishuv">Yishuv</a> went well for three years. Starting with a small group of Kazettlers - <a href="../../../k/z/_/KZ_4ace.html" title="KZ">KZ</a> (Concetration Camp) survivors - the <a href="../../../y/i/s/Yishuv.html" title="Yishuv">Yishuv</a> quickly grew to encompass schools, hospitals, <a href="../../../k/i/b/Kibbutzim.html" title="Kibbutzim">kibbutzim</a>, orphanages and a book publishers in <a href="../../../w/r/o/Wroc%C5%82aw.html" title="Wrocław">Wrocław</a>. It ended, however, in 1948 when the communists chnged their policy, Egit was put in jail and the majority of <a href="../../../d/z/i/Dzier%C5%BConi%C3%B3w.html" title="Dzierżoniów">Dzierżoniów</a>'s citizens emigrated to Israel. From 1950 Egit was editor in Warsaw of <i>Jidysz Buch</i>. Due to continued harrassment Egit emigrated to Canada in 1957 where he became a prominant member of Canada's Jewish community. In 1991 he published his autobiography <i>Grand Illusion</i> (Toronto: Lugus)</p>

<p>Quaboag Regional High School is a very big school located in Warren, MA. It has been known for it's troubles with the teaching staff and the principals. It has also been known for it's horrible MCAS scores. It has 1,874 students and ten teachers per grade. In the top 100 schools in MA it is number 58.</p>
<p>&gt;I am not a wiki member, but I am a student here and take offense. Quaboag is known for winning Division III State Girls Basketball championships and it's excellent teaching staff. Failing MCAS scores for 10th graders were cut in half from 2004 to 2005. It has about 670 students. It has a staff of approximately 70 people. It is not "very big". But at least it is in Warren, MA.

<p>A few years after his return to Venice in 1295, Marco Polo found himself aboard a Venetian ship under the post of gentleman-commander during a regional war between Venice and Genoa. The ship was captured by the Genoese fleet and Marco consequently spent the next few years, until May of 1299, in a Genoa prison. It was during this period that Marco found the time to dictate, possibly with the help of notes taken during his voyage, the story of his years abroad. Rustigielo, a citizen of Pisa and fellow prisoner of Marco, took down Marco's story. The book was dictated in prison and copied by hand, as the technology of mass printing had not yet immigrated to Europe from China. As a consequence, there exist today many versions, translations, and reconstructions of the Rustigielo transcript.</p>

<p>Hanshi Pachivas began teaching karate to the general public in he early 1950’s and is the Father of Karate in Florida. Traditional karate grew under his leadership. He supported the growth of authentic karate and promoted many tournaments that were the stepping stone for Florida Karate-ka to gain national prominence. He’s been named “Coach of the Year” six times and traveled around the world as an Ambassador of Karate.</p>
<p>During Hanshi Pachivas’s competition days he was feared for his speed and power. Usually fighting from a cat stance he could use both roundhouse and front kicks and his incredible hand speed. In 1963 Grandmaster Robert Trias invited him the Hombu Dojo in Phoenix, Arizona. This was the beginning of a special relationship that would last for the next 25 years. Hanshi Pachivas is one of just a few to be personally chosen by O’Sensei Trias to be a member of the Trias International Society.</p>
<p>Among his many accomplishments are his students. Three who are members of the Elite Trias International Society. They are Ridgely Abele, Twice World Kata Champion, Andy Horne, and Lori Clapper. Society members are selected on the basis of accomplishment, ability, knowledge, competitive spirit and sincere dedication to the dissemination of true Karatedo. Another of Hanshi Pachivas students whom deserves special mention is Donna Judge. Miss Judge is a eight time and current USKA Woman’s Black Belt World Champion.</p>
<p>Under Grandmaster Trias, Hanshi Pachivas received the highest title within the organization. He is a Chief Instructor and now Director of the United States Karate Association International. Hanshi Pachivas holds a 5th Degree in Judo and in Jujitsu.</p>
<p>Hanshi Pachivas provided training of authentic Karate and Sport Karate for over 40 years. He is concerned with the total development of he individual. He counseled many Karate-ka on the importance of being free from any prejudice, and doing your best is the real winning.</p>
<p>Hanshi Pachivas believes that Karate develops character and Integrity and provides the insight for success in life. He reminds that hard physical training never stops.</p>

With Shai Yallin working as a producer, the band released their debut album, 'A Prescription for Paper Cuts', on September 2005. It was solely independent effort by the band, with Opher Vishnia designing the cover and booklet.</p>

Waituna West Waituna West is a community in the Manawatu, in the North Island of New Zealand. Founded by J.H. Williamson, this small community consists of a primary school, a playcentre, a hall and a church. It used to have a post office, store and blacksmith, but due to Waituna's nearness to the town of Feilding (about a 20 minute drive) these types of businesses closed down many years ago. Primarily a farming area, Waituna West is a tight-nit community.</p>

<p>Founded in 1928, the 40-40 Club is an online community of persons who have taken a vow of <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstinence.html" title="Abstinence">abstinence</a>, to last at least forty days. While the website may at first look as though it is truly trying to convince a person to become abstinent, further examination of the "abstinence guide" available on the website prove to show satirical, often ludicrous undertones; for example, they recommend avoiding any and all persons one might feel sexually attracted to, and in the later stages of the forty day program persons are directed to completely bind themselves in duct tape to prevent themselves from having <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">sexual intercourse</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbating</a>. Obviously doing this could potentially result in serious injury, and anyone would be ill advised to actually commit such an act.</p>
<p>While the organization may be official, scrutiny of the website (and common sense) seem to indicate that the content of what is being advertised is meant to be taken in a satirical or humorous light, and not literally.</p>

<p>The website for the organization claims that undergoing forty days of refraining from any and all sexual acts will purify oneself. While the website does not explictly state that they are motivated by or are following the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> religion, the site does have a reference to a passage in the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Bible_ae59.html" title="Holy Bible">Holy Bible</a> on the subject of abstinence.</p>

<p>The organization offers free membership to any applicant, and will provide that person with a membership card, a forty day calendar for keeping track of how many days of abstinence have gone by, and daily "cold shower" e-mails (that provide information regarding the supposed harmful nature of sex or masturbation, according to the organization).</p>
<p>The website lists small biographies of various members, of which it contains at least several dozen. Whether or not the persons featured in these biographies are actual members of the organization remains a subject of debate, since the website does not feature a forum or other method of public communication from its membership that could validate their actual involvement with the organization.</p>

<p>The organization has made several videos available on their website, each of which portray masturbation and sex in a way that indicates such actions are bad or even <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil">evil</a>. They also sell paintings on the website inspired by their illustrated tutorial of abstinence.</p>

<p>Inazo Nitobe originally wrote <i>Bushido: The Soul of Japan</i> from his home in California in English. The work was intended as an explanation of Japanese distinctness (or <i>nihonjinron</i>) and written specifically for American consumption. Nitobe extends the contempraneously largely fictionalized or idealized samurai lifestyle to all of Japanese culture. There is no discussion of distinction between ethnic groups (Korean, Okinawan, Ryukyu, Ainu, Chinese) or even social classes but rather a presentation of a uniform culture. Before the Meiji Restoration in 1868 Japan upheld a Confucian class system consisting of four major classes. These are samurai (in China scholars), peasants, artisans, and merchants in descending order of social prestige. Other classes such as the various untouchable castes and courtiers existed outside of this system. After 1868 the class system was largely disolved, but diversity remained. <i>Nihonjinron</i> thought deifies uniformity of perception and so</p>
<p>Nitobe applies his rewriting of bushido to Japan as a whole. He addresses in his essay a number of issues including women and the interpretation of nature.</p>
<p>Aside from the heavy use of <i>Nihonjinron</i> (the apparent answer to Orientalism ala Edward Said), the other major problematic point in his argument is the idea of <i>bushido</i>. <i>Bushido</i> may be literally translated as the "Way of the Warrior" but has far deeper, disperate, and historically inspecific meaning. The terminology has been in use for some 1000 years but took on new meaning experiencing a sort of rebirth in both the Edo and Meiji eras. In Edo period, the samurai class had to maintain their claim to power and so created house codes admonishing discipline within their clans and suggesting exceptional lifestyle to those on the outside. In the Meiji, the use of the term "dou" or way over jutsu protected arts and ideologies from being disolved with the offending samurai class. As such, there is no one Bushido that all of Japan uniformly follows.</p>
<p>Nitobe was attempting to explain his country to those on the outside. Japan at this time had to walk the tightrope of maintaining its uniqueness and avoiding Western invasion and colonialism. As such, <i>Nihonjinron</i> and assertations of Japan's special position among the peoples of the world culminated in Japan's expanding empire and the infamous "Co-Prosperity Sphere."</p>

<p>The Solomon Plus is a band from connecticut that plays Punk/Hardcore/Glickcore/Synth/Progressive Rock type stuff.</p>
<p>The Solomon Plus Is:<br />
<b>Greg:</b> Drums<br />
<b>Pat:</b> Guitar, Vocals<br />
<b>Ross:</b> Bass, Vocals<br />
<b>Sam:</b> Keyboard<br /></p>
<p>The Solomon Plus started with 2 members, Greg and Ross. Together with some of their friends they tried to fill up an hour set at the Glastonbury Cofee House with only 15 minutes worth of songs. That was their first mistake. Their second mistake was that they tried to teach their friends the songs literally 15 minutes before they left to play, no joke. Their third mistake was that they were a joke band, and they resorted to giving the crowd their instruments, to avoid any more embarassment.</p>
<p>The next time they went into record their 3rd ep, they had a few serious songs.. and yet another joke. They did this with new fellow band mate: Sam Johno (formally known as "Glick"). Although they were amatures, they got the job done.</p>
<p>For another year, Sam Johno didn't really do anything for the band... and Ross and Greg weren't taking action. They recorded about 26 ep's 2-4 songs long, looking for a drummer to play shows with them the whole way.</p>
<p>Finally in the early 05 school year, long time friend (a year) Pat "Pdiddy" Butkiewicz filled the spot as drummer, and The Solomon Plus was COMPLETE!</p>
<p>In May of 2006, Greg and Pat switched positions to try improve the quality of their music. Pat now plays guitar, while Greg plays drums.</p>

<p>Wanting to revive 1930's music, Karmyn's beautiful and powerful voice showcased her newly released CD entitled "Karmyn Tyler" at the Perot Theatre in Texarkana, Texas on November 20 to an audience of over 1200. The show was more than a concert; it was a Broadway road show! The crowd was wowed by her as she took off her trench coat during the dance number "Big Time" to reveal a 20's black velvet dress with black lace from a slanted hemline and diamonds around her neck. As she said the words "my name in lights above the tile" a big 11 1/2 foot by 4 foot marquee sign dropped flashing with her name spelled out in the middle of the sign. It was absolutely breath taking. Another favorite was a unique arrangement of "Summertime" in which Karmyn wore a black and white Lillie Rubin vintage accordion pleated dress.</p>
<p>Karmyn's Unique Voice will pull you into the song. Never has a vocalist had such voice control with emotions. Karmyn’s hometown calls her Texarkana's Sweetheart!</p>
<p>Karmyn is a former Miss Louisiana and talent winner at Miss America. She is a professional actress/singer and a member of Hollywood chapter of Screen Actors Guild and Actors Equity Association. She has done several national commercials and co-starred in the movie Alabama Love Story. Karmyn is also a member of NARAS (National Academy of Recording Arts and Science – The Grammy’s).</p>

<p>-WARNING- this game is highly addictive</p>
<p>This is a web-based multiplayer strategy game for those who want to jump into a world of politics and dominate the battlefield through words and strength.</p>
<p>At Combat Grounds you can create your own character by choosing between a Navy Seal, a Soldier, or a Terrorist. Where is the enemy? Who are your allies? In an environment where the only certainty you have is yourself, can you survive?</p>
<p>There are several ways to fight, and many strategies to win. Choose your method of approach, find your target, and then attack at the most opportune moment. Win and enjoy the spoils of your victory, or go home in a body bag. Steal your opponents' money and destroy their army, but choose your enemies wisely because they can do the same to you. There are many weapons you can purchase to further enhance your character and dominate stronger adversaries. You can band together with other players and form a crew, from there you can go to war with another crew, make peace, or simply hate them. If you don't like stealing money, that's fine too, try your luck at the Casino, Nuke countries, Missions... The options are endless but always watch your back and plan ahead, or it's you that will become the prey.</p>
