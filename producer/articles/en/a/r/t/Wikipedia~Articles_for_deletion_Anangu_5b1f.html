<p>It is a word. This is not a dictionary. I can't see that it is more significant than any other word.

<li>Delete, but borderline. The author did try to add discussion and context in linguistics, so it's not as offensive as most dictdefs. If the whole entry has been transwiki'd, though, it's now duplicate material. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:49, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You can delete it if you like. I only added an entry for it because someone added a link to it on the <a href="../../../u/l/u/Uluru.html" title="Uluru">Uluru</a> page (not me), and they seemed to misunderstand that it was a <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitjantjatjara.html" title="Pitjantjatjara">Pitjantjatjara</a> word exclusively, hence I put in the little explanation. Perhaps you can instead change the <a href="../../../u/l/u/Uluru.html" title="Uluru">Uluru</a> page to have a link to the Wikidictionary entry, so that this can be clarified a bit better. It seemed to me like there was a great deal of misunderstanding as to what the word meant, so I was trying to help things a bit. Alternatively, it could be expanded in to something that would be encyclopaedia-worthy, as it is rather a broad word. I am sure that someone knowledgeable of aboriginal languages and customs could do that. It's up to you.203.26.206.129 07:31, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, if I can be so bold, what I think is a good suggestion is to do both. Firstly, make a link from the <a href="../../../u/l/u/Uluru.html" title="Uluru">Uluru</a> page (which references Anangu as a word) straight to Wikidictionary (I am sorry, I am a newbie, and don't know how to do that). Secondly, expand on my article here (which is a stub) to make it encyclopaedia worthy. A word like "Anangu" does not simply mean "people". It means a whole way of life. That is what makes it enyclopaedia worthy. Furthermore, it can be used interchangeably to mean all aboriginal people, or all aboriginal people of an area, and has so many different meanings. I am sure that it could be turned in to something encyclopaedia-worthy with the right writer. Please can you change this to a stub, and deal with it in that manner. 203.26.206.129 07:37, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, just another bit. This particular word is also used with lots of Aboriginal businesses. So it could also be a disambiguous entry to link to the various businesses that use the word "Anangu" as part of their name. I can think of a dozen off the top of my head. 203.26.206.129 07:41, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - the Anangu are one of the more well known Australian Aboriginal tribes or peoples being included with the people associated with Uluru / Ayers Rock. The word does not just mean people it refers to particular people. I am appalled that anyone would nominate an article about a people for deletion. The article certainly needs expansion but nominating it for deletion should not be the way to achieve that.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 10:40, 23 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that that highlights the importance of having an argument, because Anangu is like saying "I am aboriginal" or "I am a member of a specific tribe". Anangu is not the name of a tribe (nor do aborigines use the name tribe - they refer to themselves as being from a particular country, such as being from Arrente country or from the Pitlands, or sometimes from a certain community). Furthermore, Anangu isn't just used in Uluru/Ayer's Rock. It's used in a large number of other places. I don't know the full extent of it though. But in the Ngaanyatjarra Lands, it is very important, probably more than in Uluru/Ayer's Rock. And the Ngaanyatjarra people have no claim over Uluru. 203.26.206.129 07:55, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The page as it stands is not offensive and has interest. It apears to be factual, and to have considerable potential for expansion. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 10:48, 23 May 2005 (UTC) (By the way, we should be careful not to confuse the source of an article with its content. Sure, the anon user who created the article has also created several patent nonsense articles that have been, or soon will be (quite properly) deleted or redirected - but this is irrelevant. <i>This</i> article is fine. Keep it. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a>)
<ul>
<li>I think that you should be very wary of writing such personal attacks in a talk page. It is inappropriate and against Wikipedia policy, which could lead to your account being banned. 203.26.206.129 07:49, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - a lot of the content of <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitjantjatjara.html" title="Pitjantjatjara">Pitjantjatjara</a> actually belongs to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anangu.html" title="Anangu">Anangu</a>, but I'd be happy to keep both. Unfortunately, we don't have anybody here from <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernabella%2C_South_Australia_0df8.html" title="Ernabella, South Australia">Ernabella</a> to enter any first-hand information. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">ScottDavis</a> 13:25, 23 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have been to Ernabella, and to most of the Central Australian communities. But I don't know where to reference stuff like that. Why do you say Ernabella specifically? I thought it was more <a href="../../../n/g/a/Ngaanyatjarra.html" title="Ngaanyatjarra">Ngaanyatjarra</a> that strongly use those words, and that is <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warburton.html" title="Warburton">Warburton</a> and the like more than <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernabella.html" title="Ernabella">Ernabella</a>. 203.26.206.129 07:49, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This conversation demonstrates the importance of articles like <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anangu.html" title="Anangu">Anangu</a>! I chose <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernabella%2C_South_Australia_0df8.html" title="Ernabella, South Australia">Ernabella, South Australia</a> as the most important town, as I'm from South Australia, and associate "Anangu" most strongly with Anangu <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitjantjatjara.html" title="Pitjantjatjara">Pitjantjatjara</a>, who own (freehold!) a large tract of north western SA. You picked <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warburton%2C_Western_Australia_477f.html" title="Warburton, Western Australia">Warburton, Western Australia</a> in <a href="../../../n/g/a/Ngaanyatjarra.html" title="Ngaanyatjarra">Ngaanyatjarra</a> country, and others have identified it with <a href="../../../u/l/u/Uluru.html" title="Uluru">Uluru</a>. Incidentally, I think I've heard Aborigines use the words "tribe" or "clan". It's a smaller grouping than "nation". I suspect Anangu is the "nation" composed of several of these other groups, like <a href="../../../n/g/a/Ngarrindjeri.html" title="Ngarrindjeri">Ngarrindjeri</a> nation consists of a number of groups along the Murray River. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">ScottDavis</a> 12:47, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I have only ever heard aborigines refer to themselves as being from a "country" or "land", never "nation", "tribe" or "clan". But maybe I am talking to the wrong ones. The word "country" they use to mean their language group, such as <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrente.html" title="Arrente">Arrente</a>, <a href="../../../n/g/a/Ngaanyatjarra.html" title="Ngaanyatjarra">Ngaanyatjarra</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitjantjatjara.html" title="Pitjantjatjara">Pitjantjatjara</a> etc, while the word "land" can either mean that, or else simply their community/town or a smaller area like an outstation. We have maps at work which divide Australia up in to aboriginal countries, and only list the traditional aboriginal lands. Quite interesting. You can get one from Institute for Aboriginal Development if you want one. I think they are in the range of $60-$100 each. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInternodeuser_a2c6.html" title="User:Internodeuser">Internodeuser</a> 08:48, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
