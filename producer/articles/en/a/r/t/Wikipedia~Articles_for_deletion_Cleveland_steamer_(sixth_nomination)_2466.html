<li><b>Ye gods, delete!</b> I've seen some horrifying stuff doing my newpage patrol thing, but this takes the prize.

BTW, I have a <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexicon.html" title="Lexicon">lexicon</a> of slang or two that have "definitions" that look just like this article. Definition plus examples of usage in sentence form or quotation. All it needs now is called a noun and given an IPA pronunciation transcription. I highly doubt Wiktionary would take this, as we aren't quite the dumping ground Wikipedians think they are. Also, I first heard of this in 1992 when it was college slang, not fodder for TV jokesters, and there was no mention of the "steamroller motion of the buttocks." I have a conventional ass, and mine won't move 360 deg. It sounds like an embellishment. I believe the common-sense etymology involving how feces steam in cool temperatures. Origin in 1992, to me, means neologism banned according to <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. This appears to have been a very, very bad article, a real troublemaker, a point of contention, and a source of snicker material for vandals for a very long time. I must question badlydrawnjeff's neutrality (but not his zeal) as he has consistently voted to strongly keep this without a single rational reason that I can find in six AfD's. I don't understand "valid pop culture term" as a reason to keep. This is a contentious issue, and I hope you don't mind having a newbie like me chime in, as perhaps I may offer a new perspective after researching this for a day. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Spunky_Toffee_af7b.html" title="User:Mr Spunky Toffee">Mr Spunky Toffee</a> 19:29, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>I wish to enter into the record</b> an AfD of an article that seems to be comparable to this Cleveland steamer article: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Dead_prostitutes_in_popular_culture_ea5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dead prostitutes in popular culture">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dead prostitutes in popular culture</a>. Boy, I had a heck of a time finding this little gem, googling for garbage. Dead prostitutes are a common joke in "popular culture." I'm sure even Family Guy had a dead hooker or two. So, why the resounding delete on an article on what is essentially a pop culture joke and list of examples, just like Cleveland steamer? Maybe an admin could undelete and compare the two. "Dead prostitutes" apparently had a sole author and no serial AfD's, and those are the only differences I can detect at this point. Oh, and the fact that it's pretty easy to figure out what a dead hooker is without reading a sentence-long definition. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Spunky_Toffee_af7b.html" title="User:Mr Spunky Toffee">Mr Spunky Toffee</a> 17:37, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now that I think about it, it seems to me that an article on dead hookers would be more encyclopedic than <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_steamer.html" title="Cleveland steamer">Cleveland steamer</a>, since the dead hooker is often used as a plot device in TV and movies as something unpleasant that must be disposed of carefully and with great difficulty. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Spunky_Toffee_af7b.html" title="User:Mr Spunky Toffee">Mr Spunky Toffee</a> 17:40, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Abstain and</s> comment</b>. This nomination was made less than a week after the last AfD closed. There is very little chance of the outcome changing in such a short time, so this was probably premature and a bit of a time-waster. Despite the fact that I'd be happy to see it deleted (see my reasons in the last several discussions), I don't think enough time has passed for this AfD to be relevant.

<li>Chaning my&#160;!vote. Since it's here, I might as well... <b>Delete or transwiki to Wiktionary</b>. This is a definition and a list of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attestation" class="extiw" title="wikt:attestation">attestations</a> in the real world. There isn't a scrap of encyclopedic content in the article. Previous AfD keep votes were given because they saw potential for the article <i>becoming</i> encyclopedic if only someone would include some decent sources, and it has never happened after the AfD closed. Given that repeated failure, I don't think it ever will until the Real World does some academic or semi-academic treatment of the subject and creates some decent sources for us. In other words, I agree with Improv wholeheartedly. Also see <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_World_Will_Not_End_Tomorrow_96f0.html" title="Wikipedia:The World Will Not End Tomorrow">The World Will Not End Tomorrow</a>: if this is going to be encyclopedic in the <i>future</i>, we can wait until then to have an article, can't we. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 22:14, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Inclusion of this article does not really advance the interests of the encyclopedia, overall. It's a very, very marginally notable entity. Let's say it adds .0001 <i>encyclopeditrons</i> of value to the Wikipedia. Then on the other hand you have the chance of this being picked up and used to give a bad impression of Wikipedia, invitation to vandalism, attracting the undesirable sort of editor, really inappropriate for children (and yes I know we are not censored for minors, but I don't think <i>this</i> is what is meant), general ickiness, and so on. We can say that overall the article <i>subtracts</i> .0002 <i>encyclopeditrons</i> of value. Therefore it is bad for the 'pedia, and the closing admin should <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> and delete it regardless. That is what <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> is for. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 23:13, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>LOL! That is one of the best arguments for delete I have ever seen! I completely endorse this reasoning: the existence of a class of articles whose removal <i>increases</i> the net worth of the project is something I have long appreciated but not found a way to put into words.

And <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> can work the other way - it can be kept because although it isn't much more than a definition, it won't be found in many dictionaries and thus is useful.

<li><b>Transwiki to wiktionary.</b> <i>Any</i> word, term, or phrase could be turned into such an "article" consisting of its definition plus a list of some instances of its usage in culture.

<li><b>Keep</b> No way should an article be made to face a sixth AfD. I don't accept the argument that a definition and a few instances means that it's a dicdef. It's hardly in mainstream usage (I hope!) and is a valid and verifiable entry into the sexual activities area of Wikipedia. The integrity of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Category%7ESexual_acts_0196.html" title="Category:Sexual acts">Category:Sexual acts</a> is at stake if we start arguing about what's encyclopedic and what's a dicdef.

<dd>Facial and felching are commonly used terms for real sexual acts, and in both cases major subgenres of pornography appear to be based on them. This is not a widely used term and no subgenres of pornography appear to be based on it.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The above reply contains numerous wildly unverified claims. Ironic, given the editor's position on why the article should be deleted. Additionally, drawing comparisons between felching/etc. and cleveland steamer is inappropriate, as the former is (as has been mentioned) notable due to its incidence in pornography and related areas, whereas the latter is notable due to its permience(sp?) througout mainstream popular culture. -- <a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">Y|yukichigai</a> 11:32, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>: As has been mentioned, this is a highly suspect nomination, particularly given the short lapse in time between the previous nomination. Additionally, the article clearly meets the core qualifications of notability and usefulness.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I've looked over all the AfDs and, while I agree with most of the nominators that this is disgusting (I seriously wish I could scrub the info out of my brain), that's not a reason to delete it. I believe this is more than a simple definition. This article should focus on the origins of the phrase and how it has seeped into popular culture. So this article just needs an overhaul.
