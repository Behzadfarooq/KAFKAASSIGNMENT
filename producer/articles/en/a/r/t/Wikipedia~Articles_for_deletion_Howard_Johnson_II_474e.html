<p>Private Jonhson, of the US Army, is one of the three thousand plus soldiers who died in Iraq. However, some believe that just him belonging in the 507 Maintenance Unit, the same unit as Jessica Lynch and the first female KIA since Vietnam. For those using the Google test, his name will appear in many locations, mostly due to many websites either being dedicated to the 507th or to listing the names of all Iraqi dead, US and collaition. My contention is that other than being killed in Iraq and part of a unit, he has not done anything else notable to warrant an article on Wikipedia. (Most of the content is about what happened at a memorial service, two medals presented and a park named after him). <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 05:43, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, First soldier from Alabama killed in OIF. The Governor of Alabama attended his funeral along with a US Congressman and Senator. Eulogized on the floor on the US Senate. Name not only appears on standard listings of OIF dead but twice in the Congressional Record and Alabama Congressman Joe Bonner's website. He is also in Jessica Lynch's book as well as Richard S. Lowry's book <i>Marines in the Garden of Eden</i>. The City of Mobile and the Alabama legislature have both passed resolutions honoring him. If the 2,000 death in OIF/OEF can have a Wikipeda page why not Howard Johnson II? Ehrentitle 00:27, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
