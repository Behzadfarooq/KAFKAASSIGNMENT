<p>This article was prod'ed by another member, with the reason stated as "School article with absolutely no notability asserted; the page is nothing more than a directory listing; only 86 total and 40 unique Google hits for the school's name, inc.

<li>There is no consensus on notability for schools. In such cases, the only rule is that the article be <a href="../../../f/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7EFame_and_importance_8fa9.html#No" title="Wikipedia talk:Fame and importance">verifiable and NPOV</a>. None of the policies or guidelines you direct me to says that a verifiable and NPOV article on a school, even if one assumes notability is not established, should be deleted.

<p>An editor argues that this is an attack page. I disagree and vote <b>Keep</b>, given the news sources cited in the article.

<li><b>Delete</b> This is an attack on this person by some one who is obviously Catholic and disagrees with him. One of the citations is a blog, which is hardly proof of anything and the other citations are all from religous organizations except one which was reporting and attack on this man.

And if it is a different person the result will be that people who google the name will be confused, it is hardly a name like smith or jones. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_140.211.55.195_9555.html" title="Special:Contributions/140.211.55.195">140.211.55.195</a> (<a href="../../../1/4/0/User_talk%7E140.211.55.195.html" title="User talk:140.211.55.195">talk</a>) 00:33, 11 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<dl>
<dd>"war crime"&#160;: Not a single mention.</dd>
<dd>"allegation"&#160;: Mentioned a few times, but all in relation to allegations of <i>Palestinian</i> misconduct. We've got:
<ul>
<li>A link to "EU investigation into Allegations of Incitement to Violence in Palestinian Authority textbooks".</li>
<li>Some "false allegations of a massacre of thousands of Palestinians" that were later disproved</li>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The subject matter - documented allegations - is worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia, we just need to make sure those allegations are <i>addressed</i> in a NPOV manner. The one concern I have about merging this into the main article is size - the main page is 69 KB already. If it's decided to combine all the offshoot articles back into the main one, and turn it into one massive NPOV article, I suppose that'd be fine, as long as other offshoots like <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_suicide_bombers_in_the_Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_4449.html" title="Child suicide bombers in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Child suicide bombers in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_massacres_committed_during_the_Al-Aqsa_Intifada_5614.html" title="List of massacres committed during the Al-Aqsa Intifada">List of massacres committed during the Al-Aqsa Intifada</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_lynching_in_Ramallah_0098.html" title="The lynching in Ramallah">The lynching in Ramallah</a> are similarly merged back in.

I would like to see allegations of both sides given their own section on the main page, and only if they become too large should there be a subpage, but one in which they appear together. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 19:18, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd be perfectly happy with a combined allegations page for both sides - mention all the allegations on the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a> main page, then link off to the allegations page for more description. As long as both sides' allegations are treated the same way. While on the subject of allegations, I think it's a bit POV for <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a> to have only two photos - one of a confirmed Palestinian suicide bombing, and one of an Israeli shooting that was alleged to be staged. Aren't there any photos around of verified Palestinian casualties to use instead?

<li>Hey Tewfik - me again. My point is still valid. But I do think that these lists can be combined. The number of civilian Palestinians killed far outnumber civilian Israels -- in these various lists that fact tends to get lost. Also I find that one problem with your perspective is that you feel that military deaths are just collatoral damage, and thus not questionable, thus giving the side with a formal military a general pass. It comes across as convenient reasoning around your blindspot. --70.48.240.99 04:31, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That would be fine except that very little of the information in the entry is actually about "Allegations of war crimes..." - most of it is simply unrelated data being used to present a novel argument (OR style). There would be no "List of massacres..." if there was only one or two massacres, and I don't see this page as needing to exist if only one or two claims exist which could be dealt with on the main article. If however there is enough content to warrant a separate entry, then I would wholeheartedly agree. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 01:52, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm. Fair call on the OR. The article needs to find citations for its arguments, not just its facts. (i.e. if the article says, "Israel did X, and X is considered a war crime", it needs to find sources for both "Israel did X" and "X is considered a war crime".)

It describes the hypothesis, but it doesn't say "this is what happened". Just to be clear, I'm not trying to compare these war crime allegations to a conspiracy theory. My point is that there's enough published material out there for us to outline the <b>allegations</b> of war crimes (by either side) in an NPOV manner. But it's <b>not</b> Wikipedia's place to say whether or not they <b>were</b> war crimes.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to be clear, when I previously said that both this article and <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a> were violating <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a>, I wasn't suggesting that <i>either</i> be deleted. This is just a case where <i>both</i> articles need to be edited to be brought into line with policy. Tewfik is quite correct when he says that this article shouldn't be allowed to just present a list of facts regarding (blank), then make the argument that (blank) was a war crime. It needs to find sources which explicitly say that. However, judging by the number of Google hits that the phrase <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=israeli+%22war+crimes%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=israeli+%22war+crimes%22" rel="nofollow">israeli "war crimes"</a> gets, I feel confident that we can find several sources which not only list facts, but make explicit allegations about Israeli war crimes. Actually, the very first page that shows up on Google, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4580139.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4580139.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC NEWS | Middle East | Amnesty slams Israel 'war crimes'</a>, is as good a place as any to start. The <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/report2005/index-eng" class="external text" title="http://web.amnesty.org/report2005/index-eng" rel="nofollow">Amnesty International Report 2005</a> that it quotes from could also be used as a source.

<dd>You seem to confuse NPOV, which is policy, with balance, which is not. It is entirely possible to have an NPOV article dealing with allegations against only one party in a conflict. I would, by the same token, object to deletion of an article on allegations of Palestinian terror during the intifadah.

<li><b>Comment</b> Would it be proper to have an Accusations of Palestinian genocidal intent article? I would argue that if this article should be kept, then people should have no problems if I later create that article. Another nice article to have from the pro-Palestinian point of view would be Accusations of Israeli participation in the alleged global Jewish conspiracy. I think the question we face is "Is Wikipedia the place to comment on every argument (whether it be mainstream or extremest) for every issue under the sun, or is that <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">not within its mission</a>?".

<ul>
<li>Let me clarify. This article is meant to cover pro-Palestine arguments. If we keep this, in order to be balanced, we should also allow articles covering pro-Israel arguments (such as Accusations of Palestinian genocidal intent). In addition, we should cover other pro-Palestine articles, such as Accusations of Israeli participation in the alleged global Jewish conspiracy, as we should not selectively cover extremist anti-Israel arguments. -- <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where"><b><font color="blue">Where</font></b></a> 13:41, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see what you mean. What I mean is that every article should carry its own weight. I mustn't be created merely on the premise that a POV article exists, therefore a counterPOV one must exist. If one deems an article to be POV, then one should edit it to remove POV, not create a new one with ones own POV.

<ul>
<li>I would agree in principle, but as of now there is no content accusing Israel on this article, and I imagine that any allegations regarding the Palestinians could fit in the main article. I would be equally concerned with creating a separate article not dictated by space etc. which would in practice only deal with the Palestinians.

Where is the "reliable sources" here? Who is the judge of what accusation and allegation is "reliable" or "unreliable"? If we ask most people, they will say that <i>any</i> accusation or allegation is "unreliable"! If this article is kept, then this system is a nepotism where people gang up and vote delete on articles they hate and vote keep on articles they like making this completely pointless. If there are rules and regulations in place, then they should hold true for <i>all</i> articles, not just because of the preferences and prejudices of people.

Forums, due to their anonymous and unverified nature, are not a reliable source-though sometimes a post on a forum can point you to better sources which <i>would</i> be considered reliable, I've had that happen more than once Googling for references. As to smoked meatloaf, let's say it really takes off. A couple of big, respectable cooking websites cover it, followed by some "food section" coverage in newspapers. <i>Now</i> we got what we need-multiple non-trivial reliable mentions. At that point, it's time to create an article!

I've already added "smoked" as a cooking method to the <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meatloaf.html" title="Meatloaf">Meatloaf</a> page so this could just be redirected.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:13, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think the prevailing sentiment should be reconsidered. There are 39,000 English-language ghits for llchan, most of them still live. Almost all of them are postings on various blogs, IRC chanels, and the like. About 5% refer to the boards themselves, and the rest to the content for them. I do not think it is reasonable to find much on this topic in other media.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It is very strange of WP not to accomodate the development of new media, published in whatever way that media is naturally published. We may need to evelop new criteria and this is where we should start. The concept of such software is surely notable--there are a number of related articles. This is a derivative of what seems to be the most widely used program, and notable as such</dd>
<dd>There is no problem finding material--the difficulty with V is only the nature of the sources. It is time WP recognized that this is 2007, not 2004. Books write about books, and blogs write about blogs. I've added a ref from what seems to be a reliable 3rd party online journal, and a good third party directory refered to elsewhere in WP. I think that solves the basic problem. Documentation of many of the details will come from appropriate sources for the subject, once WP learns to accept them.</dd>
<dd>I once more am grateful to an AfD for widening my education into previously unexplored areas, when the people who do know the area won't do the work of finding references.

<li>Just a couple of relevant links... there is apparently an online petition to stop the school closure on ipetitions (can't link because it is blacklisted)... not that this constitutes a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>.

I'm not Scottish, so I have no idea how Hamilton relates to South Lanarkshire geographically or politically, but I assume this is the same school.

<li>It is interesting that you should say that as Alien is my favorite movie of all time, I have seen it more times than I have seen any other movie.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I can't justify a delete because there aren't really insignificant characters in Alien, but I'm not sure that Wikipedia is the right place for character stories. If anything, merge the characters with their respective films. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 02:09, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I assume we are throwing in our fourpenneth on all 4 nominations here so.... General point: If anyone wants references and sources for anything then drop in the appropriate tag and someone will try and address it. Obviusly there are the fims bit, if you want one from a source other than the films, then <i>Beautiful Monsters</i> covers them all and there are other volumes for other films <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_%28film_series%29#Further_reading" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_%28film_series%29#Further_reading" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> - the first step is to ask for them though (no one has). I would also query their being defined as "non-notable secondary characters" in the proposal - they are important supporting characters in a major (even iconic) film. There are, potentially, non-notable members of the cast but they don't have an entry. Let's look at some of them: Kane has the most iconic scene in the film (in fact it is one of the most famous in cinema). Bishop plays an important role in the first 2 films and appears in the third (reappearing as another version of the android at the end) and appears as the man the design is based on in another film - surely a character whose appearances span 4 films (as well as appearing in a whole range of spin-off merchandise) has to tick the notable box. I could go on but I hope I have made my point. (<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperor_dcf0.html" title="User:Emperor">Emperor</a> 02:18, 11 January 2007 (UTC))</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>The reason I chose not to ask for sources was that I have a pretty good knowledge of Alien literature and the like, this is not to say that it is impossible that some of these article could be sourced, I would just be surprised. The problem is not that these characters are not important within the film (that is why they are mentioned in the plot summaries) but that there are no external sources referenced. In order to be notable in Wikipedia terms the character has to be the subject in multiple third party sources, non of these characters are. The subject of Beaurtiful Monsters is not Ash or Dallas but the Alien and Predator series.</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well yes I doubt there are any actual books about the characters - the best you'll usually get are books on the films (or possibly some media studies papers - the Ripley entry also needs beefing up in the reference department with that in mind). The problem is we are in a bit of a Catch 22 - no one has bothered asking for references and the entries are damned for not providing them. There is a process and we seem to have skipped a stage. I doubt I could find enough references in the time requied for all of the entries. I also think it is unfortunate they appear to have been lumped together as less strong cases will drag down the keepers - I genuinely think it is a mistake throwing Bishop in with the others as his multiple film appearances should make it a dead cert if it had been proposed on its own.

<li>"Simpsons are irrelevant to this discussion" - It is entirely possible that the other fictional articles you mentioned should also be deleted. It may very well be pop culture information worth remembering well into the future - but the question here is whether Wikipedia is the right place for it. Much of the article appears to be plot summary of the Alien film, which is already provided in the main Alien article. I think this could be merged back to the main article with no great loss. <a href="../../../z/a/k/User%7EZaku_kai_3334.html" title="User:Zaku kai">Zaku kai</a> 20:15, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> Either into the movie itself, or a list of characters from the movie. I'm not especially troubled with the problem of sourcing these articles, these are notable movies, all of these characters are more than just a walk-on guy, but if you object to them having their own article, they should be well-described in the movie's page. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:24, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep some, merge some.</b> Bishop is certainly not a minor character, and the article on him provides a good synthesis of a lot of detail from the multiple movies he appears in, so I'd&#160;!vote a strong keep for him. Since Ash is only in the one movie, his information could be merged, but he's fairly central to the plot and I think deserving of a separate article. For the others, I'd keep them if I ran the world, but would be happy to compromise on a merge to Alien or a new Alien characters article, since they're not as important. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 16:59, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That'd be a suitable compromise (I was always suprised there wasn't one but having some many character entries meant it wasn't worth creating one). Would it be worth making it a list of characters in the Alien movie series or just for the Alien film with longer character outlines (I'd slightly favour the latter). As per what I said above and Pinball's comments I think Bishop needs his own entry. I have done some digging and can expand the entry to look at the academic studies of him (as he touches on various aspects - I'll expand his entry soon).

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rurouni_Kenshin_8316.html" title="Rurouni Kenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a>, whilst making clear that it is a fictional creation. I would argue against mentioning it in <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katana.html" title="Katana">Katana</a>, as it's not a katana - any actual 'sakabatō' are just fan memorabilia. One might as well put <a href="../../../b/o/k/Bokken.html" title="Bokken">bokken</a> under the same heading, as it has more in common with real Japanese swords than a 'sakabatō' does: bokken are actually used in Japanese martial arts! The general consensus on Sword Forum International<a href="http://forums.swordforum.com/showthread.php?&amp;threadid=18705" class="external autonumber" title="http://forums.swordforum.com/showthread.php?&amp;threadid=18705" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> is that the 'sakabatō' is a fiction, and while cheap decorative replicas can be bought, they are not fully functional and could not be used in martial arts. The claim on the Japanese wiki of a pineapple being cut in half validating the blade's efficacy is laughable to anyone familiar with real test cutting. Also, the traditional way of making katana precludes having a cutting edge on the back, as the sword bends naturally towards the blunt soft-steel side during the cooling stage of the forging process. <a href="../../../o/r/o/User%7EOroshi_93e6.html" title="User:Oroshi">Oroshi</a> 05:48, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I only suggested a mention in <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katana.html" title="Katana">katana</a> because I originally went there to find information about the sakabato, not knowing the name "sakabato" at the time. I am sure others will do the same. It seems to be a common enough question in other forums, that the katana article should at least mention it briefly by way of disclaimer somewhere.</li>
<li>Fascinating forum you pointed out. Reading a few pages into it, it seems that traditional forging processes (even simple things like a higher-temp quench) can be used to reverse-curve a katana blade, and some have been forged by forum participants. But the consensus is that these blades aren't historical, aren't practical for sword fighting, although some swordsmiths in Japan reasonably would have experimented with such a design before abandoning it. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 21:22, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd just like to point out that I doubt people will be looking for I walk Alone (song) specifically. I imagine that they would either capitalize the first letter in each word or just capitalize the I in the title. It's pretty unlikely they'll not capitalize walk but then do it for Alone. So while I don't object to a redirect for "I walk alone" or "I Walk Alone" (as both would be common search terms), this random capitalization is NOT common. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 14:39, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This has been done for ages, though I've clarified it in the article. The problem isn't that the article doesn't assert notability - it's that people with no knowledge of the larger subject (webcomics) are making judgments of notability, and people are treating this as a democracy in that "two wolves and a sheep deciding what to have for lunch" sort of way. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 23:32, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, the problem is that the definition of reliable sources being applied to articles like this is useless, and has nothing to do with reliability. The sources being used for this article would be considered reliable for any reputable study of the subject. They are what would be used for scholarship and journalism about the subject. But this whole debate has nothing to do with reliability, and everything to do with using the word "reliable" to mean "notable," which is misleading and wrong. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 01:09, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure - basically, there are two types of webcomics. The first are independent ones - self-published, either hosted on the writer's own webspace or on a free webcomic host. These comics are sometimes notable - indeed, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_4103.html" title="Penny Arcade">Penny Arcade</a>, which would be a strong contender for "if we include only one webcomic, this must be it..." falls into this category. Then there's the second category - comics that have been picked up by one of what one might call the webcomic syndicates (Though syndicate is an odd term, since there's not always the sort of external publication that one gets from a newspaper syndicate). These syndicates are picked by editors who are respected figures in the webcomics community, and create a sort of brand identity of webcomics. <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> and the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Tales_9ad4.html" title="Modern Tales">Modern Tales</a> set are probably the two most important, but also on the list is <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayfree_Press_6295.html" title="Dayfree Press">Dayfree Press</a>, which has some of the most important strips going on in webcomics - <a href="../../../q/u/e/Questionable_Content_a910.html" title="Questionable Content">Questionable Content</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur_Comics_f693.html" title="Dinosaur Comics">Dinosaur Comics</a>, and <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girly.html" title="Girly">Girly</a>. The editor of Dayfree Press, for example, was named one of the 25 big names in webcomics in 2004 by Comixpedia - one of the major places one goes if one is looking for information about the larger webcomics community. (Websnark and The Webcomics Review are the two other biggies at present.) Able and Baker is a member of Dayfree, and has thus been identified by an important figure in webcomics as an important webcomic, and has become part of a significant brand identity in the webcomics world. Ergo it is a notable topic in the coverage of webcomics. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:33, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It is picked up by Dayfree Press, which is indeed a notable "syndicate". That does mean that it has been identified as an important webcomic. <i>That does not mean that the particular webcomic is notable, or that the particular comic has reliable sources</i>. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 17:36, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, the comic is a reliable primary source. The Dayfree website would also be a reliable primary source. I'm not sure I see the problem here.

<p><b>Delete</b>, the article as it stands now is a perfect example of what happens with articles about non-notable fictional works; there's nothing but plot summary. Unless you can say something substantial about it, or cite some secondary source, there isn't a legitimate piece of article content to be had. The fact that it's published in a syndicate can be reflected in a list of comics published by that syndicate, and it doesn't really take more than one line there to give a decent summary of what it is. the rest is just getting into a level of detail unverifiable by secondary sources. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 03:06, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ye Winston Old English Bulldogge was speedily deleted, ostensibly as a breed failing to assert notability, but dog breeds don't have to pass <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#A7</a> so the deletion was overturned at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2007_January_5_ae3b.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 January 5">deletion review</a> and the discussion now moves here.

<li><b>Delete</b> per the <i>total</i> lack of verifiable information and lack of available sourcing. Currently the article has no assertion of notability and the only source is a homepage for the breed. The AKC doesn't register this as a breed, and probably consider them to be nothing more than mixes with consistent characteristics. Searching for the term Winston Olde English Bulldogge brings the Wikipedia article and Wikipedia mirrors as the first results, and the search also returns results for Old English Bulldog, making it almost impossible to differentiate without checking each and every source. If this has been contested so hard, the editor doing the fighting should have produced some sources by now. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 14:54, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information. This appears to be a list of albums a particular magazine gave a particular rating; Wikipedia should not be a database for all critical reviews of everything (<a href="../../../s/l/i/Slippery_slope.html" title="Slippery slope">because where do you stop</a>?). This posting was previously speedy deleted as a copyvio, but while I think the cover gallery fails to qualify as fair use here, I don't think the list in this article is itself a copyright infringement; the magazine didn't make the list (as far as I know), it instead made a series of choices that can simply be documented in list form. This list is akin more to a list of films Roger Ebert gave thumbs up, rather than Roger Ebert's Top Ten best films of 2006. Anyway, we should delete it based on the topic to give it finality. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 02:54, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aside from the fact that this article's title is a complete MISNOMER (none of these characters are major in any way other than being fighters), it's more of a list of trivia than an encyclopedic list og characters. Jonny2x4 03:19, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Has potential. I'm not sure about renaming to "Understanding of Islam in the West". That's a vast topic, and would encompass everything from the 6th Century to 9-11.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Use of the term "The West" in the context of this article is unencyclopedic, due to its ambiguity, and because the terminology is POV-centric. What is "The West"? And, more importantly, who defines it? Is it the US, the Americas, Europe? Does it include Australia, even though that continent is geographically east? What about the large portion of Russia that is part of the Asian continent? Are Israelis "Westerners"? What about Palestinians living in the same region? Why separate the views of eastern non-Muslims (Indians, Chinese, Japanese, etc.) from those of western non-Muslims? What about the views of Muslims who live in "The West"? Are these not "Western" views of Muhammad? A much clearer, less POV-centric, more encyclopedic title for this article would be "Non-Muslim views of Muhammad." If the article is kept, a summary paragraph will still need to be included in the Muhammad article. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 18:23, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Keeping a summary paragraph with a pointer to longer article is quite normal. As for the 'West', it is a bit vague, but not unencyclopedic. It is used for short hand in many academic discussions to mean Europe, America and those part of the world sharing much of their their cultural assumptions (so yes Australia and NZ etc.). THe nations that would once largely have been seen as predominantly Christian. As for Muslims in the West, there's no explicit reason why they shouldn't be included, although probably only in so far as their views might be distinguished from other Islamic views of the prophet (I don't know whether they can be or not).--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 18:32, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The article currently does not define what it means by "The West." If the term is commonly used in academic discussions to mean Europe and culturally related countries, that ought to be clarified and works cited to support the distinction. I found that <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-Islamic_views_of_Muhammad_13b8.html" title="Non-Islamic views of Muhammad">Non-Islamic views of Muhammad</a> already exists, and this article is redundant with that one.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The section for which this article is supposedly an expansion is actually entitled "Medieval Christian views of Muhammad"--that's a huge disconnect. I would have to agree with Dmz5. This article is a synthesis of views of various authors (heavily weighted toward Muslim scholars), and thus constitutes original research.

You can look "West" up in a dictionary: it means European civilisation and its offshoots. Voltaire, Gibbon, Carlyle et al. emerged from the same culture as Dante and Peter the Venerable and this article should examine the shifting attitudes of Westerners towards Muhammad (it is often very difficult to assess just how Christian, agnostic or atheist some of the major Western figures are after the Enlightenment). Hindus and Buddhists have had a completely different historical experiences of Islam so their attitudes towards Muhammad should have separate articles. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 09:12, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Prod patrol bumping from Prod for more consensus. Prod nominator's concern was "no content, just taxobox, trivia, and links". I found it, wasn't sure what to do, and left a long note on the talk page. I asked for another prod patroller to look; the first to do so wasn't sure what to do either. I can't quickly see if there is either 1) a species or variant known by this name, or 2) a common mutation referenced in scientific literature (either would merit a keep) or just 3) a few herds of different deer species that have white mutations and are marginally notable therefore, but nobody ever discusses more than their local herd. Please treat as a technical nomination with no opinion from me. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:50, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> or preferably redirect to a better explanation somewhere else (I was the prod nominator). There's no such animal, as far as I can tell--the various populations are different species. Thus, the taxobox is actually somewhat misleading, since it suggests that this is a species. Obviously, a proper article could be written on Deer albinism or some such, but that article doesn't exist yet. This one doesn't either--it has no content at all. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 04:27, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There is no reason given for considering white deer notable enough for their own article (contrast with <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_elephant.html" title="White elephant">White elephant</a>, which is significant for cultural and linguistic reasons). This is just another example of albinism, which exists in many species, and white deer aren't particularly notable except as curiosities. Taxobox is also misleading, as there are several species of deer. A white deer is not a separate species. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 07:31, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> white deer are important in mythology (though not as much as white elephants) and "albinism in deer" is not a good rename because not all white deer are albinos. There are also special laws dealing with white deer.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I think that they should be kept - i have asked for certain ones to be AfD and reduced the number of daughter articles. If you refer to User:Gnangarra/Aquinas - this is where i got the idea of he daughter articles from. Now...if you were to say AfD the House System page (which has been listed AfD but doesnt appear above) then you would have to AfD the page on Scotch College, Perth which lists its school's houses. The boarding page is especially significant as boarding was the foundation of the school. If you are to delete the pages - then fucking merge them back into the article - all the info on there is bloody valuable.

<li>I'm confused. What's the difference between "built on" and "verified by"? Also, what secondary (i.e. external) sources verify the information in the articles?

<ul>
<li>The Heritage Council and ABSA pages are trivial, refer not to any of the topics of these articles but to Aquinas College generally, and don't verify any of the information in these articles. I can't access the South Perth gov't page, so I can't tell what information it verifies, but it's only one ref in one article and I'm not sure what encyclopedic information city council meeting transcripts could convey anyway. I don't see the other sources you refer to listed in the articles. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:51, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An article I'm working on at the moment depends quite heavily on council minutes, which are available via State Records or if recent enough via the council themselves. WP:OR says we can't draw *conclusions* from primary facts (gazettals etc) beyond stating the fact itself, but the official published council minutes and unpublished minute books often do go heavily into the whys and wherefores, casting light on why a decision was made and what factors were highest in their consideration, so provide a reliable source by which to derive these assertions. May not be relevant to this article but a point nonetheless. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 03:44, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - To persons associated with youth sports in Western Australia. The PSA would have to be the most highly regarded youth sports league in WA.

<dd>I agonised over this. And changed my mind twice. But there is no consensus to delete. It seems that the existence of the thing is verifiable. Thus the barebones of WP:V are satisfied. What isn't satisfied, is reliable sources that indicate notability. But ultimately WP:N and WP:WEB are guidelines. They indicate what wikipedia tends to keep or delete. They are descriptive not prescriptive. Unlike WP:V and WP:NPOV they do not trump consensus. It may well be, that this is the type of thing wikipedia tends to delete. It may well be that keeping it is inconsistent. But, that consideration is not enough to force a deletion in the absence of consensus. Brenneman made a good case, and frustratingly, many of the keepers focused on the re-nomination rather than refuting its reasoning (bad!). But, on the other hand, I take Pschemp's point (and she did give reasons) that many of the keepers have previously given reasons. Brenneman's case for deletion is very strong, but the article does not appear to breach WP:V, and so it comes down to consensus. Brenneman has been unable to persuade a consensus of Wikipedians that the article should be deleted--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 01:56, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Moving on from the ad hominum considering I <i>notified</i> you of this nomination:
<ol>
<li>Even if we accept that the single osnews piece is from a reliable source, it is not the required <b>multiple</b> published work.</li>
<li>The os news review is by Bob Minvielle (<a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22Bob+Minvielle%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22Bob+Minvielle%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">Google</a>) whom appears to be just a guy who wrote in according to their <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=168" class="external text" title="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=168" rel="nofollow">Style Guide: How to Submit Articles,</a> which doesn't appear to match the concept of <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer review</a> as I know it.</li>
<li>The review is on a small on-line forum, which is a far-cry from, for example, being reviewed in <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wired.html" title="Wired">Wired</a>. There are <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=site%3Awww.osnews.com+review&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=site%3Awww.osnews.com+review&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">lots</a> or reviews on OSnews and I don't think you're suggesting that we have articles on all of them.</li>
<li>The Open Source Industry Australia is a de facto press release for the <i>above</i> review, consisting of a forty word precis and a link to OS news. That's forty words out of 1,500, which I am staggered by suggestion that it's anything other than a trivial mention.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I'm sure that I sound like a broken record here what with asking that the guidelines be followed an all, but I'm simply not seeing the required coverage to demonstrate notability: I'm seeing an article built out of a single review and a lot of passion. It's entirely possible that I'm totally ignorant, but the way to change that is by presenting more facts. This article has been done over this three times now and I still see just the one.</dd>

<li><b>note to the above note</b> Someone expressed some confusion with my statement, so I guess I should clarify. I guess I can see how this may be seen as non-notable. However, it has passed an overturn at deletion review, and has apparently been nominated a few times since. This indicates to me that there is no clear community consensus on the topic, and that this is likely a content dispute that might be better worked out on a talk page than a deletion debate. Once something has been through the ringer once, I feel it is usually superfluous to re-nominate, though I can understand in this case there is some confusion over the actual consensus, so I don't hold any prejudice against the nominator, the topic may indeed be questionable enough that it warrents debate. The above statement was intended to state my belief that without a substantial reason for changing our collective minds, we should let it stand, otherwise we run the risk of endless AfD rounds that could get tiresome. Again, that's the general principle, in this case I'm not sure which takes precidence, a questionably notable topic or the prior case history. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 06:40, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think I see what you're saying, but in general I try to keep in mind that wikipedia's idea of "consensus" is often the comments of less than a dozen editors. Lots of stuff gets nominated and the discussion gets flooded by people from a message board, or policy gets blatantly ignored, or an admin closes too early, etc. etc. I have nominated several tenacious articles for deletion that had survived multiple previous attempts and I'll probably do it again.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 06:48, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I know exactly what you mean, many times I've been rather stunned by the weight given to WP:ILIKEIT votes when determining 'consensus'.

<li><b>Incredibly strong KEEP</b> What is wrong with us that we want to thrash out the same issue over and over? I think I smell something rotten in the state of Denmark. What do the editors who keep nominating this for deletion have to GAIN from deleting this? Sounds VERY mysterious to me. Once I can understand. Twice a bit iffy. But THREE times in short succession? I am outraged. I cannot believe this. What is the value of attacking someone who means well and who is trying to provide some valuable information about a product people obviously use? I often use Wikipedia as a trusted source to find out a little bit about different software packages. Sure there can be advertising contamination, but the nature of Wikipedia means that it is far less and far more balanced than many other sources; in fact than almost any other source. This really reeks. And I am disgusted that we would be trying to drive away productive members of our community. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Please reconsider what you are doing. Are you really that bent on destructive actions?--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 18:40, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As a disinterested party, I am wondering why Wikipedia's rules and policies even permit an article to be renominated for deletion <b>less than two months</b> after a previous AfD vote was closed with a <i>keep</i>. At best, this nomination is questionable; at worst, it is destructive and disruptive. IMO those who are in favor of deleting this article should accept and respect the consensus of the most recent AfD for the time being. The time is definitely not ripe for a new nomination. --<a href="../../../t/k/y/User%7ETkynerd_ae5f.html" title="User:Tkynerd">Tkynerd</a> 19:08, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep and salt</b> The appropriateness of the article is obvious. N is clear from the number of the users, aand there are no problems reported with V. The article still had some traces of advertising language, and I removed some. Perhaps other supports can add some of the many reviews instead of just talking about them. Let's improve the article so nobody is absurd enough to try this again.

<li><b>Keep</b> with less rhetoric; Aaron didn't nominate this <i>just out of spite</i>. But this poor little article - which may just be our most inline-cited software article of its size - has been subject to so much excess bureaucracy that a new nomination was clearly going to achieve nothing but a waste of time. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 02:29, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am absolutley unapologetic over renominating this article. It has no serious claim to notability, no citations from reliable sources, and despite it's many rounds through deletion discussions appears to continue to be defended based upon totally spurious grounds:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"I promised to quit"</li>
<li>"product people obviously use"</li>
<li>"this nomination is questionable"</li>
<li>"number of the users"</li>
<li>"abuse of Afd"</li>
<li>"keep"s without rational X 2</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Simply having <i>a lot</i> of inline citations doesn't solve the problem that this "little piece of software" appears from the evidence presented to be less article-worthy that <i>"Reaper, a An OpenGL based 3D-game, emphasizing stunning graphics and interesting algorithms."</i> or <i>"GQview, an image viewer for X windows."</i> If there were serious arguments presented that this satisfied our well-established guidelines, than this could concieveable come down to "consensus" via counting noses. But there are not, just a lot of shrieking. There has been very little effort to even <i><b>rebut</b></i> the deletion arguments, mostly just they are ignored. There may be some people involved here who should be ashamed, but it bloody well isn't me.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> A) It may be a little early to renominate this. B) While Mr. Brenneman may come off a tad too overzealous in this discussion, I can certainly understand his frustrations, as he presented a perfectly valid argument for deletion only to be met with several unfair statements and accusations regarding the deletion. C) This appears to be something that is being retained per "I like it," which I'm starting to notice isn't really all that uncommon, however D) I abstain from officially opining because I think what's needed here is for everyone to just step back, allow this article to have sufficient time to develop before renomination, on the condition that E) Rather than simply asserting how notable this is and waving hands at the deletion, perhaps people can work to improve and source the article per Wikipedia policy. If this is done, then there will not be a need for further nominations ever. If this is not done, however, then F) I resent the idea of "salting" this as it really goes in the face of ideas about bold editing, changing consensus, and, though perhaps biased, does not give due credit to someone with a very good history of sensible Wikipedia editing.

<li>Sounds reasonable (especially the part about allowing the article to develop). I don't actually know what "salting" means, and Wiki doesn't <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Salt (disambiguation)">cough it up,</a> so I'm not sure what that fuss is about - apologizing for using a term without knowing its usage, that was stupid - I've seen it used when something keeps coming back, again and again. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 02:34, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Salting is usually meant as a form of page protection. I've never seen it use for keep pages before; it usually refers to the page that happens after something has been deleted multiple times. It results in that page that says something like "Wikipedia does not have an article on..." etc. I'm assuming in this case, it's meant as eliminating the possibility of ever renominating this. That possibility should be eliminated by addressing the nominator's concerns within the next several months, not by imposing some sort of arbitrary protection, in my opinion.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Just about every above reason to keep is invalid and based on either 'I like it', or 'it's been nomninated before!!!'.

The hand-wringing about 'oh my god, it's been nominated before!! RECENTLY!! are irrelevant. Two months ago is not particularly recent when the article is so fundamentally lacking in evidence for its assertions of notability, and voting 'keep' on procedural grounds because of this is disruptive, and ignorant of Wikipedia's requirements for verifiability (see that little message at the bottom of the editing window?) The article was only restored at DRV because DRV is a purely head-counting exercise, so is easily subverted, and this has some very dedicated people who want it kept regardless of basic fundamental <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">policy</a>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 10:38, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm surprised that so many references on the article are not in English. Surely it should be possible to find something to back this up in the English language - this is the English language Wikipedia after all. I'm not persuauded that this article is properly verified and is based on reliable sources. Usually I would suggest giving an article some space to develop but for an articles 3rd nomination this is a pretty serious problem - these weaknesses should have been ironed out after the first nomination. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpartaz_f576.html" title="User:Spartaz">Spartaz</a> 15:57, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm the person who added those non-english sources last night, and I agree that more english sources are needed. However this software is predominantly used in Japan and Europe. Also, "group office" isnt a useful search term in english. So I specifically investigated its notability in the non-english world when I realised that most of the public installations (roughly <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22group+office%22+lost_password.php" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22group+office%22+lost_password.php" rel="nofollow">identified</a> using google) were in other countries. IMO a Japanese zdnet article should be considered as reliable as the English equivalent, and the fact that the page is in Japanese makes it only slighly less verifiable, as machine translation ensures you are seeing a pretty honest interpretation of the article. These source prove that the features listed in the English documentation from group-office.com is reliable. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 21:14, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Evidence of major distro inclusion = keep<br />
Absence of evidence of major distro inclusion = delete+salt</b>.<br />
The sole policy-based claims of notability that means anything in all the above seems to be that <b>Alexa reports</b> it as #8, and that it's included in various <b>major linux distros</b> (per <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> examples of major distros include Debian, Fedora, etc). No evidence is presented for either of these statements so far. Alexa itself is not a neutral source. Although listing on Alexa may be evidence of usage, it's unclear if <i>Alexa mention alone, unsupported by other evidence</i>, is a sufficient evidence for notability. Likewise, if it is included within the named major distributions, can someone paste a few links to the relevant <b>major distro</b> package inclusion listings and then this AFD will pretty much be done. If that's not possible, and lacking evidence of these then I have to agree that Group Office doesn't look at all notable outside its own fan-base and <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=7074" class="external text" title="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=7074" rel="nofollow">one minor review</a> elsewhere. (And as an aside, references to <i>"Incredibly strong keep"</i> and <i>"Hyper-strong keep"</i> suggest that the responses concerned include emotive views rather than policy based views, tending to support the nominator's interpretation.) Without <i>evidence</i> that this view is significantly wrong, then it looks like it should be deleted - probably with salt since with 3 heated nominations and much ardor for the package, article recreation must be considered a possibility. <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">FT2</a> <sup><span style="font-style:italic">(<a href="../../../f/t/2/User_talk%7EFT2_8c21.html" title="User talk:FT2">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_FT2_cd1f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/FT2">email</a>)</span></sup> 22:36, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><small>What a waste. WP:Notability is a guideline, not a be all end all policy that requires endless wonkism about the nuances of its interpretation. WP:N-Software is still only a proposed guideline and one that not everyone agrees with. This article has mutiple non-trivial sources period. The broader view is that this article contributes to Wikipedia's purpose by providing useful, notable, verifiable knowledge. Is it the most earth shatteringly important knowledge that human kind needs? No, but neither are the feeding habits of Pokemon. Many of the plain keep votes here were given with reason and explanation on the previous discussions and knowing the history, it is rather obvious that asking people to comment yet again on a topic already hashed out multiple times is going to cause some hard feelings. Good faith nomination or not, this is a typical and understandable human response. Wikipedia is written by people, not robots without feeling. The bottom line is that this is improving Wikipedia and I have seen no evidence that it isn't or that it is harming the project in any way. Wikilawyer all you want about it, but if this project can't see the forest for the trees it has some serious issues. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 22:47, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's pretty random whether a particular event gets termed a "crisis" or something else. I remember during 1982 the BBC News used to report regularly about the "Falklands Crisis" and then suddenly started referring to it as the "Falklands War" once the shooting had started. If I was writing a dictionary definition, I would define a crisis as any state of events where vital interests are at risk and where a particular decision would have profound and immediate consequences. That could encompass almost every war, stock market crash, transportation disaster etc. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 21:24, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>, without prejudice: fairly obviously a worthwhile subject. Our coverage of <a href="../../../l/i/c/Lichen.html" title="Lichen">lichen</a> species is so sparse, though, that I'd be tempted to keep this, even though it is hardly encyclopedic in its current form.

<li>I rather disagree with the above. The nominator is, I suspect, right in his suspicions about a lecturer getting free hosting. But that's not the point: the question is "Is this article about a notable subject for which we can find references, and which can be covered in an NPOV way&#160;?" I'm inclined to say "yes", so on that basis I'm plumping for <b>Keep</b>, but with a tag for a substantial <b>Cleanup</b>, including removal of any OR and "How To" elements. The author should be encouraged to do some of the cleaning himself - he might even persuade his students to help, and maybe to improve our coverage of other lichen, for some extra credit ( I believe we have a way of handling this ). <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 17:05, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't doubt that it may be used in the past, possibly invented by a clever blogger or even Clancy's people. Regardless, it remains a neologism that is not supported by any reliable sources nor referenced in any scholarly works.

<li><b>Comment</b> so it's a typo of a neologism. But let's assume that the page was under the correct name "Ryanverse". Now how notable is that neologism? Google comes up with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ryanverse+clancy&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rlz=1B2GGGL_enCA176&amp;start=130&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=ryanverse+clancy&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rlz=1B2GGGL_enCA176&amp;start=130&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">126 unique relevant hits</a>. That's better than the dismal results for Ryaniverse but it's still unacceptably low imho, especially since few if any can be considered as reliable sources. Now of course Google searches don't mean much but it's interesting to compare this with the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Jack+Ryan%22+clancy&amp;btnG=Search&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rlz=1B2GGGL_enCA176" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Jack+Ryan%22+clancy&amp;btnG=Search&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rlz=1B2GGGL_enCA176" rel="nofollow">259 000 hits</a> you get for "Jack Ryan" + clancy. This strongly indicates that the term "Ryanverse" hasn't caught on, despite being pushed, as Sharkface seems to suggests, by Clancy's editors. All this notwithstanding, the article is still a combination of original research and material already extensively covered in <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Ryan_b2fa.html" title="Jack Ryan">Jack Ryan</a> or <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Clancy_22e8.html" title="Tom Clancy">Tom Clancy</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 02:50, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Can't see much notability as far as this guy goes. Apparently he's the first pro wrestling promoter in New Mexico although I don't know accurate that is. When the sources are myspace and the promotion's web site, you gotta question the verifiability <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrstroeebski_7f9b.html" title="User:Orstroeebski">Orstroeebski</a> 07:20, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> as per nom. --Rupertchaucer 16:02, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>No comment</b> I figure I really shouldn't be given a voice in this debate, given that I created the article. I think Mosh Pit Mike's appearance on the West Texas Wrestling Legends (WTWL) page makes the inclusion of Mosh Pit Mike necessary. If we start by deleting this page, we would have to delete the page of every wrestler listed in the federation, and if we do that, we might as well delete the entire thing, and that's just not fair. Lastly, the AmarilloPWF.com page linked as a source is something that wrestlers do NOT have access to, and it is managed and edited by the webmaster. Hmmm.. I know I said lastly, But I feel like I should clear something up. Mosh Pit Mike is by NO MEANS the first wrestling promoter in New Mexico. The business goes back what, sixty years? But Mosh Pit Mike, along with Hobo Hank and Thunder started the first &amp; only wrestling school/federation based solely in New Mexico. I had read an Albuquerque Journal article about it a while back, but I just can't seem to find it online anymore. Wow, that was long winded, and I apologize if you read the whole thing&#160;;) Burquelo 19:58, 11 January 2007 (UTC) Oh man! Here I go again, continuing with the long windedness. I also feel that user Orstrobeeski has a personal grudge against me. If he were to be putting deletion notices in all wrestler pages, I would accept it as a substantial challenge. But look at CJ Summers. This page cites no sources whatsoever, except for the wrestler's personal website. There are no federation websites which suggest he even exists, yet Orstrobeeski simply removed links instead of nominating the article for deletion. Personal attacks are fine, I'm a big boy, but I think it's unfair when it impacts a wiki.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Delete Unless Sourced</b> If the article doesn't get <i>real</i> sources soon, it should go. However if it does, I can see keeping this article around. If the claims in it are in fact true than I would have to credit it as being notable, however right now this appears to be mostly original research.<b><a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanfon_9d3c.html" title="User:Ganfon"><font color="blue">Gan</font></a><a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanfon_eeee.html" title="User talk:Ganfon"><font color="green">fon</font></a></b> 21:42, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Do NOT Delete</b>: The nomination for deletion on this wiki page is an outrage. Mosh Pit Mike is a professional wrestler that I have seen with my own eyes perform for West Texas Wrestling Legends in Amarillo, TX. The AmarilloPWF.com website is not ran by anyone other than WTWL Management and The WTWL Webmaster. While Mosh Pit Mike is on The WTWL roster, he is not the promoter and has no access to editing AmarilloPWF.com in anyway. Being apart of The WTWL, I know that the information on Mike's wikipedia page is 100% accurate and I can say that Mosh Pit Mike has performed at every WTWL show since his debut in November 2006. This page belongs on wiki just as much as any other wrestlers page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Brett420x (<a href="../../../b/r/e/User_talk%7EBrett420x_8c1e.html" title="User talk:Brett420x">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brett420x_bafe.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brett420x">contribs</a>) 22:19, 11 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - first of all, it is not necessary that every term, person, location, fictional character, etc. etc. that is mentioned in one article should get its own article. Second, the existence of one bad article does not mean we should keep all the others.

<li><b>Week Keep</b> - Certainly needs rewriting to be less commercial and more NPOV, but I think it is probably notable in the same way as Inselkamf etc, seems to have a fair few mentions on google - <span style="color:#ccf;background:#ccf;border-style: single"><a href="../../../p/o/c/User%7EPocklingtonDan_89be.html" title="User:PocklingtonDan">PocklingtonDan</a></span> 10:36, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>It is very interesting to hear all of your comments about this Wiki page, which you are making out to sound as if it is some "Shocking" website with explicit details and so should be removed! When really it's just an extremely popular kids website and if anyone was wanting to find out more about this site, then Wiki would be the place to look for details. Re-directing to Nick as suggested above, is a pointless idea, as Nick only host a link to the Bin Weevils website. Whilst they own 50% of the site, they are more of a silent partner and are only involved in showing the Bin Weevils cartoons. Which i have provided a link from my wiki page to the Nick UK page. So it would be like suggesting <a href="../../../n/e/o/NeoPets_8752.html" title="NeoPets">NeoPets</a> should be redirected to <a href="../../../v/i/a/Viacom.html" title="Viacom">Viacom</a> because they own NeoPets. So, let's remove the deletion tag, as im not trying to advertise this site. The site already has over 300,000 users signed up. It is merely an information page just like all the other pages on Wiki. Rather than everyone getting carried away on here and continue the deletion debate, i am more than happy to welcome someone to try and sort my page out so it fits in better with the Wiki standards as i am not so familiar with Wiki. Many Thanks</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> One of the authors, User:Jameseditor, states above that the site has 300,000 users signed up.

Wikipedia is not here to be a place to look for details for a commercial website. It is an encylopedia to provide concise information on topics that are already notable and verifyable. This debate is not making out this is a shocking website - the concerns expressed by the nominator were among others notability <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and reliable sources <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - I don't think editors should make judgments on which major awards are <i>really</i> major awards. It's not an honorary plaque from a high school or Rotary Club, it's an Emmy.

<p>Non-notable dessert, article provides no context other than "it's available at many pubs in the UK".

<li>I'm not sure what you mean by 'unsourced' passage, when it was written by one of the people in question? Chris 15:57, 11 January 2007
<ul>
<li>Yes, that is rather the problem. We are an encyclopedia, or at least we are trying to be. Do you think it is appropriate for an encyclopedia to contain coverage of eating games invented by you and your friends? Answer should be no. <b>delete</b> (in current state) I rather doubt we can find any reliable sources on the pudding in question, but if we can then not opposed to a recreation. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 16:01, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, I'm only asking the question. I'm pretty new to wikipedia (well, editing articles and such), and it wasn't me who created the article in the first place, just checking what is allowed and what isn't. I find it difficult to believe that there isn't any information in wikipedia that is from someone's knowledge rather than a 'source'. Chris 17:36, 11 January 2007

</li>
<li>The fact that there is an eating game associated with the dessert should not have a negative effect on whether that dessert is eligable or not. If the dessert is reasonably widespread, and can be shown to be, then should this not factor? Dave 18:12 11 Janurary 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>The first is a web page that makes no mention at all of this subject. The second is a PDF of a restaurant's menu. It supports none of the content of this article, such as the eating competition. It doesn't even support the part of the article that discusses how this dessert has evolved. Per our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy, Wikipedia is not for documenting the previously undocumented. If you wish to have histories of this eating competition and this dessert included in Wikipedia, then those histories <i>must have already been</i> researched and documented, and that documentation published, <i>outside</i> of Wikipedia. The place for publishing documentation for things that have not been documented before is a book, a journal article, or a web site, not here. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:24, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b> - Short films by animation companies shown only in their parks/museums seem to be plentiful on Wikipedia (<a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_EO_037a.html" title="Captain EO">Captain EO</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Timekeeper_8c51.html" title="The Timekeeper">The Timekeeper</a>, and others) but, that is not enough justification to keep this article. I have added the kanji to the article, of which google hits around 200 articles. The Japanese wikipedia template for Ghibli (<a href="../../../../ja/%E3%82%B9/%E3%82%BF/%E3%82%B8/Template%7E%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%E3%82%B8%E3%82%AA%E3%82%B8%E3%83%96%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BB%E5%AE%AE%E5%B4%8E%E9%A7%BF.html" class="extiw" title="ja:Template:スタジオジブリ・宮崎駿">ja:Template:スタジオジブリ・宮崎駿</a>) shows a similarly named short film (<i>Imaginary Flying Machines</i> <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">空想の空飛ぶ機械達</span><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji">Kūsō no soratobu kikaitachi</span></i><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span>), (and presumably also only shown at the Ghibli museum), which has a Japanese article. That template seems very thorough, and has red links for a couple of shorts, but no mention of this movie at all. The lack of a Ja: article for this one short film is what tips the balance to delete in my opinion. If it can be determined that those two are the same film, my vote will change. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 13:39, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</s></li>

<li><s><b>Informed comments, weak keep.</b> I live a stone's throw from the Ghibli museum and have been there. On any particular day they are showing one short film exclusive to the museum, all of them the works of the very famous Hayao Miyazaki (Nausica, Spirited Away, Laputa, The Monster Princess). I have seen one, called Mei to Koneko no Basu (Mei and the little cat bus). It kicked ass. But since they are only shown at the museum, they are not terribly famous even here in West Tokyo. Most Japanese in Tokyo (to say nothing of elsewhere) are unaware that they exist at all (though many have heard of the museum). I am voting weak keep because there are no POV issues or anything like that, and it seems a shame to delete such a harmless article about one of these really great short films. But... to be honest, it is not really notable.</s> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Dun_64ea.html" title="User:Drake Dun">Drake Dun</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Drake_Dun_a769.html" title="Special:Contributions/Drake Dun">contribs</a>) 17:51, 11 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Factual details, reluctant delete.</b> Okay, I read Japanese so I did some digging around upon the suggestion of Neiei (below) and I found a description of the film at <a href="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/bibliotheca/studium/animonth/animonth-0212.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/bibliotheca/studium/animonth/animonth-0212.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ne.jp/asahi/bibliotheca/studium/animonth/animonth-0212.html</a>. This *is* the correct title of the film. The film was made by a guy associated only peripherally with Studio Ghibli and is not ordinary Studio Ghibli type work (he describes it as "dark"). It did not show in the theater at the Ghibli Museum, but in a "film box" in the corner of a room they have on the second floor devoted to temporary exhibits. I have been there and am not sure exactly what he is referring to with "film box", but the museum has a lot of anachronistic devices, including boxes you can look into and watch films on by running the frames yourself using a hand crank. It may be to one of these that the guy is referring. He complains about wanting to watch it on a bigger screen. The article is from 2002, so given the fact that the film was shown in the room for limited time exhibits, it is almost definitely gone now. It was not there when I went in 2006. Considering that the notability of even the main films in the star theater is rather dubious, I think this clearly fails the criteria for notability.. so I must reluctantly vote delete. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Dun_64ea.html" title="User:Drake Dun">Drake Dun</a> 07:54, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Mei, and the other shorts are listed in the Japanese template I posted above. I highly suspect that this movie is a mistranslated title of the other one, because IMDB's Ghibli page lists all of the other shorts except "Imaginary Flying Machines", and the Ja: template lists all but this one. If they are the same, then, the article can be expanded via translation from the Ja: wikipedia, if nothing else. But, based on the paucity of info on this and the IMDB page about it, I can't see for sure that it is the same. Someone with better Japanese than me may be able to take one of the google matches for this title and dredge up more detail. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 21:41, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>　A film produced as part of a museum exhibit is not really something that meets notability criteria. Museums, aquariums, zoos, libraries, and theme parks produce these things all of the time. Even though the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28films%29_a836.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (films)">Film notability guidelines are inactive</a>, it misses all of the critera. IMDB is a place that accepts submissions from anyone around the world. I've seen stage shows get erroneously listed as movies. We should not accept them as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> for information. Now, it may be perfectly good material to flesh out the author's biogrpahy. "「天空の城ラピュタと空想科学の機械達展」でこぢんまりと映像展示されていたもの。こぢんまりし過ぎです。どうしてミニシアターでやってくれないのでしょうか。かなりアニメしてるのに。内容に関しては、『空想の空とぶ機械達』が濃かっただけに、かなり普通っぽく思えてしまいます。展示全体の中では良いアクセントになってはいますが。" <a href="http://members-abs.home.ne.jp/nitar/review/a-ghibli.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://members-abs.home.ne.jp/nitar/review/a-ghibli.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 18:44, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Speedy Keep and Rename</b> -- ideology and AfD processes aside, the title is confusing -- is the article referring to allegations by the U.S of others' state terrorism ... or allegations by others of U.S.-sponsored state terrorism? The answer, of course, is the latter. The "See Also" section has a link to <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._list_of_state_sponsors_of_international_terrorism_802b.html" title="U.S. list of state sponsors of international terrorism">U.S. list of state sponsors of international terrorism</a> but I think that should also be included in some sort of disambiguation statement with link at the top of this article. Perhaps a better title here would be "Allegations of U.S.-sponsored state terrorism" or "Allegations of U.S. government-sponsored terrorism". As for my "speedy keep" recommendation, that's based on the short interval since the last AfD. Unless there was a process problem the last time (sockpuppetry, votestacking, etc.), I think it's wrong to push another AfD so soon. (If there was a process problem last time that's not mentioned here, please spell it out and I will reconsider). --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> I was just in the process of unwatching this page, I never really thought much of this page in many respects, truth be told, and now a third deletion. Looks like I have to watch the page again, more drama. This page needs major work, but people's ideologies block any progress, one way or the other.<br />
As long as this article has this name, it will be a lightning rod of controversy. I tried to change the name a million times, but <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herding_cats.html" title="Herding cats">Herding cats</a> makes me want to slit my wrists. Nuclear once said he would never allow me to change the name, but he has recently changed in surprising ways. Maybe we can get a name change.<br />
<b>SUGGESTED COMPRIMISE: I don't suppose User:Khodavand would close the AfD if we can agree on a name change?</b> Best wishes, Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 17:52, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Apparently some scheme used by the ever-sneaky Zeus to seduce women by darkening the sky. I would normally have a quick www search to back this up, but plugging "long night" into a search engine could lead anywhere. There's no references or any claim to notability - OK, so the author tells us that Shakespeare also mentions "long night", but he mentions many things that don't warrant an article. This page has been here since 2002, so is bloody old. And possibly salvagable. Maybe a redirect to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Long_Night_30a6.html" title="The Long Night">The Long Night</a> is required, maybe a link to <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equinox.html" title="Equinox">equinox</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_solstice.html" title="Winter solstice">winter solstice</a>.

<li>Go ahead and <b>redirect</b>. I did find the term used for his seduction of Hercules' mom, but it was to make the night longer for more fun rather than to preven Hera from catching him. <a href="http://www.greecetravel.com/greekmyths/argos6.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.greecetravel.com/greekmyths/argos6.htm" rel="nofollow">an example</a>. But it seems the term isn't always used for this story, and it was hard to find so there is no real evidence the term is notable in this context. So I would think the page could be redirected and the story added to hercules or zeus pages.

<dd>I am happy to read your response. This is because you always provide an unbiased view when addressing Article for Deletion nominations. I can elaborate on this latter. I also wish to thank you for your acknowledgment of the good that has come from this nomination. You are incorrect in saying he has been the "primary subject in features from well-established sources". Has he been the "primary subject"? Or has he been mentioned in passing? I believe it is the latter. Do you have any evidence that he has been the "primary subject" of these publications? Otherwise this is just your opinion and will be regarded as such. You state, "he managed to become a Grand Ayatollah, which is in itself a notable rank in Shia Islam". I completely agree that the rank of Grand Ayatollah is a "notable rank in Shia Islam". It is imperatave that you, or any other editor, do not confuse this with qualifying as notable in Wikipedia. I mention this because his notability with regards to Wikipedia is in question, not his notability in Shia Islam. You state "This might be expected, considering that he managed to become a Grand Ayatollah, which is in itself a notable rank in Shia Islam". Your expectations or analysis as to why he has been mentioned in some publications is irrelevant, and thus unnecessary. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 21:04, 11 January 2007 (UTC) Agha Nader</dd>

<dd>Again, try reading the sources I provided. The USA TODAY article is about him, and he is also heavily discussed in the Slate article. If you really need me to paste passages from these sources because you cannot see this yourself, I am able to do so, though it seems absurd. After all, if you cannot see his significance by reading the articles, I don't know why me pasting here will work any better. None of these are simply trivial mentions of him in passing; rather, they discuss him and his views specifically. The note about "expected" was simply a transition to one of the supplementary points(as scholarly discourse is an important to becoming higher rank), the point about his position in the highest rank of a major religion. In any case, the main point is that he satisfies the central criterion of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 21:56, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For your information, I have read the USA TODAY article. How is he heavily discussed? He is only mentioned as an introduction to the main point of the article. The subject that is "heavily discussed " is clearly voting in Iraqi election, not Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Ishaq al-Fayad. Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Ishaq al-Fayad was not mentioned in 13 of the 15 paragraphs in the USA TODAY article. He wasn't even named in 14 of the 15 paragraphs. How is he the primary subject if he isn't mentioned in the body paragraphs? Please provide sourced that have Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Ishaq al-Fayad as the "primary subject". It is clear to me he has been only addressed in passing. What is your definition of "heavily discussed"? As you know, the criteria for notability that you site, requires him to be the "primary subject". All the article says about Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Ishaq al-Fayad is that he doesn't believe in the separation of religion and state. USA TODAY says of Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Ishaq al-Fayad, "A high-ranking Shiite cleric who helped a coalition of religious parties to apparent victory in Iraq's elections eight days ago said Sunday that the new constitution must embody Islamic law. 'We will accept no compromise,' said a statement by Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Ishaq al-Fayad, one of the three top Shiite clerics who serve beneath the most senior religious leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. Al-Fayad said separation of religion and state must be 'completely rejected.'" How is the "primary subject" of the article? Please provide elaboration. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 00:36, 12 January 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader

<dd>He is the primary subject because the article is about his statement. The title focuses on him and his expressed opinion, the opening paragraphs introducing the "news" focus on <i>him</i>. The rest of article is about reactions to <i>his</i> statement, and also some background information for context. The article is about al-Fayadh because it is reporting specifically about <i>his</i> demands regarding the constitution of Iraq. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 00:53, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Let me get this right. You think he is the primary subject of the article? And that the upcoming Iraqi election is not? Why isn't he mentioned in mentioned in 13 of the 15 paragraphs in the USA TODAY article. He wasn't even named in 14 of the 15 paragraphs. How is he the primary subject if he isn't mentioned in the body paragraphs? <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 04:14, 12 January 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader

<dd>The article's purpose was to cover his comments; hence, the title they used. The opening paragraphs. Of course it relates to the Iraq elections, but the actual news item being reported was his statement. It was the "news" part of the report. By the way, I find it "cute" that you consider each of the bulleted wire reports as separate paragraphs. They begin with "Also Sunday:", and are small recaps of other events that also occurred during that day. It is similar to a Ahmadinejad Israel comment; a few other things are usually recapped or mentioned for context, but the main idea was him and his statement. Such is the case for this article as well. Glad to help! <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 04:55, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agha, whether he's mentioned in the paragraphs or not isn't even relevant. His title and the mere mention of him combine to pass WP:BIO even in just that state. His position in the article is much like the position of any famous person if the article were on a famous event. Again, the 3/4 of the article that doesn't talk about him doesn't matter, the fact is those first couple do talk about hi and aknowledge his notability.--<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman"><span style="color:#0D0;background:#009">Wizardman</span></a> 06:55, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I appreciate that someone finally accepts that 3/4 of the article doesn't mention him. But I must disagree that "the fact is those first couple do talk about him and acknowledge his notability". <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says that the person must be the primary subject of media attention. I have read through the USA TODAY article, and each time I come to the same conclusion: he is used as an introduction to the Iraqi election. Do you agree that someone has to be the primary subject of media attention? <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 17:35, 13 January 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader

<dd>Besides, his comments(hence, him) are the primary reason for the news report. Just because Agha Nader is distracted by the recapping and contextualizing common to news reports doesn't mean that al-Fayadh is not the primary subject. It seems Agha has a tendency to ignore statements from opposing viewpoints unless he thinks that he can misconstrue them to fit his point. At this point, it might be best for all parties to simply ignore his continuing obstructionist approach, and wait for this Afd to close. It does not make sense that we all have to repeat arguments just because Agha Nader chooses not to acknowledge evidence. I hope Agha Nader learns how to act more appropriately on Wikipedia from these experiences. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 23:34, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

It says, "The debate is not a vote; please make recommendations on the course of action to be taken, sustained by arguments." So when making comments make an argument and respond to mine. I also wish to tell you that a person needs to be notable in order to have a Wikipedia article about them. Please see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability#Notability_is_not_subjective</a>. It says, "Subjective evaluations are not relevant for determining whether a topic warrants inclusion in Wikipedia. Notability criteria do not equate to personal or biased considerations". Although you may think being a Grand Ayatollah on its own is notable, you must prove it with arguments relating to Wikipedia guidelines and policies. Also do not just assume someone is notable because of their rank. I would also like to inform the editors that there is no criteria on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> that says a high ranking cleric, bishop, or rabbi is notable just because of their rank. Please be objective when defending Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Ishaq al-Fayad's notability. Also please read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability#Notability_is_not_subjective</a> it says, "Notability is not judged by Wikipedia editors directly". Your job is not to judge Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Ishaq al-Fayad's notability, but rather to consider the guidelines and policies of Wikipedia on notability. Also, I am able to answer any questions you have about deletion nominators! <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 23:09, 11 January 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader

<dd>Well, I think you should now explain, in detail, why he doesn't meet the criteria of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. You mention that "Subjective evaluations are not relevant for determining whether a topic warrants inclusion in Wikipedia. Notability criteria do not equate to personal or biased considerations." Until you thoroughly explain your reasons for saying that he is not <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, we are only seeing your personal considerations, so it is high time for you to explain. Also, remember to consider the conversation about the central criterion from above, since it is, well, central. If you give this elaboration, I think it will at least be easier to know where you are coming from. It was fairly obvious when you nominated, since the article was just a stub lacking much information, but your nomination has spurred improvement to the article, and it seems that just a little investigation about the man has shown that, indeed, he is rather significant. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 00:40, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Behnam, remember, you should assume good faith, instead of making this kind of comment. Saying that "It was fairly obvious when you nominated, since the article was just a stub lacking much information" isn't assuming good faith. Furthermore, you are making the affirmative statement by saying he should remain, and thus the burden of evidence is on your shoulders. But it should be clear by now the reason as to why I don't think it should remain. The reason is that he hasn't done anything notable and does not meet the criteria on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. In fact, the only thing he has done is become an Ayatollah. And that, by itself does not make him notable. Unless you wish to keep avoiding this, please post a response that relates to my comment. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 04:02, 12 January 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader

<dd>Apparently, you misunderstand my statement. Do you know what I was saying was "fairly obvious"? I was saying that it is plain to see why you might nominate the article for deletion because, at the time, there was nothing notable mentioned n his article. If anything, this <i>is</i> assuming good faith. By stating that all he has done is "become an Ayatollah", you seem to be overlooking the improvements to the article that indicate that there is more to him than what you believe. I <b>have</b> provided the <b>burden of evidence</b>; try reading the conversation above if you have forgotten. I said he satisfies the central criterion of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and I provided the sources that support this claim. You just claimed the sources mentioned him in passing, despite the fact that <i>they are reporting about him</i>. If you are going to just ignore evidence, you may be able to justify to yourself that all he did was "become an Ayatollah"; however, you probably will not convince others here. So please, assume good faith before accusing others of not assuming good faith. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 04:13, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia isn't a place to judge content. The fact the book carries and ISBN and the author appears to have notability - with sources cited - is good enough. Please note that <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">Wikipedia: Notability (books)</a> is only a <b>proposed</b> policy/guideline and this should <b>not</b> be used to gauge whether an article should exist on a particular novel. Personally I follow earlier guidelines that basically say anything that isn't vanity press and had any sort of distribution is notable. I'm willing to change my vote if proof can be provided that this book never existed. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:55, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: I think that citing the proposed guideline is fine, to the extent that the community agrees with it, but suppose that while it's merely "proposed," the debate here may help show the extent to which the community agrees. In addition, the book is notable under the proposed guideline - it <i>is</i> relatively well known, and it is fairly trivial to find references to it.

There are rules that exist on what makes a page notable so maybe you guys should have researched them before throwing up a page thinking it will stick just because it exists. <a href="../../../4/9/e/User%7E49erInOregon_0564.html" title="User:49erInOregon">49erInOregon</a> 17:16, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a non-notable training aspect of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office_ee96.html" title="United States Patent and Trademark Office">United States Patent and Trademark Office</a>. It gets about 67 Google hits, almost all of them are from the USPTO. This article and similar ones have been created several times (in both article space and on their user pages) by Mrchrzan (<a href="../../../m/r/c/User_talk%7EMrchrzan_774a.html" title="User talk:Mrchrzan">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mrchrzan_f64b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mrchrzan">contribs</a>) and Jteets (<a href="../../../j/t/e/User_talk%7EJteets_d43e.html" title="User talk:Jteets">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jteets_167d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jteets">contribs</a>) to promote "the greatest group of patent examiners to come out of the PTA". They also uploaded a ton of photos yesterday of people around the office that I deleted since they seemed to be used only as a free webhost. I don't see any outside reliable or verifiable sources for this. I also don't see any notability for this. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 15:32, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, this is not a public-facing agency and is unlikely to ever be individually notable. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory of government offices</a>, of which there are so many. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 16:03, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I don't see anything particularly unworthy about the subject. It is an agency of the U.S. government whose existence can be verified. The fact that it is not run for the general public is neither here nor there. The motives of the creators in creating it are matters of editing for NPOV, and apparently, for deleting unencyclopedic photos; they don't give rise to grounds to delete this article. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:24, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> but is it really a government agency? From what it seems like, it's not. It appears to be a training aspect of a government agency. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 19:31, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I used "agency" generically.

<li><b>Comment</b> - It would appear to be an institute established to train public servants for the USPTO. Judging from the article, it was only very recently established. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:56, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

This time I created it based on the German and Spanish language versions as well as Pacha's own web site (and I may have perused several clubbing web sites also in the process) and my knowledge of the enterprise from having visited the Ibiza club twice a few years back.

<li>I should have refrained from using the contentious term <i>ranked</i> which quite correctly warrants an authority to perform the ranking.

<dd>Just assume good faith here, I have absolutely no affiliation with the Pacha company. This is an international brand, with its own record company, it hosts the worlds top DJs in residence.

<p>I have done some additions to the article now including a poll from an clubbing magazine rating Pacha Ibiza as the no. 4 most popular nightclub globally. Please consider when you take issue with claims like "world's most celebrated" and "well-known and prestigious" that we are dealing with an entertainment venue that caters to a high degree to the world of supermodels, music and fashion industry executives and promoters and international jetset personalities. In this light these terms should be considered intrinsic, not inflated hype. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 16:29, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This is a prime example of an AfD nomination on charges of "advertising" and "non-notability" based on sheer ignorance. Pacha is definitely a renowned nightclub chain (and certainly one of the most famous nightclubs in my country Spain)—the DJ Magazine ranking provided by User:Meco should make this clear to those nominators around here who know nothing about what they rush to AfD. <a href="../../../u/a/x/User%7EUaxuctum_57d1.html" title="User:Uaxuctum">Uaxuctum</a> 14:30, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Eh... the <i>majority</i> of the article is quoted from the source with very little critical/explanative commentary, and could be replaced with rewritten material.

<li>Um... it's abundantly clear this does <i>not</i> fall under fair use by any stretch of imagination.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Hi Jefferson Anderson. I was just wondering if you happened to read the discussion page on the article before applying the AfD. It may help to explain why the article had been deleted in the first place. Also, I made a note to please let me know any problems with the article so that I may create it to better suit Wiki standards. I'd think it would be in Wikipedia's best interest to improve on the articles as opposed to quickly deleting ones which could be fixed to comply. This is my first article so I will be the first to admit that I may need a bit of help, but it doesn't help at all when someone comes by and adds an AfD without explanation, apparently without even taking a look at the discussion page. I hope we can work together to solve the problems with the article as opposed to the deletion of an article which should have a home on Wikipedia. I will be looking forward to your correspondence. Thank you and have a great day. <a href="../../../m/d/y/User%7EMdyogi_4405.html" title="User:Mdyogi">Mdyogi</a> 21:36, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Maybe I should go ahead and start the discussion regarding your problems with the article. Yes the books are published by AYP, but I see little reason why this would be a problem. As a matter of fact, I can list 10 spiritual teachers off the top of my head (with current wikipedia articles) who publish their own books. Let me know if you'd like me to do so. Meanwhile, you haven't seemed to take notice that all the books are consistently (and often significantly) within the Amazon 100k rank level in the USA, Canada and Europe, and are in the process of being published in India as well. Regarding references, I wasn't sure exactly what needed references so I just did my best with what I thought might need it. It would be helpful if you could point out what exactly needs references and I can take it from there. I am willing to work with you on this, and I hope you will do the same. Thank you and have a great day. <a href="../../../m/d/y/User%7EMdyogi_4405.html" title="User:Mdyogi">Mdyogi</a> 21:53, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - And one more thing. What was the problem with the quotes section? The subject is widely known for that quote which is the basis of his teaching. <a href="../../../m/d/y/User%7EMdyogi_4405.html" title="User:Mdyogi">Mdyogi</a> 22:07, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> (I was the one who 1st marked it for speedy deletion) -This is a young article, give it a change to find some sources so it can prove if it is verifiable or not (Template accordingly).

<li>Yes, that is precisely why I AfD'ed it rather than speedy it.

<li>Hi Jefferson Anderson. I plan on working on the sources this weekend, but why AfD the article in the first place instead of a tag which would serve as a warning? The article is less than a week old. I have no arguments with the article needing some work, I just don't understand the need to pull the trigger on the AfD so quickly. Now that I have a better understanding of what needs to be done, I will be happy to update the article according to Wiki standards. If you wouldn't mind explaining exactly what you feel needs sources, it would be of even greater help. Thanks and have a great day. <a href="../../../m/d/y/User%7EMdyogi_4405.html" title="User:Mdyogi">Mdyogi</a> 18:12, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a basic stub, and certainly expandable. It may be a long time before someone competent to add information finds and sees it, but the subject strikes me as worthy, and the stub, though minimal, is informative.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. While consisting solely of a definition, this is more a <a href="../../../s/t/u/WP%7ESTUB_7484.html" title="WP:STUB">stub</a> in that it is "an article that is too short to provide encyclopedic coverage of the subject, but not so short as to provide no useful information." The point is that it has the potential to be a full article once someone knowledgeable comes along to expand it.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> -- <b>Jackhorkheimer</b> has made most of the points I wanted to, but I'll try to contribute my own argument anyway. The topic of the article is clearly a real <i>thing</i> which has its own origin, history, development and use. The simple fact that none of us happen to know, offhand, what any of those are doesn't mean that someone else won't come along who does, or who feels like finding more information to contribute from outside sources. The article is tagged with a stub tag, clearly indicating that the potential for a full article is there, but needs someone to turn it into a full article. This is all that needs to be done with this kind of article.

<p>It's okay. Go ahead and delete it. Is it okay to mirror it on my talk page?--<a href="../../../g/o/g/User%7EGogochar_cdd2.html" title="User:Gogochar">cw1925</a> 20:19, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just spoke with CW1925 and I do believe the article could be viewed as a good reference for horror fans who are interested in reviews, as well as independent directors withing the horror or cult genre. If I may do a little bit of editing, with the permission that CW just gave me, could I have the opportunity to possibly show the article could be more than just a promotional tool for a single site?</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> You don't need permission to do that, Dreemykreem. If you think you can make a case, go for it, but I think the deletion tag will stay on in the meantime. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu-Fool_Danyal_ibn_Amir_al-Makhiri_38e8.html" title="User:Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri">Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri</a> 20:43, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Indeed, you have five days to improve the article, before this AfD closes. However, it is for Wikipedia not important if the site is very useful or absolute rubbish: the only question is if the site has been the subject of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources: has the website been written about by reputable sources (so no blogs, other fansites, ...), has it been the subject of articles, TV shows, books (chapters), ...? If not, then we should not have an article about it. We are an encyclopedia, not a web directory. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 20:45, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Frankly, Bloody-Disgusting's main site (not specifically the forum) is probably the #2 or #3 Horror website on the internet, up with Fangoria and Dread Central. Other than those, I can think of no other site but Bloody-Disgusting that is of the same quality.<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocbp87_1974.html" title="User:Docbp87">Docbp87</a> 03:08, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, sorry. It looks like a decent site, but, you know, there are scores of thousands of decent sites, and we don't want articles on them all. The Wikipedia is weighted toward the web and toward pop culture as it is. There don't appear to be any magazine or newspaper articles about the site or any other proof of notability.

<p><s>Fails <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. The only claim to notability appears to be that it recognizes new "breeds" of dog which the American Kennel Club does not. A search for the availability of sourcing has turned up nothing of note, being either casual references or not meeting <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> guidelines.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. While the article desperately needs to be re-written and expanded, this organization is the largest rare breed association in the United States and very well known, though perhaps not outside of the dog breeding and showing world. They register, show and promote breeds which have been recognized by the <a href="../../../f/%C3%A9/d/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Cynologique_Internationale_5ca0.html" title="Fédération Cynologique Internationale">FCI</a> but have not yet been recognized by the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Kennel_Club_2a94.html" title="American Kennel Club">AKC</a>. Dogs such as the <a href="../../../c/o/t/Coton_De_Tulear_207b.html" title="Coton De Tulear">Coton De Tulear</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cane_Corso_d80a.html" title="Cane Corso">Cane Corso</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_Spitz_45ad.html" title="Japanese Spitz">Japanese Spitz</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bergamasco.html" title="Bergamasco">Bergamasco</a> are registered by this organization. They are discussed in the books in the <i>Kennel Club Dog Breed</i> series and the <i>Essential</i> series by Howell Book House. Many, many other books (I will be happy to provide a list if necessary) contain a phrase similar to "other kennel clubs, including the United Kennel Club and the American Rare Breed Association", which infers the type of notability the organization has in the dog world. They're even discussed in <i>Breeding Dogs for Dummies</i> by Richard G. Beauchamp (2002) and also appear in the Dogs and Puppies for Dummies books; unless a book about breeding or showing dogs is written specifically about or for the AKC, they are generally discussed at some point. They are certainly discussed more frequently in media targets to dog fanciers than mainstream media, but they greatly exceed the non-trivial published works requirement. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShell_Kinney_fd26.html" title="User:Shell Kinney">Shell</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShell_Kinney_fbce.html" title="User talk:Shell Kinney">babelfish</a></sup> 22:37, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment/tentative keep (Strong Keep if evidence provided)</b> - a brief online search tends to suggest it's bona fide, notable and has a reputation in its niche. (eg amongst <a href="http://b.webring.com/webring?ring=rarebreeddogs" class="external text" title="http://b.webring.com/webring?ring=rarebreeddogs" rel="nofollow">rare breed webrings</a> at least, and a decent amount of referencing online.) However what is missing for me is a few solid references to it, by a known reputable dog body, to confirm that in the niche world of rare breeds, this is considered a "known name" and is notable. Get me a few of those and this moves from a tentative to a strong keep. <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">FT2</a> <sup><span style="font-style:italic">(<a href="../../../f/t/2/User_talk%7EFT2_8c21.html" title="User talk:FT2">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_FT2_cd1f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/FT2">email</a>)</span></sup> 23:50, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - found the same webring listed in the top 10 of google references. The webring could itself be suspect (many are), but it does indicate at least a degree of notability. I think it might help if someone could check if they were ever cited as a source for a breed that is considered notable, but I don't have the time (or lately, with the cold, the brainpower) to do that myself right now. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 00:07, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Suspected hoax; there are no sources, and no google hits for the given species name <i>Damalinia sedementaria</i>. A google search for "rock mites" (acarina OR acari) yields 15 results, none of which are pertinent.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Nominator has withdrawn the AfD from the log page. I think the actual AfD debate (this page) should be deleted - G6 or G7? - so that any subsequent AfD won't conflict with it.

<li><b>Delete</b> Article reads somewhat like an advertisement, and lacks reliable sources. Printed articles commenting on this man or his work would be desirable under WP:RS. Since some editors above have complained about 'mass creation' or 'mass deletion' of articles, I think it's desirable that each article be carefully documented in its own right. There may not be any ongoing community of editors knowledgeable about this man who are willing to participate, so the references may not get any better in the future. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 17:57, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No. Bingham McCutchen has been recognized 3 consecutive years by Fortune magazine for its work environment as one of the best companies to work for. It was also recognized by Boston Business Journal and the San Francisco Chronicle. While these references were not included in the article originally, they do show notability (i.e., recognition by multiple independent news sources).

<dd>Fine. Search in Hebrew, but put the information you find in the article or at the very least in this AfD. Claiming to have found something of import to establishing notability in another language and providing that information to actually establish notability are two different things. As for the "widely-accepted" ratings, you'll have to establish that "fact" as well too. It's not my lack of knowledge that's the problem here, it is the lack of evidence. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 05:15, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I question the use of a "size" ranking index to validate notability. Imagine a situation where every company in a category is ranked by size and listed in an index. If 200 firms exist, then even the 182nd largest company is listed in the index and therefore meets <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> under this interpretation, even if the size of the company is 10 staff. Is size of a company notable? Maybe this is more necessary for clarification on the WP:CORP talk page than this AfD, but when the only thing notable about a law firm is "it hires more lawyers than all but 2 others in Israel", then is it still notable? Surely, the #3 biggest law firm in all of Israel has done something to warrant better notability than that. The thing is that I can't find it. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 21:13, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> has over 7 million people in it. As the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem_Post_ac05.html" title="Jerusalem Post">Jerusalem Post</a> article suggests, Israel is saturated in lawyers (with 33,000 lawyers, there is alot more than 200 law firms in Israel; I'm guessing several thousand). Just the mere scope of a law firm being in the top 20 in such a country is inherently notable. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 22:42, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the #1 largest law firm had 26,000 lawyers, the #2 largest law firm had 5,000 lawyers, and the #3 largest law firm had 900 lawyers (the remaining 100 lawyers spread among #4-#whatever), then you could make an argument that #1 was notable based upon size alone, but that 900 pales in comparison and is therefore less notable (if not completely un-notable based solely on size). This is clearly not the case, but gives an example why size ranking alone is hardly a hearty criteria for notability. Even when companies are recognized by independent reliable sources, we sometimes require multiple recognition as such for notability. To hinge keeping an article solely on a very loose interpretation of WP:CORP criterion #2 (ranking indices) is not in accordance with the guidelines of Wikipedia. This is about as clear as I can make it in stating this argument, so I will probably refrain from any further comment on it. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 00:06, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That argument makes no sense. "If the #1 largest law firm had 26,000 lawyers..." is not based in fact. In fact, the #1 law firm in Israel, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herzog%2C_Fox%2C_Neeman_%26_Co._33e1.html" title="Herzog, Fox, Neeman &amp; Co.">Herzog, Fox, Neeman &amp; Co.</a>, has 100 employees and 34 partners. That is huge for a law firm. The #10 firm, <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fischer%2C_Behar%2C_Chen%2C_Well%2C_Orion_%26_Co._b210.html" title="Fischer, Behar, Chen, Well, Orion &amp; Co.">Fischer, Behar, Chen, Well, Orion &amp; Co.</a>, has just over 100. These are very signifficant in a country of just over 7,000,000 and well past the threshold of scope for notable law firms. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 03:04, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was looking at what links here in preparation for a "merge and redirect", which seems to be the best solution. There are a number of templates that use this format of article title, e.g. <a href="../../../u/s/r/Template%7EUSRepSuccessionBox_2f47.html" title="Template:USRepSuccessionBox">Template:USRepSuccessionBox</a>. So, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congressional_Delegations_from_Minnesota_bb3f.html" title="United States Congressional Delegations from Minnesota">United States Congressional Delegations from Minnesota</a> should be renamed <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_Representatives_from_Minnesota_123e.html" title="List of United States Representatives from Minnesota">List of United States Representatives from Minnesota</a> and all occurrences of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congressional_Delegations_from_Minnesota_bb3f.html" title="United States Congressional Delegations from Minnesota">United States Congressional Delegations from Minnesota</a> should be changed. Once the admin approves this solution, I can do it with AWB fairly easily.--<a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EAppraiser_5597.html" title="User:Appraiser">Appraiser</a> 17:10, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongly Oppose</b> because there are 49 other "List of United States Representatives from Foo" articles out there with different information from "[United States Congressional Delegations from Foo". See, for example, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_Representatives_from_Massachusetts_c4a5.html" title="List of United States Representatives from Massachusetts">List of United States Representatives from Massachusetts</a>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, <b>Oppose Deletion</b> - The information presented on the list page presents the information in an alphabetical order with additional notes which the delegations page does not allow.

<li><b>Strongly Oppose</b>, <b>Strong Keep</b> - These articles are here for a reason. While most of them are at the moment woefully inadequate, this one in particular is very well organized. The hope is that the rest of the Representative lists will be completed in the not-too-distant future, but the fact remains that these articles serve a purpose. This is not redundant at all - this shows information on these representatives, as opposed to a graphic representation of when they all served. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValadius_948b.html" title="User:Valadius">Valadius</a> 21:26, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Currently the only additional information for each Rep. is the exact dates of service. "District Home" has no meaning that I'm aware of (districts have no "seat cities"). As for being alphabetical, I can't see much advantage. Browsers have search features that obviate that need.--<a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EAppraiser_5597.html" title="User:Appraiser">Appraiser</a> 22:25, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"District Home" means the Representative's hometown in the district. For example, see one of the congressional district articles, such as <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts%27s_3rd_congressional_district.html" title="Massachusetts's 3rd congressional district">Massachusetts's 3rd congressional district</a>. In it, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_McGovern_ae9b.html" title="Jim McGovern">Jim McGovern</a>'s district home is <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcester%2C_Massachusetts_6e3a.html" title="Worcester, Massachusetts">Worcester, Massachusetts</a>. Back in the 1880's, the Reps from that district were from Boston, which helps indicate where the district was located at the time.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b>, <b>Keep for Now</b>. This list is well organized and took some effort, but it is somewhat repetitive. Components of this list can be folded into others. A larger discussion should take place regarding <b>all</b> delegations to eliminate repetitiveness wherever possible, and what lists link to what articles to begin to get some uniformity going. I'm for keeping this list until that happens. As Valadius states above, many lists are woefully inadequate, and we shouldn't be discouraging initiative. As Markles states above, there are 49 other state lists. They should be taken up en masse rather than singling out a particular state, or at least start eliminating ones that haven't been worked on in a while and are incomplete. On the plus side of deletion, by all of us working on less list types, we may get more work done if we agree to some type of format. The problem lies with policing and agreeing to which lists make sense.<a href="../../../p/m/e/User%7EPmeleski_6cbf.html" title="User:Pmeleski">Pmeleski</a> 23:24, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>In response to <a href="../../../p/m/e/User%7EPmeleski_6cbf.html" title="User:Pmeleski">Pmeleski</a>, the discussion and the agreement on the format has been completed and resolved at <a href="../../../u/s/c/WP%7EUSC_1ca1.html" title="WP:USC">Project Congress</a>, and hence we have the format for the <i>list of reps and list of senators from Foo</i> articles distinct from the <i>Cong Delegation from Foo</i> article. Lots of dedicated Wikipedians have done amazing work on the entirety of Project Congress--and all Project participants invite your participation to further improve these articles — in the context of the larger project.--G1076 03:06, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Please stop using AWB to change links in other articles from "List of…" to "U.S. Cong Delegs from…." You're calling it "cleaning up" but it's not cleaning up, it's making a policy change without consensus, and I don't know how to use AWB to change it back.—<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkles_da7d.html" title="User talk:Markles">Markles</a> 01:35, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Many articles link to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_Representatives_from_Minnesota_123e.html" title="List of United States Representatives from Minnesota">List of United States Representatives from Minnesota</a> because of the templates that are used across all 50 states. There's no practical way to change which article they link to as long as there is no consensus to merge, rename, or delete the article (as it now seems is the case). However, a few articles explicitly linked here, which I was able to change to link to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congressional_Delegations_from_Minnesota_bb3f.html" title="United States Congressional Delegations from Minnesota">United States Congressional Delegations from Minnesota</a>. Whenever the "List" article is completed, I wouldn't mind linking the articles here again, but right now only 24 of the ~140 representatives are on the List and the "Delegations" article has all 140 representatives with links to each of their own articles (which several of us worked on completing). I see no reason to deny the reader the link to the much more complete article, when we have the option. You reverted one of the 1/2 dozen or so articles that I changed, but regardless of the outcome of the "merge" discussion, I think the changes I made are improvements. Can you think of any reason to link to the incomplete one at this point, in those few articles that we have a choice about? The point to rename or merge the articles is to pick up the 100s of articles driven here via templates. (The "cleanup" is just what AWB puts in the comment line - I wasn't trying to obscure the actual changes.)--<a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EAppraiser_5597.html" title="User:Appraiser">Appraiser</a> 02:24, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>1st reason: each and every other state header in <i>ordinal congress</i> articles links to the <i>list of reps</i> article. 2nd reason: If you are concerned that the reader won't have the benefit of the complete list at the <i>Cong Delegation</i> article, put a <i>see also</i> link on the <i>list of reps</i> article to the <i>Cong Delegation</i> article. 3rd reason: It's a lot easier to add that <i>see also</i> link to one article than to change 100's of other articles now, then change the same 100's of articles back.--G1076 03:06, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP!</b> Hi, I just found this amazing article and saw that it was foolishly nominated for delete by some random runescape player as noted on the history thingy. I 100000% agree with everything the above smart people have stated. There is no reason to delete this. Policies need to be change to keep up w/ the times. Plus, I hear there is a IAR policy here at wikipedia. As a common user of wikipedia, I speak for the average person-- keep it or we leave!

<p>I would assume that you promote the deletion of every other page that is a page about any specific school? As for lack of notability, it would seem to me that they list a lot of note worth things on the page. I would propose clean up rather than deletion. What makes the page for UMW so mush better than this? If pages can be created for any/all universities without reprocutions like this, why can't this stay? <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemonOWA_fb01.html" title="User:DemonOWA">DemonOWA</a> 00:10, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

If the school has particular notability on a national level for scholastic achievement, or a history of notable alumni, or high standards, then it would be appropriate; but most elementary and secondary schools don't fit those criteria.

<dd>Also According to the proposed WP:SCHOOLS guidelines, it is ok so have a page about a school if: "The school is distinctive in any one of the following areas, or in any other areas for which it has received press or other coverage." Recently there was quite a lot of coverage relating to the Alpine Robotics Team, which is affiliated with the school. Also in numerous national competitions Poudre High school, and it's affiliated programs have been recognized.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also in the notes section of the WP:SCHOOLS guidelines it states that: "Newspaper coverage includes regular coverage in local media (such as complete stories about a school's athletic program)." Which Poudre High School has been. Orangemike cannot be the judge of this because is not from an area where he has access to local news.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On to note 4 in WP:SCHOOLS guidelines. Although Poudre High School is one of but a few schools in the district, it's academic acheivement is often noted amongst schools in the entire state, and regularly does better than them in many nationally recognized and acclaimed sources such as Newsweek.</dd>
