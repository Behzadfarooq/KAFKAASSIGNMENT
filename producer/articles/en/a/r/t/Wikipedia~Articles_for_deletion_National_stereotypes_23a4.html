<li><b>Delete/Stubify/Rebuild</b> As it stands, this is an outrageously bad article, with little concern for verification beyond the few fig-leaf book references and obscure web links (only related to a few items on the list) at the bottom. There is even less concern for context or sensitive treatment of a controversial subject.There are some descriptions which are just outright offensive and idiotic - the idea that "Most Africans have AIDS and will kill anyone for food" is not a stereotype in general circulation, but it seems, a vile expression of some random editor's own twistedness. It appears that the article creators/editors just find it amusing to list as many stereotypes as possible. This article as it stands is a threat to Wikipedia's reputation. The article could be rewritten encyclopedically, but more than a cleanup is required. I recommend deletion of this article and leaving it as an open stub for rebuilding - with community monitoring by responsible editors <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 20:44, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete.</b> Original research, POV, unencyclopedic, and painfully ignorant. Written entirely from the perspective of a rather un-worldly American: observe how all Africans are lumped into a monolithic ilk of grotesque savages, yet the USA is diligently divided into <i>eight</i> subsections. This article's creator obviously spent some time working on it. I hope he didn't seriously think it would be found acceptable.

<li><b>Keep</b> But revise extensively. An article on stereotypes and racial and national prejudice is quite appropriate.

Show how it is Prof so and so's research, then it isn't OR, is it?

<li><b>Comment:</b> Pages like this, which presume to catalogue opinions and subjective impressions, are impossible not only in practice but in principle. Unlike facts, stereotypes are completely unverifiable, inherently subjective, and may differ dramatically from one person and one locality to another. Who is to decide whether a given stereotype is common, or merely a peculiarity of an individual? Certainly not the person presenting the opinion. We lack the ability to conduct scientific surveys and interviews, which would be original research anyway. Since we admit that most of the opinions currently listed on the page are unfalsifiable and unverifiable, we would be forced to accept any offered opinion, however factually groundless or bizarre. "Jews are made of chocolate? Hey, it may not be true, but if someone believes it..." Vandalism would be indistinguishable from earnest contribution. Bigotry is boundless: can you imagine how large this page would become? Moreover, even if it can somehow be reliably determined that a particular group of people has an established stereotype of another group of people, our policy of countering systemic bias will require that we also mention how <i>other</i> groups of people view the latter group, how the latter group views the former, etc. Accordingly, articles like this will never be anything more than a storehouse of often conflicting personal biases. This is true whether they reflect the view of <i>one</i> person or a thousand persons from all over the world. Because personal impressions don't reflect facts, they can never be formed into any kind of coherent article, especially if they are presented anonymously and out of the context in which they were acquired. A fact may be objectively reported, but an opinion cannot be regarded without a full knowledge of who holds it. Obviously, this is not the purpose of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/h/u/User%7EBhumiya_8fee.html" title="User:Bhumiya">Bhumiya</a> (<a href="../../../b/h/u/User_talk%7EBhumiya_1af5.html" title="User talk:Bhumiya">said</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bhumiya_e6d2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bhumiya">done</a>) 15:57, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless every stereotype has a reference. "Canadians are dependent on the government. They are fond of beer, love hockey, and hate Americans. They end almost evey sentence with the question, "Eh?". They are also know for eating their famous 'Kraft Dinner' and saying 'aboot' instead of 'about.'" True, but <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. -<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_b1fa.html" title="User:Royalguard11">Royalguard11</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalguard11_4f58.html" title="User talk:Royalguard11">Talk</a></sup> 00:59, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as unverifiable original 'research'. Strongly agree with many of the reasons to delete above. The stereotypes here are a random selection with a US bias and no serious commentary. It seems impossible that this list could ever develop into a well-sourced article with an international perspective (NPOV), but if someone does write one, the page could be re-created.--<a href="../../../h/j/m/User%7EHJMG_daa3.html" title="User:HJMG">HJMG</a> 11:34, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep-heavy editing</b> Tawker's orginal complaint that this article is <i>biased, ... and rather offensive</i> smacks heavily of censorship and conflicting bias. However this article does need some heavy editing, specifically regarding the previous comments that stereotypes are normally held by one group of people about another group of people. Therefore it must be stated, and cited, which people hold these opinions. In my not so humble opinion the content of this article has a much bigger impact on humanity that the vast majority of other wikipedia articles.--Ben 14:18, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
