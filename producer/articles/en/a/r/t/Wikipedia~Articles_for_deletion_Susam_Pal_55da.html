<li><b>Comment</b> - 207.229.176.46 states that the article is wrong. I refute this. The article states that Susam has discovered a few vulnerabilities which includes Windows, XSS, SQL Injection as well as Apache. An SQL Injection vulnerability in an Indian site can be used to cause a DoS. So what's the difference? Morover the link that this User ID has posted is a link to a forum which is non-notable.

<dd>go to <a href="../../../s/q/l/Sql_injection.html" title="Sql injection">sql injection</a>. hit ctrl+f5. do a search for "denial" or "dos". you won't get any results. sure, maybe it could help in a few rare circumstances, but they are, in actuality, two very different kinds of attacks. sql injection compromises databases. it allows attackers to read data they might not otherwise be able to read - to insert data they might not otherwise be able to insert. denial of service, per its very name, does not do this. denial of service attacks do just that - <i>deny service</i>. honestly, how can you presume to comment on the notability of anyone in the security field when your understanding of the <i>fundamentals</i> appears to be so piss poor? -- 207.229.176.46</dd>

<dd>you should follow your own advice and go through the article nicely. check out Susam Pal#Assistance to Indian Tourismv. it says he found a vuln "which could be exploited by an attacker to bring the site down thereby making it inaccessible to intended users". "bring down the site" is the definition of a dos. and whether or not it can be is moot. it violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and mistates the vuln. 207.229.176.46 13:08, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>LOL! Whatever is written in the article is true. It is an SQL Injection in the site which can be used to drop tables in the site in question there by causing the DoS attack. I hope you have understood the meaning now. (How the tables can be dropped is not a publicly disclosed fact and is still a guarded secret of the Indian underground community). Ok if that particular statement violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, then that particular line can be removed and it can simply be written that he discovered SQL Injection in the site and demonstrated standard probing techniques. The reference for the latter fact is present in the article. --<a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoot_exploit_dcdf.html" title="User:Root exploit">Root exploit</a> 14:40, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>i will concede that i had not thought of dropping the tables. that said, you're still a fucking idiot. SQL injection allows an attacker do a hell of a lot more than DoS attacks do and to call it a DoS attack is highly inaccurate. here's an example:</dd>

<dd>would it be more accurate to call that xss or sql injection? technically, it's both, but if you could only chose one, it'd be more accurate to say sql injection, because that's, ultimately, what is enabling the xss. your calling of an sql injection vuln a dos is akin to saying that the above is xss, which is wrong. 207.229.176.46 18:11, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, there is a difference between a vulnerability that you post in some XYZ forum like a school kid and some vulnerability that is reviewed by SecurityFocus Bugtraq team and included in the Bugtraq Vulnerability Database. If a vulnerability posted by you enters the Bugtraq Vulnerability Database, network scanners all over the world include this vulnerability in their scanning list. For instance, Susam's Apache vulnerability disclosure is used in scanners.

If a story by you enters slashdot.org, websites all over the world cover the story. since your argument can be so easily adapted to advocate wikipedia entries on everyone who's ever gotten a slashdot.org story accepted, you must also believe that? otherwise, please explain to me how you're not being hypocritical.</dd>

<li>your an idiot if you think including an article on someone who has a few stories on securityfocus is akin to citing the bbc. that comment is attacking the notability of securityfocus or secunia - it's attacking the notability of susam pal. a more proper analogy would be creating a wikipedia article on everyone who has ever written an article that's been published on the bbc. but no matter. you say wikipedia has stooped "so low". well, congratulation's - you've stooped even lower. if the only counter you have to arguments is by misrepresenting them, you shouldn't waste anyone's time trying to counter them in the first place. 207.229.176.46 13:16, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>i think your fucking idiot. i am not saying that SQL injection can't be used to DoS - I am saying that you can do a fuck of a lot more with SQL injection than you can with a DoS attack. at <i>best</i>, DoS attacks are a <i>subset</i> of SQL injection. SQL injection allows things that DoS attacks do not and therefore, calling an SQL injection attack a DoS attack is highly misleading. 207.229.176.46 18:11, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I never said that "Secunia, SecurityFoscus, FrSirt, etc. not notable or verifiable?". When I said "it seems that on an average day, more than ten security vulnerabilites are reported at both the sites", I meant that the subject of the article is just one of the many people who report vulnerabilities. Subscribing to all security-related mailing lists and registering at all security-related websites doesn't make a person notable. And if the person is so notable, where are reliable references? <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJyothisingh_3ee3.html" title="User:Jyothisingh">Jyothisingh</a> 13:10, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am sorry I didn't get this. We are a bunch of guys from erstwhile Orkut hackers' community, erstwhile since the community itself was deleted, who were trying to write some wikipedia articles on the <a href="../../../o/s/v/OSVDB_955b.html" title="OSVDB">OSVDB</a> volunteers. So our purpose was just that. We never intended to edit articles outside the domain of <a href="../../../o/s/v/OSVDB_955b.html" title="OSVDB">OSVDB</a>. So why are we supposed to make more than 10 edits. We have made 2-5 edits per subject. Does that mean our arguments won't be given any importance here? -- <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENareshhacker_6f55.html" title="User:Nareshhacker">Nareshhacker</a> 13:37, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> - The following comment was made:- "Subscribing to all security-related mailing lists and registering at all security-related websites doesn't make a person notable." by JyothiSingh. I would like to make a correction. We are talking of two differen things. Security Mailing Lists and Security Organization Reports. It is quite easy to get your name into every security mailing list of the world. Just post a mail in the Bugtraq mailing list and it would soon be copied by all other security mailing lists. I agree with this point. <b>But the story is different in case of Security Reports</b>. All the references in the article are those of security reports. A security report is published only after verifying the security incident or vulnerabiliy. Only when it is found verifiable and worthful by the security organization, it is published as a report or advisory. So the subject in question had no way of forcing his name into the thousands of security reports that are available in his name. This is just a clarification. Of course the administrators have the right to decide what is the best thing to do with this article. -- <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoot_exploit_dcdf.html" title="User:Root exploit">Root exploit</a> 14:40, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I find the argument that "if you were active in security you'd have heard of him" to be unpersuasive.
