<li><b>Keep</b>. Aside from the arguments others have proffered, I'm very unimpressed by the premise that listing junior B teams means we're going to be compelled to add kindergarten teams; it's a disingenuous argument at best, and I'm sure we can do without the scaremongering. Junior B leagues are the principal feeders into junior A and college hockey programs, no less important than rookie and amateur league teams in baseball ... <i>each and every one</i> of which has an article. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 05:26, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Junior "B" teams ARE notable teams. Also this is a stub, meaning it will be expanded -- I have put forth countless hours of research towards stats and history. Also, hockey is very new to the wikipedia, and more and more members are joining the Wikiproject on a daily basis... the chances of interest and further development are great. I believe that to delete this article before it has fully been written (as it is a stub) is a travesty. Let the Wikiproject do its work. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 00:46, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Canadian towns with a Junior B team pay a lot of attention to their teams. In the Canadian context, this is a notable team. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> 00:29, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> DMighton has obviously been doing a lot of research on these teams, and I believe that he deserves the chance to flesh out the article into something that is worthwhile for inclusion. While my personal preference is not to create an article unless I can expand it into something of meaningful length, the use of stubs is a long accepted practice on Wikipedia. I vote that we let the wikiproject finish its work here, then decide if there is enough to retain an individual page, or if the team articles should be merged into the league page. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 00:59, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> As an encyclopedia, we should strive for completeness whenever possible. Some of the information is difficult to find; this does not relegate it to unnecessary. This entire discussion validates just how necessary it is to include these types of pages in Wikipedia. If users have found these stubs, it goes to show that interest has been generated in them. Furthermore, if a user has put the amount of time into this as DMighton has, then it obviously has some value. Finally, what does it hurt to put up more information than less? If the information is accurate (which I assume it is), then what is happening is that a user has spent a great deal of time locating information across many disparate sources, and this only helps the Wikipedia community. (All this from someone who doesn't have much interest personally in junior hockey, but I am aware of many others who do.) --<a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKermitmorningstar_2754.html" title="User:Kermitmorningstar">Kermitmorningstar</a> 03:50, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> mainly per Resolute but also kermitmorningstar. I think that the articles should be reevaluated AFTER they have been completed by DMighton and if then, there seems to be a lack of information a possible merge with the league page would be in order. <a href="../../../m/b/o/User%7EMBob_54e5.html" title="User:MBob">MBob</a> 04:03, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

I cannot believe that so many want to retain sopmething about a non-notable team - but then when he has be calling on others to help out (as above) abd trying to sway the decision. The argument that WP should strive for completeness if untrue - it should strive to represent notability. This is non-notable and needs to be removed.

<li><b>Comment</b> To anyone interested, the official name of the team is the "Northern Hawks". I have chosen to STUB them as the "Thunder Bay Northern Hawks" in an attempt to dissuade confusion with college teams or any type of animal... and so on. This is a common practice in sports. Often though, you'll see the team being called: "Team Name" of "Team City"; but I was not expecting someone to AfD a simple stub. If, let's say, a user here was to search for the "Thunder Bay Northern Hawks", you would get about a tenth of the official documentation about the team that is on the net as you would if you searched the "Northern Hawks". I am looking at those search results right now. They are plentiful. I hope this clears up any confusion that may occur.

<dd><b>Additional Note to Closing Admin</b> The subject in question is a weighty one. The use of Stubs for wikiprojects and the importance of someone on the outside who does not know much on the subject at hand. Although we do not believe a person outside of the WP's reach is irrelevant... we do believe that if it will effect the long term health of the WP, that it is important. I was attempting to encourage open debate from people that this will actually matter too... nothing else. I now have the administrator with the above notice raining fire and brimstone upon me while he stands by and allows the person who raised this question to taunt me. This is perfectly ok, I can handle this. But this alleged "SPAM" was only a means to include the community inwhich this decision matters. Thank you for your time. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 10:09, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Please, if this is a notable sports team could you provide the evidence - just a sentence would do, as to why Junior B teams deserve a place on WP. It could put this all to rest. Robertsteadman 10:12, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I am not an admin.

<li><b>Keep</b> A reason was already given, but you don't seem to accept it. It's notable if you are interested in it. I might as well nominate "Ununhexium" for deletion because I'm not interested in chemistry and don't find obscure synthetic elements notable. --<a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegalizeit_8ac8.html" title="User:Legalizeit">Legalizeit</a> 10:17, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> not at all - it has nothing to do with whether I am interested or not - and I am interested in ice hockey - it has to do with notability. Please explain how it is genuinely notable and deserves a place in WP - I suggest that all Junior teams A, B and C are probably not notable and should be deleted merged with their league articles, if they have notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> Oops, my mistake... I thought you were just talking tough because you were assume a position of authority... oops... Like I've said before... Robert lost his assumption of good faith a while ago... and you Gerbil, I now trust you as far as I can sling a piano. You have both shown extreme cowardice... teaming up on me on my userpage.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Every professional sports team is notable, no matter the level: see <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingsport_Mets_3d90.html" title="Kingsport Mets">Kingsport Mets</a>, or even the mighty <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilkes-Barre_Scranton_Pioneers_0b55.html" title="Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Pioneers">Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Pioneers</a>. I strongly suggest Robert settle down a bit. I agree that <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> shouldn't have left messages on all of our talk pages, but a simple notice on <a href="../../../h/o/c/WP%7EHOCKEY_7a0a.html" title="WP:HOCKEY">WP:HOCKEY</a> would've sufficed. That said, though he did spam, he didn't say "come and vote keep." Verbatim, from my Talk page: "Hello, a user has decided that he does not want us placing hockey stubs on Wikipedia to expand later into teams. In particular he doesn't like Junior teams... I was wondering if you could please voice your opinion." What's more, this professional hockey team is no less notable than many of the high schools we have on Wikipedia, and every one of those are kept. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User_talk%7ERasputinAXP_2a9a.html" title="User talk:RasputinAXP"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="background: maroon;">&#160;RasputinAXP&#160;</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RasputinAXP_8e7a.html" title="Special:Contributions/RasputinAXP"><small>c</small></a> 11:25, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b> - are they full time professionals - if they feed into the Junior A, then College ice hockey.... Robertsteadman 11:32, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Well, if you knew anything about sports, you would know that anything below major pro: NHL, MLB, or NFL; is not fulltime professional. On the other hand, most Junior teams have legal base salaries -- at all levels. Junior teams also sign players to contract, just like pro.</li>
