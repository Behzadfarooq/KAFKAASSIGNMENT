<dd>The <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> was obviously that the addition of the single word "notable" was an assertion of notability, when the VfU discussion was clearly in opposition to the undeletion of the article on A7 grounds. The recreation at an alternative capitalization with practically the same content is gaming the system, and falls under the same ambit. Had the author just behaved properly when the vote went against him/her, this just wouldn't have happened: alternatively, the good sense to {{<a href="../../../s/o/f/Template%7ESofixit_b7f1.html" title="Template:Sofixit">sofixit</a>}} might have helped considerably, but it took multiple deletions, undeletions, blocks, unblocks, messages and AN/I before anyone got around to that, and did it in the proper way with a /temp page. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 02:15, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you. You see, <a href="../../../n/a/u/Nautica_Thorn_cb68.html" title="Nautica Thorn">Nautica Thorn</a> would definitely qualify as notable in my book. To me this indicates the guidelines are lacking when it comes to determining what porn actors and actresses are notable. The present one seems to imply they're <i>all</i> notable. But while that's fine if you are of the viewpoint nearly every person on Earth is notable anyway (or "worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia", if you will) it seems quite uneven to use the guideline in singling out porn actors this way. I doubt anyone would argue there's not a difference between porn actors and actors in just about any other genre in this regard, but if I'm wrong, I'd like to have that spelled out at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> Â· <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 01:32, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nonsense. A student is not notable as a student except for very few rare cases, which would have to be explained. But is it very common for an actor to be notable for simply being an actor and having a minimum name recognition, but there may be no practical way to demonstrate that in an article. Here on VfD we can point to Google counts and other metrics which would be unencyclopedic in the article itself. <a href="../../../n/o/p/User%7ENoPuzzleStranger_093e.html" title="User:NoPuzzleStranger">NoPuzzleStranger</a> 01:59, August 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it works that way for any speedy. <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> explicitly talks only about the <i>content of articles</i>, not about their topics. The criterion under which this article was deleted reads "an article about a real person that does not assert that person's importance or significance" (and follows this up with the reason why we're here: "if the assertion is disputed or controversial, it should be taken to VFD instead"). It seems hard to argue that the article "asserted that person's importance or significance", unless you want to agree with NoPuzzleStranger that adding "notable" is such an assertion. (Grammatically speaking he's completely right, of course.) If you want to argue administrators <i>additionally</i> have the requirement of checking whether the article doesn't happen to ineffectively talk about a notable person who's significance is not established before speedying: I can't see anything in any policy anywhere where that is even implied. If you want to hold administrators responsible this way, I suggest amending policy to make this more explicit. I will agree with you that continuing to speedy an article despite objections is a bad idea, but I cannot agree with you that the original speedies where as baseless as you seem to suggest they were. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> Â· <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 01:50, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No matter what the CSD's say, we don't expect our administrators to act blindly and delete perfectly good articles on the basis of content--at least I don't. Obviously this was a VfD candidate from the first, asserting as it did that the person named was an American porn star. The way to remove doubt would have been to type her name into google and see if anything comes out--if it doesn't, then it's a clearly spurious claim and can be speedied; otherwise some discussion may be required.</li>
<li>I'm sorry that you don't seem to see anywhere in policy that says administrators are expected to be persons of generally good judgement. Maybe we should add something to that effect to our policy, though of course it would be superfluous because obviously we all are, so we don't usually go around blindly deleting articles on the basis that if we squint a bit we can pretend that the subjects aren't pretty famous people. But we all make mistakes. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:08, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Rational continuation of this argument seems pointless. You clearly believe administrators cannot delete articles (or ought not, at least) unless they first make a good attempt at establishing the notability of their subjects, and failing. I do not. The remainder of the straw man arguments and hyperbole are not worth addressing. I understand your point perfectly well, Tony. No need to give it an ironic, or even sarcastic edge. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> Â· <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 02:18, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm sorry that you thought I was being sarcastic. I do sincerely believe that we're all capable of being good administrators. I don't think that ever involves deleting articles that say stuff like "X is a porn star" without even checking on google. The claim that a person is a porn star is a claim of notability (porn is mass distributed and so thousands, possibly even hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to the attributed work of a person who works in that industry). Now if I wrote an article "Meritanio Gonzalez is a porn star" you would obviously want to know if this were a likely claim. But it's easy enough to check it. I have done RC patrol myself, it just doesn't make sense to blindly delete stuff because a lot of it turns out to be easily verifiable and if you delete it you've just deleted something that can be made into a good stub in a few seconds. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:53, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, now I see where the argument lies. You consider porn stars (existing ones, obviously) to be notable <i>because</i> porn is mass distributed. I find myself holding the exact <i>opposite</i> opinion: I'd expect that so many porn movies are made and so many porn actors hired that individual ones need to have good claims to fame. Now I also see why you must have thought me a bit of an idiot to belabor the point: you would consider the assertion "X is a porn star" to be a <i>good claim</i> of notability and thus not something you could apply the speedy criterion to; I'd consider it <i>insufficient</i>. This seems like a pretty serious discrepancy, though. We should definitely try to get some consensus on the issue outside this individual case. I'd imagine we're not the only two people representing either side. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> Â· <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 03:02, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Without, hopefully, talking out of turn, it seems pretty clear to me Jonathunder might be referring to the (two) <a href="../../../v/f/u/WP%7EVfU_1b7f.html" title="WP:VfU">VfUs</a> on the matter. It's likewise equally clear that Kappa and Tony are disputing they're relevant to the VfD. Do you think I feel stupid for pointing out these things? Man, you better believe it.

<li>As I understand it, VFU is a place where people are supposed to go to appeal bad deletions. It isn't VfD, it has no power to mandate deletion, only to recommend undeletion.

<li>Extreme Holly was kept; there was no consensus to delete. And <i>that</i> porn star didn't even have any imdb entry. She worked solely from her website.

<li>Closer inspection will reveal that the two "keep" voters quoted the same links as "notable", and that the addition of a single <i>delete</i> voter would have resulted in deletion. Thus demonstrating that there is <b>no current consensus</b>, and that both User:John Kenney's and your comments are not representative of any facts in evidence. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 05:43, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>See above: that there was no consensus was <i>my</i> point. Recall that a minute ago you cited the "three-fifths" as a significant result--now you've just as good as admitted that if a single delete voter had gone the other way there was have been three-fifths in the other direction. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 05:52, 15 August 2005 (UTC)
