<li><s>Abstain</s>, but two things: firstly the future redlink eclipses should be dewikilinked, as creating the articles would be <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">crystal balling</a>, and secondly the article needs to be renamed, as the title uses the past tense even though the article includes to eclipses 800 years in the future. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 00:24, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sadly, we cannot dewiki the future dates due to the poor design of MediaWiki in overloading the brackets to indicate not only internal links, but date preferences as well. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 01:50, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually this would be one of the very few legitimate exceptions to the crystal ball argument. Eclipses really are predictable centuries in advance. All it takes is physics and mathematics. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 07:15, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>From <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: "Lists of tropical cyclone names is encyclopedic; "Tropical Storm Alex (2010)" is not, even though it is virtually certain that a storm of that name will occur in the North Atlantic and will turn counterclockwise." That seems to match future eclipses perfectly. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 15:55, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, it's not a perfect match. While the chance of a tropical storm occuring in 2010 is extremely high, the chance that future eclipses will happen is orders of magnitude more likely. You could almost say as likely as the sun will rise tomorrow morning.&#160;:) Unless some *extremely* improbable event happens, such as the Earth being destroyed by <a href="../../../v/o/g/Voguns.html" title="Voguns">Voguns</a>, these eclipses will happen. I still wouldn't link to the dates, however. Better to link to a single page on future astromical events or something. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 18:54, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe I've misinterpreted, but I interpreted that sentence, specifically "<i>even though</i> it is virtually certain", to mean that crystal balling does not necessarily exclude articles about subjects that are certain to happen. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 19:14, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The exact wording is, "Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place." Basically what it would take to alter this schedule is a collision with a very large comet - a collision on a scale neither the earth nor moon have experienced in hundreds of millions of years. So yup: this article falls within Wikipedia's narrow exception. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 02:09, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well that's exactly my point. The <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">Solar eclipse</a> article already has a list of recent and upcoming (to 2020) eclipses across the world. The question I ask to the Wikipedia community in this AFD is whether or not a separate article is needed for China, with eclipses ranging from 1001 to 3000. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonel_Cow_7b4f.html" title="User:Colonel Cow">Colonel Cow</a> 03:34, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Solar eclipses can be seen from worldwide area is very different from solar eclipses can be seen from a specific location. For worldwide, total solar eclipses are common, about once every one or two years, but for a specific location, they are very rare events, about once every 300 years. So it makes sense to list these rare events in a separated article. â€” Yaohua2000 09:44, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But one could just check the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">Solar eclipse</a> page and look for eclipses in their region of the world (it says where the eclipse will happen on that page). Now, it doesn't go as far into the future as this article, but whether or not a list really needs to go to 3000 is a separate debate (which I'm sure those at the Solar eclipse page have already debated). --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonel_Cow_7b4f.html" title="User:Colonel Cow">Colonel Cow</a> 14:01, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I always wondering when I can see a total solar eclipse in my hometown when I was a child, total eclipse is rather rare, and it is not easy for a layman to work it out with enough precision, for people with similar questions, this article focuses on the previous and next total and annular solar eclipses from a specific location on the Earth, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">Solar eclipse</a> doesn't contain such information, and such information is also rare on the web. Wikipedia and this article gives the answer. So I think it is useful, and perhaps encyclopedic, if it has a worldwide view some time, it can be a great article. â€” Yaohua2000 20:26, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">Solar eclipse</a> does in fact have that information (or is being added). If I were someone in New York, I could go to the Solar eclipse article and look for the next time an eclipse will occur for me in that list (by looking for "North America"). Same thing if I were anywhere in the world. If I were in Beijing, I'd go and look for eclipses under Asia. Solar eclipse already has this worldwide view that you speak of, and so pages like this aren't needed in my opinion. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonel_Cow_7b4f.html" title="User:Colonel Cow">Colonel Cow</a> 21:01, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you did some research on this topic, you might not think so. Absolute most (&gt; 95%) total solar eclipses in North America is not total in New York. Even in Beijing, Beijing municipality is far smaller than North America, but during A.D. 1001 and A.D. 2000 period <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beijing&amp;oldid=30993185#Astronomical_phenomena" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beijing&amp;oldid=30993185#Astronomical_phenomena" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, 7 total eclipses occured from somewhere in the municipality, but only one visible in the urban area. So for someone only check total eclipses visible in North America, or even State of New York doesn't make so much sense to total eclipses in New York City. â€” Yaohua2000 21:33, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So then a column on the Solar eclipse page e.g. "Total eclipse viewable in" would be a good idea, but it still doesn't change that a list about China itself (when the information could be put on the Solar eclipse page and represent a worldwide view) is "listcruft" in my opinion, as Sceptre put it. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColonel_Cow_7b4f.html" title="User:Colonel Cow">Colonel Cow</a> 21:41, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You can create such a column in <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipse</a>, but make this column as a separated article would be better. â€” Yaohua2000 22:18, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and keep the future listings too. Eclipses are one of the very few things that really are predictable. Physics and mathematics do not equal a crystal ball. I'm going to go out on a limb here because my father was a NASA scientist and I grew up with this sort of stuff. I see what these list creators are doing and it makes a lot of sense. There should be more lists like this for other major cities. The information at <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipse</a> is too general to be useful for eclipse enthusiasts. These are people who spend thousands of dollars and plan years in advance so that they can observe the real show during a solar eclipse, and by that I mean the very small path of totality where the sky goes dark. This sort of person would want to know, "Will there be a total eclipse in my metropolitan area during my lifetime?" If they're likely to be alive for the next one, then that saves a small fortune. These people would use a series of similar lists because they would designate easy points of travel: nearly two-thirds of the earth's surface is ocean and some of the rest is pretty uninhabitable. I believe this year's total eclipse will be in the Sahara desert. Solar eclipses are about the most verifiable information on earth and they're unquestionably notable. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 07:10, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> on 3 points.

Third point: Even though I am really keen on physics and astronomy as a hobby, this kind of info qualifies as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">an indiscriminate collection of information</a> and really belongs on some astronomy website, where the information probably comes from. Taken to one extreme, if this article is kept then similar articles <i>for every country in the world</i> would be equally acceptable and IMHO is overkill. Taken to another extreme, since prediction of eclipses is not crystal balling, predictions from the beginning of time to the end of time would be equally valid, and <b><a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28numbers%29_3077.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)">Wikipedia is not infinite</a></b>.

<li>If you carried that reasoning to its logical conclusion Wikipedia would become a very small project supported only by journal articles and books. Many articles present information that is available on other Internet websites. Let's leave this alone and chase down the real cruft: the copyvios and the phone lists of fast food restaurants in Manila. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 18:53, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and Comment</b>, for <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> you pointed, but this is NOT original research. I suggest you read what original research first, since solar eclipses are verifyable. Anyone with a astrosoft and some astronomical knowledge can verify these eclipses. â€” Yaohua2000 12:32, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think you misunderstand <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> - it says that everything must be <i>verifiable</i>, not verified.

<li>The limited English language skills of these article creators hinders their ability to advocate for these entries. Had I noticed these nominations I would have defended them all. The mistaken reasoning cited in some deletion votes (such as the fallacy that eclipses are unpredictable) is strong evidence that Wikipedia needs <i>more</i> articles about astronomy. Solar eclipse information is an excellent starting point. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 18:59, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think having the <a href="../../../e/c/l/Eclipse.html" title="Eclipse">eclipse</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipse</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_eclipse.html" title="Lunar eclipse">lunar eclipse</a> articles is sufficient to explain eclipses. A list of eclipses will not increase understanding of astronomy, except by duplicating content in other articles in the introduction or linking to other articles. Also, covering eclipses by the country will require many articles, and covering them by the city would require an enormous amont of articles. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 22:51, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
