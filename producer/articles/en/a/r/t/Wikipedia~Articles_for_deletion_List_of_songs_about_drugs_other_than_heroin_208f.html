<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was no consensus to delete, however there does seem to be a rough consensus that we don't need a separate list for heroin. Therefore I will follow the suggestion of <b>moving</b> this to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_about_drugs.html" title="List of songs about drugs">List of songs about drugs</a>, then <b>merge</b> <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_about_heroin.html" title="List of songs about heroin">List of songs about heroin</a> into it. Since yours truly is truly a <i>lazy</i> administrator, the first version will be crude, and it will have the heroin list as a separate section. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:32, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> per DCarrano. <i>One</i> list about drugs is encyclopedic, given that the references are often in coded langauge and obscure to the "un-hip" <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 9 July 2005 04:45 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I disagree. It is an alphabetical list, and can be searched or tabbed easily; if one wishes to view all drugs songs, then one will simply have to confront the fact that there are many songs about drugs. Distinctions based on drug type seem arbitrary to me (other than, perhaps a distinction of legality to exclude alcohol, caffiene, and nicotine, which are widely legal, and substantially different in their level of social acceptability.) <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 02:29, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's already a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_about_drinking.html" title="List of songs about drinking">list of songs about drinking</a> to cover alcohol. Every list of songs about drugs I've ever seen, going back to the original Rock Source Book in the late 1970s, divided it by type of drug if it was specific.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 04:25, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>And that doesn't change the fact that it would still be way too long and unwieldy. Combine it into one list of songs about drugs, and I guarantee you that within a week the edit page will warn that it's getting too long and people on the Talk page will be talking about organizing separate lists for cocaine, marijuana, heroin etc.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 04:28, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Oh, and another thing: <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">Heroin</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marijuana.html" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a> all have song lists specific to those drugs (My proposal is, once the standalone lists are substantially complete, to propose over there that those sections simply link to the lists).<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 04:34, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Correction: <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannabis_%28drug%29.html" title="Cannabis (drug)">cannabis (drug)</a> does not have a song list. But the other two do.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 04:37, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, if you are arguing that a merged "drug" list wouldn't survive because of complaints from editors about its length, I'll defer to your judgment, because you have more experience with those editors. I'm afraid, though, that this will leave you with a harder case for VfD in the future. Distinctions by drug may be practical, but I don't think they're either intuitive or independently significant. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 08:01, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

I think recreational drug use is the most common definition for the word "drug" (as opposed to medicinal use). What do you guys/gals think? Think the topic definetly warrants inclusion, afterall we have a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_containing_the_name_of_a_ship%2C_aircraft_or_spacecraft.html" title="List of songs containing the name of a ship, aircraft or spacecraft">List of songs containing the name of a ship, aircraft or spacecraft</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_about_nuclear_war.html" title="List of songs about nuclear war">List of songs about nuclear war</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> A list of songs about drugs would, as the three about specific drugs would show if combined, be far too long. Once I get around to creating "List of songs about hallucinogens," then it would be prudent to have a list of songs about other drugs (since I think there really aren't enough about, say, amphetamines to justify a specific list for that) and a list of songs about drugs in general (Lynyrd Skynyrd's "That Smell," for instance).<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 19:34, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> all the separate lists per drug - they could be merged into an article about "narcotics use in the music business" or something like that. However, since there seem to be controversy about what songs actually are about drug use (outside commentators claim some song is drug-derived when the songwriter disagrees) that should be limited to "admitted" examples. (Moreover. I think that any list of song could be merged into an article about the issue - various historical articles also have references to derived fiction, for example) - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 11:31, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, we really should be having this argument on the talk pages for the separate lists. And the lists you could keep grow lengthy enough that they merely crowd up the articles in question, as I've been arguing.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 06:11, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>. I actually think that there is good reason for the page; there is already a page about Heroin specifically, of which there are man. However, I think the best option is to combine the two pages. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolkor_00a7.html" title="User:Folkor">Folkor</a> 19:16, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>If this list is deleted because it's not encyclopedic, pretty much all lists of songs would have to be deleted. --<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFritz_Saalfeld_18b1.html" title="User:Fritz Saalfeld">Fritz Saalfeld</a> 08:20, July 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>
