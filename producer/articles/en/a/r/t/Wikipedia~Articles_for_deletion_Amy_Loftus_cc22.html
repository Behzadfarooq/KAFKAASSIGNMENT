<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Hu, did I not get the memo? The article was created only 2006-12-05T00:45:08&#160;! It needs to be marked as stub and allowed to grow!

<li>Apparently you didn't. You couldn't be bothered to even do so little as to stub it. I did. I also moved some material from its talk page into the article. Articles don't need to be "full-length, fully referenced from day 0" (though it <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_write_a_great_article_687a.html" title="Wikipedia:How to write a great article">is recommended</a> and has been done), but <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">biographical articles</a> <b>do</b> need to clearly indicate the notability of the subject.

<li><b>Comment</b> Apparently I didn't. I don't care about Amy per se (I apologize for this discussion here), but I am at loss why Wikipedia should not to allow articles to incubate for a few days before nominating for deletion.

<li><b>Keep:</b> After Morven thoughtfully added notability information to the article, I have changed my "vote" to "keep" because now the notability is properly asserted and referenced.

<p><b>Comment:</b> So many advocates for the article and yet not a single one has enhanced it, not even the "Strong Keep" or the article's creator, despite being notified. The only two people to enhance it proposed the deletion and voted for deletion. What a joke all these "keep" votes turn out to be! <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 18:39, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am very mindful of being civil. I very carefully wrote that the votes were the joke, not the editors. I choose my words carefully and I always hope that people will read carefully. The comment did turn out to be helpful as it stimulated some positive edits on the article, which was one of my purposes in making the remark, and which none of the "keep" votes accomplished. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 21:11, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is collectively that the votes were "a joke" (singular), and I pointed to the irony that the edits (and that they advanced the article) were not made by the defenders.

<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, Hateless, but your argument doesn't hold water. Claiming Hu is being disrespectful by point out <b>fact</b> is not very civil either. The <b>fact</b> is there are people who will vote keep for an unsourced, non-notable, unwikified stub and yet will not fix it, expand it, or source it. It's not an accusation of hypocracy, it's a statement of fact. If someone thinks this article should be expanded, they should expand it, not expect others to do so. Otherwise, the keep vote is merely an empty gesture that should be discounted since it relies neither on policy nor on the intent to bring the article up to the standards that would meet policy. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 22:39, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't subscribe that there is a moral impetus to expand an article (afterall, we're all volunteers), and the idea that there should be social pressure that force people to do so is repugnant to me. Nor do I subscribe the idea that opinions can be automatically discounted on Wikipedia if <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> is not a factor. You also seem to miss the point of discussions and consensus if everything is as policy-driven as you claim it is (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WIkipedia is not a bureaucracy</a>). Your tolerance of inflammatory language is also not something I agree on.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Voting for keeping an article in no way obligates one to work towards fixing and enhancing that article. We should vote keep if the given article covers a subject that is notable and verifiable, which apparently this is, although the article may be poorly written and poorly sources. A poorly done article on a notable and verifiable topic should be marked for cleanup, not deletion. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:51, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Agree, of course. The irony remains, nonetheless (as does the doubt on notability). I've been on the other side of the fence too, voting to keep an article and not having time or knowledge to improve it.

<li><b>Delete</b> Deleted references to subjects website as they are not valid citations. Now, we have two left to consider. One, she is the subject of a writer's choice award, I can think of high school students who have recieved similiar awards who are known only by their family and friends. The second item, the 3rd place in one of many categories in the International Songwriter Competition, does not do it for me either. I have no idea how prominent that ISC competition is in the music industry, but it didn't appear that professional to me by reviewing their web site. Therefore I support DELETE based on lack of <a href="../../../v/_/_/Wp%7Ev.html" title="Wp:v">Verifiablity</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wp%7Ebio.html" title="Wp:bio">Biography Notability</a><a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 09:14, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Self-published sources are not acceptable to establish notability BUT are acceptable sources of non-controversial biographical detail. I have thus reverted your changes to the article. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 11:00, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
