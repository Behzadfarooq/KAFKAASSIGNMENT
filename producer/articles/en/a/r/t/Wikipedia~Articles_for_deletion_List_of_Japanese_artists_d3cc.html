<li>Not everyone is in the camp that lists must always be ended if there is a category. This list is pretty tepid, but maybe someone can find something to make it as expansive as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Chinese_painters_6e5d.html" title="List of Chinese painters">List of Chinese painters</a>. Although on that there is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Japanese_painters_09f1.html" title="List of Japanese painters">List of Japanese painters</a>. Possibly this should be merged with that, or the painters list should be merged with this as artists is a broader term. Anyway point being the Japanese are surprisingly poorly covered at Wikipedia compared to how many of them there are. (I checked this) So if someone can make this a long list of important, but poorly covered, Japanese artists that'd be good. In fact I might do that now.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 08:13, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This list was not in a category so I was essentially unaware of it until now.

<dd>The purpose of article for deletion is to decide on deletion or not. It is not something to warn people that an article may be deleted so they better rush off and throw some quickie edits on it.

<li><b>Comment</b> You have to weigh the value of what was in the article when it was nominated for AfD, and one name a list does not make. So the Nomination for deletion was ultimately correct see <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">CSD-A1</a>. The issue is he used Article for Deletion instead of speedying it. The people with the sudden interest in the fate of this article have no history of editing oriental art articles, or for the most part art at all. I checked their contributions. They are all however regular contributers to other list articles. I sincerely believe that they are letting their personal opinion of the value of these types of articles, to come between the removal of an article which has limited value, and in this case can be best served with an existing category. The use of Categories is the proper way to go for things of this nature, especially where there is little interest in developing, maintaining, and promoting the list. Several people have mentioned that the lists best indicate articles which need creation. This is true however the process is better served by the request for article process. Non-existent articles links in article content are of a limited benefit to the Wikipedia and indeed can run off newbie visitors. -- <a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusanLarson_f734.html" title="User:SusanLarson">SusanLarson</a> <span><sup>(<a href="../../../s/u/s/User_talk%7ESusanLarson_fb19.html" title="User talk:SusanLarson">User Talk</a>, <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SusanLarson&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SusanLarson&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">New talk</a></span>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SusanLarson_f10c.html" title="Special:Contributions/SusanLarson">Contribs</a>)</sup></span> 22:36, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not invalid, <i>hasty</i>. The usual procedure is to bring such a list to the attention of the community before nominating it. This list in particular was less than three months old. It is very odd that anyone would introduce a reference to patent nonsense in this discussion. With so much actual nonsense at Wikipedia it seems strange to single this out.

<p><b>comment</b> CSD-A1 is short articles: Articles #1 "Very short articles providing little or no context (e.g., "He is a funny man that has created Factory and the Hacienda. And, by the way, his wife is great."). Limited content is not in itself a reason to delete if there is enough context to allow expansion. A search engine may help in determining context and allow for the article's expansion." One name lists would qualify under that section. As for no history I was primarily speaking of T. Anthony who initially stepped up proclaiming an active interest handling this article. At the time I posted that I did not know others had shown an interest in or stepped up to edit on that article. At this point I am flexible on keeping the article or not. I would suggest that a list should be more than a list and include actual text on the arts in Japan. New question is why can this not be added to the Japanese Art article? -- <a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusanLarson_f734.html" title="User:SusanLarson">SusanLarson</a> <span><sup>(<a href="../../../s/u/s/User_talk%7ESusanLarson_fb19.html" title="User talk:SusanLarson">User Talk</a>, <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SusanLarson&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SusanLarson&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">New talk</a></span>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SusanLarson_f10c.html" title="Special:Contributions/SusanLarson">Contribs</a>)</sup></span> 00:19, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm more flexible on lists then you might think. If this information could be merged to the article on <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_art.html" title="Japanese art">Japanese art</a> without losing any information that could be okay. I'm not for that in some cases as it ends ups distracting from the article, but it's worth thinking about. Likewise merging <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Japanese_painters_09f1.html" title="List of Japanese painters">List of Japanese painters</a>, with the proviso of putting the new names in the format used here, I think should be considered. Have I even voted on this?--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 01:12, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>On second thought the Japanese art article is already fairly long. However this could be made a link at the bottom of it acting as a kind of addendum of sorts.(And I'm going to put a merge notice on the painters list)--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This list is a stub. Keep and expand stubs. They cannot grow if they're deleted. Wikipedia does not have a policy stating that articles must be in their complete and final form before being posted. Such a policy would be contrary to the nature of a wiki.
