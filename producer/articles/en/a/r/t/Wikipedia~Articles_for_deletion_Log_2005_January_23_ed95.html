<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was delete. However, 1) noting that redirects are cheap, 2) noting that there is no compelling reason why the history of this article must be eliminated from Wikipedia and 3) hoping that a redirect will make clear to all the users who contributed to this mistake, I am going to exercise my discretion and replace the article with a redirect instead. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 08:05, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have no idea why this page was created. There already exists List of music videos by name: A. First the creator of this page removed links to the older page and similar alphabetical lists from List of music videos by year. Then he created new alphabetical lists, like this page, and added links to them.</p>
<p>List of music videos by name: A has now all the videos that this page has, so you can safely delete the newer one. By the way, does creating redundant articles like this qualify as vandalism? -<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHapsiainen_6f9e.html" title="User:Hapsiainen">Hapsiainen</a> 16:21, Jan 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Simply being NPOV does not mean that an article is merited. If I created an article called Items on Carrp's Desk, it could be completely NPOV, yet certainly doesn't merit mention in WP. Why couldn't the information in Jews in USA be included on one of the many other pages that discusses Jews? In fact your information <b>is</b> already included in WP and appears to have been copied verbatim from <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_American_e82f.html" title="Jewish American">Jewish American</a>'s population section. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> 02:45, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>You ignored the google hit argument and books and articles on jewishvirtual library. I have added relevant information from jewishvirtuallibrary. i think now your complaints are gone. Any other complaints? <a href="../../../z/a/i/User%7EZain_engineer_cf12.html" title="User:Zain engineer">Zain</a> 03:12, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We'll let users vote on this. I personally think an article with 100% pasted content from a website should be deleted. If you believe WP is missing information in the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_American_e82f.html" title="Jewish American">Jewish American</a> article, why not add it there? If you really like the "Jews in USA" title, make it a re-direct. We have different opinions on this page and I'm going to let the VfD process proceed. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> 03:18, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your thought about copying is 100% correct. (by the way I also mentioned it in edit comment). it is bcoz the vfd was called without much discussion. So ofcourse now we have to NPOV the claims of Jewish virtual library. I'll really love if you lend a hand in it. So a lot of work is left in that article that's why I labeled it as a stub. but your demand of proving 'uniqueness' of the article required quick adding of data. So if you think it shouldn't be copied as it is. You should edit it. Plus the jewish virtual library data is in public domain. Wikipedia is also public domain. and its policy says that we can copy paste text from public domain sources whenever applicable.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Now about <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_American_e82f.html" title="Jewish American">Jewish American</a> that article is generally about individuals and this is more about community interactions. These two are different things. One is about individuals other is their collective influence. you can understand this difference when u read jewishvirtuallibrary. 'American Jews' are treated different then 'jews in america' both topics are given different treatments. So is here. Now your objections gone? <a href="../../../z/a/i/User%7EZain_engineer_cf12.html" title="User:Zain engineer">Zain</a> 03:29, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rather than this being a vote for deletion or not, I would like an explaination. Having worked on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_the_United_States_c2b0.html" title="History of the Jews in the United States">History of the Jews in the United States</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_American_e82f.html" title="Jewish American">Jewish American</a>, both would seem to be good places for material on Jews and politics. In fact, I have already writen a lot of material on these subjects in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_the_United_States_c2b0.html" title="History of the Jews in the United States">History of the Jews in the United States</a>. Why not add material there? It already talks about Jews and socialism, Jewish support for Israel after 1967, and Jews and civil rights. Or, add it to <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_American_e82f.html" title="Jewish American">Jewish American</a>, which is not about individuals at all if you read the article. Please justify the article (not the title, which is fine, but could be a redirect) and why it needs to be seperate. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 06:37, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>I did a little more search work for it and I found <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/copyright.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/copyright.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> It probably suggests that we can reprint (reproduce the work) if we put link to jewish virtual library. Similar to GFDL I think. Only one constraint that if the content is not orignal work of jewishvirtuallibrary but it is a borrowed work. Then we have to get permission to orignal source too. The content which I copied was not a third party work.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Now American Jew refers to individuals. While this one is about community. I found neglect of this topic when I used to view jew article. There was a section of jew world wide in that we had sub-sections of jew in Europe etc but had no section of jews in USA. So It is normally difficult to put some content directly in jew article. So I prefer making a seperate article then by vfd get a merge vote.</dd>

<ul>
<li>The Jew article talks about populations in Israel and the Diaspora, the Europe thing has since been changed, so your argument does not make sense. The article on American Jew talks about the American Jewish community, look at the content, not just the title (if you want, redirect this title to that article). Plus, so does History of the Jews in the United States. You have not explained what you want this article to cover that is not in the other two, or, indeed, what content you want to see here. It just seems redundant. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 02:27, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Doesn't it suggest that the content is 'irrelevant' in the context of title? And we should move that content from that article to this article.</dd>
<dd>Now about the jew article. I was just mentioning that this topic is some time ignored. It was ignored when jews in europe and even africa were mentioned. Now the structure has changed so that is no longer an issue. But I was refering it as a general trend.</dd>
<dd>Now what content I want in this article. Almost in same direction as it is mentioned in jewishvirtuallibrary if that is copyrighted. (I copied the link which suggested that reproduced is allowed). That content will be somewhat irrelevant in american jews. normally the 'relevance' issue is brought when a change is brought which is not liked by most editors. So I found that better solution is to create a whole new article. Instead of wasting time in debating what is 'relevant' or 'irrelevant'. <a href="../../../z/a/i/User%7EZain_engineer_cf12.html" title="User:Zain engineer">Zain</a> 02:38, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)<br /></dd>

<li>I'm totally confused. This has both a copyvio notice and further content. I thought that was never supposed to happen: if the copyvio notice is there, any rewrite should be at Jews in USA/Temp.

<li>Regarding the Copy-vio aspects of this discussion:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>This page is not empowered by make copyvio decisions.</li>
<li>Copy-vio discussion is therefore off-topic here, and a disruption of the VfD process.</li>
<li>The previous discussion of copy-vio does not cast doubt on any votes, since no one gave copy-vio as the reason for their vote.</li>
<li>It has long been policy (but i have made no effort to be sure there have been no changes) that the introduction of copyright-protected material cannot be remedied by removal of the problematic material from the article by editing, so it requires the special permissions needed to remove it from the history as well.</li>
<li>The reason for prohibiting editing of a page under copy-vio consideration is that it is impractical to extract the new contributions from every copy-vio-ed page, leading to loss of those contributions. Thus
<ol>
<li>Those who edit an article that already contains a Copy-vio notice deserve to have their contribs go to waste.</li>
<li>Those who edit an article after the introduction of material that is later determined to be copyright protected, but before the Copy-vio notice is added, may have a legitimate gripe; i don't know if there is a solution in practice, but they should discuss the situation with someone experienced with copy-vio handling.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In the case of this page, post-copyvio-notice editing has apparently already begun, and taking it off VfD won't fix that.</li>
<li>I am adding this article to the copy-vio page, on the basis that there are disputed opinions here of copy-vio, and that is where the expertise on what is or isn't a violation is assembled. (Copyright law is a matter for experts, despite opinions of others that they understand everything about it.)</li>
<li>If the article is voted for deletion under VfD (which seems likely, given the 9-Del/1-Keep tally), and completes before a copyvio decision is reached (which seems plausible, with a little over 3 days left), the copy-vio consideration becomes moot.</li>
<li>Therefore (and especially since there is no agreement about the copyvio being real), IMO this VfD should continue.</li>
<li>Two interested editors delayed voting under the influence of the copy-vio confusion, and others may have been put off by it without saying so. Therefore if any additional Keep votes from well-established registered users come by the end of the 28th, the possibility of the misguided discussion changing the result becomes plausible, and i will re-link this page so discussion continues until the end of the 30th, as if it had been nominated today, so there is no question of it being deleted without 5 full days of consideration.</li>
<li>I will transfer the copy-vio discussion presently on this page, where it is an irrelevant distraction and impediment, to the copy-vio page, replacing it with a note and link to its new location.</li>

<li>Regarding what we are voting on:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>This page is not empowered to make or act upon decisions about whether a copyvio has occurred.</li>
<li>Any vote on VfD is a vote on whether the title in question should continue to be the title of a page on WP.</li>
<li>Many voters chose to vote something instead of, or in addition to, Keep or Delete; in effect such votes are additional guidance available to future editors about what the community will tolerate. (E.g., a consensus to "Keep as Redirect" is compelling evidence that the redirect may not be converted back to an article.)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep.</b> Correct to "Seraphim Records". I have no idea what the status is today, but in the fifties and sixties LP era Seraphim was Angel's "bargain" line. The connection between the companies was obvious, the label design was very similar, and IIRC the labels explained that Seraphims were "Angels of the highest order." Most recording companies had similar bargain labels, which in most cases were simply older releases. RCA had two, Victrola and Camden. London had... rats, I can't remember that name, but I <i>loved</i> that label, because at the time London had some of the best recorded sound there was, and their bargain label was just as good, just older releases... <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:28, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>DELETE. Angel Records' own website says</p>
<p>Angel Records was founded in the early 1950s and was later purchased by Capitol Records. Angel Records signs, develops and markets a select roster of classical, crossover, Broadway, world and folk artists and releases. Angel Records is also responsible for U.S. marketing of artists and releases for sister labels EMI Classics (UK) and Virgin Classics (France).</p>
<p>Angel Records, located in New York City, is a division of Capitol Jazz and Classics, owned by UK-based EMI Recorded Music and is distributed in the United States by EMI Music Distribution.</p>
<p>The veracity of any other "fact" on this page is therefore highly suspect. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 02:52, 2005 Jan 23 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This doesn't make sense to me as an independent article. The range of estimates belongs in <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_exodus.html" title="Palestinian exodus">Palestinian exodus</a>, along with discussion at who has made estimates, the methodologies that were used, and the problems with those methodologies. Just listing the numbers used by various people and on various web sites doesn't make much sense. For one thing, there is no reason to believe that they are even independent estimates. Several of the numbers appear more than once. Is that because two sources have independently attacked the problem and arrived at the same result, which would tend to add confidence to the number? Or is it simply that someone made an estimate, and other people have used it. This wouldn't add any confidence to the estimate, any more than buying a second copy of the New York Times and finding that it has the same news as the first copy adds any confidence that the information is true. Finally, retaining an article because of valuable information on its Talk page seems strange.

However, most of the "Other" estimates are either wild guesses or partisan junk. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 16:08, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> the fact that there are several dozen estimates for the same figure show how unencyclopedic this is. What Wikipedia is not: Original research. <a href="../../../j/e/w/User%7EJewbacca_ebda.html" title="User:Jewbacca">Jewbacca</a> 18:17, Jan 26, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Do I see some personal bias showing through here? I voted delete, but not for these reasons. Numbers are often disputed, and a good encyclopedia will point out a controversy that large. A paper encyclopedia may not have room to actually list said figures, but wikipedia can. Also, this is certainly not original research, as the figures are all quoted from already existing sources and therefore represents a synthesis of prior work. The problem with this "article" is that it is not an article at all, which is why the figures belong someplace else on the site. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 19:17, Jan 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There are many many songs with the title "Crazy".

<li>Delete this article. It is a silly joke. - Preaky.</li>
<li>Well, lots of people watch <i>South Park</i>, so I think articles on individual episodes are fine. Unfortunately, as we have seen with <i>Simpsons</i> episodes, people have a tendency to create articles on jokes within the episodes and not on the episodes themselves. Perhaps the problem is that most people don't know the episode titles. It seems to me, though, that if we just left all these "joke" articles in place, eventually a dedicated editor (or several) would come through and do the necessary moving and rewriting to make them proper episode articles. So I say keep. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 13:21, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>It seems to me that if someone has a mind to make a proper article on an episode of the show, they will do so whether this article is here or not. Keeping an inappropriate article (which I believe you see this one as looking at your above statement) in the hopes that someone will move it someplace else and expand it into an appropriate article strikes me as rather silly justification for keeping an article. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 16:19, Jan 23, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. In fact, this is the only Romanization that is really popular. Most people from Hong Kong know only this Romanization and none of the academically sound systems. I guess the editor got the idea of the title from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_common_Chinese_surnames_de0f.html" title="List of common Chinese surnames">List of common Chinese surnames</a>. I also did not know how to call it when I edited the article, so I put "HK Gov't" and wrote in the its footnote: <i>This is the romanization used most often by the Hong Kong Government in transliterating names for birth certificates and identity cards. It is an unsystematic method based on the Meyer-Wempe system, with all the aspiration marks and diacritics gone.</i> There is finally an article that I can link to but it is put on VfD. Yes, we may work on the title and improve the content, but it is informative and factually correct. Certainly, besides the schemes proposed by various scholars, Wikipedia needs an article on how Cantonese is actually Romanized in Hong Kong.

<li>Move to more appropriate name, whenever that's determined and whatever it may be. Since it's not official, it appears the word "government" at least should be dropped from the title.

<li>The situation is this: the Hong Kong Government actually uses it without any "official" announcement, but the examples listed are all "official" usage.

<ul>
<li>Well, the examples are from the government, but is it only the government that uses this? If so, then at least add (unofficial) to the title of the article. The current title gives the impression that the government developed it and is trying to promote it in the same sense that LSHK is trying to promote Jyutping. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 04:20, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<p>Not only does she not have any books listed in Amazon, but the screenplay that she refers to doesn't appear on IMDB. She did do the Peace Corps work, but she stopped before her term was finished. The newspaper column was about the Peace Corps work, but it ended when she abruptly quit the Peace Corps work. When you does a little research behind this entry you can plainly see that she is simply engaging in self-promotion--against Wikipedia policy.

<p><b>Delete</b> I could only find the newspaper column, which, yes, ends abruptly with no explanation of why she's quitting Peace Corps assignment(27 months). IMO the column was unprofessional and had a condescending tone. I agree with Keetoowah, who's really done research. This is just self-promotion of a freelancer who worked behind the scenes for a congressman. Also info on Rep. Dennis Moore (D-KS) shows a Rebecca Black listed as press secretary. I say remove this entry entirely. Midwestbluesfan 02:51, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

I also don't think it matters who created the article, or what the fate of their other articles may be. So, with all that out of the way, I think we have to evaluate the notability of the subject of this article on its own merits. Unfortunately, I don't see any&#160;:-) The article doesn't tell us anything about what the person did to earn notability (it doesn't even say they're a porn actor, so I assume <a href="../../../j/n/i/User%7EJni_807c.html" title="User:Jni">jni</a> has additional knowledge). For that reason, and that reason alone, I'm voting <b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. If Isaac Fanous as an artist is not known to the majority of Egyptians, by virtue of them being Muslims, there is hardly any of the 15 million Copts around the world who does not know Isaac Fanous. He has travelled around the world to paint Icons for Coptic churches. He has a whole school of his own to teach modern Coptic iconography, and where hunderds of apprentices are currently learning the art of painting Coptic icons. I am the one who added the article and I am not of the same family of Dr Fanous (that's to answer the claim that it might be a self-promotion from my side). I vote to keep the article.

<li>I suppose my choice of the word "hunch" fed the same odd bit of human psychology that tends to treat the unmodified word "coincidence" as ruling out the sense of "mere coincidence". Thus i invited the inference that i thought what i learned by following it was some kind of compelling "confirmation" of a hunch, despite the disclaimers before and after it -- and despite introducing it with "BTW", which i think is widely accepted as warning "Don't be distracted by this minor thing i am about to mention; it is an insignificant part of the whole." In fact, i had not so much a hunch as an estimate that since there are about 40 items a day added to VfD, M's VfD edits could be close to the number of new VfDs during her month of editing; if that were true, it would make it surprising if she <i>hadn't</i> voted on that at least peripherally related VfD. Indeed she had, and it seemed to me that leaving that small additional snippet out would undercut my more extensive effort to help anyone interested find a context for this exceptional vote (the only Del, then and still now, other than that of the nominator), and this remarkable history.

<li><i>[Regarding the personal attack, to which this is subordinate by one bullet level, and which <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">i</a> removed above at 02:50, 2005 Jan 29 (UTC): The removed material, <a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegan1967_cb9a.html#Important_Notice_.28re_VfD_on_Isaac_Fanous.29" title="User talk:Megan1967">according to</a> its author, "stat[ed] a claim by another editor which I took on good faith". Without suggesting that bad faith on her part was involved, i regard it as a personal attack for the following reasons:</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li><i>The thrust of that contrib is that my citation of her remarkable record (my terms) should be discounted because</i> i <i>submitted it; that is a textbook example of</i> argumentum ad hominem <i>AKA personal attack. While the context, including any inferred intent of the author, can be important in remediation and in the justification of the policy, the essential element of a personal attack is the focus on the individual, and the main target of the policy is the attack rather than the author. So one might stop at this point.</i></li>
<li><i>While to some extent "meaning no harm" and having acted with reasonable caution is irrelevant (neither protects an attack from removal), i address that area to demonstrate the attack is not <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_minimis.html" title="De minimis">de minimis</a> in terms of the policy's intent to protect individuals. Her accepting the claim "[based] on [assuming that <a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmar_Filini_43d3.html" title="User:Omar Filini">User:Omar Filini</a> so claimed in] good faith" (if that is what her reference to "good faith" means) is not in this case compliance with "assume good intent", since concluding i had engaged in vandalism meant assuming</i> i <i>had acted with bad intent. (In fact, whether or not Omar received her assumption of good intent, i did not.) And if there were a need to decide which of two colleagues</i> more <i>deserved that assumption, she had reason</i> not <i>to choose the one who (the day before) had 23 edits since registering 17 days earlier, and had been "prominent" (as i described it) in a troubled VfD: She had reason because of the post that immediately preceded, and provoked, the one she says she relied upon in inferring that a "record of vandalism" existed; if she was reasonable enough to read it, she knew that those things had been stated about him, read by him, and not contested by him. And she had further reason: if she had an impulse to believe his vague charge, and his audacious claim to judge so quickly what vandalism means here, consider the fact that she had (if she acted reasonably) seen a link to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Marco_of_Alexandria_2c9b.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Marco of Alexandria">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Marco of Alexandria</a> in that preceding post. On that other VfD, a reasonably acting editor could easily have evaluated the behavior of each the nine other IP or newly minted editors allied to Omar, and have estimated the number of independent voters among them, as an aid to evaluating his claim to the benefit of the usual assumption. (Checking</i> exhaustively <i>there for vandalism of Omar's contribs by me would have of course demanded a little more Wiki sophistication.)</i></li>
<li><i>While falsehood is not a necessary element of a personal attack, it is IMO another aggravating circumstance that can reinforce the need for removal, in support of the protective role of the policy. The claim was "you seem to vandalizing all my edits and trying to discredit all my actions here!" i.e., (even allowing for inserting the word "be" to make it grammatical) literally not a claim of vandalism but of a subjective sense of it probably having occurred. On the other hand, the removed material was "your vandalism is on record", literally asserting not that the record includes charges of vandalism but that vandalism by me existed, and is "on record", and the circumstances indicate in two ways that the author</i> intended <i>to assert that substance:</i>
<ol>
<li><i>the statement is irrelevant to its context unless (in addition to ignoring the</i> ad hom <i>fallacy) the claims are at least credible</i></li>
<li><i>presumably understanding that (while avoiding the literal statement can help excuse the intimations to the same effect) authors are responsible for their literal statements unless the intimations are</i> clearly <i>to the contrary, she chose "your vandalism is on record" where either the free inference "a vandalism charge against you is on record" or the literally true "a suggestion of vandalism by you is on record" was an easy substitution.</i></li>

<li>Jerzy Do you have a specific problem with me???? you seem to vandalizing all my edits and trying to discredit all my actions here! and no I am not Marco of Alexandria, and by the way since you brought it up. Marco of Alexandria is more notable than Isaac Fanous and it is not the question of being a Muslim or Christian because they are both Christians as far as I know; but I don't think Marco was Coptic, maybe Catholic or Protestant otherwise he will be called Morcos and not Marco. <a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmar_Filini_43d3.html" title="User:Omar Filini">Omar Filini</a> 14:25, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC) The reason I was Supporting Marco is because I am very much into the art scene here in Egypt and I know much about it; I did add a few names to the List of Egyptian Painters page and plan to write articles about a few. And that is why I nominated this article for deletion because I know that this person is not nearly as notable as anyone on the list; regardless of his position in the coptic church; as an Artist he is not notable at all. <i>[The text from the red link to a non-existent article sharing my username, to here, is all part of the same edit at 14:25, 2005 Jan 24 by Omar.]</i></li>

<li>Yes. It is not the purpose of an online encyclopedia editor to "draw lines", ie make sweeping personal assumptions about what may be considered "relevant"; we should not be so presumptuous as to assume that things that aren't relevant to <i>us</i> aren't relevant to <i>anyone</i>. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 09:03, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Any standard applied to an article is going to be subjective, that is why we have a voting process based on community consensus, to see whose subjective view wins out. There would be little point to the VfD process if the assumption was that we keep everything that is factual or verifiable. There would also be no need to qualify vanity articles or what wikipedia is not. I do not object at all to your keep vote, which is your right as an editor of wikipedia, but to the fiction you attempt to maintain that relevance and subjectivity do not play a part in project decisions. I nominated this for encyclopedic reasons, however, and not for reasons of relevance to me.

<ul>
<li>That is precisely my point. Until I stumbled across it on Wikipedia I was not even aware of this author or his work. Now that I am I should reasonably expect to find that Wikipedia is a comprehensive source on his entire oeuvre, at a high level of granularity. In my opinion the <i>only</i> articles that are valid targets for deletion are (1) original research, (2) vanity, (3) complete nonsense and (4) lists of URLs. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 22:37, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> as it is not significant separate from the book. Fictional locations have to be exceptionally notable to be worth having separate articles. The level of relevance is easily determined by how much information is possible - if a location only has a brief mention, then you can't add more information because it simply does not exist. As for the precedent - if a precedent is silly, throw it out. If Wikipedia uses a rule that fictional locations merely have to be mentioned once in passing to get an article, but scientists need to win the Nobel Prize, Wikipedia is going to be laughed at as a serious source. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 13:46, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Look, I do not mind if you want to keep the article, that's fine, but he is not that important. Rayner, Duke, Mengst, the Overmind, Tassadar, Kerrigan, etc. are important characters that are central to the story. Daggoth and his fellow cerberates don't really do that much and the story would be little changed if they had no role at all.

<li>No, you're just saying that because they happen to have bigger speaking roles. Daggoth controls an entire <i>brood</i>. Jimmy started by controlling a small little ragtag team in the badlands of Mar Sara. Alright, maybe the story revolves more around them, but Daggoth is still important as he headed up some major battles in the game. Also, he controlled Torresque, if I recall correctly.--Seth Goldin 02:41, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: Excellent question! I love it when people take responsibility for their nominations! Barnstar stuff. Don't worry, the whole idea of a Wiki is that we each contribute as we are able.
