<li><b>Keep</b>. There are plenty of company stubs that are short as this one is. Without looking deeply into the site, it seems that the company has been around for 5 years or more and has a reasonably well developed web presence that suits a company that's not fly-by-night ... but that could be an illusion, of course. I've left the 'delete' tag on, of course, but done a categorization of the article and added a stub-tag. <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> 02:06, 2005 Feb 12 (UTC)</li>

The page is now radically different and anonymous users have been removing the VfD without comment. No references are included in the article and I've been unable to find information on the Chen Fang described in the article. I will keep the article listed here as I believe the author is acting in bad faith by removing VfD notices (and later by vandalizing my user page and that of <a href="../../../h/a/d/User%7EHadal_a4d0.html" title="User:Hadal">User:Hadal</a>).

<li>I can't agree with speedying for vanity and non-notability because articles, especially substubs like this one, that appear vanity often enough turn out to be about subjects of least debatable notability, and are often the product of redlinks. Megginson was the original lead developer and maintainer of <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_API_for_XML_6b72.html" title="Simple API for XML">Simple API for XML</a>, apparently a major <a href="../../../x/m/l/XML_3501.html" title="XML">XML</a> standard <a href="../../../o/27/r/O%27Reilly_Media_64bd.html" title="O'Reilly Media">O'Reilly Media</a> and others put out books on. I'd need positive evidence that he led the community that developed this for a very short time and contributed very little to it before not voting <b>keep</b>, and at least allow for organic expansion. Add that <a href="http://www.megginson.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.megginson.com/" rel="nofollow">megginson.com</a> shows he's written two books, chaired one working group and served on another for the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wide_Web_Consortium_532b.html" title="World Wide Web Consortium">World Wide Web Consortium</a>, recieved an award for Outstanding Individual Contribution to the Java Community from JavaPro magazine and <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Microsystems_c3ed.html" title="Sun Microsystems">Sun</a>, who should know.

<li>It's worth noting that we <i>already</i> allowed for organic expansion, and nothing happened (apart from some minor wikification and categorization) in <i>six months</i>. It took the threat of deletion for something to actually happen to this article. Have you considered patrolling <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_articles_of_dubious_importance_658b.html" title="Category:Wikipedia articles of dubious importance">Category:Wikipedia articles of dubious importance</a>? That would certainly help, considering that (as was the case here) people <i>do</i> put tags such as {{cleanup-importance}} on such articles and wait for a while to see whether improvement happens, and if nothing happens in a reasonable period nominate them for deletion. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:28, 2005 Feb 11 (UTC)</li>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_MGPL_4f46.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/MGPL">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">GNAT Licence</span></h4>
<p>All Ada programmers know the Licence under the name of "Modified GPL" and the shortcut "MGPL". This is because - just like the Linux kernel - GNAT has a build in licence check via the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.3/gnat_rm/Pragma-License.html#Pragma-License" class="external text" title="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.3/gnat_rm/Pragma-License.html#Pragma-License" rel="nofollow">pragma License</a> command and <code>pragma License (Modified_GPL);</code> is used activate the licence check.</p>
<p>So while your naming is prehaps politicly correct - it's not what the user will type into the search box.</p>
<p>Also, not all of Ada is Modified GPL - i.E. packages derived from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8652" class="extiw" title="w:ISO_8652">ISO 8652</a> are "unrestriced".</p>
<p>The reason for the MGPL and <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.3/gnat_rm/Pragma-License.html#Pragma-License" class="external text" title="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.3/gnat_rm/Pragma-License.html#Pragma-License" rel="nofollow">pragma License</a> is clear: GNAT is closed source projects as well. And we are quite happy with that - those closed source users pay quite a lot of money which then goes into the further development of GNAT.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This was originally proposed as a speedy delete, but didn't really meet the criteria; it was not patent nonsense and context was provided (the movie Full Metal Jacket was mentioned) and notability asserted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Me_So_Horny&amp;oldid=10059946" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Me_So_Horny&amp;oldid=10059946" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. In cases like this I sometimes remove the speedy notice and replace it with a VfD; however, in this case Google showed a fairly impressive number of hits which left me unconvinced that a VfD would succeed. Therefore I merely cleaned it up and added more context <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Me_So_Horny&amp;oldid=10070511" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Me_So_Horny&amp;oldid=10070511" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> and notified the speedy proposer that she could submit it for VfD, which she has now done. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 05:57, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>There are 60,000 hits for "me so horny", and if you filter out all pages that mention "2 Live Crew" or "Full Metal Jacket" you still get 9000 hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+%22Me+so+horny%22+-2+-Live+-Crew+-Full+-Metal+-Jacket&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+%22Me+so+horny%22+-2+-Live+-Crew+-Full+-Metal+-Jacket&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">(Google search)</a>. Some of these are merely phrases from sentences like "it made me so horny"; however if do the equivalent search for "me love you long time" again filtering out pages that mention "2 Live Crew" or "Full Metal Jacket" you still get 4000 hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+%22Me+love+you+long+time%22+-2+-Live+-Crew+-Full+-Metal+-Jacket&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+%22Me+love+you+long+time%22+-2+-Live+-Crew+-Full+-Metal+-Jacket&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">(Google search)</a>. So it seems the phrase did indeed enter the vernacular and is sufficiently notable (and the fact that episodes of South Park and Family Guy cited the phrase indicates that viewers of such popular culture are familiar with it). Other popular phrases that have gained sufficient notability are present in Wikipedia, for instance <a href="../../../l/e/t/Let%27s_roll.html" title="Let's roll">Let's roll</a>, which has its own page rather than a redirect to <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>. Wikipedia also has articles on silly phrases like <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base are belong to us">All your base are belong to us</a> and <a href="../../../e/v/e/Every_time_you_masturbate..._God_kills_a_kitten_2718.html" title="Every time you masturbate...

God kills a kitten</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacked_By_Chinese%21_233a.html" title="Hacked By Chinese!">Hacked By Chinese!</a> that attained notability. Finally, the phrase "me love you long time" was apparently widely used in massage parlors in Vietnam during the Vietnam War <a href="http://www.alternatevoice.com/blog_archives/000064.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alternatevoice.com/blog_archives/000064.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and so is not merely some scriptwriter's invention.

<li>This is a tricky case. Certainly the term "me so horny" has become a well recongized meme, but I'm not sure that automatically makes it a worthy article in an encyclopedia. Then again, there is tons of complete crap that has been made into articles. Perhaps the best thing to do is make it into an article about the song (retitled as "Me So Horny"), and within that article mentioning <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> and the phrase's popularity elsewhere. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 06:53, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

So it wasn't red, but it went nowhere, and there wasn't nearly enough on Socrates to say exactly what <i>Elenchos</i> referred to.

<li>One cannot simultaneously "redirect" <i>and</i> "delete", people. It's one or the other.

Article does not establish notability (not even to the extent of David J. Parker), however a quick Google Web search indicates that there is plenty of potential (Dialectizer, "ultra-condensed books", the stupidity and barratry of of Bank of America, Samuel Stoddard the 18th century theologian, and so forth). <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:07, 2005 Feb 11 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(Note: I am the same person as 193.167.132.66 above.) OK, I stand corrected, I meant "delete <i>and then</i> redirect". This article has way too little content to warrant a separate article. The RinkWorks main article already mentions its webmaster is Samuel Stoddard, so what's the point in a separate article that only says that and nothing else? As for the RinkWorks features, they should be included in the RinkWorks main page or in articles of their own. As for Samuel Stoddard the 18th century theologian, well it's nice that there was such a person, but until someone actually <b>writes</b> something about him, there's no point in keeping a dummy article. Therefore, I say that either <b>write</b> something here (about either "our" Stoddard or the 18th century guy), or delete this article. 81.17.198.7 17:24, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, agree with UncleG. There is plenty of potential here. Obviously it has to expand beyond the current one line status. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 22:57, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Even though Uncle G has found a Samuel Stoddard or two who might be notable, they are not this Samuel Stoddard. This Samuel Stoddard's only claim to notability is that he is the webmaster of an Alexa rank 28,330 website. I am the webmaster of a Top 2000 website, according to Alexa, and believe me I am not notable enough to merit a Wikipedia article. Neither is Samuel Stoddard, which doesn't mean he isn't a great guy, like all webmasters. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:58, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I consider Samuel Stoddard's website RinkWorks quite notable. Many other websites mention or link to its humour features. However, having a separate article <b>only</b> to mention that Samuel Stoddard is the webmaster - especially when it's <b>already</b> mentioned in the RinkWorks article - is needless. Articles with next-to-none content shouldn't be kept just because someone might write something there in the future. <b>When</b> they actually write something, they can recreate the article. 85.76.152.179 09:47, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Even if the website is notable (a point not yet validated), that does not mean that the webmaster of the site is automatically notable. No evidence has yet been presented that he meets the recommended <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. To <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a>'s point, if some future editor has something encyclopedic to say about one of the other Samuel Stoddards, he/she can create the article more easily from a redlink. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:43, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete: no useful content. No need to disambiguate articles which don't yet exist. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E. Heresiarch">Wile E. Heresiarch</a> 07:48, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, there <i>is</i> a need to disambiguate, even without the now <b>expanded article</b>. If deleted and re-created as a redirect, we'd still have a choice of whether to redirect to <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon_Stoddard_3d88.html" title="Solomon Stoddard">Solomon Stoddard</a>, who appears to have been known as "Samuel", or to <a href="../../../r/i/n/RinkWorks_38e7.html" title="RinkWorks">RinkWorks</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:48, 2005 Feb 13 (UTC)</li>
<li>I see the article has been expanded, which is a Good Thing, but still all the material is about Stoddard's website RinkWorks, not Stoddard himself. I have heard from Stoddard himself that there is more to his life than just RinkWorks! 85.76.152.179 18:20, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then, as someone who clearly knows him, you should be expanding this article instead of decrying it and asking other people to write about what you know for you, because otherwise (and despite the fact that there's a strong argument for <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Stoddard_de66.html" title="Samuel Stoddard">Samuel Stoddard</a> to be a redirect to <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon_Stoddard_3d88.html" title="Solomon Stoddard">Solomon Stoddard</a>) it's likely that this article is going to end up being a redirect to <a href="../../../r/i/n/RinkWorks_38e7.html" title="RinkWorks">RinkWorks</a>, <i>giving pretty much exactly that impression</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 06:07, 2005 Feb 14 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(Note: I am the same person as 85.76.152.179. I am on a different computer.) First of all, I am only an active participant on RinkWorks. I am not Stoddard's personal friend. We have never met, but we've talked via e-mail. Thus I don't know very much about his personal life, other than the fact that he's married. Second of all, I never said I had anything against merging the article with RinkWorks. Go ahead if you want. 193.167.132.66 08:06, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Someone already did link them, actually, before I removed the links. One thing I think about, though, is the question of whether deleting such an article stunts Wikipedia's natural growth. If different people are indicating an interest in starting these articles, is that in itself a <i>de facto</i> indicator of notability? I don't know. I think that for exceptionally famous people, arguably including Al Gore, close relatives within one generation are probably notable enough by association to warrant inclusion. But within two generations? I don't know.

But when what is being merged is one sentence, keeping the history isn't much of an issue. In the process of working it into the other article, the sentence probably gets transformed a bit, anyway.

<li>I am quite aware that the blanket octopus really exists and is not a made-up animal. My previous comment was about the style, which as you say, is jokey high-school style.

<li>We aren't voting on "the militia phenomenon", whatever that may be (given that for pretty much as long as the United States has existed groups like this have been springing up calling themselves "armies", "militia", and whatnot, and then disappearing again without making much of a mark upon anything). We are voting on the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_Militia_Corps_d84c.html" title="Indiana Militia Corps">Indiana Militia Corps</a>. And the question is whether it is encyclopaedia-worthy. Anyone can start a "militia". You could start the Rhode Island Superpower Secessionist Army tomorrow, if you wanted. But anyone can start a band in their garage, too. The question is whether this is a serious militia, or just an excuse for a handful of gun enthusiasts on weekends to prat around in military surplus battle fatigues and get drunk. In other words: Have they passed the "<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">released an album</a>" test? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:39, 2005 Feb 11 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The IMC is one element of the militia phenomenon. Their wesbite is fairly extensive and sophisticated, although, admittedly, it could be the work of one person. But, on the other hand, what evidence do we have that they <b>are</b> just five guys and a dog as asked below? (I like dogs.) They could be a sizable group that doesn't disclose their numbers because they are, as one would suspect, a bunch of paranoid freaks. But if the ADL is monitoring them, they are probably a <i>notable</i> bunch of paranoid freaks. (Some of my best friends are... never mind.) I don't think that it is the role of an encyclopaedia to exclude information for fear of publicizing a distasteful group. If someone wants to find a militia in Indiana, they'll find the IMC website pretty darn quickly without Wikipedia's help. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevintoronto_ec05.html" title="User:Kevintoronto">Kevintoronto</a> 21:21, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If the ADL is monitoring them, it's not just three guys in a toolshed whining about the government.

<ul>
<li>Unless the ADL "monitoring" is something above filing news clippings and press releases ("Red Dog 1, this is Red Dog 3. I have him on visual, it looks like he's heading for his mailbox."), it says nothing about how seriously the ADL takes this particular group. They're referenced by name <i>once</i> on the ADL website, in an article about the (mostly failed) attempts by these various "militia groups" to band together. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 03:23, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The rewrite is a distinct improvement, but VfD votes are not primarily about the content; they are supposed to be about whether the topic or subject is encyclopedic. A bad article on a valid topic can be cleaned up. A bad article on an invalid topic can be cleaned up by a decent editor, too, and that might be what Samaritan has done here. The question is whether this group is notable. At this point, even with the rewrite, there is no evidence that the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_Militia_Corps_d84c.html" title="Indiana Militia Corps">Indiana Militia Corps</a> is more than 5 lunatics and a dog out in the woods somewhere in Indiana on summer weekends. The group is only a few years old, for one thing. I want to see more evidence that this is more than a web site and a few demented people. While our norms compel us to have articles about the significant groups, as loathsome as they might be, we shouldn't be in any big rush to give publicity to every little self-important group. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 21:05, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The ADL uses them as the first example of a phenomenon, that's like a music journalist using a band as the first example of pokemetal or something, it shows they are at least notable enough to get some attention from people in the business. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:53, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). Not quite a two thirds majority, and I'm also concerned with a massive GNAA influx of voters early on in the debate. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:09, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I won't write this under every time it occurs, but this is totally immaterial. We comment on the contribution, not the contributor. If someone wants to aid Wikipedia by improving the ratio af signal to noise, I don't care if they eat babies for breakfast. They could go about it with a bit more subtlety, and the quality of the nominations would be improved by linking to the searches (and perhaps an Alexa ranking per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or the actual blogs), but ad hominum attacks are not on. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 01:30, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>The notes are intended to inform the admin who ends up closing the AfD, so that they can consider GNAA's coordinated effort to delete blog-related articles. They aren't personal attacks.

<li><b>Disagree with “delete” arguments.</b> I don’t blog, and I don’t use Windows, but I disagree that this software is useless, and I see nothing here that’s blatantly subjective, so I don’t think it constitutes “advertising” any more than does, say, “<a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Windows_48e2.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>.” The only thing that’s missing here is a comparison (or link to a comparison) to like software. For instance, Wikipedia is probably the only hope for a query like “show me a list of blog client software that implements the <a href="../../../m/e/t/MetaWeblog_3681.html" title="MetaWeblog">MetaWeblog</a> protocol.”<br />
To say this is an “advertisement” (in the sense of “marketing”) is tantamount to saying that this was contributed by a W.bloggar insider, is it not? (Don’t confuse “advertising” with an enthusiastic user’s testimonial.) Frankly I consider that a reckless assertion, not (evidently) <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">based on fact</a>.<br />
I don’t have any opinion on W.bloggar’s notability though. —<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFleminra_45b2.html" title="User:Fleminra">Fleminra</a> 19:51, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It does, doesn't it? Braino, but not actually relevant to whether the page should exist. I won't really mind if it does get deleted; it's just something several people have mentioned to me recently, and seemed to be something someone might look up. <b>Abstain</b> - I made it, but I don't care if you don't think it should be there. PS. I've never heard of Breakup Day; as a common English phrase it's impossible to Google-test, but the first google hit on "Breakup Day" is unrelated, and the second has it on a different date and appears to be an independent invention.

<li>Ah, I see - you're assuming there that I heard about it from a Richard Herring show (I don't think I've ever seen one). I heard about it from people who intend to celebrate it, and only found out it was a Richard Herring reference from <a href="http://forums.kingdomofloathing.com/viewtopic.php?t=20031" class="external text" title="http://forums.kingdomofloathing.com/viewtopic.php?t=20031" rel="nofollow">another page</a> that referenced it. I accept that they may be the only ones&#160;:-) Though, by analogy, how many people actually 'celebrate' Breakup Day (particularly as a holiday, which the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holiday.html" title="Holiday">Holiday</a> page seems to think it is)? '"St Skeletor's Day" February 15' gets 515 hits, and "St Skeletor's Day" isn't the sort of phrase which would appear by accident. '"Breakup day" February 13' gets 122, several of which STILL aren't about the Breakup Day that gets a Wikipedia article.... This isn't relevant to whether this is notable, I'm just taken aback by the non-notability of the thing that was proposed as notable in comparison to it&#160;:-) <a href="../../../t/s/p/User%7ETSP_05ce.html" title="User:TSP">TSP</a> 21:00, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please note that Wikipedia official policy is <b><a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">No Personal Attacks</a></b>. This policy is taken very seriously, not because we all want to be super–politically correct or hypocritically polite, but because Wikipedia can only function by consensus. Insults only inflame the emotions of the other party and make them more stubborn and less likely to want to compromise with you. So banning personal attacks has nothing to do with enforced "morality", it's purely a practical measure to dampen edit wars and other conflicts before they escalate. For the above reasons, in certain cases users with a pattern of repeated personal attacks have even been blocked, just for "mere words". -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 05:41, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It was tagged for automatic speedy deletion as a re-creation of a VfD'd article, but the author and other advocates cite changed circumstances (the film has now been released). Enough time has passed to make it appropriate to nominate for a second VfD as an alternative to automatic delete-again. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 19:47, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

It would have been better to wait for at least an IMDB listing to establish notability... Wikipedia should not be used as part of a marketing campaign, if this was the intention of the possibly premature re-creation of this article.

<li>You are out of line even suggesting that he may be trying to intimidate people. How dare you! Why don't you read up on the user name policy, if you can, because where I come from BM means <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowel_movement.html" title="Bowel movement">bowel movement</a>.

You people who are so hateful and have some sort of warped agenda in seeing these films, that an awful lot of people love to watch, erased, you are creating precidents for the future so some of your articles might one day be in jeapardy because of things you are saying now.

<li>Nearly all of the actors survived VfD, but only because there were only a half-dozen or so votes each time, and the page creators voted to keep, so no consensus was reached. None of them were decided "Keep", just "No consensus".

<li>The point is, this film was so recently released (a week or two ago) that it doesn't even have an IMDB entry.

<li>You are right, YOU are jumping the gun in wanting to erase the film. Just because it hasn't been listed YET on IMDB it should be deleted? Is that how this Wikipedia works if it's not on IMDB erase it? Of course, then when movies and people, that deltionists want to get rid of, are listed on IMDB suddenly we hear that IMDB will list anything and anyone and it doesn't mean anything. Basically, if a few crack pots take a dislike to something they can keep demanding it be deleted regardless of how many Google hits or listings. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlank_08b6.html" title="User:Plank">Plank</a></li>

<p>This isn't the article about "<a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyber-terrorism.html" title="Cyber-terrorism">cyber-terrorism</a>". All it does is acknowledge that even though "<a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>" refers specifically to the use of violence, that the intended goal behind the violence can be to send a message. Leaping abruptly from there to the assumption that sending a message can therefore be terrorism <i>regardless</i> of whether any act or threat of violence is involved, the article then asserts "By inference", people "could be accused of Internet terrorism" if they are using the Internet to disseminate any information that damages the reputation or public standing of a corporation or a political or religious figure. By this ludicrously broad definition, Wikipedia's a hub of <b>"Internet terrorism"</b>: have you included any information, true or false, in any article, which makes a public figure look bad? Congratulations, you're an "Internet terrorist". It's <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Custodial_Rape_%28non-sexual%29_8c01.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Custodial Rape (non-sexual)">another attempt</a> to take an emotionally loaded word and stretch the definition until it screams, for the purposes of getting all that emotional loading into a neologism to throw at enemies. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:12, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's just somebody's college dissertation, or something. The second source uses the phrase in "quotes" throughout, suggesting that it's not notable in itself.

<li>" ...people or groups that use the Internet for the systematic spreading of information aimed at harassing, damaging or destroying the business of corporations or the public standing of political and religious figures, could be accused of Internet terrorism."

<p>This is almost certainly a vanity page. 'The Guild Of The Dark' and 'Group 9' aren't well-known, and certainly aren't "underground legends" in the hacker community. Also, no-one calls themselves 'digital shinobi' except people who've been reading too much cyberpunk. <a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwiin_e2f4.html" title="User:Twiin">Twiin</a> 23:46, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not big on the title word 'clans'. The article Hacker group redirects to List of hacker and cracker groups. Neither of the two groups described in <i>clans</i> made the list at <i>list</i> (but at least there aren't separate articles on them). If kept then this article needs cleanup.
