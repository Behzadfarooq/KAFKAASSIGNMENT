<p><i>Completing abandoned nomination by <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">User:Alex Bakharev</a>.</i> This appears to be a response to Musical Theatre Guild, which is itself in need of a makeover. I have no idea whether the group's notable or not, but either way, WP isn't the place for two people to give dueling accounts of an organization.

<li><b>Merge</b> or delete per nom; both articles need cleanup. This company is well-known in the LA theatre community, with multiple nominations and some wins in local theatre awards (e.g. <a href="http://www.ladramacriticscircle.com/awards_05.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ladramacriticscircle.com/awards_05.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which seems to establish notability. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyguy649_8ae4.html" title="User:Flyguy649">Flyguy649</a> <small><a href="../../../f/l/y/User_talk%7EFlyguy649_8c24.html" title="User talk:Flyguy649">(talk</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Flyguy649_0877.html" title="Special:Contributions/Flyguy649">works)</a></small> 04:31, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I wrote BOTH articles. The facts in them are true and I was a member of the board and witnessed all accounts. I have documentation and correspondences to prove all points mentioned. It was a member of the current theater company that came along and changed the original, deleting information on the demise of the original founders, which was the intent of the original article. If there was a problem with the title not reflecting that, I have no problem with the change of title. That's why I wrote the second article and added in "The Founders Story." This theater company is the only one of it's kind to our knowledge (being a membership musical company that produces staged readings) and had several West Coast Premiere's including Sondheim's PASSION. I have been contacted by many people thanking me for writing the original article as it was never publicized as to why the original founders were no longer a part of the company and the current company has withheld information from the public and in fact doesn't tell it's current membership about the original founders at all. That's why they chose to delete the information from the original article, so people couldn't find out that they kicked the founders out of their own company with no foundation and even prevented them from attending the meeting in which they were removed (which is against Robert's Rules of Order.) I would rather have the original article The Musical Theatre Guild removed and my new one The Founders Story left in. If the current theater company wants to write their own article leaving out truths, they can surely do so.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/t/g/User%7EMtguild_acc2.html" title="User:Mtguild">Mtguild</a> (<a href="../../../m/t/g/User_talk%7EMtguild_bcbc.html" title="User talk:Mtguild">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mtguild_7aee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mtguild">contribs</a>) 23:31, February 24, 2007.</small></p>

<p><b>Merge</b> This entry has given me some questions. Its a nice article in itself, and I did check the website, but is this really a <b>notable guild</b>. The article title <i>Musical Theatre Guild - the Founders Story</i> sounds like a book. I live in UK so this article may be something that relates purely to Los Angeles but really if this article is agreed as being <b>noteworthy</b> then it should be in an Musical Theatre Guild article with The Founders Story as a headline on the page. If founders are then coming onto Wikipedia to vandalise articles that contain the truth (but its not pleasant for those it talks about) then it should be taken up via the appropriate channels. --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincessBrat_4583.html" title="User:PrincessBrat">PrincessBrat</a> 16:03, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here's what happened. <a href="../../../m/t/g/User%7EMtguild_acc2.html" title="User:Mtguild">User:Mtguild</a> wrote the article Musical Theatre Guild. Another editor removed some material from that article which Mtguild thought was important, and rather than re-insert it, he wrote this response article (It appears that Mtguild is one of the "Founders" in question. The deleted information concerned how the two men who formed the group either left or were forced out of it. Take a look at <a href="../../../d/j/r/User_talk%7EDjrobgordon_b90e.html#re:_Musical_Theatre_Guild" title="User talk:Djrobgordon">this discussion</a> on my talk page, if you want the justification in his words. I urged him on his own talk page to edit the original article, if it omitted important information. The problem with a merge here is that I can't find any sources on the internet, even unusable ones, that verify Mtguild's account of how the group's founders left. Policy states that when it comes to controversial information, the burden of proof lies with the editor arguing to keep it. Accordingly, I can't see adding his account to Musical Theatre Guild. And obviously, an article can't exist when its author has admitted its only purpose is to provide a second point of view of a topic already covered in its own article.--<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">Djrobgordon</a> 16:20, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is quite a hornets nest isnt it. Whatever is decided via AfD will cause problems for someone associated with this guild. After reading the discussion you pointed me at - I come to the conclusion that an edit war may start on this article. This guild does not seem very famous outside LA so really we have to question is either article worthy of a place on wikipedia. Im coming to the conclusion that it is not and this might be better suited on a personal website which would be harder to be vandalised. --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincessBrat_4583.html" title="User:PrincessBrat">PrincessBrat</a> 16:51, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
