<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable enough.

<dl>
<dd>You clearly have some deep connection with ISRO if you speak of it by name and actually know what it is, Lambiam. While it is linked from Mr. Laciner's page, it goes to the Indian Space Research Organization. If you were a normal wikipedian (and not Mr. Laciner himself or an associate?) you would likely be as in the dark as the rest of us about it, not use being the director of it as a good reason for his bio to remain on wikipedia. On top of that, you claim he has books published. Well I'm sure SOMETHING (his organizations?) published the books listed on his page, but it was not by any real publishing company. I looked up the name Laciner on amazon, which has practically anything published ever, and there were no results. Thus, his "books published" were probably done by his own organization and that certainly does not warrant him a place on wikipedia. Heck, my uncle has published a few things that you can actually buy on amazon but I'd never think of adding him to wikipedia for that reason. Finally, yes he was selected "Young Global Leader", but the way you state it is misleading. He was A young global leader, not THE young global leader of 2006. If you check the list he was one of about a hundred or so. Unless each of them deserve a complete wikipedia page for that reason, merely participating in a conference, then that can't be used as a reason either. I seem to have exhausted reasons Laciner should have a wikipedia page, do you have any others? Vartan84</dd>

<dd>Argue the merits and leave the shrill, bloviating incivility and unwarranted sockpuppet accusations behind; they do nothing but hurt your argument. Yeah I suppose it's possible that Lambien made 3,000 edits to disguise his future plan to post a vanity article and make it look like he was a new user with 135 edits. Actually the plan has worked, here I am defending Lambien so I must be another Sedat Laciner sockpuppet.

Laciner is one of the famous Turkish academicians. Vartan84 is an Armenian user, and he is not happy with Prof. Laciner's studies on Armenian issue. That's why Vartan 84 nominates one of the most famous Turkish researchers for deletion. I do not know who created the page, yet many others contributed the page and I am sure many more will do. If Wiki deletes this page there are more than 100.000 pages in the Google and Vartan and his radical friends cannot delete all of them. Please be constructive instead of discriminative.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. The article is very problematic, as it is created by the subject, who really is not broadly notable. At the same time there are no entries of really notable Turkish scholars such as Kemal Kirişçi, Şerif Mardin, Murat Belge or Hüseyn Bağcı. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 09:07, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that it is a shame that these don't have an article. Only Murat Belge has an article on the Turkish Wikipedia. Unless the argument is that the names mentioned are at the border of notability so that anything less must drop off, I don't see how this is relevant to the decision we're trying to reach here. I don't think of the subject of the article as being particularly notable for his scholarship in the academic sense, but more so as an intellectual who through various activities has an input in the policy debate on a variety of issues. While not "broadly notable", there are many less notable subjects who have an entry, and I'm not referring to poor Mr. Mike Bach, but for instance all-around nice guy <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Hetherington_4c8d.html" title="Marc Hetherington">Marc Hetherington</a>, or Chris Weinkopf, or <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Bauer_8f2b.html" title="Bill Bauer">Bill Bauer</a>, or any of zillions more. I personally don't see the point of deleting those (I guess I must be something of an <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Inclusionism" class="extiw" title="meta:Inclusionism">inclusionist</a> then), as long as the information is verifiable and can be presented from a neutral point of view.

<dd>As I said, I don't particularly want them deleted.

<li><b>Delete</b> I don’t see how Laciner is a leading well-known scholar in his field. There is quite an easy way to know if someone is indeed notable in his field, Laciner is in political science, right? Well, he has written books right? Then we know of the notability of a writter on the notability of his publications. If he is notable enough and that his works are notable enough, there should be at least one notable critic of his works published at least in one notable scholarly journal. I have checked in the databases there is none, neither was his works ever cited in a reputable journal. If we were to start creating articles about individuals leading or not, from who knows what think tank organization we could add thousands of people that have no place. Anyone here can visit university factulties and pick professeurs who follows master or doctorate degree students, what is the probability that they are published scholars and that their works are cited or criticised in a reputable journal? The probability is pretty high, and I personally known professors who are really, really reputable compared to this man, but still, I’d qualify not enough for an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 06:03, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Doesn't make sense, I don't know that person, but suppose that that individual should not be on Wikipedia, how does this justify a keep? For all I know, I can randomnly choose anyone and give credence to his notability. Lets take David Davidian, he has a registered organization collecting databases, for all I know, publish materials, and of course he is the president of his own organization. Lets just add him. Lets also add Laciner protege, Holdwater, because his site and his pseudonym gives various hits. I think that he hasn't published anything relevent in any reputable journal other than his, and that his works have never ever been criticised positivaly or negatively in any reputable journal or ever been cited in any reputable journal would downplay the claim of notability. If him, his journal or what have you are notable, why then, no one cite them, why then no one cite the materials then? Had he not added his own page, would there have been anyone here that would have thought of ever creating the pages he has created? I am sure there are various Turkish Journals covering science matter etc., which are probably much more cited. Kamuran Gurun the Turkish retired Diplomat was much more notable, his work denying the Armenian genocide had been critised by reputable journals, is there anyone here that though of even creating a page about him? Laciner not only has used Wikipedia to boost his credibility, but he has used also google searchengines to do so, with various pseudo think-thanks linking to eachothers and then ending on his persona, and now he is here in Wikipedia desperatly trying to creat the illusion that he has some notability. What notability? There are hundreds of think-thank organizations, I can creat one myself, I can creat my journal, register it and publish works from my own publishers. would that make me worthy of being included in Wikipedia? <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:13, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK then, lets add the hundreds or thousands of think thank organisations in Wikipedia and a page for their presidents. It's plain ridiculous. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:50, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Doesn't seem you understand what is an encyclopedia. Let me tell you another ridiculous thing. If you had really understood what is the subject of this nomination, you would not have requested moving the article to itself.&#160;:) Anyway, everyone has the right to have his/her opinion. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 19:05, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An encyclopedia is a collection of all human knowlege, not knowlege you aprove. I can read the reasons of the nom et all, is there anything I am not told? --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 10:48, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh come on! So you are saying wikipedia is a place for ALL human knowledge? Seeing as some humans have knowledge of me, for that reason alone do I merit my own wikipage just like Sedat? Your arguement of all human knowledge could be applied to absolutely everything nominated for deletion. If we are going to be that inclusive why need to delete anything at all? This of course would result in absolute everyone from the craziest nutjob to the obscurest nobody to have their own page, but I guess as long as it is within the realm of all human knowledge it's fine...

<dd>Which suggests autopbiographies are <i>strongly</i> discouraged, not banned.
