<p>This is a classic example of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. The subject is unlimited, or at any rate any attempt to produce something approaching a comprehensive list would involve terabytes of information. It has little content beyond links to other articles, and would therefore better serve as a category, if indeed it is needed in the first place. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 13:18, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Some more references would be an improvement, but not having these is not a reason to delete. Well, let's say, the attempt to delete is "indiscriminate". I don't see why <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a> would exclude thematic lists like this one.

<li>No - it's not to do with fictionality. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_legendary_kings_of_Britain_efbf.html" title="List of legendary kings of Britain">list of legendary kings of Britain</a> is a finite category - there are only a certain number of them, and it makes sense to collect the information together in one easily used list. The List of fictional rulers, by contrast, could include any king, queen, sultan, emperor, dictator, chieftain, sheik, khan, etc, to have appeared in any work of fiction, in any language, ever. This makes it an infinite list, in other words an <i>indiscriminate</i> collection of information (since the job is simply too big to be completed or worked on in any kind of systematic way). Better by far to create a category to cover this, which all of these entries could be included within. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 14:36, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, we already have categories for "Fictional monarchs", "Fictional kings", Fictional queens", etc. Far better to expand and standardise these than to try to mainatin an unmaintainable list. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 14:39, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can only conclude you start to invent indiscriminate rules supporting your AfD nomination. Quite disgusting. Where is that so-called rule that finiteness vs. infiniteness has anything to do with whether a list can be made in wikipedia? You just invented it on the spot. Wikipedia deals with a lot of "infinite" lists (if we take infinite according to your definition); But the list at hand isn't even infinite (you just constructed an akward definition of "infinite" in order to make this list seem "infinite". Disgusting).</li>
<li>Also, if there's a good running set of categories, there's no argument that for that reason a list on the same topic should be excluded. Where did you get that? Obviously not in wikipedia's current policies and guidelines, see for instance <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes_edc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes">Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes</a>: "Increasingly, multiple entries to fields of knowledge are provided [...]" (which is followed by an example of a set of articles that are connected as well by <i>lists</i> as by <i>categories</i> as by <i>series boxes</i>).</li>
<li>Note that, for instance, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Ubu_910e.html" title="King Ubu">King Ubu</a> isn't listed in any of the "fictional rulers" categories (nor should he necessarily be, the article is on the <i>play</i> with the same name, not the fictional ruler): much better to keep this fictional monarch in the list of fictional rulers.</li>
<li>Note also that <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a> *discourages* to make separate articles on secondary fictional characters. In many fictional universes, for instance, the <i>emperors</i> are the secondary characters (e.g. in <a href="../../../f/u/t/Futurama.html" title="Futurama">Futurama</a>). So, if one wanted to have these in <i>categories</i>, articles would need to be created (or at least categorised <i>redirects</i>). Well, no, the list, where the rulers are listed <b>grouped by the work they come from</b> has a separate function of it's own... would need an "infinite" number of subcategories to do the same grouping by categories.</li>
<li>Please don't make up your own rules. Please have a look at the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">existing ones</a> instead. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 15:13, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

That's why I said above that the list should better have more <i>references</i>, so that it is easier for those who do maintenance on such lists (and e.g. throw out the non-notable content). --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 15:35, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think it breaks guideline #1 - "Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as quotations, aphorisms, or <b>persons</b>". Apologies if that was unclear. I also "apparantly had a fit" (sic) in explaining "unlimited" during the nomination: though his explanation of why is unclear, I will be happy to clarify if anyone can explain what is unclear about it. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 15:56, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Compare, for example List of real people appearing in fictional context - now that's a list of <i>real persons</i>. "List of fictional rulers" is not.

Neither is "List of fictional rulers" a page listing <i>indiscriminate</i> content as defined by WP:NOT. Further specifications for fictional content are in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">wikipedia:notability (fiction)</a>, which doesn't exclude listing of significant fictional content.

<dd>The article under nomination is no more encyclopedic than plenty of things found in WP - I gave some examples, that's all - how many US townlets census results should really appear in a real encyclopedia&#160;? I love this article, but I'd like WP to keep an appearance.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Not an arbitrary collection (being a "ruler" is a key attribute of a fictional character; contrast: "list of fictional characters with blue eyes"). It's better as a list than a category since not all these characters deserve articles, but conversely the fact that not all the entries have their own articles is not a clear reason to delete the list. It may need subdivision, probably not by fictional universe (this would produce too many small lists, and wouldn't serve the more useful connecting purpose): perhaps separate lists for the more common titles would be in order? Maybe it would be better to split by genre (List of fictional rulers in science fiction etc). Is it useless? No: if you want to consider the characteristics of rulers in fiction, this would be a good place to start looking. Moreover <b>"It has little content beyond links to other articles, and would therefore better serve as a category" doesn't comply with <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a></b>. There's no reason it shouldn't, if worked upon, include more information than mere links (it appears to me that well over 50% of entries actually do already!). Further, there's no reason to limit the list to only rulers with their own articles. And just because it is likely to be permanently incomplete doesn't make it invalid. <i>Please refer to <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a> before nominating lists for deletion</i> - this seems to fit the criteria there almost perfectly! (Annotated, lists entries without articles, well-sorted, extensive and useful "see also" section, entries all linked by an important common characteristic... how is this cruft?) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 17:40, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Accidentally I stumbled into some asteroid-related wikipedia pages today:</p>
<ul>
<li>there are currently over 1000 "list of asteroids" pages, each listing 100 asteroids (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_asteroids_8bf3.html" title="Category:Lists of asteroids">Category:Lists of asteroids</a>);</li>
<li>there are currently over 100 "Meanings of asteroid names" pages, each listing some 1000 asteroids (example: <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meanings_of_asteroid_names_%28100001-101000%29.html" title="Meanings of asteroid names (100001-101000)">Meanings of asteroid names (100001-101000)</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, this puts this vote (regarding a single list) a bit in perspective... especially the outrageous claim by the initiator of this vote that "any attempt to produce something approaching a comprehensive list would involve terabytes of information":</p>
<ol>
<li>I think there are less "fictional rulers" than there are registered asteroids;</li>
<li>For the *notable* fictional rulers (anyway, per <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_notability_criteria_535d.html" title="Category:Wikipedia notability criteria">wikipedia notability criteria</a> only the notable ones would be included in the fictional rulers list, and the notability criterion has apparently a slightly higher threshold for fiction than for asteroids if "visibility in the media" would be used for comparison) the meaningfullness for people's lives is often higher than that of most of the over 100000 rocks of a few cubic kilometers floating around the sun.</li>
<li>Most importantly: list "size" is a lame argument from whatever side it is approached.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note also that I must formally reject the argument that the list of fictional rulers would be difficult to maintain. I have it on my watchlist for some time now, and I suppose there are some others. I've seen no particular vandalism to the list. There were some odd reverts (just a couple as far as I can remember), but maintenance-effort-wise not comparable to anything happening on the "high profile" lists contained in wikipedia that are on my watchlist. In fact this vote cost me up to present dozens of times the amount of energy than the maintenance on that list has cost me over the last year.</p>
<p>So, obviously, those that argued "[...] <b>unmaintanable</b> list" above, weren't involved in its maintenance. "Votecruft"? Is that a word? If not, I invent it here formally: <b>votecruft</b>. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 13:34, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
