<p>Does not <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> refer to content, rather than a website? It is true that Total Gamer Zone is host to a forum, but it is not limited to its forum, despite its large member base. It is also a Game News website, a wallpaper and graphic repository, a forum, a game review site, and a place to set up online matchups. Theirfore, I beleive that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does not apply in this case, and that this Deletion should not take place.

<dd>The assertion that <i>"this site is very relevant to the gaming community"</i> may be true, however that does not necessarily mean it is notable enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia. Please read the criteria <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">here</a> for the "ground rules" used by WP editors to determine the notability of a website. Membership and Alexa rank are not official criteria, but they can be helpful when there are no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> references. For example, if and when the site has multiple reviews published in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable and reputable sources</a>, then it should pass muster here. Until then, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> an internet guide, nor is it a <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_ball.html" title="Crystal ball">crystal ball</a>. --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWine_Guy_7420.html" title="User:Wine Guy"><font color="#000080"><b>Wine Guy</b></font></a> <a href="../../../w/i/n/User_talk%7EWine_Guy_c683.html" title="User talk:Wine Guy"><font color="#000000"><small>Talk</small></font></a> 19:50, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Would someone explain to me why we are not allowed to post our reviews of games as an external link or review of games that are already in the system? ReyBrujo continues to remove any links to reviews of the games that we have given. Saying that information is non-notable. I can understand you saying that our sight is non-notable, it is very new, and has not had time to grow, however information and reviews of games are immediate things, simply created after a game is created, how can these be considered non-notable? If there is some guidlines for the editing or removal of external links to further information on a subject, please post a link to such guidlines, if there is not, should this user be reported for outright vandalism?

<dd>Hi there. Wikipedia accepts contributions from every user, however some do not fit Wikipedia. Imagine if people adds every single review from every single site about a game. <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#Occasionally_acceptable_links" title="Wikipedia:External links">The first External link style guide</a> about occasionally acceptable states that, <i>for albums, movies, books: one or two links to professional reviews which express some sort of general sentiment.</i> That is the closest for games, it is currently being discussed if general reviews should be accepted. Having reviews from <a href="../../../i/g/n/IGN_e112.html" title="IGN">IGN</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameSpot_fd17.html" title="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamespy.html" title="Gamespy">Gamespy</a>, <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurogamer.html" title="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>, <a href="../../../1/u/p/1UP.com_c6a3.html" title="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> and meta reviews like <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameRankings_5585.html" title="GameRankings">GameRankings</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metacritic.html" title="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, having the review of a non notable site with a forum of around 200 members and virtually no Alexa rank is not acceptable. Also, massively adding hyperlinks without discussing them in the talk page of the articles to see if there is consensus for adding them can be considered <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">spam</a>. Hope that makes it clear. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 05:43, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe I need to clarify that, when we talk about Non notable, we are referring to Wikipedia standards like <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which may or may not acknowledge other kind of notability. In example, the daughter of an actress may be notable by public standard, but an article about a newly born baby, unless inheriting a notability title like Count or Duke, is usually considered non notable. It is not an offensive term, but people new to Wikipedia may find it not appropriated. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 06:44, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: So by your own words, games that have no listed reviews would be fine to add our reviews to, that is funny, because the majority of the games to which I added reviews did not already have them. Also I find that notable intellectual work, such as reviews and along with other things, does not have to be created from something, someone, or someplace in and of itself notable, in order to have reference to a community or the world. I do not think any kind of content should be decided to be non-notable, simply because where it came from is not-notable. Using your own example, that would be like calling a book or some other form of intellectual property non-notable simply because it came from a non-notable person, while calling another book or work of intellectual property notable simply because it came from a notable person. I would equate judging our reviews of games as non-notable simply becuase our site is considered by <b>YOU</b> to be non-notable to be judging a book by the way you, personally, see the cover....MasterIkrit 09:56, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I never said that. I was referring to the fact that, existing IGN, GameSpot, Gamespy, Eurogamer, etc, sites with a long life and proved reliability, there is little need of new reviewers. See the <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html#How_not_to_be_a_spammer" title="WP:SPAM">sixth guideline</a>.
