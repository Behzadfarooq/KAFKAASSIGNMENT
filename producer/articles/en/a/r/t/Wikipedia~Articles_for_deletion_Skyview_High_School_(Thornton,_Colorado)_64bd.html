I know the people in the pictures personally, and they gave me permission for thier placement on this page. I was nto expecting anyone to come across it for a few days, and the page is only a couple of hours old. Within a week, the page will be in perfect wikishape.

<dd>Comment. I trust your work on this article is not indicative of the quality of students that come from this school. My AfD tag was in the interests of reversing the dumbing down of Wikipedia, and is not a <i>"a flaming/trool comment"</i>, whatever that is. If you want to avoid this ever happening again in the future, then write and fully tweak your article before you post it. Incidentally, do you not have a spellchecker? Anyway, I'll help out a bit on the article. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 08:13, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I am also taking all requests for added information so I can gatehr the proper facts and add as nessecerry. I also say that it is not cruft, as it was wanted from appeanance by wikipedia, as ntoed by the red link, and since noone else wnated to work on it, I chose to.ThNik 02:05, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm no deletionist, but I must say that a 'keep' proposal so aggressively targeted at the editors who could aggregate to prevent deletion of this article doesn't seem the best way to proceed. By the way; I (and many other editors) am/are A Geek, Not A Nerd. Another point which is perhaps worthy of mention, without disparaging the creator's efforts; a redlink does not necessarily mean that <i>Wikipedia</i> per se wants an article; it could also suggest that <b>one</b> editor thinks that an article should be created, and that other editors who disagree have not yet removed the redlink. Having said that, fleshing out redlinks is a noble cause (see Sir Geoffrey of Redlink), and I salute you for this, if not for a considered and calmly argued approach. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Colon</a><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_Esperanza_bb00.html" title="User:Col tom/Esperanza"><font color="green">el</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Tom</a> 13:47, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, suggesting a vanity motive, would seem to be more of an assumption of bad faith. The above keep voter, is merely indicating that they find none of your arguements worth considering. They are not questioning your *motive* for making any arguement. There's a big difference. You did ascribe an improper motive to others: namely "vanity". Note: the guideline is worded "assume good faith" *not* "assume good reasoning". Also, it's hard for others to understand your reasoning when you make an *invalid* speedy vote. Please cite where in policy you can justify a speedy deletion of this school. You gave *no* legitimate reason for a *speedy* deletion. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 15:26, 13 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I do not know why you assume that I voted for deletion solely based on vanity. I voted for deletion, as I state in my deletion vote above, because the article does not even attempt to cite sources thus leaving the information in the article unverifiable. The article relies purely on origional research. There are Wiki policies regarding citation, verifiability, and orgional research. The comment, whether or not it assumed bad faith, was still offensive in that it attempted to simply dismiss the points made by other editors who voted for deletion without giving any counter arguement for why the article should be kept. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 15:40, 13 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, I didn't say that was your sole reason. In fact, it may not have been a reason at all. I just said "<i>You did ascribe an improper motive</i>". My point was <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> means assuming good faith, not assuming good reasons. If you critiqued the *reasoning* of others, that would have been better then critiquing the motive (vanity) of others. Also, I didn't say you gave no reason for deleting per se. I was specifically saying you gave no basis in policy for *speedy* deletion. You had no speedy-specific reasoning. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 15:53, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is a reason that there are two sections to the page, so that people don't feel justified in singling out one section without the other.

<dd>I'm not following you. You supported to keep this article on the basis that the "current article is not at all <i>cruft</i>." If you're saying that my argument may be invalid, as I'm only looking at reasons to delete the article, why did you only consider an argument to keep it? If everyone wanted to support both sides of the debate, this entire AfD would be a long list of "neutral votes."&#160;;) — <b><a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/b/User_talk%7ERebelguys2_747e.html" title="User talk:Rebelguys2"><font color="#CC5500">talk</font></a></sup> 17:55, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I put my comment down because it is not valuable to the debate to simple reference one set of arguments in response to someone referencing the complementary set of arguments.

<dd>I suppose you haven't been through the trenches in the "schools debate." The reason people cite <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> is because all debates turn out the same – they default to keep. Rehashing the same argument each time is a waste of energy for everyone involved. If you'd simply like me to take an argument from <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_Arguments_66b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments">Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments</a> into this AfD listing, which is what everyone here, including you, has already done, I'd be happy to do so. — <b><a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/b/User_talk%7ERebelguys2_747e.html" title="User talk:Rebelguys2"><font color="#CC5500">talk</font></a></sup> 20:45, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The arguments in the section you reference are very broad. They don't all correspond to this AfD as the list references all possible arguments against having the page. Did you consider in your decision to vote this way whether the Keep arguments on the page are relevant, and as such whether they are stronger than the relevant Delete arguments. All of these things make for a more constructive debate than having people simply responding to someone referencing Keep and another referencing the corresponding Delete arguments.

<dd>I do, in fact, look at articles before I say anything on the corresponding AfD and I have, in fact, read the other arguments on this AfD listing. I think we can relax a little if you'll allow me to clarify my argument: "1. Individual schools are not inherently encyclopedic and there is nothing to distinguish insignificant schools like this one from thousands of nearly identical schools around the world. WP:NOT states "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information.
