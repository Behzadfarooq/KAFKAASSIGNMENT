<p>uninteresting, incomplete, potentially enormous... It may be tilting at windmills to try to get rid of this, but this list has such vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion that it could potentially grow to literally tens of thousands of entries, or more, and still be incomplete. And to what purpose? The result would be of mild interest, at best. I think this sort of thing is better served through categories. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 10:14, 1 January 2007 (UTC) Oh, and there are presently NO sources or references in the article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I have just added Melbourne to the brief Australian list and then I realised that I could probably name several dozen Australian places named after people. Indeed with a bit of research I could probably name hundreds. My suburb in Melbourne, Spotswood, is named after a person. This list is unmaintainable and therefore useless. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 12:04, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

If there are problems breaking down the lists when it gets too long, I'd happy to help you with this. BTW Categories were deemed unsuitable to group, e.g. "places named after US Presidents". -- User:Docu</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> as a list of lists- eg.

<li><b>Delete</b> A cursory search on Google turns up the frightening future of this page: "in Busseto, Italy, every street is named after a composer..." " In the market quarter of Athens, every street is named after a classic ancient Greek playwright..." "the village of Cesiomaggiore is really into bicycle racing, every street is named after a famous Italian racer..." <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBourne_5dc0.html" title="User:Bourne">Bourne</a> 23:44, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. The current article is completely unreferenced, and this is a subject area where a certain amount of digging is required. I suspect the present list is full of plausible but unresearched guesses. For example, is the District of Columbia really named after Christopher Columbus, or after the iconic figure, <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_Columbia_26b5.html" title="Historical Columbia">Columbia</a>? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:54, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I find Bourne's preview of what this list is destined to become particularly compelling regarding its lack of manageability. Compounded by the OR problems noted by Dpbsmith, I find it unlikely that this list can be retained, at least in its current form. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 03:02, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Potentially endless, badly referenced list containing too many dubious items. Romania named after Romulus? Erm, no. Neither, most probably, was Rome. The list fails to distinguish between mythological etymologies made up later in an attempt to explain place names ("Europe" from "Europa") and bona fide toponyms from real historical characters (Washington). This gives the page a nice mediaeval feel, but if you want that kind of encylopaedia you're better off sticking with <a href="../../../i/s/i/Isidore_of_Seville_9c52.html" title="Isidore of Seville">Isidore of Seville</a>'s <i>Etymologiae</i>. Not for Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 10:31, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I reworked the list. In addition to a short summary about countries (from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_country_name_etymologies.html" title="List of country name etymologies">List of country name etymologies</a>), it's now limited to cities and towns named after people. -- User:Docu</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. This really does not work. For a start, you have missed out places between countries and towns such as Australian states. Secondly you have not defined what a town or city is. A complete list would be very much longer and it is still impossible to get complete. Everywhere there are hundreds of towns that are not on the list. Also every entry will need a reference so they will be as long as the list. It is monster that serves no usefull purpose. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 11:07, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, to be more precise, Docu split up the article in a couple of different ones, including one about country subdivisions: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_country_subdivisions_named_after_people.html" title="List of country subdivisions named after people">List of country subdivisions named after people</a>. See also: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_railway_stations_named_after_people.html" title="List of railway stations named after people">List of railway stations named after people</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_islands_named_after_people.html" title="List of islands named after people">List of islands named after people</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_lakes_named_after_people.html" title="List of lakes named after people">List of lakes named after people</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_eponyms_of_stadiums.html" title="List of eponyms of stadiums">List of eponyms of stadiums</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_eponyms_of_airports.html" title="List of eponyms of airports">List of eponyms of airports</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_convention_centers_named_after_people.html" title="List of convention centers named after people">List of convention centers named after people</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_eponyms_of_stadiums_in_the_United_States_5c11.html" title="List of eponyms of stadiums in the United States">List of eponyms of stadiums in the United States</a>. As this is a good faith effort for improvement by Docu, I suggest we do not simply judge them all as one, but decide for each of the articles on their own merits. As smaller articles, some might be more worthwhile than others. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 11:26, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the list still has the potential to grow unmanageably. It would help if, as suggested above, it was limited to capitals and major cities. It still has no references and apparently contains many inaccuracies. Why don't we discuss the utility of this list here, and leave the calved-off fragments for another AFD? --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 18:46, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sounds fair to me, I was just afraid that people would want to include all the newly created articles in this AfD, which just seemed not right to me, giving the diversity of subjects. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<li>comment <b>- I'm not putting a debate in for either position here, because this might be salvagable, but as it stands, with *any* place being listable, it's potentially massive. For instance, my university campus alone has a dozen such sites (IE Lubar Hall, Merril Hall, Curtin Hall, and so on) at least, all named after people. Criterion for personal notability might help that though, so if may not be a fatal flaw. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 23:30, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</b></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The potential for the lists to become too long is the only problem that troubles me. But it should be a straightforward job to move the very long lists into pages like "List of places in Brazil named after people", and keep the length of the lists per country to &lt; 10 or so. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETintin1107_b710.html" title="User:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> (<a href="../../../t/i/n/User_talk%7ETintin1107_ddb3.html" title="User talk:Tintin1107">talk</a>) 16:40, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia has a bunch of useless (and incomplete) lists, so why do you have to single this one out? I have contributed to this page and have made sure to check that the actual article of the placename mentions who it's named after. Besides, I have learned some cool tidbits (Russia does not name airports after people, while most of Mexico's major airports are named after military leaders or political figures). And how else will people find out about <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Strom_Thurmond_de8e.html" title="Lake Strom Thurmond">Lake Strom Thurmond</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Hope_Airport_18a5.html" title="Bob Hope Airport">Bob Hope Airport</a> or Hitlersee? <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENutmegger_809c.html" title="User:Nutmegger">Nutmegger</a> 21:37, 3 January 2007 (UTC) Also, I think a lot of people wonder about this kind of stuff – it's not totally useless. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENutmegger_809c.html" title="User:Nutmegger">Nutmegger</a> 21:39, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>"Wikipedia has a bunch of useless (and incomplete) lists, so why do you have to single this one out?"</i> <i>"...it's not totally useless"</i>?

<li>"And how else will people find out about <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Strom_Thurmond_de8e.html" title="Lake Strom Thurmond">Lake Strom Thurmond</a>..." Obviously, someone interested in knowing the origins of the place name "Lake Strom Thurmond" can find out by typing "Strom Thurmond" into the search box. As for people interested in origins of place names, I think anyone interested in such things would do far, far better to go to the library and check out a copy of George Stewart's <i>Names on the Land</i> than to look at a completely fortuitous and arbitrary list of, perhaps, 0.0001% of all the places named after people. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:22, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
