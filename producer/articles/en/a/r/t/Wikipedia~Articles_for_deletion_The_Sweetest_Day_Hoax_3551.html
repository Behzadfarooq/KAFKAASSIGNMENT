<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> Sweetest Day is one of the most notable hoaxes of the 20th and 21st Centuries. October 8, 2006 will be the 85th anniversary of the first Sweetest Day, which was staged in Cleveland by the Candy Industry on October 7th and 8th 1921. In the beginning (1921), Sweetest Day started out as simple <i>consumer manipulation</i> by the Candy Industry, wherein the 12 Confectioners who constituted <i>The Sweetest Day in the Year Committee</i> co-ordinated advertising, news stories and editorials published in <i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> newspaper in order to (A) convince Clevelanders that a new candy-buying holiday was occurring nationally and (B) that they should buy candy for everyone they loved and cared about because everyone else was doing it nationally. The manipulation of Clevelanders' candy-buying habits continued over the first few years, and by 1924 editorials were being published in <i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> informing Clevelanders that Sweetest Day had become a <i>National Institution,</i> and advertisements were calling Sweetest Day <i>National Candy Day.</i> What is perhaps most notable about <i>The Sweetest Day Hoax</i> is that the hoax is still ongoing today, being perpetrated and enhanced by companies such as <i>American Greetings,</i> <i>Hallmark,</i> and Trade Organizations such as <i>Retail Confectioners International.</i> Evidence of the continued attempted manipulation of American Consumers' candy and gift-buying habits are clearly visible in the articles posted on these companies' websites <a href="http://pressroom.americangreetings.com/archives/fall04/sweetestday04.html" class="external text" title="http://pressroom.americangreetings.com/archives/fall04/sweetestday04.html" rel="nofollow">1</a> <a href="http://pressroom.hallmark.com/sweetest_day.html" class="external text" title="http://pressroom.hallmark.com/sweetest_day.html" rel="nofollow">2</a> <a href="http://www.retailconfectioners.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=60196&amp;module_id=3418" class="external text" title="http://www.retailconfectioners.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=60196&amp;module_id=3418" rel="nofollow">3</a> with the introduction of the phony <i>Herbert Birch Kingston</i> story during the 1990's. The attempts at manipulation can also be clearly seen on the current <i>Wikipedia</i> Sweetest Day site by viewing and comparing the former edits of the Sweetest Day page. The Sweetest Day Hoax has influenced millions of Americans and is a <i>multi-billion-dollar</i> effort on the part of Industry to manipulate the buying habits of Americans over the past 85 years. Wikipedia should allow the new article, <i>The Sweetest Day Hoax,</i> to replace the <i>Sweetest Day</i> article currently posted on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a> 16:29, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a>, this article is a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a> and the whole basic premise of it is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, inference based on primary sources, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unsourced</a> conjecture. The problem is that there are multiple sources purporting a version of events and it is not the place of Wikipedia, or wikipedia editors to decide which one is "right". Wikipedia is here to report <i>what has been written elsewhere</i>. The problem with this article (beyond the fact that it should never have been created; <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information should have been left in the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetest_Day_b5ea.html" title="Sweetest Day">Sweetest Day</a> article and editorial concerns worked through on the Talk page... which is what we were doing) is that you've inferred a hoax with no concrete evidence that one exists. You have presented circumstantial evidence and while it is certainly an interesting hypothesis, there are no secondary sources presented that point to anybody else supporting your <i>hoax</i> hypothesis. If there was a body of work out there that supported this hypothesis it would be one thing, but the only source for this that I see is your own website... and the Primary source you've provided only suggests there was a <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetest_Day_b5ea.html" title="Sweetest Day">Sweetest Day</a> committee of 12 men in 1921. It in no way suggests a candy-peddling cabal out to push a day of tooth-rotting sales.</li>

<dd>The origins of this day are murky at best, with the Kingston 1920's version being widely promoted as the "official" version (and I daresay the popularly accepted version). Leigh Eric Schmidt traces it back to 1910, which also doesn't jibe with your version of events. The Sweetest Day article is small enough to easily take on a section on the origin controversy provided we stay with sourced, verified material and stay away from conjecture and promoting theories or conclusions not supported by the source material. There simply is no reason for a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a> here just because you don't want to work on a collaborative version at <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetest_Day_b5ea.html" title="Sweetest Day">Sweetest Day</a>.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:57, 1 September 2006 (UTC) [<b>Note:</b> Recury and Antaeus Feldspar have deleted the article published in <i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> dated 10/15/2005 which states "<i>Dozens of Cleveland's top candy makers concocted the</i> [Sweetest Day] <i>promotion 84 years ago</i>" <b>3 times</b> from this discussion page (see history). <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a> 10:20, 5 September 2006 (UTC)]</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> It took less than 2 hours at my local library to find all the information and photos contained in this article. <i>Hallmark</i> has been selling Sweetest Day cards for <i>half a century,</i> and only recently started using the premise of the Herbert Birch Kingston story. <i>American Greetings</i> (which has been located in Cleveland for the past 100 years), like Hallmark, has never reported <i>any</i> of this information about the origins of Sweetest Day. The Herbert Birch Kingston story has <i>zero</i> primary source references. <i>Zero.</i> A Google search for Sweetest Day returns <i>half a million</i> results. A Google search for Herbert Birch Kingston returns 254,000 results. A Google <i>image search</i>, however, returns <i>zero</i> results for Herbert Birch Kingston. Is America really ok with the idea of Hallmark and American Greetings re-writing American History in order to sell greeting cards every 3rd week of October? <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a> 20:34, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The salient questions <i>here</i> are:
<ol>
<li>Is Wikipedia really okay with you deciding that, even though it is <i>debated</i> in the real world which of the stories of the origin of "Sweetest Day" is accurate, <i>you</i> will choose for one of those stories to be presented on Wikipedia as "the truth"? (Hint: read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.)</li>
<li>Is Wikipedia really okay with you deciding that, if other editors will <i>not</i> let you present the side of the debate that you favor as the "truth" of the matter, you will start a <i>different</i> article that basically exists just to let you assert as "the truth" what you were not allowed to assert as truth at <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetest_Day_b5ea.html" title="Sweetest Day">Sweetest Day</a>? (Hint: read <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a>.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>By the way, I'd like to point out that you're not only violating the above policies, but <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">Wikipedia:Avoid self-references</a> as well. "The attempts at manipulation can also be clearly seen on the current Wikipedia Sweetest Day site by viewing and comparing the former edits of the Sweetest Day page." Aside from all the other policy violations this assertion represents, there's no reason why it should be assumed that the "current" Wikipedia Sweetest Day article will be "current" when the reader reads it, or that Wikipedia will indeed be relevant and of interest to the reader (since it may not be Wikipedia they're reading it on.) -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:06, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>This discussion is invalid</b> because <i>Recury</i> keeps removing comments (see history). <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a> 20:51, 4 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So if I started going off on a complete tangent about, say, clowns and seaweed and red balloons, would you say that my tangent cannot be removed without making the discussion invalid? No? Then we are agreed that irrelevant comments can be removed without invalidating the discussion, and what we disagree on is whether the comments that Recury removed are relevant or irrelevant. Obviously you think they are relevant, or you would not have made them, but all I saw was you arguing <i>yet again</i> that your position on the origin of Sweetest Day trumps what everyone else has to say -- and even if that was <i>true</i>, it would still not be relevant to the question we are discussing <i>here</i>, which is what we should do with almost a textbook case of POV forking. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:18, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why did the textbook POV fork occur? Answer: Because the editors on the Sweetest Day page insisted on giving a story with <b>zero</b> primary source references (the Herbert Birch Kingston story) predominance on the Sweetest Day page. <i><b>(text deleted)</b></i> Both of these <b>sourced arguments</b> completely <i>justify</i> the POV fork. So let's bring the <b>relevant discussion</b> back to this page, shall we? <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a> 00:23, 5 September 2006 (UTC) <i>(I deleted text here because POV forks are</i> not <i>justified by being "in the right" and the material removed was entirely devoted to proving Miracleimpulse to be "in the right".) -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:29, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</i>
<ul>
<li>Why did the textbook POV fork occur? Because you were neither willing to accept the consensus or to use legitimate dispute procedures, neither of which (contrary to your assertions) justifies creating a POV fork. End of story. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:29, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Saying the candy &amp; card companies are perpetrating a massive fraud because your sources and their story doesn't match is a "novel narrative or historical interpretation" and thus original research. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransfinite_8be5.html" title="User:Transfinite">Transfinite</a> 04:12, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>My <i>sourced</i> arguments have now been removed from this discussion <b>3 times</b> by Recury and Antaeus Feldspar. <i>Transfinite</i> has also removed <i>sourced</i> information regarding the first Sweetest Day (October 8, 1921) posted on the 1921 event page. At this point I will remind the reviewing administrator of the Wikipedia guidelines for discussion:</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;Discussion&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Do not remove or modify other people's comments even if you believe them to be in bad faith (unless the user has been banned from editing the relevant pages or is making a blatantly offensive personal attack). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> The actions of Recury and Antaeus Feldspar on this discussion page constitute the exact type of deletion/editing of <i>sourced</i> material which caused the POV fork on the <i>Sweetest Day</i> article in the first place. Deletion of <i>sourced</i> material on a discussion page or in a Wikipedia article should be frowned upon and discouraged. The only just solution in this dispute is to allow <b>both</b> pages, <i>Sweetest Day</i> and <i>The Sweetest Day Hoax</i> to remain on Wikipedia. After all, Wikipedia is not paper, so why not allow both articles to co-exist in peace. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a> 09:57, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a>, what this all boils down to is that you feel your sourced material is superior or "more correct" than the more numerous sources that do not agree with your assertions because your source is the older, or perhaps more "primary" source. That simply is not how it works at Wikipedia. If there are 20 sources that say "Apples are Green" and one older source that says "Apples are Red", then the article on <b>Apples</b> needs to present both pieces of information <i>without making a judgement which is the correct color of apples</i>. We also don't write a <b>Green Apples</b> and <b>Red Apples</b> article just because those supporting <b>Red Apples</b> don't like the way <b>Green Apples</b> are portrayed in the <b>Apples</b> article. The only solution is for this article to be deleted and for a <i>discussion</i> to start at <a href="../../../s/w/e/Talk%7ESweetest_Day_d377.html" title="Talk:Sweetest Day">Talk:Sweetest Day</a> about what is the appropriate and factual amount of information to be included from <i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> along with the "Kingston" version and Leigh Eric Schmidt's version. Right now, much of The Sweetest Day Hoax is assumptions, conjecture, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> that is better suited to your own personal website than a Wikipedia article. I'm willing to discuss the <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetest_Day_b5ea.html" title="Sweetest Day">Sweetest Day</a> article content, but Wikipedia is a collaborative effort, so <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORKing</a> is never the answer to a content dispute. There are other avenues that can be taken to resolve content disputes and if you are interested in pursuing them I (or any other longtime user if you don't trust me) can tell you what these processes are (<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> alluded to them below).--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:29, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Response</b> Personally I like yellow apples: the skin on red apples is often too tough and green apples are too tart. Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia: &lt;&lt;This means that there is no practical limit to the number of topics we can cover other than verifiability and the other points presented on this page. There is a kind of feasible limit for individual article sizes that depends on page download size for our dial-up readers and readability considerations for everybody (see Wikipedia:Article size). After a point, splitting an article into separate articles and leaving adequate summaries is a natural part of growth for a topic (see Wikipedia:Summary style). Some topics are covered by print encyclopedias only in short, static articles, and since Wikipedia requires no paper we can give more thorough treatments, include many more relevant links, be more timely, etc. This also means you don't have to redirect one topic to a partially equivalent topic that is of more common usage. A "See also" section stating that further information on the topic is available on the page of a closely related topic may be preferable.&gt;&gt; Why does anyone have a problem with both articles co-existing on Wikipedia?

<p><b>Response</b> Hoaxes often involve <i>suppression and management of information,</i> which is exactly what was happening with the edits on the original <i>Sweetest Day</i> page resulting in the POV fork. Although all information posted in <i>The Sweetest Day Hoax</i> article is readily available at many Public Libraries, none of it has ever been published before to help make people aware of the methods used by advertisers and the Candy Industry to engineer the beginnings of Sweetest Day. The relentless deletions and re-wordings on the original Sweetest Day article constitute just such <i>information suppression and management.</i> There can be little doubt that Industry will continue their efforts at insidious deception and information management on <i>The Sweetest Day Hoax</i> page just as they have on the <i>Sweetest Day</i> page. The request for protection is fully justified. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a> 17:30, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

I've said this multiple times, but I will say it once more: you are drawing conclusions from the newspapter article that are not explicitly stated in those articles you've used as sources. The fact that none of the information you've cited has ever been used by anyone writing a piece using these primary sources as the basis for an article advancing the idea that Sweetest Day is a hoax started in 1921 <i>makes this whole contention a text-book case of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a></i> and thus not suitible for a Wikipedia ariticle. Furthermore, you are requesting protection for an article under the assumption that at some point someone is going to come along and engage in, as you've called it, <i>information suppression and management</i> when this has never happened in the article. Pages don't get protected against the assumption that at some point someone may edit them; that is the whole point of Wikipedia. You've created an article and now anyone can come alone and edit it provided they cite sources. Please read <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. Articles don't even get protected against the assumption that they may be <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">vandalised</a>. Protection is only used if and when it has been demonstrated that an article is being repeatedly vandalised and protection is the only way to stop that vandalism. Since the only edits to this article have been by you (other than me nominating it for deletion and <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">User:Dismas</a> doing minor wikification) there is no reason to protect this.

<p><b>Response</b> &lt;&lt;The fact that none of the information you've cited has ever been used by anyone writing a piece&gt;&gt;The October 15, 2005 article from <i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> which states that "Dozens of Cleveland's top candy makers concocted the [Sweetest Day] promotion 84 years ago" has been edited out of this discussion <b>3 times.</b> So let's put it back in again right here:</p>
<p>Idea behind Sweetest Day was to push candy, not love Saturday, October 15, 2005 Bill Lubinger Plain Dealer Reporter - Today will be sprinkled with cards and flowers, dinner dates and sex toys. - Except Sweetest Day wasn't supposed to be a day for lovers, but a day for lovers of sweets. - Dozens of Cleveland's top candy makers concocted the promotion 84 years ago and it stuck, although it never became as widely accepted as hoped. - "Sweetest Day is extremely regional," said Van Billington, spokesman for Retail Confectioners International. "It basically follows a path from Detroit to Buffalo." - The candy men of Cleveland proclaimed an annual "Sweetest Day of the Year" as a touching way to spread happiness -- not just for family and friends, but orphans and newsboys, too. - What better way to give 'em some sugar than with -- big shock -- candy, "because it has an appeal for everybody, rich and poor, old or young." - Chocolatiers delivered thousands of candy boxes to the needy. To the rest, they sold their product with outlandish claims. - In a special four-page Sweetest Day spread in The Cleveland Plain Dealer on Oct. 8, 1921, they pitched the benefits of confectionery delights. - They promoted everything from almond creams to fruit-centered milk chocolates, as if touting seaweed extract and fish oil. - "Scientists Say Man Can Walk Mile on Power Furnished by One Ordinary Caramel," reads one of the headlines. And did you know, the manufacturers fudged, that animals love candy, too. "Furthermore, most authorities agree that it is good for them." - Horses and dogs are especially keen on chocolate-covered varieties, they insisted. (No mention that chocolate can be toxic to a dog - even chocolate Labs.) - Candy makers wisely used the event to dispel popular myths that apparently hurt sales: Glucose doesn't contain glue, they informed readers, and the product isn't made from horses' hooves or coal tar. - Maybe they got one fact right, though. - "We are known as the greatest nation of candy eaters," the masters of marzipan bellowed proudly in print. "It has been said that all the rest of the world combined eats less candy than we do." - How sweet. - News Research Director Patti Graziano and and Deputy News Research Director Mary Ann Cofta contributed to this story. - To reach this Plain Dealer reporter: - blubinger@plaind.com, 216-999-5531</p>
<p><i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer,</i> being the <i>instrument</i> by which Sweetest Day was foisted upon Cleveland by the Candy Industry, is the <b>ultimate</b> source on Sweetest Day. Who would know better that Sweetest day is a <b>concocted promotion</b> than <i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</i>? <b>They helped concoct it!</b></p>

<p><b>Response</b> Right Feldspar. Just like Sweetest Day was founded by candy store employee Herbert Birch Kingston and his small group of friends doing good deeds for the forgotten. It's all in the wording and context, isn't it. There are two distinct points of view about Sweetest Day in our society: one held by those making profit from the event that it is a legitimate holiday, and one held by others that Sweetest Day is a made-up <i>Hallmark Holiday.</i> These two points of view cannot co-exist within the same article without one being cancelled out, because one is true and the other false. The truth does not attack a lie; it simply replaces it. Wikipedia is not paper. Both points of view should be allowed on Wikipedia until one just <i>disappears.</i> <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a> 17:30, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, Miracleimpulse. Both points of view should be allowed on Wikipedia, if they are both significant points of view. However, the <i>place</i> for <i>both</i> points of view, contrary to your assertion that they "cannot co-exist", is <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetest_Day_b5ea.html" title="Sweetest Day">Sweetest Day</a>. Other projects, like <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a>, are free to make their own choices about giving differing POVs their own articles; Wikipedia has already made a choice to disallow such things. "Wikipedia is not paper" does not overrule "Wikipedia is not a soapbox" or "Wikipedia is not a free host" or "Wikipedia is not a directory"; I fail to see why you think it overrules WP:POVFORK. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:12, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No, there is no equality between your scurrilous innuendo and the comments I made earlier today. My comments concerned your <i>behavior</i>, not unfounded speculation about you having a financial motive affecting your editing. As for your "deceptive weasely motorist", I would not say that the motorist in my example was deceptive or weasely -- he <i>honestly</i> thinks that it is all right for him to violate the speed limit, if someone else did something they should not have which "forces" him to speed to make up for it. If he has a flaw, it is less deception than self-deception. In contrast, you made a clear accusation of dishonesty.

</ul>
<p><b>Conclusion</b> Until I began editing the <i>Sweetest Day</i> article on Wikipedia, the article was a basic copy (nearly word-for-word) of the Industry Spin used to sell this holiday on countless websites across the internet. Once I began posting actual facts and photos about the subject, editors appeared out of nowhere to contradict, alter and delete what has turned out to be <i>primary sourced information and photos.</i> To date, the <i>only</i> source referenced on the Sweetest Day page is <i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> and that reference is to the information I posted which remains on the site. To my knowledge, <i>American Greetings, Hallmark,</i> and <i>Retail Confectioners International</i> have <b>never</b> been listed even as secondary sources on the Sweetest Day page. Lacking any type of primary source reference <i>whatsoever,</i> it can only be concluded that the Herbert Birch Kingston story of the origins of Sweetest Day is a cleverly crafted industry-generated <b>hoax,</b> the purpose of which is <i>mass deception</i> about the true origins of Sweetest Day in order to increase sales of candy, greeting cards and other <i>Sweetest Day-related products.</i> This being the case, the Wikipedia article entitled <i>The Sweetest Day Hoax</i> is indeed a distinct <i>new</i> topic on Wikipedia which will provide accurate and <i>sourced</i> information on the real origins of Sweetest Day to Wikipedia readers for years to come. I would like to thank Wikipedia for the opportunity to post this information on their site and offer a word of caution: that Wikipedia can be and has been used by industry to promote disinformation about topics such as <i>Sweetest Day.</i> I also look forward to working with other interested Wikipedians to present all new information which comes to light regarding <i>The Sweetest Day Hoax.</i></p>

<dd>"it can only be concluded that ..." Once again, incorrect. Someone who looks at the evidence <i>might</i> indeed conclude that the official story of Sweetest Day is an industry-concocted hoax.

At this point I'm tired of reiterating the same points over and over and too many editors have spent too much time on this discussion.

<p><b>Response</b> Incorrect, Isotope23. <b>All</b> means <b>All.</b> You are assuming that all primary source information has been posted, and it definitely has <b>not.</b> <i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> provides a treasure trove of <i>primary source information</i> on the origins of Sweetest Day beginning in 1921. <i>The Sweetest Day Hoax</i> article can and will be expanded exponentially using these sources. As is stated on the first edit summary, <i>The Sweetest Day Hoax</i> article is a work in progress (like all Wikipedia articles). Also, you are overlooking the US Census documents which have been posted that are <i>primary sources</i> of information. Meanwhile, the Herbert Birch Kingston story on the original Sweetest Day page (and all the other countless places it appears on the internet) remains unsourced in any way, primary or secondary. As a matter of fact, it seems like all editing on the original Sweetest Day page has stopped at a rather pathetic stage. What's up with that? <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a> 19:10, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> well, by all means... if you have "primary source information" that has not been posted here or in the article yet, that specifically proves this day was a hoax created by the 12 individuals you feel are responsible for it <i>and</i> refers to them as "founders" of Sweetest Day, then what are you waiting for? I for one welcome you to produce this evidence if it exists so I can stop wasting my time here... As for the census data, I'd already seen all that during the original AfD of <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetest_Day_b5ea.html" title="Sweetest Day">Sweetest Day</a> and I'm at a loss to see what you think that proves. It shows that he exists, that he resided in Cleveland, that he worked in advertising, and at some point he apparently owned a confectionery shop. How is that at odds with the popular mythology of "Herbert Birch Kingston, a philanthropist and candy company employee..." Candy companies employ advertisers. Anyone can be a philanthropist. The census data <i>proves nothing either way</i>... other than his exsitence, residence, and employment. As for sourcing, the current article is sourced by primary and secondary sources. I'm tired of explaining this... so I'll leave it at that. If you have problems with sourcing of information on other websites, I suggest you contact them. The original <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetest_Day_b5ea.html" title="Sweetest Day">Sweetest Day</a> page has stopped because it is finally to a point where it contains only information that is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>. You may think it pathetic, but IMO this is probably the best version of this page that has ever existed at this namespace... though it would be improved by Leigh Eric Schmidt's version of Sweetest Day from his book.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:04, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
