<p>This article is interesting, but is essentially pov in its view on terror suspects. There is no reason to list suspects based on whether or not they are minors. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazakhPol_c9da.html" title="User:KazakhPol">KazakhPol</a> 06:21, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Definitely POV, but probably a valid subject for an article. Could also be merged with the main article listing war-on-terror detainees, if there is room for another section. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 07:34, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Minors are treated differently by the law, international standards, etc. so it doesn't strike me as POV to list them differently. Would you mind elaborating, KazakhPol? Thanks!--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 08:36, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <b>Speedy keep</b> per Kchase02. The article does need to attribute criticisms to (plentiful) sources.--<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 09:14, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b> -- According to <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a>, specifically, <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_not_be_needed" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL#Problem articles where deletion may not be needed</a>, a perceived POV is not grounds for deletion. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 09:54, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- disclaimer -- I started this article.
<ul>
<li>This article is important. There are many newspaper articles that get the details wrong. About six months ago some Arab journalists came away from a briefing from a DoD spokesmen, believing he had told them that there were only three minors in Guantanamo, and that those three were receiving schooling. Untrue, the three children who received schooling, and played soccer with their guards, at Camp Iguana were released in January 2004.</li>
<li>I'd encourage anyone who thinks they have noticed POV in the article to be specific about their concern -- on the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Talk%7EMinors_detained_in_the_global_war_on_terror_2d44.html" title="Talk:Minors detained in the global war on terror">Talk:Minors detained in the global war on terror</a> -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 09:54, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> What I meant by my "Definitely POV" remark above is the the topic of the article, as stated, is POV. If one wished to make an article with the opposite POV, one would title it Use of Child Soldiers by Islamic Terrorists. Both of these are going to be attack articles, inherently. However, I think this <i>is</i> a valid topic and a good start on an article. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 19:36, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When I first started initiating articles on the Guantanamo captives I had my first experience with the {afd} process. One day I found four articles nominated for deletion at practically the same time. Several of the nominators argued that the topic of Guantanamo was "inherently POV", and "inherently anti-American". I asked them to explain themselves more fully. But they declined. So far as I am concerned no topic is inherently POV. Some topics are merely harder than others to write from a NPOV. But I don't think this means we should try to create dueling articles from two different points of view. I think this means we should just try harder to write one article that we can all agree is written from a NPOV. If there are specific passages you feel don't measure up to the NPOV standard I encourage you to draw them to our attention, on <a href="../../../m/i/n/Talk%7EMinors_detained_in_the_global_war_on_terror_2d44.html" title="Talk:Minors detained in the global war on terror">Talk:Minors detained in the global war on terror</a>.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> for reasons explained by <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 12:33, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A few things. Speedy keep only applies in limited circumstances as described at <a href="../../../s/k/_/WP%7ESK_0a05.html" title="WP:SK">WP:SK</a>. POV isn't normally a reason to delete an article, though it may be a valid reason for something that is irredeemably or inherently POV, where substantial efforts have been made to fix the POV problems. List of sequels that were better than the original is a good example of an article idea that is inherently POV; and so can't be pursued.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 20:15, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article is well sourced (U.S. Defense Department and Labor Department, other verifiable sources) and bears on the GWOT. If the nominator sees POV, feel free to edit. If there are reliable sources which disagree, feel free to add them. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 21:13, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Question</b> Neutral on this particular article, but what's the justification for having the separate articles on each detainee? They may be encyclopedically notable as group, but this does not mean that they are notable enough as individuals for their own articles <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:38, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've done a lot of the work on the articles on the articles on the individual captives -- and their "notability" is a perenial question. Many wikipedia contributors have called for the deletion of particular articles, citing <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Two wikipedians nominated <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaker_Aamer_2d6f.html" title="Shaker Aamer">Shaker Aamer</a>, the first article when sorted alphabetically, announcing their plan to then do a bulk deletion of all the other articles on Guantanamo captives if that nomination succeeded. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Shaker_Aamer_624f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shaker Aamer">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shaker Aamer</a>.</li>
<li>I point out to them that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> acknowledges, right in its first paragraph, that it is <b>not an official wikipedia policy</b>. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> acknowledges that it is just a guideline, one that is considered controversial by some contributors. Whatever authority it has is based not on being an official policy, but on its interpretation of three real official policies: <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a>.</li>
<li>My perception is that these challenges highlight the weakness of using "notability" as a guide to which articles should be deleted. It is far too subjective and vulnerable to unconscious influence from the wikipedia's systematic bias.</li>
<li>If there is ever an explicit debate to transform notability from a guideline to an official policy I will argue very strongly that it should not be transformed. Rather I would suggest this guideline be deprecated.</li>
<li>IMO we should stick with the more objective criteria <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a>.</li>

<dd>Well, you're coming from an understanding of Wikipedia which is very much the opposite of mine. <b>Pointing out that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is just a guideline is a double-edged sword</b>. I've routinely point out the same thing when inclusionists use <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> to argue for keeping articles. I would emphasize that proponents of encyclopedic notability see it as extending not just from notability guidelines but also from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> which is a <b>core official policy</b> as well as the <b>No.1 official policy &amp; mission statement</b>: <i><b>"<a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html#Key_policies" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. Its goals go no further, and material that does not fit this goal must be moved to another Wikimedia project or removed altogether.</a>"</b></i> All other guidelines and policies including <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>,<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> serve this ultimate overarching policy/mission statement. Exclusion on the bases of encyclopedic notability based on these official policies helps prevent (or slow) Wikipedia's slide into becoming a free-for-all webhosting/information database/news report archive/networking&amp;marketing service. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 17:21, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
