<li>VfD has no authority over non-mainspace articles, no authority over cases of people ignoring "proposed process" in non-mainspace articles, and you haven't even tried to cite the part of the deletion policy that this is covered under, mainly because it isn't. Take your squabbles to the talk pages involved, please. Listing such things on VfD is a waste of people's time.

<li>Rfde-Adm has no authority over de-adminning sysops, the Arbitration Committee does. Listing such things on Rfde-Adm is a waste of people's time. Should I go on? What's that you say... there's nothing in the deletion policy to cover this Vfd listing? Hang on a sec, maybe I'll do what Netoholic did and just write my own brand-new policy from scratch. Maybe I'll even call a vote on my brand-new policy and then ignore the consensus. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 23:56, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>&lt;lame humor&gt;Well before you delist it, you need to call for a Vfd for this Vfd page. Unfortunately, there's nothing in deletion policy that covers the deletion of Vfd pages. Of course, you can remedy that by just inventing your own policy. Or you can start a petition to invent such a policy... remember to put it under a subpage of <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_de-adminship_8eb9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship">Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship</a>, which is our new namespace for petitions. Actually, rather than delisting this Vfd page, what you should do is move it to Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship/Votes for deletion/Requests for de-adminship/Snowspinner, because contrary to appearances this was never a Vfd at all, it was just a petition, so it belongs in the petition namespace. Or maybe now the new petition namespace is in Netoholic's user space, so we should move this page to User talk:Netoholic/Requests for de-adminship/Votes for deletion/Requests for de-adminship/Snowspinner. Maybe I'll go ahead and do that. Oops, hang on. Netoholic moved it back out of his user space just now, a minute ago. Never mind.&lt;/lame humor&gt; -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 02:48, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. This misleading page has been created by Netoholic without regard for the rules he himself set down (it's not been listed on the main <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFDA_5218.html" title="WP:RFDA">WP:RFDA</a> page as required) and without regard to the palpable lack of consensus for his otherwise interesting and thought-provoking proposal. Moreover, in the absence of a clear consensus on policy, his singling out of a particular user constitutes a personal attack on that user. The page should be deleted and he should be considered for severe censure--something that will stop him repeating this kind of very serious personal attack. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 02:55, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I would have favoured moving it to user space, but the originator clearly doesn't want that. This cannot be viewed as unconnected with the RFDA process, since it's a subpage.

<li>Well, I have to give points to Netoholic for coming up with new and original ways of being a royal PITA without actually breaking any rules.

<li>Well, since you're neutral and your only reason to post this was to berate me, I'll answer. All I did was create a petition to gather information. I didn't make this VfD listing.

<li>Why are votes, straw polls, and elections appropriate for Wikipedia:, but not petitions? Is this vote really just about it being a sub-page of RFDA? -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 03:44, 2005 Mar 25 (UTC)

<li>And he accuses Snowspinner of making up policy as he goes along... Surely there are better ways to propose —and implement— policy changes. Providing there is consensus for these, we should hope. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 10:00, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>An appropriate response to this vfd might be to transform it into a RfC. He already has two supporters so if they can agree on a single issue where they have evidence of unresolved grievances they can kick it off and have community discussion. If a consensus arrives that Snowspinner should not be an admin by reason of abuse of power or for some other valid reason, arbcom could be directed to investigate (their charter directs that they'll take cases when ordered to do so by the community). --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 14:00, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Page move</b></p>
<p>I have moved the page to Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Snowspinner2 and reformatted it.</p>
<p>It is wholly inappropriate and unseemly to attempt to utilize a nonexistent mechanism that clearly lacks community support as a means of dealing with a personal dispute. The RFC mechanism is the means presently available for dealing with such matters, and so Netoholic's dispute properly belongs there. Since a major goal of the RFC process is to centralize such disputes to avoid having them scattered across the wiki, I have chosen to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a> in moving it there.</p>

<p>Not only did <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> delete the redirect, he pasted it back in without the VfD header. The evidence of his bad faith and intellectual dishonesty is piling up. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 03:29, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This page is what it is. It is not an RFC, it is not a personal page of mine, It's a petition on the specific subject subject of Snowspinner. If the community votes to delete it, so be it, as long as they clearly understand what they are deleting. I appreciate that everyone wants to help "handle this" in various ways, but the one way that was not explored was asking me first. I'd have been happy to clear up the misconceptions early on. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 03:42, 2005 Mar 26 (UTC)

<dd>Any "misconceptions" are of your creation, and it's hard not to believe they're not deliberate. This is, in fact, a personal, unofficial petition, so your user page is <i>precisely</i> where it belongs, Yet, you're hellbent on having this thing under the banner of your phony <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_de-adminship_8eb9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship">Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship</a> policy page. Why is that?.</dd>
<dd><i>If the community votes to delete it, so be it</i> Yet, you deleted the VfD tag in your latest revert. An actual revert wouldn't have done that, so it must have been deliberate.

<dd>I'm not going to argue on this VfD page.

<dd>I think, actually, the community <i>has</i> voted to delete it. The usual VfD term is of course 5 days, but in most cases the heavy turnout is the first day or two, and under these circumstances I really can't imagine why the overwhelming trend of comments would reverse itself. Perhaps instead of getting people wound up over whether the VfD tag is properly on the page, Netoholic could spare everyone the non-suspense by slapping a {{delete}} tag on it instead. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 04:04, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
