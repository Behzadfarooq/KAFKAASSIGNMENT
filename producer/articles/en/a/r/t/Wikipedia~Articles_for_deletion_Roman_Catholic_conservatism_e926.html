<p><b>Delete.</b> The overriding reason this page should be deleted is because of its massive POV problem. I will argue that this problem is inherent to the topic, "Roman Catholic conservatism". The only purpose this article could possibly serve is to discredit people with whom the author disagrees. It is not a serious encyclopedia entry, and should therefore be deleted.</p>
<p>First, there is a consensus in Catholic circles that political terms like "conservative", "moderate", and "liberal" are inappropriate and not germane to theological questions.</p>
<p>Second, the positions listed as examples of Catholic "conservatism" are very radical, to the point where somebody who believed most of these things probably would belong to a breakaway fringe "Catholic" group rather than subject himself to Rome.</p>
<p>Third, when people think of "conservative" Catholics, they often think of those who simply support the Church's teachings on issues like abortion, birth control, etc. If they came looking for more information to this article on "Roman Catholic conservatism", they would be led to think that those supporers of Church doctrine are much more extreme than they are.</p>
<p>Fourth, some of these are simply disingenuous misrepresentations. Nobody regards Jews as "faithless"; actually, that type of prejudice would be sinful under Catholic teaching! I suspect a lot of these items of "Roman Catholic conservative" ideology were listed and radicalized in order to discredit "Roman Catholic conservatives".</p>
<p>Fifth, equating these outrageously bigoted, non-Catholic, heterodox ideas with perfectly (theologically and morally) acceptable ones like saying the Mass in Latin, emphasizing devotion to Mary and the saints, "justification for war when absolutely necessary", and "abstinence from meat on Fridays", suggests a <i>massive POV problem</i> with this article, and bolsters my suggestion about the authors' motives in the previous point.</p>
<p>Sixth, the idea of "conservatism" implies a tendency to "conserve". In this case, that is precisely the opposite of what this article suggests "Roman Catholic conservatives" want. They supposedly "reject ecumenist policies", "totally avoid interfaith theological dialogue", "deny that Anglicans and Protestants are Christians", demonstrate "no respect for non-Catholics", believe "salvation is for Catholics only", emphasize Tradition <i>over and against</i> Scripture, "avoid handshaking and body prayer" (whatever <i>that</i> is), and believe that sex is for "reproduction only, not pleasure". These positions are <i>contrary</i> to the constant teaching of the Church. They can't be characterized as "conservative" in any meaningful sense.</p>
<p>If this article is about people so radical that they couldn't reasonably be called "Catholic" or "conservative", then I wonder what the purpose of this article is -- other than to discredit both Catholics and conservatives. This is a poor excuse for an encyclopedia entry, and I urge deletion. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyphen5_402f.html" title="User:Hyphen5">Hyphen5</a> 11:21, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. POV can always be edited out of an article, but this entry has been unsourced since October 2005. It violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, as it stands. Also see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Roman_Catholic_liberalism_b410.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Roman Catholic liberalism">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Roman Catholic liberalism</a>. <a href="../../../p/j/m/User%7EPJM_3604.html" title="User:PJM">PJM</a> 12:44, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> the whole list to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditionalist_Catholic_36a0.html" title="Traditionalist Catholic">Traditionalist Catholic</a>, of which it's a possible <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a>. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyphen5_402f.html" title="User:Hyphen5">Hyphen5</a>, you can then make your arguments there and remove what's unsourced. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 13:05, 17 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, my point is that this article is intellectually unserious. <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditionalist_Catholic_36a0.html" title="Traditionalist Catholic">Traditionalist Catholic</a> is a good faith attempt to document a real phenomenon. <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_conservatism_cc2b.html" title="Roman Catholic conservatism">Roman Catholic conservatism</a> is not, and so I wouldn't necessarily want to fill that article with this one's garbage. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyphen5_402f.html" title="User:Hyphen5">Hyphen5</a> 21:01, 17 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That may well be so, but this is about process. Not being a theologian, I don't know what makes sense here, but the editors of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditionalist_Catholic_36a0.html" title="Traditionalist Catholic">Traditionalist Catholic</a> may. If we merge the list there, and then you delete everything you think is wrong, they will see it and possibly object. That's the point of avoiding <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORKs</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 22:53, 17 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I guess I could live with that, but shouldn't we also make sure that we apply the same standard to Roman Catholic liberalism -- which is (rightly) <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Roman_Catholic_liberalism_b410.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Roman Catholic liberalism">headed for deletion</a>? There are, of course, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> violations in this article as well. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyphen5_402f.html" title="User:Hyphen5">Hyphen5</a> 22:59, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>merge</b> per Sandstein</s>. I am persuaded by the suggestion that <b>delete and redirect</b> is the better alternative and support that. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">Bucketsofg</a> 17:25, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditionalist_Catholic_36a0.html" title="Traditionalist Catholic">Traditionalist Catholic</a> as it is a likely search term but don't merge content for reasons outlined by Hyphen5.<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 23:45, 17 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I could go for that. How do I "officially" change my vote to <b>delete and redirect</b>? I'm kind of new to this. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyphen5_402f.html" title="User:Hyphen5">Hyphen5</a> 06:39, 18 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, on second glance, the laundry list of conservative ideas in the article does look more than a bit spurious. <b>Delete and redirect</b>. There is no "official" way of changing votes; you just did. But you can <s>strikethrough</s> your initial vote if you want to. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 07:44, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b>. As I understand it, this forum is not, strictly speaking, a vote per se, but a discussion seeking consensus. Indeed, I suggest that the above is very much a model of how AfD discussions <i>should</i> go: a detailed case, some counter-points, other counter-points, with people changing their mind and broadly accepting a certain outcome as the best solution. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">Bucketsofg</a> 16:52, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
