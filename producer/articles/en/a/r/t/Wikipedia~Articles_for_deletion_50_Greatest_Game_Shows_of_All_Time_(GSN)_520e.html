<p>This series is not a notable series unto itself (GSN is a minor cable network), and Wikipedia doesn't need a borderline-copyvio copy of every "List of Greatest Foo". - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:13, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Delete</b>, why should <i>this particular list</i> of the 50 greatest games be on Wikipedia? It's really just GSN's POV, and even though GSN caters to the game show audience I'm not sure it should be here. I'd also point out that we also have the similar <a href="../../../5/0/_/50_Greatest_Game_Shows_of_All_Time_%28TV_Guide%29_06b8.html" title="50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time (TV Guide)">50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time (TV Guide)</a>, perhaps that should be nominated as well if this one is deleted. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanG_1aea.html" title="User:BryanG">BryanG</a><sup><a href="../../../b/r/y/User_talk%7EBryanG_f39b.html" title="User talk:BryanG">(talk)</a></sup> 05:39, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</s>

<li>Hmm, I was interpreting this more as a list than a full-fledged series, but my fellow editors have pretty much destroyed that argument.

<li><b>Keep</b> This series represents the opinion of the television network that services the niche audience concerned with game shows. It is notable content. If the article does not develop over the course of the series into something deserving of its own article, the proper course of action would be a proposal for merger, either into the TV Guide list of 50 greatest game shows to create a single "greatest game shows" article or into the GSN article. I have edited this article. In fact, I deleted the prerequisite template that got us to this stage. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 05:43, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, per Erechtheus. If consensus is to delete, perhaps we have a comparision between TV Guide's list and this one? Failing that, maybe a list of all game show rating lists? Or, perhaps, if those solutions fail, possibly have a category of those shows listed in either list, and then sort them so that they are organized, if technically possible? <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanManka_997b.html" title="User:IanManka">Ian Manka</a> <small><a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIanManka_481c.html" title="User talk:IanManka">Talk to me!</a></small> 06:18, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. TV series are notable by default, especially if broadcast internationally. GSN is not a minor cable network as it is available not only in the US but in Canada as well and produces its own programming. If this were just a list of a magazine or TV show's opinion, that might be another matter, but this is specifically an article about a TV series. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:52, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. As 23skidoo said, this is not just a list, but a full-fledged television series airing in prime time on a nationally available cable network. Therefore, I think it deserves an entry.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> TV series are NOT notable by default. This is a listcruft program with little real authority (the list was compiled by a few network executives when dreaming up this show?).

<li><b>Comment</b> I wanted the AfD box to be deleted because that list is important to all Game Show fans. Some fans may not remember the list after they watch it.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This is total cruft and borders on copyvio, I also ask that this vote get an extention due to the vandal that removed the notice. --Shaunvader 10:47, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> thanks to the attention paid the page by not one but two different editors, the notice was gone for 25 minutes in total. I can't speak to extension policy, so it may be that one would automatically lie. If it's some sort of totality of the circumstances test, I'd hope the prompt replacement would weigh heavily in favor of no extension. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 01:17, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The AfD is running 16-5 keep, so an extension seems pointless. Keeping the AfD around for another day or two means the final would be maybe 19-7 keep. Frankly, it's about time to close this one. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 22:13, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Uh, just did a hand count. It's 18-5 keep now. Why bother with an extension? <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 22:22, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I can't imagine how this could be considered to border on copyvio, and more than any other TV episodes' descriptions would. This is original programming from a major network, lasting for many weeks, and is worthy of a page. <a href="../../../q/a/q/User%7EQaqaq_a365.html" title="User:Qaqaq">Qaqaq</a> 15:12, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> – A TV series that airs a list is not cruft in-and-of-itself. I also agree with several people on here that GSN is <i>NOT</i> a minor cable network; while it is certainly not on the level of networks like ESPN or MTV, it most definitely has a niche audience (just like ESPN and MTV, incidentally). Speaking of which, a regular list-type show that airs on MTV or ESPN isn't considered cruft, but a list-type show that airs on GSN <i>is</i>? PS – If there is copyvio issues, send it to another editor for a rewrite; problem solved.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> this is no less crufty than a show like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Greatest_Canadian_f665.html" title="The Greatest Canadian">The Greatest Canadian</a> or <a href="../../../h/o/c/Hockeyville.html" title="Hockeyville">Hockeyville</a> and it is a very useful reference which is not found elsewhere (not even on GSN's website) - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 02:36, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> What Qaqaq said. This isn't just a list, it's also a television series airing on a cable network that's available to more than half of US households. I even get it up here in Canada. There are articles on TV series here that are a lot more obscure, or air on networks with much less saturation. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilraven_ff94.html" title="User:Kilraven">Kilraven</a> 02:40, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
