	    <p>So, I adjusted the section of his history detailing Promise of the Witch King. It started out as just fixing up a few grammer/spelling mistakes, but I soon found myself explaining the book in detail. However, even though I read it recently, I can't remember some things.</p>
<p>What was the name of the corrupt noblewoman who traveled with the party? The Half-Orc wizardess, her lover, and the village they hailed from? What was the name of the "Paladin King" of Damara and the secret criminal organization trying to unseat them? I'll pull the book out and adjust the article with more details later, unless someone does it first. -207.224.22.101</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have the book beside me right now, but I am not in a position to edit. Incidentally, is it just me, or has Charon's Claw's ability to cause wounds to fester virtually disappeared by that book? I saw no mention of it, which is odd given that Entreri had to be careful even of getting nicked by the sword in <i>Servant of the Shard</i>. Maybe it was somehow tied into the glove? *wry grin* Or it could be Salvatore either forgot, or tried to quietly downplay the ability for fear that it would be too powerful. As a side note, the knight was Ellery with a bunch of extra last names. The wizardess was Arrayan and her lover was Olgerkhan off the top of my head. The name of the paladin king was "Dragonsbane". *wry grin* Sad that such things stick in my head like that. And I think it was the Citadel of Assassins.</dd>
<dd>Incidentally, if you find the events of the book go over a paragraph, I suggest creating a seperate article for the book (I know anonymous users can't start articles, but signing up takes about 30 seconds and requires very little personal information) and linking it, only providing a brief summary for the Entreri article. -<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanDuggan_af73.html" title="User:SeanDuggan">Fuzzy</a> 20:57, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems like there's plenty of information here to make a very good article but it just needs organising a bit more. I've tried to rework the intro a bit to make it sound more encyclopedic. The Hisory/Bio section is good but as its reasonably long it might be a good idea to add subheadings to show his involvement in each of the books that he appears, or failing that, subsections like "Early life", "Meeting Drizzt", then later stuff with Jarlaxle etc, the latter might be more appropriate. If anyone knows enough about this please do, otherwise I'll try and find out enough to do it myself.</p>
<p>It's also a good point to remember that this is an article on a <i>fictional</i> character, not a source of information for D&amp;D players, so just wondered what other people thought on the rather large sections talking about his magic items. How much do they add to the understanding of the character? They do mention some useful bits but im not sure about the rather large large quote from servand of the shard.

<p>I've forgotten the name of the story, but a young Artemis Entreri appeared in a short story describing his ascent in the Thieves Guild of Calimport in a collection that was themed around the villains of the realms. I'm sorry that I don't have the name, but the book featured stories centered around Manshoon, Elaith Craulnober and others. If someone knows the name, it might be a good idea to add it under Appearances. --68.0.144.96 21:54, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this should be changed to Lawful or Neutral Evil. I'm not aware of any official stats that have been published after the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting was released -- which depicted him as LE (before he aquired Charon's Claw). I think he could easily be considered NE after <i>The Halfing's Gem</i>, when he left his guild life behind to seek out Drizzt, and especially after he left Calimport with Jarlaxle at the end of <i>Servant of the Shard</i> to become a mercenary. But, certainly not True Neutral -- yet. He's still shown characteristics that mark an evil character. I recall one instance in Promise of the Witch King where he had the chance to save someone from falling off a speeding wagon, but decided it wasn't worth the risk of losing control of the reigns so he let him fall to his death. Later on, he intended to kill the man's widow/lover, Calihye, because she blamed Entreri for her late lover's death. In Salvatore's preview chapter of his upcoming <a href="http://www.rasalvatore.com/#siteNews76" class="external text" title="http://www.rasalvatore.com/#siteNews76" rel="nofollow">Road of the Patriarch</a>, Entreri decides to kill Calihye, his new lover, if she ever "disgusts" him. These little aspects of his character seem, to me, to place his aligment somewhere in the evil side of the spectrum.</dd>

<dd>I think a good argument could be made that contends Enteri is <i>becoming</i> True Neutral, but, since it's unclear how much the magical flute is influencing him, it seems too early to call. It's been almost a year since I read Promise of the Witch King, so I'm sure I missed some more telling moments of the book. But, I'm pretty confident that he'd still be considered evil by D&amp;D standards --Saramus 10:20, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just re-read <i>Promise of the Witch King</i>. I had my characters mixed up regarding the wagon scene. Entreri let go of Calihye's good friend, who was a woman. As far as his alignment goes, I'd say he's still evil. Although he seems to be willing explore his emotions now (influenced by his partner, Jarlaxle and the magic flute), and may find "purpose" in his life beyond killing, he still exhibits the darker characteristics that have defined him throughout Salvatore's books. The D&amp;D 3.5 edition description of LE still seems to describe him best -- for now. --Saramus 08:57, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Again, and again you mention that this change in Artemis is due to the magical flute. Maybe it helps a little, but I believe the true influence came from Calihye. Artemis found some one to love and his whole outlook on life changed. When he was locked in the dungeon in The Road of the Patriarch his only worry was of Calihye. She changed him, and made him hole, but then she screwed him up again! I wouldn't have blamed him for killing her after what she did. The other influence is Jarlaxle, no matter what Entreri says, they are friends, and brothers. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxxiboy_e858.html" title="User:Maxxiboy">Maxxiboy</a> 03:05, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>For reasons explained above. --Saramus 08:57, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Artemis should be considered truly neutral. He has clearly given up on the life of the assassin, as seen in <i>The Road of the Patriarch</i> when he disobeys the Citadel of Assassins. The people who were discussing him earlier were ignorant to the whole story, and what they had down wasn't even the correct story. When Parisus(the woman on the wagon) fell, there was nothing Artemis could do to save her, and he regrets that. Also he never wanted to harm Calihye, he loved her, and she did eventually disgust him by denying his love and trying to kill him. Artemis didn't retaliate by killing her, but let her live. He is a changed man, and if anything he will eventually come over to the good side. But personally, I enjoy the Artemis Entreri who has a sliver of evil in him. But he no longer works to disrupt the good in the world. Artemis Entreri is <b>Neutral.</b> <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxxiboy_e858.html" title="User:Maxxiboy">Maxxiboy</a> 20:06, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Are you kidding? He just killed his father! How is that not evil? Should his magically changed alignment be considered his "true" alignment? He's clearly <b>Evil.</b> <a href="../../../m/w/s/User%7EMwsilvabreen_11b8.html" title="User:Mwsilvabreen">Mwsilvabreen</a> 01:10, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, he killed his father, but his father was far from being "good". He was very corrupt and abusive, as was his uncle. I still feel TN is a valid alignment for him. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurlo_Lomon_530b.html" title="User:Turlo Lomon">Turlo Lomon</a> 01:10, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Does killing someone corrupt make it right? His sword is evil, so he needs an evil will to control it. Since we don't know if his new glove can control the sword, he probably still uses his "wall of rage." <a href="../../../m/w/s/User%7EMwsilvabreen_11b8.html" title="User:Mwsilvabreen">Mwsilvabreen</a> 02:21, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wall of rage? Hah! Obviously, I'm arguing with some one out of their league here. Did anyone happen to read the short stroy in the anthrology Realms of Shadows? If you had read it you would realize that Artemis Entreri is able to control the sword because he absorbed the soul of a shade with his vampiric dagger. Since then he has become ten times the man he was before, stronger in mind and body. Some say that the author, R. A. Salvatore only did this to lengthen Entreri's life span. I agree, and I use this to show that even the great Salvatore likes Artemis Entreri. Entreri no longer fights with rage, but passion.<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxxiboy_e858.html" title="User:Maxxiboy">Maxxiboy</a> 02:07, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now that I can't argue. Lawful Evil it is! (Also, it makes sense, him being the antithesis to Drizzt, who is CG). <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurlo_Lomon_530b.html" title="User:Turlo Lomon">Turlo Lomon</a> 16:10, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Me again, Artemis isn't evil anymore, he realizes that he's been living a life with no purposes and has changed, in The Road of the Patriarch he defies an Assassin's guild and though he still has a somewhat sour mood, he does good more often than evil lately. Personally I enjoy the sour mood and dry humor between Entreri and Jarlaxle, thats what makes them more interesting than Drizzt. Drizzt is the goody-goody and everything is happy for him, and everyone loves him; he makes me sick! Artemis Entreri came from a horrible childhood, and was never loved. But since he found that there were people who could care about him, he has changed, and changed for the better. Artemis is clearly <b>neutral</b>. You're lucky I'm not arguing for him to be considered good. I feel passionatley about Entreri and when people put him down like this I will fight to the last breath for him. Go ahead call him evil again.<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxxiboy_e858.html" title="User:Maxxiboy">Maxxiboy</a> 02:03, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, Turlo Lomon, Artemis is not Drizzt's opposite at all. When Drizzt notices a change in Artemis's demeanor (and he does see a change) he even compares the new Artemis to Zaknefien, Drizzt's father. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxxiboy_e858.html" title="User:Maxxiboy">Maxxiboy</a> 02:38, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I reviewed the talk page, and it appears my comments were shifted down from where they were originally a reply. They are very out of context. I have to yield to other contributers' opinions on the recent books because I haven't been able to get caught up on my reading yet. My originaly post stated TN. An event in a book I haven't read pointed out this was incorrect, so I yielded to that person's analysis until I had a chance to read the book. I'll update my opinion when I get caught up. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurlo_Lomon_530b.html" title="User:Turlo Lomon">Turlo Lomon</a> 12:18, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I must agree with Maxxiboy on this issue, though I believe his name is a tad homosexual. Artemis Entreri is definately neutral. He no longer does evil bidding, and I don't believe he will come back to the side of evil again. I, and the flute of Idalia have changed Artemis Entreri, for the better of the world, but I'm afraid he is of no use to me anymore.

<dd>Hall of Heroes has Artemis' alignment as Neutral Evil. The Forgotten Realms Campaign Book lists it as Lawful Evil. Given that between these two publications, Artemis really didn't change his personality in the book, it appears that even the game mechanics are not sure on this subject. So, here is a proposal. <b>Lawful Evil with Neutral Tendencies</b>. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurlo_Lomon_530b.html" title="User:Turlo Lomon">Turlo Lomon</a> 07:44, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. His official alignment is *NOT* for us fans to decide. It is official, thus must for the Wizard of the Coast to say. Although some may object that LE/NE is not consistent with his desciptions in the later novel, but it is just that unless WotC later changed Entreri's alighment. However these issues can be a new section such as <i>fan reaction</i> in the article though. --<a href="../../../c/y/n/User%7ECynehelm_e01e.html" title="User:Cynehelm">Cynehelm</a> 11:42, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually there is not a "shade" class. It is actually a add on race template that can be added to anyone. This is described it the FRCS, in the the back of the book where they list several new monsters. Though I wish there was another encounter between Entreri &amp; Drizzt, I sincerely doubt Salvatore will do this. Especially after the way he ended Road of the Patriarch. It seems in his latest books (Road of the Patriarch &amp; The Two Swords)that he is attempting to break of from the long and entwining stories of Entreri and Drizzt. I do hope he does continue to write about them though! --DaronPyrosis, 10 November 2006</p>

<p>Problem is that Alignment in DnD is a very grey area where interpretation rules.</p>
<p>Is someone evil because they don't risk their own well-being in order to save another?</p>
<p>I admit that I believe Entreri was evil in the Icewind Dale trilogy, since he was not so much evil, as he was unnecessarily cruel and selfish to a point where it would be considered evil. Such as when he sent Drizzt Regis' fingers as a gift on his flight to Calimport.</p>
<p>The big question for me is, is Artemis Entreri Lawful or Neutral? I would think Neutral considering some of his later behaviour, but Lawful due to his personality traits, such as the perfection of fighting, although that begins to take a back seat later in the novels as he becomes less self-absorbed.</p>
<p>After the Legacy and Starless night however, I think an alignment change begins to take effect.</p>
<p>I just remember reading somewhere about the alignments, (possibly the DnD manual) that Good actively promotes helping others whom they don't know. Neutral helps only family or people of importance to them. Evil helps only themselves or those who will be useful to themselves.</p>
<p>One last thing, I believe Entreri's Classes are all screwed up, he should never have a lvl in Assassin, even though he was one. It simply doesn't follow canon with his abilities. Ranger1/Fighter10/Rogue6/Shadowdancer1 would cover all his current abilities canon-wise to the end of the most recent novel. IMO Kau-12 00:12, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I feel this quote should be removed from Artemis' entry. Yes, it is a quote by Artemis, but it doesn't give an example of his character or personality.

<p>I don't want to get into an edit war, so I am bring it here. Currently, there is an issue with Psionicist vs. Psion in history. Psionicist was the proper name under 2nd edition AD&amp;D. Under 3.0 and 3.5 D&amp;D, the name was retroactively changed to psion.

<p>A quick search on Google about Psion doesn't show much D&amp;D related content. It may be as you say, but I have not heard of this term yet, and so do most readers. It is really that important that you use the term here in this artemis entreri article&#160;? 3.0 or not many readers knew Artemis Entreri from novel, and the drow was not refered to by that term.</p>

<dd>There already is a <a href="../../../p/s/i/Psion_%28Dungeons_%26_Dragons%29_6c42.html" title="Psion (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)">Psion</a> article. In fact, <a href="../../../p/s/i/Psionicist.html" title="Psionicist">Psionicist</a> redirects to it. None of it my doing, mind you. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurlo_Lomon_530b.html" title="User:Turlo Lomon">Turlo Lomon</a> 08:45, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We have already set a precendent of going by the written rules over the novels, specifically his alignment. I am not dead set on keeping it one way or another, but your words specifically stated we had to use the official alignment. Is using the official class name not the same? <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurlo_Lomon_530b.html" title="User:Turlo Lomon">Turlo Lomon</a> 08:54, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
