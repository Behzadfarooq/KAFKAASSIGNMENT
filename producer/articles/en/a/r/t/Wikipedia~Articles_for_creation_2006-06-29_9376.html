The National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies (NICET) is an organization that was established to create a recognized registration for technicians and technologist within the United States. The National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) developed the certification program because they oppose legal recognition of technologist by the United States government. The NSPE has developed this alternate private program to control the criteria for Technologist registration.</p>
<p>The private control of technologist registration has led to a loss of credibility for registered professionals. The Technologist title from NICET is controversial because it doesn't require an examination for registration. The registration only requires that an individual graduate from a university that is ABET/TAC accredited.</p>
<p>NICET excludes Technologist registration for individuals who graduated from applied science programs or those who obtained valid education from other universities recognized by CHEA or the US Department of Education. Open registration concepts that may rely on examinations and/or experiential qualifications would improve the acceptance of the NICET certifications.</p>
<p>Some program accreditations that are excluded from the NICET program are the Distance Education Training Council (DETC), the National Association of Industrial Technologist (NAIT), the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of Technologies (ACCSCT), or other non-ABET institutions that are only regionally accredited.</p>
<p>NICET recognition is not well known or accepted by employers. The Technologist term is an unknown commodity within the United States and it is not clearly understood by employers. Usually, a Technologist is required to have a Bachelors Degree. Employers and Engineers incorrectly determine that Technologists are inferior graduates because they lack training in design issues. This conclusion is inaccurate because a Technologist curriculum may focus on other specialized issues such as technical management, process, or production improvements. In many cases, a technologist maybe better suited to fill a position than a design engineer. A technologist is trained for applied engineering applications.</p>

<p>Here is a name to always bear in mind, the name Joseph Matar. Here also is a lifetime of achievement, a masterpiece in itself.</p>
<p>Artist Joseph Matar is a great humanist, born of the piercing sun and glowing luminosity of the Orient. He is a poet and creative spirit, matured in the universities, workshops and museums of Europe, of Spain, of France and of Italy. His is the eastern soul out to conquer the genius of the West, a human flame with mystic roots in the divine.</p>
<p>Creative artist, theorist and technician, free of all burden of system, he seeks to express himself in light! To him blind chance and obscurity are repugnant. On every canvas, the interplay of line, colour and volume falls into place of hard struggle, like the victory of a strategist or like some great symphony! Here is "a nest of verdure where a house rings out a melody" and there is a whole village rapt in contemplation of the sea. Beyond stands a vigorous tree that offers the bounty of its fruit. In yet another place one sees an immense sun beating down on the plain, a family around a newborn babe, or the golden glory of an ascending crowd.</p>
<p>Joseph Matar is a master of many artistic fields and pictorial techniques portraiture, anatomy, landscape and history, and above all sacred art brought to life with a new inspiration. He is master of many media, oils, water-color, pastels, ink and pencil...</p>
<p>When he welcomes you at Eddé-Byblos, you feel yourself in the studio of some great figure of the Renaissance, abounding in creative energy. An experience awaits you that will leave its imprint in the depths of your psyche.

Joe McNally was born on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_4.html" title="August 4">August 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> at 5:43 at Christ Hospital. His parents name are Julie Mary McNally [Memmemsheimer] and Michael Patrick McNally. He has A younger sister Holly [[[December 25]], <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>] and an older brother Nick [[[April 24]], <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>]. He enrolled at St. Cajetan school. Joe enjoyed playing games at a small feild near his house with his neighbors who were much older in age so Joe was reaping alot of benefits. Joe was always willing to play no matter against who so he became very good. Joes best sport was football in fourth grade signed up. He didnt expect to play much because there were 2 grades older then him but joe went to practice every day anyway. Joe impressed alot of coaches as he gave it his all day in and day out. Luckily there are the b-games [games that the boys who dont get into the regular games play in] Joe played extemly hard in those games and was very impressive. He played running back[full time] and linebacker[fulltime] Joe also played special teams. In a few games Joe would sub as db. Until their second string rb was kicked off for grades as he had to step up to the plate as a 4ht grader. Joe was on kickoff return he got the ball kicked to him on the start of the second half. He knew he could impress every body andhe took his chances and broke a 53 yard return. In 5th grade Joe was a both way starter defense he played DB and on offense he played WR and again started on special teams. He scored 3 tds that year and had 2 interceptions. And finally in 6th came Joes year he was the rb Joe was head captian. He scored an oustanding 12 tds in the regular season [most of his teams tds] He had finally led the Warriors back to the playoffs for the first time in 14 years.But that wasnt enogh for Joe he scored 4 tds in 2 games against the 2 best defenses [he scored 4 of the six playoff tds] The Warriors laost in the championship. And thats were the story stops for now. As for Joe people look for him to make it to the NFL but Joe just wants be what God Has planned for him.</p>

<p><b>Victims of Circumstance</b> was formed in the fall of 2005 by guitarist and vocalist M. Smyth and drummer Glenn Stewart. The duo met while working for a telemarketing company in Clearwater, Florida and, through a mutual love for music and a growing dissatisfaction with their office jobs, decided to start a band. The earliest days found VOC practicing in the office after hours.</p>
<p>The band quickly added bassist Brandon Vola who, prior to joining, did not own a bass and had never played. The trio was completed by October of that year and played their first show, without the newly added bassist (who could not be located) on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_11.html" title="December 11">11 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.</p>
<p>The first release, which has seen limited distribution, was recorded at Paradise Acres Studios in Largo, Florida during the spring of 2006 and released on Financial Records.</p>
<p>In June 2006, VOC announced that they had begun work on their first full length album.</p>

<p>The first mechanical pumping station on the Somerset Levels was built in 1830 to drain the area around Westonzoyland, Middlezoy and Othery. The success of the drainage system led to the formation of other drainage boards and the construction of other pumping stations. The pump at Westonzoyland originally comprised a beam engine and scoop wheel (like a water wheel running backwards), however after 25 years there were problems pumping the water away due to the sinking of the land as it dried out and a better method was looked for. Thus in 1861 the present pump was installed. It was made by Easton &amp; Amos and was capable of raising 100 tons of water per minute 6ft from the rhyne (pronounced 'reen') into the River Parrett. The pump operated until 1951, by which time the local drainage system had been linked into Kings Sedgemoor Drain which discharged further down the Parrett. As a result the water levels dropped and the pump was unable to draw the water from the rhyne. During times of heavy rainfall, when additional pumping might be needed, the Environment Agency maintain a diesel pumping station next door with a capacity of 50 tons per minute. In 1976 members of Somerset Industrial Archeology Society began restoration of the site, including digging out tons of mud which had buried the bottom of the pump. The Westonzoyland Engine Trust was formed and in 1990 they bought the site from the owners Wessex Water. A collection of steam and diesel engines with connections either to the area or to pumping have been assembled on site and regular steam days are held.</p>

<p>Background</p>
<p>Ahmed Zaoui was a university lecturer and Imam (religious leader), well respected in his community in the country of Algeria. In 1991 he won a seat in the first round of democratic elections as an FIS candidate for the district of Tipaza. In January of 1992 the military stepped in canceling the elections and taking control of the country. The situation eventually meant that Mr. Zaoui was forced to leave Algeria in 1993, fearing for his safety. He took refuge in a number of countries, including France, Belgium and Switzerland. In these countries he was dogged by allegations that almost certainly originate from the military regime in Algeria, who are determined to remove threat legitimate politicians pose to their rule. Mr. Zaoui was put on trial in France and Belgium, read Michael McColgan's report on the outcome of the French trial, and read from paragraph 175 of the RSAA report for a detailed outline of the Belgium trial</p>
<p><br />
While he is in Europe, Mr. Zaoui was sentenced in absentia by the military regime in Algeria. The systems of trials and human rights abuse operating in Algeria have been widely criticized. The New Zealand Refugee Status Appeal Authority (RSAA) said of the trials: We have reached the conclusion that it would be unsafe to rely on the appellants Algerian convictions as evidence It is these convictions that give Mr. Zaoui a very credible reason to fear returning to Algeria.</p>
<p>Mr. Zaoui eventually was deported to Burkina Faso in 1998 by a Swiss Federal Decree where. He stayed until 2000 when he moved to Malaysia. In 2002, Ali Tounsi, the head National Security in Algeria visited Malaysia. Mr. Zaoui became aware of moves by the Malaysian government to extradite him to Algeria. He then made arrangements to leave. Mr. Zaoui had read of New Zealand's humanitarian response to the Tampa refugees, and decided to go to New Zealand</p>
<p>Ahmed Zaoui arrived in New Zealand on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_4.html" title="December 4">4 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>. He approached a police officer at the airport and requested asylum. He was taken to the Immigration Service airport office and interviewed with an Arabic interpreter. Later in the evening he was questioned by a customs officer where it was alleged he admitted to being a member of the GIA. To understand how dubious this admission is, read from paragraph 917 of the RSAA decision.</p>
<p>Mr. Zaoui was transferred to Paremoremo prison. His initial refugee status appeal was declined, and he appealed to the Refugee Status Appeal Authority. 8 months later, after a 5 week hearing, the RSAA granted Mr. Zaoui refugee status on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_1.html" title="August 1">1 August</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. The report also cleared Mr. Zaoui of any links to armed or terrorist groups.</p>
<p>Since Dec of 2002 Mr. Zaoui has waited in prison. For the first 10 months, in solitary at Paremoremo. Despite being granted refugee status, Mr. Zaoui remains imprisoned on the bases of a Security Risk Certificate issued by the NZ Security Intelligence Service. Mr Zaoui's lawyers have won the right to a summary of the information contained in the Security Risk Certificate. Although this summary contains almost no new information, and nothing of substance, Ahmed Zaoui remained imprisoned.</p>
<p>In October 2003, Mr. Zaoui was moved to the Auckland Central Remand Prison, he remained there until December 2004 when he was released on bail into the care of the Dominican Friars following a decision by NZ's new Supreme Court.</p>

Brendan Lawley (Born 18/9/88) is an attacking midfielder for Albury Wodonga Football Association club Benalla Rovers. The livewire forward recently sent shivers through the defence of league leaders Myrtleford when he made his first substitute seniors performance in a league match. Touted as a future Melbourne Victory player in the Australian premier football competition, the A-League, Lawley is an exciting prospect for the future and likely replacement for the outgoing Harry Kewell in the Socceroos.</p>

<p>The Lyman School for Boys was established by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts about 1886 and was closed in 1971. It was the first reform school, or training school in the country, replacing the State Reform School near the same site, which was opened in 1846. The school was named for its principle benefactor, Theodore Lyman who had been a mayor of Boston in 1834 and one of the founders of the Waltham Watch and Clock Company.</p>
<p>Lyman School was situated near Lake Chauncey in the town of Westborough, on Power Hill, off State Route 9. It comprised about one thousand acres of which about five hundred were prime farmland, maintained by its students. The farm remained a principle means of support for the school until about 1955 when the agricultural nature of the region changed to a more industrial composition. At that time, training of the students was also changed to reflect these changes.</p>
<p>Students were sent to the Lyman School when the courts had determined that it would be in the public interest. Until about 1970, juveniles in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts were afforded none of the (now) commonly accepted Constitutional rights. Therefore, many boys were sent to this reform school for “crimes” such as truancy and being a stubborn child. In fact, the laws in the Commonwealth even allowed stubborn children to be put to death (<a href="http://www.infanticide.org/history.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.infanticide.org/history.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.infanticide.org/history.htm</a>). Several famous criminals attended the Lyman School, one of them being the Boston strangler, Albert DeSalvo, (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_strangler" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_strangler" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_strangler</a>). However, most of the students were just ordinary boys who came broadside against the corrupt Massachusetts juvenile court system where such children were not allowed to have trials or to exercise other constitutionally protected rights.</p>
<p>Students at the school were subjected to strict discipline. They were required to conform at all times to some strict rules that were enforced with corporal punishment. Students lived in so-called cottages. These were monstrous brick buildings that provided shelter for three to four hundred boys in each cottage. The top floor of each cottage comprised a dormitory and the lower floors, the living space. Each cottage was ruled by a cottage master and usually a cottage matron. This husband and wife team lived in a cottage apartment and was on duty twenty-four hours a day. In the late nineteen-fifties, it became difficult to find such cottage parents, willing to work such long hours, so several changes were made.</p>
<p>Pictures and information about this school are currently being maintained by Dick Bolt in (<a href="http://freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~history/grafton/LymanSchool.html" class="external free" title="http://freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~history/grafton/LymanSchool.html" rel="nofollow">http://freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~history/grafton/LymanSchool.html</a>). There are two authors known to have attended the Lyman School and lived to write about it. They are Mark D. Devlin, the author of <i>Stubborn Child</i>, (<a href="http://www.blogofdeath.com/archives/001357.html" class="external free" title="http://www.blogofdeath.com/archives/001357.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogofdeath.com/archives/001357.html</a>), who recently died, and Richard B. Johnson, author of <i>Abominable Firebug</i>, who writes considerable details about students’ daily activity at the school. His webpage is (<a href="http://www.AbominableFirebug.com" class="external free" title="http://www.AbominableFirebug.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.AbominableFirebug.com</a>).</p>
<p>The Lyman School was a nearly complete town in itself. It looked like a college campus. All of the maintenance, construction, and repair of the facilities were performed by its students. They were supervised by trade masters. A student attending Lyman School would learn a trade whether he wanted to or not. It was not optional. The trades taught were grounds-keeping, laundry, cooking and other cafeteria skills, carpentry, painting, masonry, janitor work, electrical work, plumbing and steam-fitting, boiler maintenance, and printing. The entire official printed documents of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and all the government stationery, was printed in the Lyman School print shop.</p>
<p>The Lyman School for Boys had a rather spotted history ranging from its nearly complete destruction by arson in its early years to runaways who were never caught nor heard from again. Institutional folk lore had it that missing runaways were not runaways at all, but children killed by the cottage or trade masters, with their bodies buried in the swamps behind the hill.</p>
<p>Approximately three hundred boys “graduated” from the Lyman School for boys every year. This means that, on the average, forty-five-thousand boys went through this institution. At least ten percent or about forty-five hundred should still be living in 2006. The public usually hears only about its failures as in the case of the Boston strangler, not its successes. This makes it difficult to determine the correctness or effectiveness of such institutions.</p>
<p>During the administration of Governor Peabody (1962-1965), various trade unions started complaining that maintenance of state owned buildings at the Lyman School was being performed by non-union labor. If the trade unions were to have their way, the cost to the Commonwealth to maintain each student at the institution would increase from about five thousand to fifty thousand dollars per year. This and other events led to Lyman School’s closure in 1971.</p>

<p>Dursun Karatas</p>
<p>Dursun Karataş is the founder and leader of the DHKP-C (Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front). He was born in Elazig. Dursun Karataş is of Kurdish ethnicity.</p>
<p>Dursun Karataş first became a sympathiser of revolutionary views from the beginning of the 1970s following his enrolment into the Istanbul University Forestry Faculty. He was influenced by THKP-C, which was lead by Mahir Çayan. He first became involved in Devrimci Gençlik (which is THKP-C’s youth branch) activities from 1972.</p>
<p>Dursun Karataş was detained by the Turkish Authorities in 1974 in Elazig for a short time whilst writing “Free Cyprus” slogans on the walls as part of the protest campaign against Turkey’s invasion of Cyprus, along with Niyazi Aydin, who later became a central committee member of Devrimci Sol.</p>
<p>Dursun Karataş was a founder of IYOKD (Istanbul Higher Education Students Cultural Association) in 1974. Since 1975 he became a leading figure among the revolutionary university students in Istanbul.</p>
<p>Devrimci Yol (DEV-YOL) was formed in 1977 by Devrimci Gençlik (DEV-GENC) followers, and Dursun Karataş became the head of Devrimci Yol in Istanbul. He later formed the Devrimci Sol (DEV-SOL) in 1978 as a splinter group from Devrimci Yol.</p>
<p>Dursun Karataş was arrested by the Turkish authorities in 1980 and sentenced to life imprisonment. However, he escaped on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_25.html" title="October 25">25 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> and went underground.</p>
<p>On the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_13.html" title="September 13">13 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, he was arrested in his house by a group called “Darbeciler” (Coupers). This group was lead by Bedri Yagan. He was held for about three months. He managed to escape with the help of Arslan Tayfun Özkok who is currently believed to be in the central committee of DHKP-C. Karataş later expelled his captors from the organisation. This expelled group later formed THKP-C Devrimci Sol, hostile to main organisation of Devrimci Sol (DHKP-C). On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_30.html" title="March 30">30 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, Devrimci Sol lead by Dursun Karataş, established DHKP-C (Revolutionary People's Liberation Party). He was elected as the Secretary-general of the DHKP-C.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_9.html" title="September 9">9 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, Dursun Karataş was arrested again, this time in France after being caught travelling on a false passport. Despite Turkish extradition requests, Dursun Karataş was tried in the French Courts for his involvement in attacks on French citizens during the 1991 Gulf War. Due to the massive international pressure, Dursun Karataş is released on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_26.html" title="January 26">26 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, in Paris according to the "procedure Judiciaire”. This meant that he had to report to the police and that his freedom is limited. Dursun Karataş escaped this "monitoring", causing considerable aggravation between Çiller's regime and France. The French State Security claimed that Dursun Karataş was helped by, among others, an unidentified woman. Although Dursun Karataş was instructed not to leave France, he predictably escaped the country and has been on the run ever since.</p>
<p>In February 2006, a Belgian court convicted several DHKP-C members of crimes related to terrorism and sentenced them to jail terms of 4-6 years. Dursun Karataş was amongst those charged, and was sentenced in absentia to five years imprisonment. Despite being in hiding, Dursun Karataş is thought to maintain a leadership role with the DHKP-C and is believed to be living somewhere in either the Netherlands or Belgium.</p>

<p>The <i>Fire Knife Dance</i>, <i>Fire Stick Dance</i> or <i>Fire Dance</i> is a popular dance spectacle renowned for the dancers agility and skill in spinning and twirling a <i>Fire stick</i> or <i>Fire Knife</i> which is torched at both ends around the dancers body while dancing. The modern Fire Dance has its origins in the traditional Dances of Samoa namely the <i>ailao</i>(Samoan knife Dance) or <i>ailao afi</i>(Samoan Fire Knife Dance). These Dances were performed using the ceremonial <i>war knife</i> of Samoa called the <i>Nifo oti</i>(tooth of death/war)</p>
<p>Apprentice warriors would develope there skills through dance, and over time be able to use the Samoan war knife as a singular or dual wielding weapon. A Dancers skill is often exhibited by the speed at which the sticks or knives are handled. For the elite, this dance is done with a stick or knife in each hand with each knife kept in perpetual motion while performing.</p>
<p>The movements in these ancient dances have evolved to become the modern Fire knife Dance of today, where the knives are often replaced with double sided torches.</p>
<p>The ceremonial war knife is also used in other traditional Samoan dances where the <i>ceremonial maiden</i> or <i>taupou</i> incorporates the <i>Nifo Oti</i> with the same perpetual motion of the <i>ailao</i>, but done more to showcase elegance and grace as opposed to speed and skill.</p>

<p>Rob Maclean is a football commentator and presenter formerly of BBC Scotland but now Setanta Sports. He gives commentary to Setanta (which is duly used in ITV's highlights) on one of Saturday's SPL games however a lack of passion in such commentaries is somewhat normal as Rob does not attend the game, simply give commentary in a studio rom. Rob is the presenter of Setanta's flagship program 'SPL Live' each Sunday afternoon, featuring the two o'clock kick-off (although this kick-off time is influenced by Setanta.) Rob is highly professional, and since his departure from BBC Scotland <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Mitchell_%28broadcaster%29_5171.html" title="Paul Mitchell (broadcaster)">Paul Mitchell</a> has replaced him as major commentator and Rob's Saturday Lunchtime preview show has been axed.</p>

<p>Wedlock is great movie full of action and comedy. Rutger is great as a thief who escapes from this futuristic prison, where convicts must wear exploding collars. Too cool! Trust me, you must see this one. Dusan Leon-Citic saw this movie</p>

<p><br />
Reuben Singh is a British born entrepreneur from <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester%2C_UK_3212.html" title="Manchester, UK">Manchester, UK</a>.</p>
<p>Coming from a wealthy family who ran a large Manchester wholesaler, <i>Sabco</i>, he founded his first company in the mid 1990s whilst still at school. <i>Miss Attitude</i>, a shop which sold girl's accessories (such as hair clips, cosmetics, and scrunchies), opened in 1995 in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_Arndale_Centre_9b17.html" title="Manchester Arndale Centre">Manchester Arndale Centre</a>.</p>
<p>Almost overnight, dozens of stores opened up across the UK, and Reuben was regularly in the press with stories of his success. Early reports cited his wealth at around £10 million, all this while he was studying for his A-Levels at <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hulme%27s_Grammar_School_11ca.html" title="William Hulme's Grammar School">William Hulme's Grammar School</a> in Manchester.</p>
<p>In 1999, he launched the website and brand <i>alldaypa.com</i>, a virtual PA / secretary service. This was initially a great success although latterly entered financial troubles whereby the company was bailed out by Reuben's parents who held a stake in the company.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1998, he entered the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_Book_of_Records_2093.html" title="Guinness Book of Records">Guinness Book of Records</a> as the world's youngest self-made millionaire. He was later removed because the extent of his wealth could not be verfied. Reports of his assets vary enormously..</li>
<li>In 1999, Miss Attitude was sold for a reported £22 million pounds.</li>
<li>He claims his parents gave him a £50,000 BMW for his 18th birthday but gave it back as he wanted to be a success on his own.</li>
<li>His portrait hangs in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Portrait_Gallery_e332.html" title="National Portrait Gallery">National Portrait Gallery</a>.</li>
<li>He owns the only banana-yellow <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bentley_Continental_eaaf.html" title="Bentley Continental">Bentley Continental</a> in the world, which reportedly £270,000.</li>
<li>He is a devout follower of the <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikh.html" title="Sikh">Sikh</a> faith and is notable for his turban and beard.</li>
<li>He was recently sued by the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Bank_of_Scotland_299b.html" title="Royal Bank of Scotland">Royal Bank of Scotland</a>. Judge Michael Kershaw QC ordered Singh to pay the bank £1,229,966 for an overdraft they claimed was secured under false pretenses.</li>

<p>The long wait is over and now we are into the Quater-Final stage of the <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_world_cup_7f3c.html" title="FIFA world cup">FIFA world cup</a> soccer tournament where only the creme de la creme remains. We are going to analyze this tournament under several heads as the information is quite vast.</p>

<p>1. Netherlands's loss to Portugal: Netherlands, the best team never to have won the world cup fell prey to Scolari's techniques and got out quite early. Surely they did not deserve to be champions this time but their presense would have made the last 8 stage much more enticing. 2. Spain's ouster: Spain might well have been the favourites against France owing to their current form but France's victory was no surprise. After their victory over Spain, they have emerged as true contenders for the title. But what makes Spanish ouster painful is that they are a much more exciting team than either England, Portugal or Ukraine - both of whom have booked their place in the last 8 due to a favorable draw.</p>

<p>QF 1: Germany wins against Argentina 2-1 (The host factor will come into play. Argentina is clearly the better team but Latin American teams have never won world cup in Europe.) QF 2: Italy beat Ukraine 2-0 (Despite having a suspension and a few yellow cards, Italy start as favorites against a side that was in danger of being thrown out in the group stage itself.) QF 3: England vr. Portugal: It is difficult to guess the outcome of the match. Both teams are the weakest teams remaining in the World Cup. My guess is match will stretch out to penalties where England has the edge. QF 4: France bt. Brazil 2-1: The WC 1998 final revisited can throw similar result.</p>
<p>Hence the semi-finals are: SF 1: Germany vr. Italy (1-2) SF 2: France vr. England/Portugal (1-0)</p>
<p>In the first semi-finals, Germany start as favorites but Italy might well pull it off. My guess is 2-1 score-line in favor of Italy via extra-time.</p>
<p>In the second one France are hands-down favorite and I places my bets on a 1-0 victory for them.</p>
<p>Hence the final will be Italy vr. France. Here I guess, Italy can very well win their 4th WC and France their 2nd one. My bets are France will win 1-0.</p>

<p>1978+1986 = 3954 (Argentina) 1974+1990 = 3954 (Germany) 1970+1994 = 3954 (Brazil) 1966+1998 = 3954 (England/France - Hosts) 1962+2002 = 3954 (Brazil) 1958+2006 = 3954 (Brazil Again) As you can see, the numerology predictions favor Brazil. And in the next world cup in South Africa in 2010, Germany can very well emerge victorious.</p>
<p>The second prediction that favors Italy is based on the fact that Italy's campaign tis year appears quite similar to 1982, when they were haunted by match-fixing and drew with Peru 1-1 with one player sent off (their match with US ended in a draw 1-1).</p>

<p>The current scenario is: - 1. Miroslav Klose - 4 goals 2. Hernan Crespo - 3 goals 3. Ronaldo - 3 goals 4. Lukas Podolski - 3 goals 5. Maxi Rodriguez - 3 goals</p>
<p>Miroslav Klose almost never scores against top teams. His chances of scoring another goal are minimal. Ronalso's chances are also close to zero as he will find it difficult to score against France. That leaves us with Podolski and I think he can score 2 more goals in this WC emerging as the Golden boot winner. So, my bet is Podolski.</p>

<p>Patrick Viera is surely going to have his day. No other player has created such a great impression as he has. He single handedly guided France into the second round. Then he was the main force behind France beating Spain. I only hope he does not get another yellow card before final. Viera is both France's playmaker and goal-scorer.</p>

<p>WC is a very cruel event. Everyone remembers the winner. Noone the runners-up. We all remember that Brazil has been a revelation. What about Germany. Remember they were runners-up last time. No credits for that. They are one of the favorites only because they are the hosts. Remember how everyone forgot about the Brazil and wen ga-ga over France after 1998 WC final debacle. And the same happened to Italy in 1994, even though Brazil failed to beat them during regulation time in the final.</p>
<p>Still, to change the tradition a bit, I am mentioning top 8 teams on the basis of their performance here. We will continue to remember heroes of 2006. 1. France 2. Italy 3. Brazil 4. Germany 5. Argentina 6. Spaijn 7. Netherlands 8. England/Portugal/Ecuador(revelation of the tournament)</p>

<p><b>AMG International</b> (Advancing the Ministries of the Gospel) is an evangelical, worldwide missionary and relief organization committed to delivering the Good News to those who have yet to hear it, through innovative strategies and responsible stewardship.</p>
<p>From the day of his arrival in the USA in 1946, Dr. Spiros Zodhiates served the Lord with great enthusiasm and resolve. Under his leadership, what is now AMG International grew from a one-room office in New York City to a worldwide outreach. What began as a publishing ministry for Greek people is now a diverse and worldwide missionary and relief organization.</p>
<p>Through the ministries of AMG, multitudes of children have been cared for, many hundreds of national workers have been trained and sponsored in the Gospel ministry, and countless new believers have been introduced to the Good News of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The burden on the heart of Dr. Zodhiates was that every soul be granted one opportunity to understand and respond to the Good News of Jesus Christ. That passion is his legacy and the enduring objective of AMG International to this day.</p>
<p>In pursuit of that objective, AMG worldwide seeks to employ any and every legitimate means as a platform for the Good News. Declaring the Good News is THE reason behind every AMG endeavor.</p>
<p><b>Newspaper Evangelism</b> The daily newspaper is a familiar and trusted source of news. When the Good News appears as paid advertising, printing costs are covered. Distribution is guaranteed. Readership is multiplied many times. The response is extraordinary! AMG sponsors or pays for Gospel ads in 15 countries.</p>
<p><b>National workers</b> AMG helps train and equip a corps of strategically placed believers that are eager to bear witness to the Gospel in their own homelands. AMG helps underwrite the ministries of over 400 national workers, church planters and Bible School students in 20 countries.</p>
<p><b>International Media</b> AMG International broadcasts the Good News daily through regular radio programs in Indonesia and on the only Christian radio station broadcasting directly to the island of Cyprus.</p>
<p><b>Childcare</b> Through caring, feeding and instructing of children who might otherwise languish in poverty, the Gospel gains an entrance into entire families. AMG International serves the needs of children and families through 77 childcare centers and sponsorship of over 5,300 children in 14 countries.</p>
<p><b>Medical Ministry</b> AMG International delivers the Good News of God’s loving care to the needy through medical clinics in Guatemala, Uganda and India. AMG also operates the ministry-based St. Luke’s Hospital in the Biblical city of Thessalonica, and serving Northern Greece and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p><b>Mission Adventures</b> A short-term ministry trip will widen one’s vision of the larger world and of the Good News as mankind’s only real hope. AMG International Mission Adventures teams have ministered in 10 nations and at the 2004 and 2006 Olympic games.</p>
<p><b>Career Missionaries</b> Career missionary service can include relief work, church planting, youth work, evangelism, and prison ministry. AMG oversees and helps underwrite the ministries of 70 career missionaries in 12 countries.</p>
<p><b>AMG Publishers</b> Publishing and distributing Biblically sound books and materials in the interest of promoting discipleship and growth in the body of Christ.</p>
<p><b>Pulpit Helps</b> Pulpit Helps Magazine and Online is a ministry resource for those called to preach and teach God's Word.</p>
<p><b>Estate Design</b> AMG International can assist your planning to provide for your future and for the future of the ministries God has placed on your heart.</p>

<p>Bus encryption is the use of encrypted program instructions on a data bus in a computer that includes a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secure_cryptoprocessor.html" title="Secure cryptoprocessor">Secure cryptoprocessor</a> for executing the encrypted instructions. Bus encryption is used primarily in electronic systems that require high security, such as <a href="../../../a/t/m/ATM_292f.html" title="ATM">ATMs</a>, TV <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set-top_box.html" title="Set-top box">Set-top boxes</a>, and secure data communication devices such as digital police radios. Bus encryption should be distinguished from encrypted data transmission which does not require input of encrypted instructions.</p>
<p>The need for bus encryption arises when countless technicians have access to internal circuitry of electronic systems, either because they service and repair such systems, stock spare components for the systems, own the system, steal the system, or find a lost or abandoned system, under battlefield conditions for example. It is not only necessary to prevent tampering of encrypted instructions that may be easily discovered on a data bus or during data transmission, but also to prevent discovery of decrypted instructions that may reveal security weaknesses that an intruder can exploit.</p>
<p>In TV set-top boxes, it is necessary to download program instructions periodically to customer's units, to provide new features and to fix bugs. These new instructions are encrypted before transmission, but must also remain secure on a data bus and during execution. This can be accomplished by secure cryptoprocessors that read encrypted instructions on the data bus from external non-volatile data memory, decrypt the instructions in the cryptoprocessor, and execute the instructions in the same cryptoprocessor.</p>

<p>Dr. David Henry Lewis, sailor, adventurer, medical doctor, and Polynesian scholar, is probably most well known for his studies of the traditional systems of navigation used by the Pacific Islanders. His studies, published in the book “We, The Navigators”, made these navigational methods known to a wide audience and helped to inspire a revival of traditional voyaging methods in the South Pacific.</p>
<p><br />
Lewis was born in England and raised in New Zealand and Rarotonga. He was sent to the Polynesian school in Rarotonga, where he apparently developed his appreciation for Polynesian identity and culture. He remained a New Zealander throughout his life.</p>
<p><br />
After an adventurous childhood and teenage years including mountaineering and skiing in New Zealand, and a multi-hundred mile kayak journey, he traveled to England in 1938 for medical training, and served in the British army as a medical officer. After the war, he worked as a doctor in London, and was involved in setting up the National Health Service.</p>
<p><br />
With the announcement in 1960 of the first single-handed trans-Atlantic yacht race (from Plymouth, UK to the US East Coast), Lewis decided to enter in a small 25-foot boat. Following a series of accidents, including a dismasting shortly after leaving, he finished third (Francis Chichester came first), as described in his book <i>The Ship Would Not Travel Due West</i>.</p>
<p><br />
He later decided to sail around the world with his second wife and two small daughters, and built the ocean cruising catamaran Rehu Moana, for this purpose. After an initial voyage towards Greenland, he entered the 1964 single-handed trans-Atlantic race and picked up his family in the United States. They circumnavigated by way of the Strait of Magellan, the South Pacific and the Cape of Good Hope. (See his book <i>Daughters of the Wind</i>.) This was the world’s first circumnavigation by multihull.</p>
<p><br />
Following his longstanding interest in old navigational methods used to explore and populate the Pacific, he employed similar techniques for the Tahiti-New Zealand leg of the Rehu Moana voyage without using a compass, sextant or chronometer.</p>
<p><br />
In 1967, Lewis acquired another boat, Isbjorn, to embark on further field studies of traditional Polynesian navigation. With a research grant from the Australian National University and with his second wife, two daughters and 19-year-old son, he set out for the Pacific again to study traditional navigation techniques. While there, he met and was welcomed into the cultures of various Pacific Islanders, who taught him their navigational lore, heretofore largely unrecognized by those outside Polynesia. Lewis chronicled this voyage and research in various articles and in his books <i>We, the Navigators</i> and <i>The Voyaging Stars</i>. Lewis’ voyages and resulting books gave inspiration to the revival in traditional Polynesian canoe building and voyaging, which was essentially extinct in many parts of the Pacific.</p>
<p><br />
Lewis’ next adventure was an attempt at circumnavigating the Antarctic continent single-handed. For this he acquired a small steel yacht, named Ice Bird. Facing treacherous conditions in the Southern Ocean after departing, Lewis was not heard from for 13 weeks but –incredibly-- frostbitten and exhausted, sailed Ice Bird to the Antarctic Peninsula under a jury rig after dismasting. He repaired the vessel in Antarctica and left again to complete the voyage, but was capsized again and eventually brought the boat to Cape Town, South Africa. This is described in his bestseller book, <i>Ice Bird</i>.</p>
<p><br />
After the Ice Bird voyage, Lewis was involved in setting up the Oceanic Research Foundation with the aim of sending private expeditions to the Antarctic. In a converted fishing vessel with a number of crew, Lewis made a summer expedition to Antarctica and wintered over there. Lewis spent some of his later years conducting research into traditional navigation techniques of the Inuit on the Bering Strait region.</p>
<p><br />
Following this, he retired to New Zealand to write his autobiography, <i>Shapes on the Wind</i>. It was said of Lewis in one obituary that he “always brought his crews home intact. He was a typical Polynesian sailor, getting into trouble through haste and neglect, then, with near superhuman courage and seamanship, fighting his way out of it.”</p>
<p><br />
In recognition of his various academic, adventure, sailing and anthropological endeavors, and he was made a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.</p>

<p>Raymond Lindeman (1915-1942)</p>
<p>Lindeman completed his PhD at the University of Minnesota. While a post-doc at Yale with G. Evelyn Hutchinson, Lindeman submitted a chapter of his thesis for publication in the journal Ecology. His manuscript was initially rejectef for its generalisations. After his death in June 1942, his manuscript was published in Ecology and it has become a seminal work in ecology and limnology.</p>

<p>Cressbrook is a village in the Peak District National Park in Derbyshire. Prior to the Enclosures Act of 1762 Cressbrook did not exist but later grew up around a mill complex built here on the River Wye, first by Richard Arkwright and then later by his son Richard, JL Philips and Brother Cotton Spinners and McConnel and Company.</p>
<p>Prior to the McConnel's period of ownership the village did not really exist at all beyond a collection of buildings in the immediate vicinity of the mill. When McConnel's professional workforce objected to the quality of the housing available he took it upon himself to build the model village that has now become Cressbrook. Building commenced in the late 1830s and was later extended by Henry McConnel's daughter, Mary Worthington in 1902 but the village has changed little since this time. Cressbrook Mill went bust in 1965, after which time it changed from being a private mill estate to the public village that it now is.</p>

<p>Lill Lindfors (Born Lillemor Lindfors, on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_12.html" title="May 12">May 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, in Helsniki, <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a>) Is a popular Finnish-Swedish singer.</p>
<p>She participated in the 1966 Eurovision Song Contest allong with Svante Thuresson, for Sweden, with the song "Nygammal vals (Hip Man Svinaherde)" (English Translation: <i>New-Old Waltz (Hip pig breeder)</i>). The song came in 2nd, Udo Jürgens coming in First place.</p>
<p>She was married in 1969 to Director Peter Wester, with whom she had one child. They later divorced in 1973.</p>
<p>She would once again be tied to the Eurovision Song Contest, where in 1985, she hosted the event from Gothenburg, Sweden. In the beginning of the show, she had a "wardrobe malfunction", where her skirt ripped off after passing through a part of the set. After showing she was embarrased, she then pulled the back off her "ripped" dress, and the front, and revealed a long white gown with long sleeves. In interviews after the contest, she said that the whole stunt was planned.</p>

<p>The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus is made up of Ronnie Winter (lead vocals, guitar), Duke Kitchens (guitar, vocals), Elias Reidy (guitar, vocals), Joey Westwood (bass, vocals), and Jon Wilkes (drums, vocals). The band's music includes pop-punk, pop, screamo, and some metal styles. This Florida quintet formed in 2003, facing a long and touch road to getting a record deal. They had done numerous showcases for record labels but remained unsigned until Virgin Records came along. The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus entered the recording studio last year where all the magic took place.

<p>Project Born was a local rap group out of Flint, MI. At the time they were signed to Psychopathic, back in 1994, they were pretty much still kids. According to Violent J's book, Behind The Paint, they used to pick these guys up and give them rides to the studio, by them clothes and shit.</p>
<p>When PJB got signed to Psychopathic, it was on the strength of a demo tape that they had given ICP. The demo was apparently AMAZING, but then...they lost it. So instead of releasing the demo as the album, they had to go into the studio and record a whole new album which, in Psychopathic's opinion...wasn't so awesome.</p>
<p>They released it anyway, and it was Project Born's only Psychopathic release. It was a short EP entitled Born Dead and featured an AWESOME track with ICP as well as one with Esham. The album didn't do so well though and soon thereafter, Project Born was off the record label.</p>
<p>They went on to release a few albums on their own record label, such as Crap of Natural and Jack The Reaper.</p>
<p>In 2000, PJB reunited with Psychopathic for the last time, performing a show at the very first annual Gathering of the Juggalos. That would be the last time Project Born ever associated with Psychopathic. They went on to release another album entitled Rent Is Due as well as Ghetto Celebs Sountrack and to this day, I guess are recording and releasing very unknown underground albums.</p>

<p>Lately when searching for information with Google, more and more Wikipedia articles have been appearing in the result set. Since most of the Wikipedia articles are based on the information found in the other search results, research on most topics can be expedited by requesting Google not to return entries listed at Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Here is one simple example of how to accomplish this, without going to the Google 'Advanced Search' page. Suppose you want to know something about the Greek writer Eubulus, enter this into the Google edit box:</p>
<p>Eubulus -site:*.wikipedia.org</p>
<p>Note that Wikipedia mirrors may still appear, but most of the unwanted material will be gone.</p>

<p>H. H. Gondavalekar Maharaj was named Ganesh by his parents. However, everyone fondly addressed him as ‘Ganu’. One of the main missions of Gondavalekar Maharaj was food-donations and inculcating the love of repeating (chanting*) The Lord’s Name among people. Below are some incidents in Ganu’s life when he was only five years old. Once His grandfather asked Him, “What would you do if you were given a pot of gold?” Five-year-old Ganu instantly replied, “I will distribute it among the beggars, blind, disabled and poor.” Once again His grandfather asked, “What would you do if you became a king?” Ganu’s reply was, “There would be no beggars in my kingdom. There would be a permanent soup kitchen at my palace.” This incident, which took place when Maharaj was just five years old, made everyone around him realize that He was not an ordinary boy but was destined to become a great yogi. An astrologer had predicted that Ganu would grow up to be a spiritual giant and bring honor and glory to His family. Ganu had a fantastic memory. He would need to hear something only once to be able to repeat it word for word. One day, He was unable to sleep at night, hence his grandfather recited a verse (shloka) from the Bhagavat Gita. Maharaj immediately recited the shloka back to his grandfather, much to the surprise of all. When Maharaj was four years old, His grandfather taught him the letters of the alphabet. Maharaj learned them all in one day. Since He was constantly in His grandfathers company, He would do everything that His grandfather did. He would recite the Holy verses of Bhagavat Gita with his grandfather, sing holy songs with him and when His grandfather started dancing out of spiritual emotion (bhav) while singing the holy songs, little Ganu would devotedly join him. At the age of five years, Ganu had his thread ceremony. After this event, He became more introverted. He had over and over heard the stories of Dhruvbal, Bhakta Pralhad and Draupadi. Now he started to seriously think about these stories. One night, Ganu was found missing from His bed. All started frantically searching for Him. He was found near a graveyard, by the riverside, sitting cross-legged in deep meditation inside a small cave. After He was brought home, His grandfather asked Him, “Didn’t the snakes, scorpions and other creatures frighten you?” Ganu replied, “Of course not. Why should one be afraid of them?” This incident showed Ganu’s deep yearning for God-realization, even at the tender age of five.</p>

        Special abilities
</pre>
<p>Symbiotes empower the natural abilities of a host to the point where they far exceed that of normal humans. These abilities include the following:</p>
<p>Super strength Superior speed and agility Provide protection (from guns or other damage) Genetic memory, recalling information from previous hosts. Limited healing ability. The symbiote also reacts to the thoughts and will of the host. When Spider-Man was originally selected, he had been thinking about Spider-Woman's costume in the Secret Wars. The symbiote acted on this and formed a similar costume, the one seen on him and Venom. The following are functions that have been demonstrated from various hosts' wills (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>The ability to transform its mass into clothing The ability to form fangs or simple bladed weapons out of their limbs The ability to mimic the appearance of anyone, or anything The ability to blend with its surroundings. The ability to stick to walls (adopted from Spider-Man) The ability to produce unlimited webbing (from its own mass, adopted from Spider-Man) The ability to bypass Spider-Sense (because the original symbiote was attached to Peter first, it took his genetic information and spider-powers. this means that the symbiote attacking Peter would essentially be Peter attacking himself, which wouldn't set off his Spider-Sense) [edit] Well known symbiotes Here is a complete list of existing symbiotes whom have/had human hosts</p>
<p>Venom has had several hosts: first worn by Spider-Man, who is also the first known human to host a symbiote Eddie Brock Scorpion (current wearer of the Venom Symbiote. Sometimes referred to as "Scorpion-Venom" or "Scorpom") Carnage (worn by Cletus Kasady) Scream (worn by "Donna") Phage, Riot, Lasher, Agony merged to form Hybrid (worn by Scott Washington) She-Venom (Venom symbiote, worn by Anne Weying) She-Venom II (Clone of the Venom symbiote, worn by Communications Specialist Patricia Robertson.) Toxin (symbiotic offspring of Carnage, worn by Patrick Mulligan) The Punisher wore the Venom symbiote in Marvel's "What If" comic series, which is outside regular continuity. There was also an incident where Wolverine wore the Venom symbiote for a brief time (Sometimes referred to as "Wolvenom"). He managed to tear it from his body and fought with it during the series "Venom vs. Wolverine". Wolverine later faced a clone of the Venom symbiote, which briefly merged with him during the "Venom: Run" series. Normie Osborn, the grandson of the original Green Goblin and friend of Spider-Girl, is the current host of the Venom Symbiote in the MC2 Universe. (This character is sometimes referred to as "Goblin-Venom".) [edit] Active and inactive symbiotes The activity of the symbiotes and their hosts vary.</p>
<p>Spider-Man: Active (no longer wearing any symbiote) Venom: Currently in jail. The Venom symbiote's host is now The Scorpion (Mac Gargan), but Eddie Brock may return Carnage: Unknown; The Sentry ripped the Carnage in two, but Cletus Kasady may not have been wearing the suit Scream: Inactive (Last seen alive but status unknown). Hybrid: Inactive She Venom: Deceased: Ann Weying committed suicide She Venom II:Unknown, Venom absorbed Patricia's symbiote and it is likely she is deceased. Toxin: Active [edit] Trivia The majority of the human hosts to the symbiotes are citizens of New York. It happens because Spider-Man (who brought the first Symbiote to Earth) lives there; the symbiote invasion of Earth was also focused on New York. Venom is the oldest of all the introduced symbiotes of the Marvel universe... this makes him highly-prized to the Xenophage, as symbiotes that have been bonded to hosts for long periods of time are considered a delicacy. Hybrid was the first "good" symbiote. Toxin is the first well-known "good" symbiote, and while Venom is referred to as an 'anti-hero', he is generally a villain. The Venom symbiote is the only symbiote to have been worn by both men and women. Normally, the symbiotes in general are worn by men. Carnage surpassed his "father" Venom by being the first symbiote to produce weapons from his limbs. He does not shoot webbing, but strands of tissue. There is some speculation that this is due to the symbiote's gestation on Earth. Venom's symbol on his chest is a Black Widow Spider - one of the world's most dangerous and venomous spiders. Toxin is said to be the most powerful symbiote of them all - having the abilities of both Venom and Carnage combined. Again, this may be due to his gestation on Earth. The Venom symbiote is confirmed to appear in Spider-Man 3. Scream appears as one of the villains in Universal Orlando's Islands of Adventure The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man ride.

<p><br />
Uniting in the astral bands of frequency…where psychological debris, the living speech of the dead, and residual vibrations from a long-gone earth now celestially dwell, SFU emerges as one of the great bands of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Beyond post-modern, beyond post-prophecy, SFU reigns with an electropop palette in tow with a muse’s brush that touches everywhere and everything…Everything that holds us with question and meaning.</p>
<p>Confident in their creations, their encounters, their picaresque adventures amidst the invisible quest for being, they plumb the polarities between soul and psyche, the paranormal, the supernatural, the B-movie, the lusty sultry, the lucid exuberant chants of transcendence, scintillating syncopated metempsychosis and ethereal laments.</p>
<p>They are prolific, they are profound, and they love to sing and dance.</p>
<p><br />
The Uteri:</p>
<p>Mystic Antenna Chick</p>
<p>Possesses the gift of broadened receptors highly sensitive to underground currents. She is able to channel the song of muses, the agony of souls through aquatic nether world vibrations. Greater and lesser powers seek her divine gift for a number of reasons - some spiritual, some for greater power, all seek a life prolonging source of water.</p>
<p><br />
Stif Spring</p>
<p>A star-tongued troubadour found guilty (by Last World Law) for seeking out the forbidden verse of the Shadow Force, re-writing and performing such verse as his own in Andraga-shama Spectacle (a type of schizophrenic ritual performance long ago outlawed as it drives its witnesses insane). For his punishment he is doomed to roam with a dog bark in search of his voice. In the Uterus he seizes it.</p>
<p><br />
DoHo</p>
<p>Last living member of a subterranean survival fleet and Nebulon Transmission Seer. Witnesses The Last Sunrise thus inverting his vision, providing him a glimpse of the SFU (where Mystic Antenna Chick and Stif Spring also appear for one exhilarating instant); he receives instruction from Nebulon on the way to stimulate further transmission to the negative zone frontiers where Sci-Fi Uterus musically ignites in the last rites of space.</p>
<p><br />
History:</p>
<p>It has been said an ancient tablet was once recovered, it\'s message broken, its implications haunting:</p>
<p>“TO LOOK ONTO THE LAST SUNRISE IS TO FIND…”</p>
<p>The message stimulated a profound dread for the world’s outcome and an exuberant sense of horror for what that moment would be like, and for those who would be there for(unquestionably the most spectacular event in this little corner of the universe)…</p>
<p>THE LAST DAY ON EARTH!</p>
<p>DoHo, the only living member of a subterranean survival fleet, surrounded by the last remaining technology on the planet can find no solution for survival, no forecast of the future (his, the earth’s, the universe’s). In frantic desperation to grasp some elemental reality he ascends to the earth’s surface. When the mighty doors fly open he beholds…</p>
<p>THE LAST SUNRISE!</p>
<p>The blistering instant drives him into a swoon, inverting his vision, and giving him the first glimpse of the Sci-Fi Uterus. Two other salient beings (Mystic Antenna Chick and Stif Spring) each in their own outer episodes of search are suddenly drawn into the ring of DoHo’s fantastic glimpse; for an instant there is a collective psychic transmission in a core the likes of a supernova, mutually felt by each trio member. They have seized beauty where it has escaped into nether-dimensional holes. All vanishes as quickly as it came. Mystic Antenna Chick and Stif Spring are expelled to their outer episodes, enchanted nevertheless by the superb illumination they have each experienced. In a hallucinatory mist immediately following the glimpse an equation is given to DoHo from Nebulon to be inputted into the subterranean tech system; when the equation is activated future Nebulon Transmissions will return the trio to the Uterus.</p>
