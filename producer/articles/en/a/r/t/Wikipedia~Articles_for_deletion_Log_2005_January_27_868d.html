<li><b>Comment</b>. At any one time, Chicago has fifty aldermen. Multiply that by the last 150 years, and multiply that by, say, a hundred large US cities. Then add many hundreds of large and important cities around the world, most of whom have alderman, councillors, or the equivalent, and where do we stop? Surely there has to be a limit on this. I haven't thought though what the parameters should be, but I would think this is going to become a growing issue. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowardB_42ca.html" title="User:HowardB">HowardB</a> 12:09, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I sympathize with HowardB here. How many biographies can the Wikipedia have? if we have have one per million people, that is 6,000 just for people currently alive. That sounds too few; there are a lot more important people than that in the history of the world. One biography per 100,000 livers gives you 60,000 biographies, which is starting to sound like too many, but could still be managable. One per 10,000 people gives you 600,000 biographies, which is more than the total number of articles currently in the Wikipedia. So settle for now on one biography for every 100,000 people who have lived. Chicago, being a huge city, gets a few dozen biographies. All this as a kind of rough guideline. Is this guy one of the few dozen most notable people to be associated with Chicago? Alderman for twenty years and Chairman of the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission makes him one in thousand, maybe one in 10,000, but nor more. So: delete. Sorry, Bernie.

<li>At 10 to 9 to delete, it would appear the dividing line between those that think it's unencyclopedic &amp; those that think it is encyclopedic; and those that think this list makes wikipedia a statistical database &amp; those that think it is not.

This information is copied directly from the US Labor Dept statistics. The link is even provided right on the page. Comment 2: The timestamp does not, in my opinion, invalidate the maintenance concerns. The title of this article is not [[2003 list of US states...]]. Even if you did change it, that's not what the articles linking in are trying to find. Comment 3: "200x in film" articles are not actually more volatile than this in the long term. They have more current edits this year but once the year's over, they will become highly stable. This article never will. This is an article which will have to be maintained year in and year out. If no alternative were available, we might have to accept that cost. However, an easy alternative <i>is</i> available - the link to the US Labor Dept report.

<li>So you're saying that there won't be <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_film.html" title="2006 in film">2006 in film</a> to update next year and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_in_film.html" title="2007 in film">2007 in film</a> the year after that.....that these articles just stop? I hadn't heard of the movie industry foreclosing at a definite point in time. I'm also confused as to your using part 3 of the link which says "other source material that are only useful when presented with their original, un-modified wording." Maybe I'm just a dunce here, but are you saying that unemployment rates aren't useful in a modified form? Having just spent no less than 5 minutes trying to find the numbers, I can't possibly see why it shouldn't be desired to have a copy of the numbers of wikipedia. (This is not where I'm a dunce with nearing my 3rd engineering degree and whom I can think of only a hand full of other equal or more computer savvy users. The BLS site is just hard to navigate.) From the linked page on the article, it takes 3 sequential clicks to get to data as displayed in the article. Even then it's preformatted text in a table form. This article improves the readability of the data and sorts it. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 07:44, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The full text of the criterion you cite is "Mere collections of public domain or other source material; such as entire books or source code, original historical documents, letters, laws, proclamations, and other source material that are only useful when presented with their original, un-modified wording. Small or otherwise for the context critical source material, either in text or image form, is needed. (But of course, there's nothing wrong with using public domain resources in order to add factual content and wording to an article -- such as the use of the 1911 encyclopedia)" This rule was certainly not made to exclude every public domain collection of data that can be found elsewhere, but probably to prevent things more suitable for WikiSource from appearing here. For example, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_by_area.html" title="List of countries by area">list of countries by area</a> is pretty much public domain raw data with a few explanatory notes about it, and a version of the same list could easily be found and linked to on some other article, but there is nothing about the subject matter or the data itself that makes it unencyclopedic and no reason to kick it off of Wikipedia. I think the same goes for this article. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 16:38, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: I should have been clearer. If we were, in fact, using the Labor Dept numbers in a modified form or using them as illustration in a larger article, that might be a reason to keep them. However, I do not believe that we are modifying the raw data or even the presentation of the data in any meaningful way. That is, of course, a judgment call and reasonable people can disagree. This page still feels to me like a raw data dump, not what I expect of an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 17:30, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and delete,</b> making appropriate comments on Talk page to preserve GFDL. Look. The Encyclopedia Britannica 11th edition had many long articles; the article on <b>Bible</b> is over one megabyte, for example. The average article length in encyclopedias seems to be in decline. The current Britannica is two-thirds "macropedia" but one-third "micropedia." The World Book, which seems to be directed at a high-school audience, has lots of short articles. Ironically, the fact that Wikipedia is not paper seems to be taken to mean that we have a 32K limit. But there's no reason for Wikipedia to become a nanopedia. Information makes much more sense in context. It's much more likely to get wide review by knowledgeable editors when it is part of a larger article then when it is off by itself. It's much more likely to get treated systematically in relation to other similar pieces of information when they can be seen together.

<li>Disagreed. Biographical articles are not equivalent; there are objective standards of notability that can be applied (though, granted, some subjectivity may come into play with borderline cases). University student unions, however, a topic where notability comes as a <i>group</i>; either they're all legitimately notable or none of them are. If you believe differently, then please, <i>explain</i> to me how you draw the distinction between a notable student union and a non-notable one, because the standard that <i>I</i> see being applied here is "Canadian university = a priori non-notable student union". <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 20:11, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Most of the people voting on this aren't even Canadian. Yes, a few may not be deleted, due to historical significance, but Bearcat is right. This comes down to is the group notable or not.

I'm not Scottish, and this has nothing to do with any lack of respect for Canada as a nation. I don't consider every student union encyclopedic, but would at least consider voting to keep the article on this one if it can be shown to have a relatively long history, previous presidents who have gone on to do something important etc. In the article's present state, I can't tell whether the union is of even the least significance to anybody outside the present student body of the university. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 10:41, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete. Student organizations do not inherently merit articles. The encyclopedic content of this article could be summarized as "St. Thomas University has a Students' Union", a sentence which can be included in the school's page.

<li><i>I</i> created the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Interuniversity_Sport_fb9d.html" title="Canadian Interuniversity Sport">Canadian Interuniversity Sport</a> stubs, because only a few teams in the federation had existing articles. Articles such as <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanier_Cup_aadf.html" title="Vanier Cup">Vanier Cup</a> were linking to a mix of teams with the article already written (eg. <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Gee_Gees_dcd0.html" title="Ottawa Gee Gees">Ottawa Gee Gees</a>), redlinked teams in other cases, and the universities in others, which is inaccurate -- <a href="../../../l/a/v/Laval_University_2331.html" title="Laval University">Laval University</a> did not win the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> Vanier Cup; the <a href="../../../l/a/v/Laval_Rouge-et-Or_7411.html" title="Laval Rouge-et-Or">Laval Rouge-et-Or</a> did.

<li><b>Keep and expand</b>. If some CIAU teams have articles, then there is no reason that all CIAU teams (including the Tommies) should not have articles. However, perhaps the more relevant question has to do with whether the individual CIAU teams should have articles. If there is so little content, then perhaps they should all be contained within a CIAU page or individual university pages. Still, users are likely to create pages and links for other CIAU teams, which will bring us right back to the current situation. We might as well expand the article. --<a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWestendgirl_7150.html" title="User:Westendgirl">Westendgirl</a> 03:00, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't know about Canada, but a lot of American universities are fronts for semi-professional sports teams.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Though it was I who nominated this for VfD, you'll notice that I didn't add '''delete'''. I didn't and don't have any strong desire to see it deleted; I merely listed it here as it's my understanding that surnames <i>usually</i> don't get articles. I'm not qualified to judge the notability of this particular surname, and I'm suspicious about the word "popular", but otherwise I find the article informative and suspect that it's worthwhile. Certainly <i>some</i> surnames should and do get articles: see <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_%28Korean_name%29_6da1.html" title="Kim (Korean name)">Kim (Korean name)</a>. Unfortunately the latter article doesn't tell me what I want to know: <i>why</i> such an enormous percentage of Koreans have this surname -- however, if I wanted to look this up (in English rather than in Korean, which unfortunately I can't read), Wikipedia is where I'd look for it. Meanwhile, Wikipedia welcomes seemingly endless articles about characters in or features of, say, this or that US TV scifi series (attempts at VfD are resisted indignantly), whereas I'd have thought that anyone interested in that material to that degree would find and use the relevant fansite. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:33, 2005 Jan 28 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not fully agreed with your 'vanity remark'. Why? In the design profession it is common to use personal names when referring to their work. This is not for 'getting your credits', but to reflect that designed products or services are often signed by a designer(team) thinking/characteristics. Design work should reflect the unique personality of a designer (imho), and should therefore be associated with him/her. Should you have doubts on my current/future contributions in the field of materials &amp; design, then I understand your 'vote for deletion' and will respect the public voice. I hope you understand that I am contributing to Wikipedia not for 'shameless self promotion', but do this because I value the initiative and its (believe it or not&#160;:) design importance. PS&#160;: how do you manage to get your name/timestamp to your remark? Is this a signature?

I hope that this is enough to save the page, as it is an interesting story and definitely worthy of Wikipedia.

Generally famed for her overuse of words such as 'pesky' or made up words 'fain' and 'pace', she is sure to be remebered by many throughout her travels in Europe, late 2004. Described as many as having a 'great pair of battleships', Gubby has earned a place in the hearts of many a boy in her home of Sheffield, UK."

<li><b>Keep</b> and send to <b>Cleanup</b>. There have been a whole slew of rocket launch site and test range site articles added to Wikipedia within the past month, some of which I've run a first pass over. (I've found, incidentally, that if one sticks a {{geo-stub}} on them (or a more specific stub, if one knows it) they sometimes see improvement. I do wish, though, that the anonymous author would (a) create a user account so that we can find <i>all</i> of the articles in order to tag them, (b) not write in telegraphese, and (c) learn, and apply, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWiki_markup_e587.html" title="Wikipedia:Wiki markup">wiki markup</a>.) Whilst not mainstream, at least these articles are about <i>real places</i> and their reasonably notable uses and histories. (Perhaps I should recommend (d) to the author as well: Disguise your articles to make them appear as if they are about Digimon characters, and then no-one will dare VFD them.) <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:28, 2005 Jan 28 (UTC)</li>

<li>Megan, based upon your voting track record I suspect there are hundreds if not thousands of bands you've never heard of before and will continue not to have heard of until you stumble upon them on Wikipedia. This is never ever a reason to delete something. If something is, as you put, "borderline notable" we are behooved to keep.

<dd>Well, BM has a point there. But looks like WP on some aspects is over-inclusive.

<dd>Please see the project page and project talk page to add to the discussion of what numbers are notable enough for Wikipedia to have articles on them.

Thus, he might have then taken a look at <a href="../../../1/3/0/130_%28number%29.html" title="130 (number)">130 (number)</a> and jotted his observations of the number there. If the section on 134 at 130 grew long enough, then someone could've made the call that the number deserved its own article. This way, people have somewhere to jot down in a common place interesting facts about a number while avoiding the careless creation of number stubs and easing the anxiety of people who wonder if others don't know that numbers are infinite. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimeFan_087d.html" title="User:PrimeFan">PrimeFan</a> 20:41, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The first fifty or so integers are fairly well covered. Certainly, the first ten integers, plus 12, are associated with a goodly amount of human activity. Past that, there is still significant relevance in the areas of mathematics and the sciences. I'm not sure, Jmabel, where that deep sigh is coming from, since (I assume) you're not doing any legwork on this one. It's also worth remembering that while the integers may progress to infinity, there is not a great deal of human relevance to record after the first few hundred, though some powers of two, some prime numbers, and some dates may be of note. As they say, if you build it, they will come, and who's to say that this is a quixotic endeavor? <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 03:23, 2005 Feb 1 (UTC)</li>
