The author has recently re-created the article, citing opinion articles as fact. No original document refers to Alpha Kappa Nu as (a) a fraternity, (b)an entity that was ever formally chartered or incorporated (c) an entity that "lasted several years" as the author states in the article. The author cites as established fact articles that are clearly an expression of opinion, including undergraduate college newspapers articles<a href="http://www.stp.uh.edu/vol69/138/news/news3.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stp.uh.edu/vol69/138/news/news3.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, one of which clearly misquotes its original source (this misquote<a href="http://www.msuspokesman.com/media/storage/paper270/news/2006/02/10/CampusLife/Tribute.A.Brief.History.Of.Black.Collegiate.Fraternities.And.Sororities-1614202.shtml?norewrite200609261547&amp;sourcedomain=www.msuspokesman.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.msuspokesman.com/media/storage/paper270/news/2006/02/10/CampusLife/Tribute.A.Brief.History.Of.Black.Collegiate.Fraternities.And.Sororities-1614202.shtml?norewrite200609261547&amp;sourcedomain=www.msuspokesman.com" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> is the basis for most of Mykungfu's claims about Alpha Kappa Nu, and he prefers to use it rather than the original source document from which the unattributed quote was taken<a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kappa/history.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.indiana.edu/~kappa/history.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>).

<li><b>comment:</b> 6 Distinct references are provided. Solely dealing with Alpha Kappa Nu. Reknown historians refer to Alpha Kappa Nu as a fraternity. It bore greek letters, was an organization on a college campus. Having a charter or incorporation aren't critera to being a fraternity, which is the basis of Robotam's argument. Fraternity by definition is <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fraternity" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fraternity" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>1. a local or national organization of male students, primarily for social purposes, usually with secret initiation and rites and a name composed of two or three Greek letters. 2. a group of persons associated by or as if by ties of brotherhood. 3. any group or class of persons having common purposes, interests, etc.: the medical fraternity. 4. an organization of laymen for religious or charitable purposes; sodality. 5. the quality of being brotherly; brotherhood: liberty, equality, and fraternity. 6. the relation of a brother or between brothers. Robotam is the original individual whom wrote of Alpha Kappa Nu as being an attack page. Any issue he brings up can be brought into the talk section. He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha a rival fraternity which has a disputed claim of being the first inter collegiate black fraternity. Robotam has brought issue with Sigma Pi Phi the oldest black fraternity nationwide. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sigma_Pi_Phi&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sigma_Pi_Phi&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sigma_Pi_Phi&amp;action=history</a> He has brought issue on whether or not it is even a fraternity <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sigma_Pi_Phi" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sigma_Pi_Phi" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> when on it's national website it states, Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity <a href="http://www.sigma-pi-phi.net/" class="external free" title="http://www.sigma-pi-phi.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sigma-pi-phi.net/</a> .

<p><b>*comment:</b> What I created was a neutral point of view, which <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykungfu_b210.html" title="User:Mykungfu">Mykungfu</a>'s chooses not to include on his pages. His references were and are questionable; In addition to citing opinion pieces and personal webpages as fact, one webpage cited by Mykungfu as authority would actually change each time inaccuracies and inconsistencies were pointed out to him. The argument regarding Sigma Pi Phi is dubious; <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Phi_Alpha_482f.html" title="Alpha Phi Alpha">Alpha Phi Alpha</a> is noted as "the first African-American <i><b>intercollegiate</b></i> fraternity." Mykungfu (under the often-blocked alias <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbydoop_8d18.html" title="User:Bobbydoop">Bobbydoop</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinjaNubian_16e7.html" title="User:NinjaNubian">NinjaNubian</a>) demanded Sigma Pi Phi be inserted into the Alpha article to "disprove" this<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Alpha_Phi_Alpha#.22Second_oldest_Greek-letter_organization_for_African_American_men.22" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Alpha_Phi_Alpha#.22Second_oldest_Greek-letter_organization_for_African_American_men.22" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, and began a revert war when he was shown that Sigma is not a <b>collegiate</b> organization. In addition, I am not a rival to Alpha Kappa Nu, <i>because it does not exist</i>. AKN was one of many attempts at forming a Black college organization prior to 1906 that unfortunately failed. All of the few original references to the organization refer to it in this manner: "Black-sponsored Greek letter organizations...might well have begun in 1903, <b>but</b> there were too few registrants to assure continuing organization."<a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kappa/history.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.indiana.edu/~kappa/history.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> Taking his assertions that AKN (referred to as a "club," not "fraternity" in original sources) in the best light, there is still a legitimate dispute regarding the <b>opinion</b> that AKN was a fraternity that Mykungfu insists on presenting as <b>fact</b> (even as his own citations do not support them). But instead of debating these issues in good faith and building consensus, Mykungfu chose to write an article disparaging the orgaziation he does not like (<a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Phi_Alpha_482f.html" title="Alpha Phi Alpha">Alpha Phi Alpha</a>), describing other articles as "false" within the text of his own article. He later turned to harrassment and vandalism of other editors and pages, which is why he is currently blocked and writing in from an anon IP.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Mykungfu" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Mykungfu" rel="nofollow">[9]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Syrthiss" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Syrthiss" rel="nofollow">[10]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ccson&amp;diff=77734855&amp;oldid=77718240" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ccson&amp;diff=77734855&amp;oldid=77718240" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> -<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotam_8f37.html" title="User:Robotam">Robotam</a> 17:43, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>*comment: an edorsement to keep</b> One University (University of Houston) and One college (Morgan State) Website aren't personal websites. Regardless of whether or not an oganization (Sigma Pi Phi) is collegiate doesn't take aways from the fact that it is a fraternity. Revert war accusation is ridiculous. That was over numerous issues as can be seen by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation/Alpha_Phi_Alpha" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation/Alpha_Phi_Alpha" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation/Alpha_Phi_Alpha</a> . Going by a classical definition fraternity that is provided Alpha Kappa Nu is a fraternity. Robotam has himself been accused of being a sockpuppet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Robotam&amp;oldid=76944904" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Robotam&amp;oldid=76944904" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Robotam&amp;oldid=76944904</a> while his Alias Ccson has been warned about 3rr violations this month on Wikipedia this month. I am wondering, where does it state the word false in the Alpha Kappa Nu article? This could easily take place in the talk section, not thru article deletion. <a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.138.html" title="User:152.163.100.138">152.163.100.138</a> 22:22, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i><b>*Mykungfu, Your allegations are silly.

<p>This article should be <b>deleted</b> on the speculative nature (POV) of the references provided and the author’s further misquoting of these references. Alpha Kappa Nu has been out of existence for 100 years. The only authentic proof of its existence at all is the picture provided. Membership roster and bios can be deduced by this picture, if one is desirous to labor in that original research.</p>
<p>However, and of the utmost importance, since there’s no written documentation to be found anywhere in the form of a Constitution, preamble, or mission statement, it’s speculative to conclude whether or not Alpha Kappa Nu was a club, society, fraternity, exclusive membership based on race, gender, or social status, academic, social, or service oriented (“strengthen the Negro voice at the city and the university”? Says who?), or otherwise. Presenting <b>any</b> such evidence as <b>100% fact</b> on this or any other site, as well as any and all journal and newspaper publications provided as sources or in the making, should be avoided.</p>
<p><b>I whole-heartedly support deletion in its entirety.</b></p>

so if it was listed as a black greek letter organization, would that be good enough for you? if you click on the picture you will see that it will enlarge and you'll see that it states "strengthen the negro voice" <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.131.205.160.html" title="User:64.131.205.160">64.131.205.160</a> 01:42, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
