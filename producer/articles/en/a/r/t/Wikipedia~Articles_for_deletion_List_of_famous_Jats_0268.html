The reason given by Sbei78 is that there are lists like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Scientologists_e09a.html" title="List of Scientologists">List of Scientologists</a>, so this list should be kept as well. I would like to point out that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Scientologists_e09a.html" title="List of Scientologists">List of Scientologists</a> is a fully-cited list.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this is an <b><a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Unverifiable</a></b> list. The argument that "lists can be verified later" doesn't go down, because the list has been existing since quite a long time, and nobody has bothered to provide a single citation or source. There is no way of verifying these entries except relying on information from personal users, most of whom are hell-bent on adding every other famous person to list of their caste, which essentially means POV.</p>

None of the users who voted Keep last for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_Nairs_fa2a.html" title="List of famous Nairs">List of famous Nairs</a> time have bothered to cleanup or verify the list.

<dd>The surnames don't always indicate caste (for eg. Mira Nair is Punjabi). Except OBCs, SC/STs, castes don't exist officially -- so, there are few official sources. The only sources are the personal sources or magazines/websites run by caste-based organizations. Also, please note that many people (esp. nationalists) that editors have categorized as "Famous Bhumihars" or "Nairs" do not believe in caste system and don't consider themselves as Bhumihars or Nairs. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 10:21, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>,That wasn’t a second vote; I was just reiterating my original position (one vote). Moreover, it is highly arrogant of <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> trying to belittle any user who disagrees with his point. I think it shows someone who is highly insecure and can’t handle anyone having a different opinion to him. It's amazing how whenever someone disagrees with him, he tries to belittle the members’ opinion through introducing things to question the person reputation, it shows someone who is very insecure within himself about people having a different opinion to him (almost fascist/extreme or intolerant).--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPethj_96af.html" title="User:Pethj">Pethj</a> 19:01, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or at the VERY least, <b>Rename</b> to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jats_d408.html" title="List of Jats">List of Jats</a>. The word "famous" is inherently POV, as has been discussed many times in the past. And there are far too many indiscriminate, unverifiable lists on WP already. The argument that we should have more bad lists because of existing bad lists is futile—if those lists are bad too, they should be proposed for deletion as well. We don't keep spam merely because there is spam that has yet to be deleted. If the list is kept (and renamed), strict criteria for inclusion should be listed. But I find the precedents cited by Utcursch compelling. Categories are better than lists, IMO, for situations like this, because the inclusion criteria can more easily be discussed on a case-by-case basis that way. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 19:43, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> step in the right direction, but for me, the real deciding factor is, "castes don't exist officially -- so, there are few official sources." To me, that puts it right in the same category as List of middle-class people or List of rednecks, and not in the same category as verifiable lists like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Scientologists_e09a.html" title="List of Scientologists">List of Scientologists</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Welsh_people_69a4.html" title="List of Welsh people">List of Welsh people</a>. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 22:29, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Solid Keep</b> I don't see anything really wrong with the article. I think all it needs is abit of a cleanup. The points raised against it are POV at best, its a solid article, the alteration by <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> only makes it more solid. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_smith2_f49c.html" title="User:James smith2">James smith2</a> 01:11, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have seen the list and have edited it many times,the list to me sounds pretty much authentic except a few names perhaps,especially that nishan e haider thing was not true..</li>

<p>Although most of the names are verifyable..may be the names underdispute s can be delted until a link is provided..</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The list contains notable persons who have done works which brought social changes in the society. We can feel proud of them. Names from the list which can not be verified may be deleted but <b>not the complete list</b>. Deleting the list will serve no purpose. List at one place can serve as an index if one needs to see some entry. We can think of renaming it as <b>List of notable Jats</b> to avoid POV. I strongly feel to <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../l/r/b/User%7ELRBurdak_7c15.html" title="User:LRBurdak">burdak</a> 15:03, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: the question is not whether these people deserve to appear in a list on Wikipedia; the question is whether "Jat" is a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> category under which they can appear. Relisting these people by region might be more appropriate. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 21:09, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
