<p>I am nominating this page for deletion as even if I created this page in the first place but way back in March 2006, I realized (I made a mistake) that the vast majority of the road (after the amalgamation of Gatineau in 2002)was located outside Gatineau's limits while the portion that is still inside Gatineau is not notable while the old and more notable portion called Chemin de la Montagne Sud was renamed.If the name haven't changed the article would have remained but now I'm asked for a deletion. --<a href="../../../j/f/o/User%7EJForget_e21d.html" title="User:JForget">JForget</a> 01:52, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I suggested before that the best solution to this would be to include a discussion of the timeline skew in an article more broadly about the fictional universe of <i>The West Wing</i>, and I think that that would still be the best solution, but nobody seemed to care. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 16:21, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Googling "West Wing" timeline skew gets a total of 313 results that are not from Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> Even after the attempt to source material, it is original research - none of the conclusions or speculation are sourced, just what was on the show when. It is also non-encyclopedic. After this much time (the first AFD to now) with the verifiability of the article under challenge, it is safe to presume that it is not verifiable. The only source <i>about</i> the timeline that is cited is the TV Zone article, so there is no evidence of real world significance or notability. As a side problem (but not an additional reason for deletion) the article does a poor job adhering to the manual of style guide requiring articles about fiction to be about the real world significance of that fiction. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 14:04, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The time has come to nuke this crap from orbit. This article may have been around since 2003, but is one of the biggest farces ever on Wikipedia. If you read the article, it barely touches on E-Marketing, instead it focues on David Chaffey's emarketing book. Why is that? Well, that's because <a href="../../../d/c/h/User%7EDchaffey_05b3.html" title="User:Dchaffey">User:Dchaffey</a> wrote the damn thing to promote his book in 2003. And since then no one has done anything about it, oh, apart from when his advert got too long and ended up split to <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online_marketing.html" title="Online marketing">Online marketing</a>. I've tagged it with cleanup and merge, but its best to just kill this dead. I'm sure our link did wonders for his google rank, especially as this article was linked to from <a href="../../../m/a/r/Template%7EMarketing_15f1.html" title="Template:Marketing">Template:Marketing</a> (link since removed).

<li><b>Comment</b>. Having lived in both Australia and the UK, I think there is a bigger deal about having notable supporters of AFL Clubs than there is about Arsenal supporters. This comes from both the notable people who support a Club, openly and frequently stating that they do, and from the Clubs themselves.

<li><b>Delete</b> I'd feel the same way if it were American Football League celebrity supporters. Football (soccor) is notable on its own. Celebrities, if notable, are notable on their own, not because they support football. This is exactly the type of list that adds nothing, unlike more structured lists. Entries like the red-ink ones under the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_celebrity_supporters_of_AFL_clubs_a976.html#Melbourne_Football_Club" title="List of celebrity supporters of AFL clubs">Melbourne Football Club listring</a> give away the fact that much of this is vanity or promotion of non-notability. To the extent that material is relevant and notable then it should be in the respective articles. For example, if the fact that <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Gilchrist_ed25.html" title="Adam Gilchrist">Adam Gilchrist</a> attends occasional football games of the Carlton Football Club with his son is notable, namely is an important part of his life, why is it not mentioned in his article? The answer is that it is a non-notable fact, mostly if not entirely irrelevant to his life. Similarly with respect to the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlton_Football_Club_f590.html" title="Carlton Football Club">Carlton Football Club</a>, the fact that Adam Gilchrist occasionally attends a game with his son is not a notable part of what the Carlton Football Club is about.

<li><b>DELETE.</b> Since December 4, 2005 there has been no new information added to the article, only some formatting and re-arranging of text, but not enough to bring it into proper wiki format. In June 2006 it was proposed for deletion and the proponents of keeping it all gave the reason that they believed that more information and further development of the article would make into a worthwhile article. It appears that after four months no one is available to bring us the requested further information, and without that further information there is no justification for keeping the article. Perhaps someone can offer a good article on the topic at a later date, but this doesn't belong in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 06:07, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> – This concept appears to have validity. I have found the following sites which mention the "Seven Worlds":</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Hebrew Wikipedia, at <a href="../../../../he/%D7%A9/%D7%9C/%D7%9E/%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%94.html" class="extiw" title="he:שלמה">he:שלמה</a> (Solomon), where it claims (unsourced) that these worlds are mentioned in a book he wrote (The "Book of Worlds"), and</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kabbalah.co.il/kabbalah/ufo.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.kabbalah.co.il/kabbalah/ufo.asp" rel="nofollow">this Kabbalah Centre site</a> (also Hebrew). The Kabbalah Centre site gives these sources:</li>

<dd>Also, there are some few details mentioned in English at the following sites:
<ul>

<p>First of all, I'm flummoxed. I've been at Cal for nine years and have never even heard of this publication. If this is distributed free of charge on campus it must be somewhere I've never been to. But since this could be my oversight I tried to look into circulation numbers, but the Patriot conveniently forgets to mention them <a href="http://www.calpatriot.org/magazine/about" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.calpatriot.org/magazine/about" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. So I looked at independent coverage it received. It turns out (per Newsbank) that the editor was cited in one article in the Oakland Tribune on "Which political party has whinier children?" A check on Lexis-Nexis for coverage on University Wire gave me five articles total, all by the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Californian_f7b2.html" title="Daily Californian">Daily Californian</a>. So absent other sources I propose deletion as a marginal student publication with no non-trivial independent coverage. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 01:13, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think I see a strongly-worded editorial about trialsanderrors on the horizon.... a la the conservative campus paper, the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_Review_34be.html" title="Stanford Review">Stanford Review</a>'s response to <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">User:Aaron</a>'s afd: <a href="http://www.stanfordreview.org/Archive/Volume_XXXVII/Issue_3/Opinions/opinions4.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.stanfordreview.org/Archive/Volume_XXXVII/Issue_3/Opinions/opinions4.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.stanfordreview.org/Archive/Volume_XXXVII/Issue_3/Opinions/opinions4.shtml</a> (in which, for one thing, the editor mulls over the problem that university students are so busy that they just don't have time to argue effectively with Wikipedian afd research efforts). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 02:18, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hermmmm. I vote <b>Delete</b> for now. A <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> search brings up a quite short CNN interview transcript with this publication's founder about the newspaper, as well as a shortish article about the newspaper in Time magazine in Feb 2003. That seems to have been enough shock value about launching a conservative newspaper on a an "ultra-liberal" campus to get attention from these media outlets. There doesn't seem to have been anything significant after these stories though. However, as I have expressed many times, news coverage, even in well known channels, does not equal encyclopedic notability - and these are quite shortish articles. It is unclear that this newspaper has attained encyclopedically significant status since its trumpeted beginnings. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 02:29, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It sounds like a somewhat notable publication since its been featured on CNN and Time Magazine.

<li><b>Weak keep.</b> This reminds me of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Stanford_Review_78b2.html" title="The Stanford Review">The Stanford Review</a> and its deletion process, which clearly was politically motivated. On the other hand, I agree with Bwithh that this publication has done little since its founding to warrant inclusion in Wikipedia. Perhaps the very fact that it's in a tiny minority is enough? I'm not sure, which is why my "vote" is weak. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 04:28, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Didn't the Stanford Review editorial express relief that the afd nominator was a Republican, so the afd didnt actually seem to be politically motivated? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 13:37, 21 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, I think he expressed nonplussedness; something along the lines of "the fact that he's a Republican didn't make me feel better." In any event, N Shar's <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>-violating statement is, of course, complete bullshit, as anyone who actually <i>read</i> that old AfD would have known. The <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_Review_34be.html" title="Stanford Review">Stanford Review</a> article wasn't put there to promote the <i>Stanford Review</i>; it was put there as part of a <a href="../../../w/a/l/WP%7EWALL_5398.html" title="WP:WALL">walled garden</a> to try to create notability for some guy's publishing company. Since it had never been improved upon by other editors beyond its original creation, it would have been illogical not to add it to the overall walled garden AfD. That's all there was to it. As for this article, I'm going to&#160;!vote a strong <b>who cares</b>. The paper may well be noteworthy, but this article sure doesn't do a very good job of asserting it, and I don't know enough about it to be able to try and fix it. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 19:54, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> into the town's article. While we <i>do</i> have a category for municipal departments, 22 of the 33 articles are on the police departments of major metropolitan areas. Three of the remaining 11 articles ((<a href="../../../b/e/l/Bellevue_Police_Department_0310.html" title="Bellevue Police Department">Bellevue Police Department</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_Police_Department_193d.html" title="Lincoln Police Department">Lincoln Police Department</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fremont_Police_Department_%28Nebraska%29_a027.html" title="Fremont Police Department (Nebraska)">Fremont Police Department</a>)) seem to share the same circle of editors -- notably <a href="../../../l/p/d/User%7ELpd1571_f8bd.html" title="User:Lpd1571">Lpd1571</a> who appears to be something of a police hobbyist. I would contend that the articles on smaller police forces are of a simliar vein -- created and maintained by local editors with law enforcement interest. I don't want to get into a debate about how big a department has to get before being noteable, but Sharon, PA seems to be the smallest of these cities, and the information in the article could easily be housed within <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharon%2C_Pennsylvania_9f5a.html" title="Sharon, Pennsylvania">Sharon, Pennsylvania</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 04:49, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>, there is nothing notable about this police department and we don't need articles on 5000 local police departments.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Merger would indeed preserve the information, but this article probably has more detail about the Police Department than the typical reader of the Sharon article would want. The readers are better served with a summary in the municipality's article and a link to this one for more information.

<p>This looks like a hoax. I can't find anything out about this band, if it does exist, aside from a puzzling myspace page. The list of albums is a list of Guns 'n' Roses and Bon Jovi albums with dates preceding the release of those albums by the latter bands. I think this is total B.S., but maybe someone can vouch for this band. Maybe it's real but heavily vandalized. From the article itself: "Unfortunatly commercial success has yet to bestow itself onto Destruktur."

<li><b>Weakish Delete</b> The Wired News source is a good start for suggesting this is at least a borderline case, but I'd like to see more reliable sources. Note that we don't decide what is a "reasonably large readership" or what web site is "notable for." We rely on reliable sources (like Wired News) to do that for us. Also, the sub articles are overkill. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 22:03, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> First of all, I will admit, I am somewhat biased... I am a member of and staff on the Bob and George forums, and of course a reader of the comic (although, obviously, simply being a reader of the comic should not automatically imply bias). However, I am a perfectly intelligent, self-respecting person, so please don't consider my argument automatically vanity (I don't really get some sense of pride from the five or six degrees of seperation between the article and myself). I agree that it is well-known enough to be significant, and more-so it was the first comic to spawn the trend of sprite comics (there are arguments of it being the first sprite comic ever, but that is another discussion altogether - almost all if not all current sprite comics can trace existance back to Bob and George, even if through others like <a href="../../../8/-/b/8-Bit_Theater_2a8a.html" title="8-Bit Theater">8-Bit Theater</a>, which directly credits Anez). It is an important part of the history of internet sub-culture. Even if it is not notable to Johnny Everyman walking down the street, it is notable within the online comic community - as explained in an interview in <a href="http://comixpedia.com/dave_and_damonk_an_interview_with_the_creator_of_bob_and_george_by_damonk" class="external text" title="http://comixpedia.com/dave_and_damonk_an_interview_with_the_creator_of_bob_and_george_by_damonk" rel="nofollow">Comixpedia</a> or an article (admittedly, about 8BT but discussing the significance of BnG in the introduction) <a href="http://webcomicsreview.com/examiner/issue050912/history2.html" class="external text" title="http://webcomicsreview.com/examiner/issue050912/history2.html" rel="nofollow">The Webcomics Examiner</a>. Also, I feel the need to say that there is <i>no</i> reason that a subcomic being non-notable reflects on the main comic. There have been more than 10 subcomics in the history of the site, not to mention non-'comic' sub sections such as art pages, so <i>of course</i> they are less notable than Bob and George itself. That is completely irrelevant to whether Bob and George stands on its own itself. Now, if you feel the article is larger than the comic's significance would warrant, you may have some case. I was honestly surprised at how much information there is in this page, and probably some of it is fancruft (there is in fact a wikia page for the site). The key, however, is that if you feel this way, it should be cleaned up, not deleted. --Author X 22:51, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I also completelly disagree. UCIP is one of the pioneers in Star Trek simming on Internet. It also have valuable information and works on a Information Developing in her Academy Courses. The Wikipedia have information about Corporations and business. Why not having about Internet Institutions like UCIP?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hmmm I disagree as a long standing member of this organization; UCIP is notable for being one of the longest running Star Trek and General SciFi Role Playing groups on the internet. UCIP has a database system that has been adapted by several Sim organizations to fit their needs. This is truly a notable entry and a notable group. 206.229.248.249 02:57, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Being a member of UCIP for nearly two years and holding nearly every imaginable post; I stipulate that the organization is a real online SIMming facility that incorporates Star Trek and other Sci-Fi genres with a very diverse group members.

<li>As a long-standing member of UCIP (seven years this December) I feel that UCIP has been, and still is, one of the <b>most</b> notable SIM organization on the net! Tango Fleet, StarTrekPBEM.com, they've all found somthing to model off of in our organzation. Just the other day a non-member told me we were the "secret organization," with "so many SIMs, an excellent infrastructure, but no public apperences." I think that after over a decade of service to the fans of Science Fiction, UCIP has earned a page here.</li>

<li>UCIP is a pioneer for Star Trek RPGs on the Internet. Having been around since 1994, and, having been a member myself since it's formative years, I can state definitively that it has defined SIMming on the internet, over IRC, and via email. They were the first to have an Academy system - that <b>all other Academy Systems</b> are modelled on. They were the first to have a universal IC environment for their systems <b>that others have tried to duplicate, and never succeeded with</b>. They pioneered the first character database, <b>which others have built and expanded upon</b>. To say that none of this is 'noteworthy' is ludicrous, and is a completely uninformed opinion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.69.56.114 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.69.56.114_59fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.69.56.114">contribs</a>) .</small> <small>— 70.69.56.114 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.69.56.114_59fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.69.56.114">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li>Do Not Delete. I believe that this organisation and its website have provided a social and developmental environment for numerous amateur authors who have through the use of the media of play by email simulations and IRc simulations have enhanced and honed skills in the development of decriptive and narrative writing. If some of these people are involved in studying English then the site and its associated aimulations may contribute in a very positive way to the educational process. I also believe that the site develops a multiracial and multicultural positive ethos with contributors from all around the world exchanging views and opinions on a common topic. This while not being unique is something to be encouraged in our world today. 86.141.109.152 14:09, 21 October 2006 (UTC) Kang 86.141.109.152 14:09, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Do not Delete. I am UCIP's current CinC, which yes makes me biased in keeping this link active. However, you claim that this site has no credence. I am here to tell you that you're wrong. In December 1998, UCIP was voted the BEST Startrek Role Playing Site on the Internet by Yahoo! Internet Life Magazine.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. UCIP was voted the "best StarTrek role playing site" in an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010210162709/www.zdnet.com/yil/content/mag/9812/besttrek.html" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20010210162709/www.zdnet.com/yil/content/mag/9812/besttrek.html" rel="nofollow">online readers poll</a>. The editorial staff at Interenet Life Magazine did not rank it, and this sub-section of the ILM is run by fans, not serious journalistic contributors. Take this quote, directly from the opening paragraph: "To sort it out, we asked our online readers to vote on their favorite spots, from Best Overall Resource to Best Anti-Trek Site." That isn't exactly like winning a <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webby.html" title="Webby">Webby</a>, and I don't consider it to denote notability. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 00:51, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Delete. This org has gone down hill for the past five years and the only reason they are trying to keep the wikipedia article is to try and use it as an Ad to bring in more members to their strugling sims.

<li>Do not delete. The point of this conversation is to determine whether or not the article is suitable for placement in the encyclopedia, so derogatory comments from ex-members of the organization should not be posted here. At any rate, we are attempting to establish the noteability of this article, and have provided several sources. Here is where UCIP is mentioned in Yahoo! Internet Life: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20001119220700/www.zdnet.com/yil/url/9812/9812a.html" class="external free" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20001119220700/www.zdnet.com/yil/url/9812/9812a.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20001119220700/www.zdnet.com/yil/url/9812/9812a.html</a>. I am still trying to find the exact article where it mentions UCIP was voted best Star Trek RPG, but the archives are tempermental. Hopefully I will find it shortly.

<li>Funny all this... lets look at other articles included on wikipedia in a similar vane. First, Alt.starfleet.rpg, an RPG community that originated from Usenet according to the article. Second we have <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Gamers_Alliance_fe69.html" title="Christian Gamers Alliance">Christian_Gamers_Alliance</a> which is a community for Christians interested in role playing games. Third we have Diversity_Fleet which is a subsidiary group of The Simming League and consists of (near as one can tell) a single SIM. Finally there is the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_Simulation_Forum_bed2.html" title="Star Trek Simulation Forum">Star_Trek_Simulation_Forum</a> which also originated on AOL, much like UCIP did. Given that UCIP has well over 15 SIMs and somewhere in the neighbourhood of 150 members (and I am being conservative) from across the globe it seems a little asinine that these articles exist and are not under threat of deletion while the UCIP one is. Further to this, Wikipedia itself references UCIP in one of its articles, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simming.html" title="Simming">Simming</a>. To have noted UCIP in an article is clear evidence UCIP is indeed a notable organization or else it would not have been included in the article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.52.151.93 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.52.151.93_4289.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.52.151.93">contribs</a>) .</small>
<ul>
<li>From what I can tell, alt.starfleet.org and Christian Gamers Alliance are both notable on their own. The Star Trek Simulation Forum is notable, in my opinion, because it appears to be an official, Paramount-approved entity. Diversity Fleet, on the other hand, <i>is</i> non-notable, and as such, I've submitted <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Diversity_Fleet_b461.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Diversity Fleet">its AfD</a>. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 17:11, 21 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are we discussiong Opinion or Fact? I wouldn't call either alt.starfleet.org or Christian Gamers Alliance 'notable'. I also would not call the Star Trek SIMulation Forum 'notable' as it has not made any large advances in SIMming for the online community as this organization has 70.69.56.114 17:31, 21 October 2006 (UTC)Jaeneva
<ul>
<li>My conclusion is just that, my conclusion. Another editor is free to submit an AfD for those three articles, but I didn't feel that they warranted one (as opposed to Diversity Fleet, which I <i>did</i> feel warranted a deletion). <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 17:36, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The "if article X exists so should article Y" argument doesn't hold much water in this case. The existence of the articles cited by 70.52.151.93 is not a precedent for the existence of <i>this</i> article. It simply means that we have so far failed to delete them. -- <a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslaySolomon_7ae5.html" title="User:IslaySolomon"><font color="#153E7E">I</font><font color="#1569C7">sl</font><font color="#157DEC">a</font><font color="#1589FF">y</font><font color="#1589FF">So</font><font color="#157DEC">lo</font><font color="#1569C7">mo</font><font color="#153E7E">n</font></a> <font color="#153E7E">|</font> <a href="../../../i/s/l/User_talk%7EIslaySolomon_7b55.html" title="User talk:IslaySolomon"><font color="#006600">t</font><font color="#336633">a</font><font color="#669966">l</font><font color="#99CC99">k</font></a> 18:23, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Its not a matter of if X exists then Y exists. Its a matter of consistancy. If one article is to be deleted only days after it was put up because it is deemed not noteworthy by an admin, why do organizations with equal or lesser notability not face the threat of deletion? The admins are asking for evidence of UCIPs notability, yet have not questioned the notability (to my knowledge) of the organizations above. I guess the question is, what flagged UCIP's article so quickly in comparison to the others? Further, why wasn't the previous UCIP article flagged, in which there were a copious number of unsupported or uncited claims, as well as a link to an article on one of the founding members?</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Again, a false premise. <i>Any</i> organisation without notability (or perceived as such) risks having its article deleted here. Just because any given organisation hasn't been nominated for deletion yet doesn't mean that it won't be - it just means nobody's done so yet. You're welcome to do so if you feel that the standards being applied to UCIP mean that any other organisation is also non-notable. The place to question the notability of other organisations, however, is in <i>their own articles or AfDs</i>, rather than here. What flagged this particular article in comparison to any other is probably the simple fact that someone found it. I found one incarnation of it at the New Pages list, for example. Additionally, the previous UCIP article <i>was</i> flagged and was in fact deleted. See the link at the outset of this AfD. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 21:29, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But where are the facts? We have been asked to provide hard evidence that UCIP is notable, and we are doing that. Therefore, I must ask that you submit hard evidence for these other organizations as well, or we are talking about a double standard.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. You're confusing the various issues. <i>This</i> is the place to provide evidence that UCIP is notable and you're certainly having a good go at doing that. The place to provide evidence for the notability or otherwise of other organisations is in <i>their</i> articles or - should it come to it - their AfDs. The only thing up for discussion here is "Should the article on the UCIP be deleted?" The other organisations have very little to do with the case. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:06, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>KEEP: Too much evidence, this is a legit organization, per articles, structure etc. Here is a question for all you "deleters"&#160;:: How many articles in wikipedia are currently incorrect or not updated?</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment.</b> The quality of other articles is not a factor within this debate.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Further, nobody's saying UCIP doesn't exist (which I presume is what you mean by saying that it's a "legit" organisation). I exist, you exist and so does everyone else contributing to this discussion, but that doesn't mean we should all write articles on ourselves. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 02:44, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Numerous items concerning the notability of UCIP has been given, which is what was asked to be done originally. Those references have been stated in the article. Now, given that, why is deletion still being discussed?</p>
<dl>
<dd>For two main reasons. The first is process: AfDs run for about 5 days, sometimes a bit longer depending on how rapidly admins spring into action or how contentious the issue is - they can be closed earlier, but only in situations where the article's already been deleted (a speedy delete), or the nominator retracts the nomination, that kind of thing. The second this is that, as a number of contributors here have said, the evidence provided isn't too great. The award cited was a fan poll, for example - and as other users have also pointed out, it doesn't look like it meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> which is a useful thing for it to meet in order to be notable. Yes, information has been provided, but it isn't necessarily enough. Therefore, deletion is still being discussed partly because that's the way we do things and partly because notability hasn't yet been proven. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 04:12, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The about.com and yahoo magazine mentions are par excellent among <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simming_organizations.html" title="Simming organizations">simming organizations</a>, few of which receive any notability in 3rd party publications.

Appearing on CSPAN, <i>if verified</i>, is reasonable evidence of notability, so I'd change my&#160;!vote to <b>weak keep</b> if that were confirmed, and he was actually a speaker, rather than being one of a number of interviewees. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 18:03, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Good point. Searching all the CSPAN websites I know of (c-span.org, www.c-spanstore.org, www.booknotes.org, www.booktv.org and www.q-and-a.org) for "Michael Rivero" got zero matches. I googled for “<tt>+"Michael Rivero" +5/15/2003</tt>” and lots of similar search strings, without finding any more mentions of a CSPAN appearance. If there was one, it's well hidden, unlike everything else about Rivero (including his repulsive anti-semetism — checking the Google hits was <i>not</i> fun). It now seems very unlikely to me that he was interviewed on CSPAN. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Chittleborough_4a64.html" title="User:Chris Chittleborough">CWC</a><small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_Chittleborough_55c1.html" title="User talk:Chris Chittleborough">(talk)</a></small> 09:22, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I found links to three different blogs, all of whom despise Rivero, who mention that he was interviewed on CSPAN in May od 2003 (15 May?) by Bill Herbert.

<li>Yeah, I found those. Bill Herbert is the blogger at two of those blogs, not the interviewer. The third blog post is just asking "Is Bill Herbert pulling our leg?". Mr Herbert says that CSPAN broadcast <i>footage</i> of Rivero making claims. He does not say that CSPAN <i>interviewed</i> Rivero. Being shown in a report is a lot smaller claim to notability than being interviewed. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Chittleborough_4a64.html" title="User:Chris Chittleborough">CWC</a><small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_Chittleborough_55c1.html" title="User talk:Chris Chittleborough">(talk)</a></small> 00:16, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for pointing that out. I hadn't noticed that Bill Herbert was the author of two of three posts mentioned there. Still, the point stands that he was sure enough of having seen Rivero on CSPAN that he repeated it on two different blogs an he is no fan. So why say ithappened if it did not? Still, I am trying to locate a more authoritative source.

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with Rosicrurian - science fiction movies employ large teams of visual effects people, these people make important contributions to the movie to be sure but they arn't necessarily big contributions (I remember hearing that on the Star Wars prequels visual effects guys were responsible for 2 seconds of film a week). The visual effects supervisor may be notable, but an animator is no more notable than a casting supervisor or a gaffer or any of the zillions of other people whose names you see in the credits. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 17:28, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Makes sense and I don't believe you're applying an unfair standard either. Checking some history, I'm suprised "Whatreallyhappened.com" was deleted as advertisement, when other comparable entries exist (not arguing that one today though). On topic, a search of his name and his production company "Home Baked Entertainment" reveals claims of awards: <i>Mr. Rivero's awards credits include gold, silver, and bronze medals from the New York International Film Festivals, two Clios in graphics, the Cable Car award at the San Francisco Film Festival, an emmy nomination, and gold &amp; silver Hugos.</i>,<a href="http://www.wwmpc.com/The%20WWMPC%20Management.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wwmpc.com/The%20WWMPC%20Management.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> and the Hawaii Student Film Festival site notes him as "award winning"<a href="http://www.hawaiistudentfilmfestival.org/HSFFGroup_files/VISION/PROS.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hawaiistudentfilmfestival.org/HSFFGroup_files/VISION/PROS.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, but I've been unable to verify a single one from another source.

<li>Interesting that you're having trouble verifying his awards - maybe he's overstating his role on his website and it was the film or the team he was part of that won the award.

Whatever they say about him could and should be cited in the article. His coauthorship of a book on graphics programming and multiple movie credits in his IMDB entry are also valid towards notability.

<li><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a guideline and not Wikipedia policy. It notes that the entire concept of notability is a contentious one, and specifically says that any person who meets one of the criteria listed can be considered notable. Further, it notes in bold that even if they fail to fit any one of categories listed, that the list is not an exclusionary one. The guideline is there to help improve the NPOV and quality of articles written, and NOT to be used to raise the bar selectively against those with whose views we disagree so as to delete entries. Rivero's website www.whatreallyhappened.com has already been up for deletion twice, and was deleted on the second attempt after a very contentious debate. No doubt articles will be written on him again since he does have a cult-like following in some quarters, and constitutes part of an online phenomenon that is notable to anyone with any familiarity with alternative news sites. It would be a shame if this entry were to be deleted simply because some people find what he writes about to be beyond the pale. An online encyclopedia should make use of its unique tools and assets to challenge and expand the notion of notability, rather than work to shrink our sphere our knowledge by upholding dogmatic orthodoxies. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 14:25, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The article is about Michael Rivero and why is he notable, and it is includes the website he runs which has received mainstream media attention. While the website may not be a reliable source for other articles, it is a certainly relevant source for the article on Rivero and his website. Not to include information from the website when it is part of what is under discussion in the article is just weird. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 12:12, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your personal opinion on maddox doesn't change the fact that he is one of the most trafficked websites on the internet. The same goes for newgrounds, another place their material is published. Consdering the nature of most of these comments, that only 3 of you are here and calling for a delete, and the way the last few attempts were handled with extreme prejudice it almost seems like you have something against TN. Face it man, the article just doesn't quality for deletion, whether you like them or not has no bearing on it.

<li><b>Comment</b>The article has useful info, but FEMA haas been providing trailers at least since 1992, so it is odd to focus so much on Katrina response criticisms. That could better be put into <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_government_response_to_Hurricane_Katrina_2efa.html" title="Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina">Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina</a> as a section. Then there could be a section in <a href="../../../f/e/m/FEMA_68a4.html" title="FEMA">FEMA</a> on housing they make available: tents (or motels or domed stadiums) for the short term, trailers for a year or 2. I find nothing in Wikipedia on "Disaster housing in the U.S." which could become important in the event of various natural disasters, wars or terrorism incidents. The stuff here which is not Katrina or FEMA criticism belongs in an "Intermediate term disaster housing" section. The article seems like too much info on too little a piece of the topic.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 02:28, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> "Too much information" seems an odd criticism here. If someone isn't interested in the trailers, they can stick with the main FEMA article. Having this much info <i>there</i> would be too much. But providing well-sourced information elsewhere is to be lauded. While it might not interest you, it probably does interest thousands of other people. Having it in a separate article guarantees that it will not overly intrude on those who do not care for this much information, while providing it for others. No reason information about 1992 trailers can't be included, an article shouldn't be deleted for being incomplete. A retitle (with redir) to "FEMA disaster relief housing" would be fine though. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 02:45, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>, at the risk of not being able to shut up. Can we please get past the <b>title</b> of the article, which can be easily changed, and focus on the content.

<li><b>Delete</b> I was neutral about this article in its initial form, but this rewrite needs to go. The original at least attempted to describe a FEMA Trailer as a subject, but this is attempting to describe some sort of possible recent culture connected to U.S. hurricanes in a region. All of that is terribly biased, since FEMA's distribution of trailers is not a new concept or limited to that region. The article as it now stands does a bad job of representing an NPOV and, quite frankly, appears to be an attempt to capture some sort of cultural phenomenon that may not be encyclopaedic at all, and may be more of a construct than a reality. Without strong academic sourcing (the sort which likely won't come until many years from now if it is to come at all), this sort of thing just doesn't seem to belong. If this article were actually focusing on the history, purpose, and use of the FEMA trailer, it might be more acceptable, although I would then likely be more inclined to merge it with FEMA; however, the article as it stands needs to go.

<dd>Greetings, William. "Liking" has nothing to do with my decision to nominate the article--I actually do like the articles. My only reasons for nominating the article for a deletion discussion have to do with Wikipedia guidelines regarding <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notability</a>. As it stands, the article does not make clear <i>why</i> the topic is notable. Additionally, since you are the owner of one of the websites under discussionin the article, there is some question as to whether or not the articles fall under the guidelines for <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">vanity articles</a> or <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">spam</a>. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 04:56, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>comment</b>. the hits that i get that aren't farms are sites like rhyzome, washington university saint louis, kanonmedia, all fairly well respected artists. to me.. it comes down to this. if the category exists as a concept and is used in an academic field like this one seems to be, is it better to cleanup the article and have it as a stub, removing the advertising from it, so that people can look up an authoritative meaning in wikipedia, or is it better to vacate the conceptual territory and let the advertisers have it?--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 14:38, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. My biggest objection to this article (I proded before it was deproded and AfDed) is that the use of the term "ethnic software" to describe a particular subset of <a href="../../../a/p/p/Application_software.html" title="Application software">application software</a> was neither sourced nor well-defined. Shribmashinke's software appears to be <i>titled</i> Ethnic software, but doesn't use the term to describe it. Digital Griot doesn't use the term on its own webpage, and I can't find anything linking the two in Google. No hits in Google Scholar. This is an interesting and probably useful extension of software, but the use of the phrase in this generic way appears to be fairly new. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 13:40, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>wierd, i got one hit from google scholar, the electronic disturbance theater, though i didn't verify it. keep in mind that the texts that terms like this originate in, in the academic universe, might not be the texts that end up in google scholar because small publishers don't participate. a regular google search actually turns up several more academics and artists in this area. i see the problem between the advert and the concept. it would be nice to expunge the advert and keep the concept. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 14:22, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>actually, software does have an ethnicity, or at least a cultural specificity. there is plenty of evidence in chi/hci specifically in the anthropology of software that shows that.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 17:00, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, that's important aspect though 'ethnicity' sounds strange here (culture or cultural context got used, e.g. <sup><a href="http://www.vhml.org/theses/nannip/HCI_final.htm#_Toc87596283" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vhml.org/theses/nannip/HCI_final.htm#_Toc87596283" rel="nofollow">[20]</a></sup>).

<dd>The information on the website (reproduced here) was clearly provided by the company. I would also say that the page is not non-trivial (i.e. it's just a statement of bare facts with no analysis). I would say that this website alone is not sufficient for the notability guideline.

<li><b>Comment</b> From the Contributor: I have taken the necessary edits to the page to make apparent the fact that the book is, as of yet, not published. However, as per the last link on the page (Which leads to the Freewebs site for the book and the book's author), the author <i>has</i> met with a publishing company in regards to publishing it. I apologize for the mix-up; when I created the three articles, I had not yet figured out how to put in the 'Future Book' template. Hopefully, this will verify that this book <i>is</i> real and should not be deleted. I once again apologize for not making this clear. --Locclo</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Actually Loccio, you've made it worse. Original nomination called this a non-notable book. Now it turns out is has not been published and the author has only 'met' with a publisher.

<li><b>Delete</b> Listcruft. Sets a ridiculous precedent, we can't have lists of fictional characters with various missing parts. We'd have to allow lists of characters with green eyes, with blue eyes, etc as well as every other possible way of classifying them. It's ridiculous, and a category would be ridiculous for the same reason. And to Noroton, the topic being 'interesting' to you does in no way signify that it should be kept; every article that gets deleted is of interest to someone which is why it was made in the first place.

<li><b>Keep</b> This page may be incomplete, but is it any different from any of other members of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_films.html" title="Lists of films">lists of films</a> category? Not especially, except that nobody has seen fit to care about it. There is already a category btw, Children's Films. And defining a children's film is pretty easily. Any film suitable and marketed at children, usually to the exclusion of adults. This is frequently established by the production company's own self-description of the film, though there may be the rare exception. So, as objections go, I'd say that's not a problem. At most this page is woefully underpopulated, but that just means it is orphaned, and lacking attention. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:03, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom, or at the very least, rename to "Stacking (first person shooter)" and transwiki to a gaming wiki somewhere.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The editor User:Fortune500 is also making nuisance edits by redirecting Enion towards this page, removing other links to Enion, and thereby causing damage to the site navigation.

<li>Please, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. The history clearly indicates that he created the Enion redir page <i>from scratch</i>; there never was any such article before. And after creating it, he fixed some links that definitely should not have pointed to his page. They almost certainly must have been redlinks before. Creating a disambiguation page would have been better, but what he did was not entirely unreasonable, and may well have been done with Wikipedia's best interests at heart. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 19:39, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Totally self-centred and self-promoting. I would have described this as vanity but that word is discouraged now. Subject/author clealry states in the las section that his intention is to subvert Wikipedia by encouaging and facilitating similar vanity (oops!) pieces.

<li>Again, assume good faith. He's done some stuff that demonstrates a clear misunderstanding of the purpose and goals of Wikipedia, but I see no indication that he's motivated by anything other than a sense of pure scientific curiousity.

</li>
<li>Thanks for supporting the harmless nature of my article. I certainly would not have gone to the trouble of fixing unrelated links to my page if I was interested in vandalism. Also, I don't know how to create a disambiguation page yet. I am however using this article as a learning tool so that I may contribute (albeit more useful information) in the future. As for the fate of this article, on balance it does more good than harm and supports the spirit of Wikipedia. <b>Keep</b> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Fortune500 (<a href="../../../f/o/r/User_talk%7EFortune500_423e.html" title="User talk:Fortune500">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fortune500_a0db.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fortune500">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>The problem is that you're still non-notable, so the article should still be deleted.

<li>I wasn't supporting the "harmless nature" of your article. Your article still doesn't qualify for inclusion in Wikipedia, and <i>does</i> harm Wikipedia by wasting space on non-notable, non-encyclopedic material. I was (and am) assuming that your obvious mistakes were well-intentioned. They were, nevertheless, mistakes. I suggest you read the official policy on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is not</a> (in particular, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a blog, webspace provider, or social networking site</a>) before making blanket claims about the "spirit of Wikipedia".

<dd>There seems to be some contradiction between the article and the external links. Article says subject came to US and completed a PhD at Berkeley in 18 months in mid 1960s. Indian external link says subject was brought over as a research scholar to the US in 1963, and doesn't mention Berkeley at all. Berkeley link says subject completed/submitted his PhD dissertation in 1969.

Being mentioned in Parliament is not persuasive as it is the everyday business of members of parliament to discusss specific cases related to petitions made by their constituents. Not every mental patient is discussed specifically in Parliament, but it is not extraordinary for parlimentarians to discuss the cases of specific ordinary citizens.

<dd>The <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">deletion process</a> is a discussion, not a vote. If there is a <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">consensus</a> about what should happen to the article, then that's what will happen. If no consensus emerges, the page will remain. Here's an informative quote directly from the <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">deletion policy</a>: "It should also be noted that packing the discussion with <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_sockpuppet.html" title="Internet sockpuppet">sockpuppets</a> (multiple accounts) and <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">meatpuppets</a> (advertising or soliciting of desired views) does not reflect a genuine consensus, and usually doesn't raise much in the way of novel policy considerations. A deletion debate is not a popular vote, but a way of obtaining editors' views as to whether an article meets policy guidelines or not, so these kind of activities don't achieve much. Often, where sock-puppetry is suspected, only editors with a significant history of contributions to Wikipedia will be counted in the rough consensus." --<a href="../../../j/a/i/User%7EJaimeLesMaths_f7a6.html" title="User:JaimeLesMaths">JaimeLesMaths</a> 08:47, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Now now, let's not start scaring the poor guy with discussions of sockpuppets and such. He obviously just wants to know why we want to delete his article about his poor dog. And the answer is that a dog known to "hundreds of people" in the San Antonio area is simply not famous/notable <i>enough</i> for an <i>international</i> encyclopedia. Even a dog that was famous throughout the entire state of Texas might have trouble qualifying. No offense to what is surely a fine dog, but Wikipedia has agreed-upon standards that this dog simply doesn't meet. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub></dd>

<dd>Sure, I can link to the articles. However, the only records that exist of the TV appearances are on VHS at my home, so that's not possible. Also, the actual link to ddrfreak appears on a separate sidebar article which is not included in the online version. The online article does describe the website as "fans at UC-Berkeley and UCLA created Web sites for fellow enthusiasts..." Jasonko888 22:48, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For the TV appearances, and newspaper articles, it's not necessary that they be online, but you can simply cite the date of the coverage, like, "Featured on Larry King Live, July 8, 2002."

<dd>Thanks for the clarification Elonka. I wonder if the links to the mirrored copies of the articles might be a possible copyright problem now that I think about it (unless you have permission to use the articles from the publishers), so I'm not sure if that's a problem or not if they are linked to.

<dd>Yeah, although that's more of ddrfreak.com's issue than ours (we should remove the links though).

<dd>Thanks, that's what I wanted to know. This is true, that the articles are on DDR in general, but the fact that the articles interview Jason Ko in specific might be worth something. I'm really not sure, though, and I'll leave that up to you and other users interested in this discussion. It may not be enough of a reason to change my vote back, but it does perhaps warrant a bit more discussion and thought. -<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDougk_db9d.html" title="User:Dougk">dougk</a> (<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDougk_3107.html" title="User talk:Dougk">Talk</a> ˑ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dougk_f141.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dougk">Contribs</a>) 01:01, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'd suggest quick deletion, as it has nothing of value, encyclopedic or humorous, and only damages WP. <a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/p/5C/User_talk%7ECP_M_d8d6.html" title="User talk:CP\M">comm</a></sup> |<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutrality_Project_de7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutrality Project">Wikipedia Neutrality Project</a>| 08:19, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I myself work in area of weaponry construction (though far from vests) and can say two things for sure: first, there is no point of making armor of 50/50 "steel"/titanium alloy (let alone that steel is alloy by itself and not a component), second, at least some people connected to that have hever heard of something bulletproof called superman plates. The actual reason for deletion, in the first place, is being a hoax. If one makes an internet search for superman plates, all that comes up is the mentioned collectibles and automated mirrors of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/p/5C/User_talk%7ECP_M_d8d6.html" title="User talk:CP\M">comm</a></sup> |<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutrality_Project_de7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutrality Project">Wikipedia Neutrality Project</a>| 17:15, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page has existed since August 2004, so I am hesitant to nominate it; however, I am unable to find encyclopaedic value in the one sentence which is here. As far as I can tell, Utopia 84 is the name of a programming language which did not actually exist, but was referenced as an ideal by Donald Knuth. A Google search for "Utopia 84" -Hawkwind (the band Hawkwind recorded an unrelated song by this name) produces 506 results, many of which mirror the text of this article, the rest of which offer no further insight as to why this concept/language is/was important or otherwise. Anyway, I currently recommend deleting this as it fails to demonstrate notability, with perhaps the option of mentioning the concept in the Knuth article if it is even that important.

<li>TV Guide seems to have chosen events from regular series and expected televised events. It is in these programs that something was unexpected. Challenger and Budd Dwyer's suicide are more likely classified as news events in the TV realm, so those were unexpected, but not part of a regular TV event. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 05:37, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page was prod'd back in April and the prod removed by the article creator. The subject seems non-notable according to normal understanding, but the article does not help by saying that durint the "controversial years of school integration " he managed "to provide central heating for the town grammar school and indoor plumbing for the janitor's home." Hardly a great contribution to the contorversial years..... Original prod by <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">User:Wickethewok</a> stated "Only online reference to this individual is from the article's creators webpage."

<li><b>Keep</b>, the book is an incredible resource for professional and laypeople alike. The fact that it has 22 contributors, some of them pretty notable in their own right, lends credence towards keeping/expanding/cleaning up some more. Perhaps, in time, some of the other more notable contributors to the book who have written numerous books/publications themselves might also merit having articles at some point.

<li><b>Delete.</b> From the limited description in the article so far, this book seems to represent only one POV in the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html" title="Mind control">mind control</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-cult_trauma.html" title="Post-cult trauma">post-cult trauma</a> controversies. Perhaps it would be better to use this book as a reference to those articles to illuminate that POV. Giving it its own article would result in merely echoing the POV of the authors and essentially acting as a free advertisement for a book which some Wikipedia editors happen to have read and liked. If no sources can be found which positively or more importantly negatively review the book, then this is an indication that it does not appear to be of any notable scientific, historic, or cultural significance, and that the Wikipedia coverage of it would necessarily be original research. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 21:46, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> even though this book presents my church in a bad light. This book is crucially important to the debate over mind control and "cults". It presents a theory of "cult recruitment" which was initially very popular but later was scientifically repudiated, namely, the "<a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html" title="Mind control">mind control</a>" theory. It's hard to understand anti-cult advocacy (such as the anxiety and urgency which led to the Waco raids) without reference to the premise of this book. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 19:35, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>LOL, not as proof of mind control. That theory has been discredited by scientific bodies. Important for the history of <b>advocacy</b> of the mind control theory. Mangone makes the typical anti-cult arguments, and we need an article on the anti-cult POV about mind control, so readers can understand why they advised parents to seek deprogrammers (e.g., fighting fire with fire?). Keeping the article on the book is by no means an endorsement of the book's premise. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 02:18, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> I wanted to point out that Arthur A. Dole's book-review is the <b>only</b> review to which full text is shown. Arthur A.

Therefore, the <b>only</b> public book-review was written by a board member belonging to a foundation to which Langone is the <b>executive director</b>. This is indicative of bias. Of course the review is going to be favorable. Since there are <b>no</b> other public book-reviews, this points directly to the non-notability of this book. <a href="../../../s/s/s/User%7ESSS108_4443.html" title="User:SSS108">SSS108</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/s/s/User_talk%7ESSS108_8de2.html" title="User talk:SSS108">talk</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_SSS108_26a1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/SSS108">email</a></sup> 23:25, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think rather it shows that there is a lot of bias in the anti-cult industry. Many groups conspired to refer worried parents to deprogrammers, and it was all justified with <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html" title="Mind control">mind control</a> theories. The first thing a deprogrammer tells his victim is that the real victimizers were the "cult" and the deprogrammer is going to free his mind from cult mind control. Once they get their victim to blame everything on the cult, they can easily persuade them to leave it (and they collect their $10,000 to $20,000 fee).</li>
<li>This book, like dozens of others, supports the mind control premise. It is therefore significant as being part of the controversy over whether (A) that there is such a thing a "mind control" and cults mastered the technique or (B) recruits converted of their own free will. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 19:25, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Although running for local public office does not confer notability by itself, when combined with a growing body of independent, verifiable information -- and yes, endorsements are a part of that -- notability emerges.

But on that point, Rosenthal is a candidate for public office of a major city. True, any resident of the city can sign up to be a candidate, but those who run a serious campaign, win endorsements and gain the attention of the local news media become noteworthy candidates. There are all sorts of articles on Wikipedia on people who are only known to a particular locality. Candidates for important local public offices -- and city councils are important -- deserve attention. These politicians are poised to be the candidates of provincial/state and national offices of the future. Calton is right to point out the number of unique hits, which I neglected to check -- it was not an attempt to mislead.--<a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWaterthedog_0768.html" title="User:Waterthedog">Waterthedog</a> 10:02, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

As I see it, the essence of that proposal is summed up in this quote: "As a compromise between those who would keep all candidate articles and those who would delete all articles on yet-unelected candidates, it would be preferable if articles on elections were written before articles on individual candidates. Only if and when there is enough independent, verifiable information to write a non-stub article on a candidate should one be written." Accordingly, an article was written on the election and the article itself contains "enough independent, verifiable information" to write a non-stub article on the candidate.--<a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWaterthedog_0768.html" title="User:Waterthedog">Waterthedog</a> 16:14, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Thanks for pointing that out, for I didn't properly understand exactly what is happening with this nomination. I do not think that a candidate for a local board (even in a large world-class city) is notable. Winning the election is maybe only 3/4 of what is needed to be notable in my humble opinion (except if there is something else to add to notability). As an someone more on the inclusionist side, I get frustrated when I see what appears to me to be renominations until an article gets deleted. That is not the case in this nomination.

<li><b>Delete</b> I have serious doubts that Ms Rosenthal would be notable even if she were to win, but that would depend on what people wrote about her then; what they're writing now is not the sort of reporting that's needed to justify an article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Let's not lose sight of what is ostensibly one of our common goals: to maintain a repository of verifiable, objective information. I'm not seeing the harm in creating articles for local political candidates so long as they are not libelous and are written in an unbiased way with independent, verifiable information. Not having articles of mayoral candidates and candidates of the legislative bodies of major cities is a loss for Wikipedia. The notability of Rosenthal is borderline, I admit. But if that's the only flaw, I fail to see need for deletion. The <i>integrity</i> if information is what is really important. And, yes, if a candidate is so obscure that relevant facts about the candidacy cannot be verified then that's a problem; that's not the case with Rosenthal. The fuzzy concept of notability and broad construct of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> should not be used to suppress articles about local political candidates.--<a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWaterthedog_0768.html" title="User:Waterthedog">Waterthedog</a> 22:26, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I did not see anything under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> that mentions "electioneering platforms" per se. It does say that Wikipedia is "not a soapbox," and clarifies that its articles are not "propaganda/advocacy, self-promotional or advertising." The Rosenthal article is not an electioneering platform and it complies with the soapbox guideline because it is written in an unbiased manner. Articles about candidates for public office are not inherently biased. Again, if anyone finds wording that is biased, the remedy is to change wording, not delete the article.--<a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWaterthedog_0768.html" title="User:Waterthedog">Waterthedog</a> 17:40, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Giving Rosenthal such preferential treatment in the general election article would be biased, but having this separate article isn't. It's not a campaign ad -- yes, of course it lists endorsements, but it mentions her failed attempts to get other endorsements, and also notes criticisms of her.

<li><b>Comment</b>: That's entirely illogical. We don't make exceptions to guidelines because another article would be only partially complete as a result. If this info were to go into the elections article, then it would only improve that article and perhaps even inspire someone to more fully define this particular election article beyond a simple listing of candidates and their campaign websites. Think it unbalances the article to do so? Put the NPOV tag at the top and say on the talk page that the other candidates need info added to better meet a neutral PoV. This article isn't submitted for deletion because of uncorrectable NPoV anyways; it fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and therefore more negative info isn't mandated (nor does that somehow neutralize an unbalanced sycophantic article). <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 17:12, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

The simple issue is how we treat the verifiable information about Alix Rosenthal. Which approach best serves the readers:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(1) A general article about the election, with links to individual articles about the candidates (meaning that we keep the Rosenthal article);</dd>
<dd>(2) A general article about the election that includes information about each candidate in the level of detail of the article now proposed for deletion (meaning that we merge everything in this article into the general article, and provide comparable information about other candidates); or</dd>
<dd>(3) A general article about the election with little or no information about the candidates, so that most or all of the information in this article is expunged from Wikipedia (the consequence of deleting this article without merging).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I believe that alternative #1 is best. The general article will give people a quick idea of the parameters of the election. Those who want more detail about the race in a particular district can click through to the candidates' bios. Alternative #2 would drown the general article in an ocean of detail. Alternative #3 would excise from Wikipedia some verifiable information that many readers, in San Francisco and elsewhere, would like to have. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 18:16, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>You argue under the false pretense that verifiable info about Alix Rosenthal belongs on Wikipedia. This discussion is foremost whether Alix Rosenthal meets the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria for inclusion. That is the guideline you are ignoring (i.e., trying to find the exception to) in order to determine its appropriate context.

<li>If by "false pretense" you mean that I'm making the assumption that the information belongs on Wikipedia, no, I'm expressly <i>not</i> making that as an assumption. I included my alternative #3 to accommodate the people who want the information expunged. I just think that people who want the information expunged should be clear about it. (Some people support deletion and merger of the article. If this article is deleted, the next step will be wrangling about whether to merge it into the general article about the election.) I reject alternative #3 because I believe that the public attention attendant upon a candidacy such as this one makes a person notable. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 20:33, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Incorrect. Starchild does not have a page and is an opponent of Rosenthal. Also note that left unsaid by you is that <b>none</b> of the other candidates (who are not also incumbents) have articles. Putting this article in a very tiny minority of 1, in that regard.

<li>I didn't say that <i>all</i> of Rosenthal's opponents had articles, but I should have clarified that I meant her more prominent opponent, <a href="../../../b/e/v/Bevan_Dufty_a5c9.html" title="Bevan Dufty">Bevan Dufty</a> (the incumbent). Bevan, along with all the other incumbents in the race (with one exception), have their own articles. The fact that the office itself including most of its members have articles lends support to the notability of the candidates running for those seats. I'm not saying that all candidates running for local public offices should have their own articles, but I am saying that these candidates should not be categorically barred from having articles either. Candidates who run serious campaigns, gain the attention of the local media and win endorsements of prominent local political organizations do meet the notability threshold of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.--<a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWaterthedog_0768.html" title="User:Waterthedog">Waterthedog</a> 20:18, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

This picture is most clearly taken with a digital camera... <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 15:20, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>weak delete</b> - A list that actually limited itself to episodes where characters came out of the closet would be a useful and interesting index, however, the article includes a lot of speculation and inferences about the meaning of allegories and other stories that aren't explicitly about a character coming out of the closet. The MASH episode isn't even about coming out, it's just a mention of "gender confusion" in one little scene.

<li><b>Strong, speedy who gives a ****</b> DesertSky, I respect your efforts. Normally, since this school's article doesn't assert any notability, I'd&#160;!vote for deletion. But what's the point? Why even try? There are so many people who have nothing to do on WP besides check out the schoolwatch and then&#160;!vote keep, because somehow, all schools are inherently notable when <b>no other corporation, public institution, or group of people</b> gets that same classification. Every inclusionist will point to the keep arguments from the last- <i>failed</i>- WP:SCHOOLS proposal, or point to how this school meets the <i>idiotic</i> criteria of the current WP:SCHOOLS proposal. At least some editors (TruthbringerToronto comes to mind) actually attempt to improve articles and establish notability than just vote blindly. (Notice how there was no exclamation point before "vote" there? That's because a lot of their&#160;!votes are pure votes.) So, you know what? At this point, I'll admit defeat. I have incredible respect for the school system, but all of them are not notable; with that said, if this group of people are so adamant about their schools, let 'em have their schools. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 19:23, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Secondary school, ergo notable. Case particularly strengthened for me by the above remark. For your information, I have many better things to do on WP than continually vote "Keep" on AfDs on secondary schools (and I do not "check out the schoolwatch"), but as long as people continue to propose them for deletion I shall continue voting. Why is it that people who oppose the inclusion of a particular class of articles so often feel the need to make snide remarks aimed at people who disagree with them (also epitomised by the "usual school saving crowd" remark of the proposer)? If you had so much support in your view then presumably you would be able to muster a little more support in AfDs; since you don't, you obviously feel the need to vent your frustrations on those of us who disagree with you. Sad really. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 21:47, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>?</b> I apparently made a mistake by making this into an article because I think the subject is interesting. At least at first glance. I understand what you mean by trivial, but it does illustrate something about networks, and isn't it the just a matter of two words put together to describe a loop that can occur in a VNC, rather than a neologism.

<dd>That's Wikipedia, every second one deals with software and they forget existence of the rest of humankind. My point, without the obscure terminology, is that the effect could be accomplished rather easily with at least one common tool.

<dd>Thank you, but I don't understand how simulating a VNC Loop effect means you shouldn't mention the real cause of it. Even if we link VNC&#160;Loop (since there are such links to the undesirable term on the web) to <a href="../../../v/n/c/VNC_c6a3.html" title="VNC">VNC</a> – and mention it there – we loose the appropriateness of the associative links under ==See also== in VNC&#160;Loop as it is now. It's not only the effect that's more or less interesting to different people, it's also the cause. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfero_8db0.html" title="User:Profero">Profero</a> 02:38, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You need a tool that zooms automatically and repeatedly the area around the mouse. This adds the feedback loop and allows to create (ugly) recursive effects.

I have a feeling it is actually a collision of opinions between they who argue for deletion because their knowledge (of computing) is - or they consider it – more advanced than they who argue for keeping in value of (or just recognize) those who need finding interesting information easily (i.e. the 'uninformed' of a subject who perhaps need WP more than others, or even those who's perspective we know little about). To put it simply: what criteria can we fundamentally refer to when judging what <i>fact</i> should be defined trivial and withheld from 'a few' others. I really hope it's not arrogance. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfero_8db0.html" title="User:Profero">Profero</a> 21:09, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As one of the people associated with the website I am a bit bias but I would like to explain. Several people have been commenting on that fact that the journal is not significant because of its hit count on Google. This is due to a technical problem on our website, which means Google was unable to crawl our site beyond the homepage. This problem has now been fixed and when Google next crawled the website, it will be updated. Interims of its reputability, it is growing quickly and I would ask if it could at least stay for a couple of months until the next issue is published and a decision could be made then.</li>

Using Google, Lexis-Nexis, and Newsbank I can find no non-trivial, non-local, reliable sources featuring them.

<p>I want to argue that using your guideline for music, that one of the members has since become a member of the National tour of RENT - Jed Resnick -- which you can check at <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/showinfo.cfm?showid=932" class="external free" title="http://www.broadwayworld.com/showinfo.cfm?showid=932" rel="nofollow">http://www.broadwayworld.com/showinfo.cfm?showid=932</a> and another member has a role on the ABC show HEROES -- which you can check at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiro_Nakamura" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiro_Nakamura" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiro_Nakamura</a>. Althogh Hiro is not a part of a musical band he still is part of a well-known show. Also this website is along the same lines as The Whiffenpoofs so what makes this article less reputable than that one? Do you need for the article to be formatted so that there are more links with our information or what exactly? Your attention to this would be greatly appreciated. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 138.16.22.179 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_138.16.22.179_6035.html" title="Special:Contributions/138.16.22.179">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>For me, what makes this article unsalvageable is not its content, but its subject. You have to show that The BN's are notable, and to show that they're notable, you have to show that they've been the primary subject of multiple reliable sources. The article on The Whiffenpoofs needs references, but I looked, and refs are at least out there, so that article is salvageable. I looked for good refs on The BN's, and found none.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for WP:MUSIC: (1) It's a guideline, not a policy. (2) The criterion you refer to was conceived thinking of a band with a (more or less) fixed number of members, not a college group with rotating membership that compiles dozens or hundreds of ex-members. (3) The sentence in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> you are referring to concludes as follows: "note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such." In this case, a mention of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masi_Oka_a2b2.html" title="Masi Oka">Masi Oka</a>'s involvement with The BN's, in his article, may be appropriate (if such involvement has been noted in a third-party publication). (As for Jed Resnick, I see he doesn't have his own article, and does not appear notable enough to get one.)</dd>

<li>I embarked upon this request before the creator of the article supplied a useful rationale for the article existing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMahound&amp;diff=82870327&amp;oldid=82869436" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMahound&amp;diff=82870327&amp;oldid=82869436" rel="nofollow">here</a>. From that, I appear to have stumbled into an edit war on another article that this was thought to be a solution to. Now, I don't agree for several reasons - forking an article is rarely a good idea when trying to create <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> texts; I know a (non-devout, quite the reverse, but still) muslim-origin person named Mahound; the article as it stands lacks con<u>text</u> so readers would be as lost as I was; but nevertheless, it was a good faith solution to an awful problem. Prior to my fellow editor intervening, I had speedy deleted this. Now I'm left thinking that, whilst this is still a speedy delete for several reasons, the article may have a requirement to continue to exist. So I'd like <b>advice</b> here. Yes folks, this is an <i>admin</i> who would like others to advise him. Explain to me what you think and why. Give reasons. Don't just "vote" (this isn't a vote, don't let people tell you it is) but give me reasoning. No one here is going to just count heads. If you do give reasoning, it will help <b>me</b> in future when I'm on CSD patrol.

I understand the point of avoiding POV forks. I am also not committed to this article, but it seemed the right thing. The information in the article is more or less the contents of an ongoing edit war at <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>. My thought was that a pejorative term, if it is a notable pejorative term of a notable subject, might be more appropriate in an article under the cat of pejorative terms, rather than in the biographical article of the person involved, just as we have an article on the word <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a> as well as one on <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_Intercourse_6c1d.html" title="Sexual Intercourse">Sexual Intercourse</a>.

If the name/term Mahound is <i>not</i> a pejorative term, then the claims that it <b>is</b>, should be removed from the Muhammad article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't believe this is a POV fork, and I'll use the whole of this comment block to explain why, then give my advise in the next column. It was basically one man who wanted to remove the whole section, as it appeared, because he didn't like any mention of Mohammed in a negative context. This section has stood for months, with parts of it there for years. I might like to point out that he was immediately banned for violating 3RR and being uncivil (e.g, <i>you are an animal</i>; this was his fourth such block). However, when I saw the section, which others seemed to be reverting in full, it seemed like a bit of an aside to me, so I removed a good portion of it (which BostonMA has restored it nearly in full on this page). We didn't need a long discussion on this specific term, because the article is about <i>Mohammed</i>, not variations of his name (what does some modern cleric declaring Jihad on all who use the term have anything to do with Mohammed?).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>For now, <b>Keep the article</b> or <b>Rename it to Variations of the name Mohammed</b> (with a redirect), as per the citations, but <i>make sure this is reliable information first</i>. This is not POV fork, as I explained above. It is also relevant: it is quite possible that people will want to find information on this name (or other variations of the name) for a research subject. It certainly doesn't fail WP:NN. I will try to remove some of the blatantly POV language, and I will put a disputed tag at the top of the article until someone can give a better description, because <i>you're right</i>, the information is suspicious. So I say keep the article, but only if we can come up with reliable info.-<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">(talk)</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">(contribs)</a></sup> 22:58, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This list was deleted on June 21, 2006 in an 8-2 vote that showed a strong consensus that this list did not contribute anything that could not be accomplished by categories. I have just discoverd that almost exactly one month later, <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a>, with apparent full knowledge of the original consensus (as evidenced by a comment he made on the article's talk page), decided to disregard the will of the community and recreate the page, a move I personally consider to be irresponsible if he realized the prior debate result before creating the page. All the reasons for deletetion from the first arguement (found <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_schools_in_Kenya_7f60.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of schools in Kenya">here</a>) still apply, plus the additional negative of a recreation undertaken in violation of clear consensus (though this is not a speedy candidate because it is sufficiently different from the original version). <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 22:07, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>What is significantly different from the previous version? If it was a lst of schools in Kenya then, and a list of schools in Kenya now, it seems like nothing has really changed. Erring on the side of caution, I'll say <b>Strong Delete</b> instead of a speedy one. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Olsen_0313.html" title="User:Daniel Olsen">Daniel Olsen</a> 22:36, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I personally agree with your point, but the makeup of the list has changed, so I think it would be too controversial to speedy it, which is why I brought it here.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Personally I prefer categories over lists, but I don't see any necessity to delete it either. But to be fair, if this list is deleted, then the same should apply to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_Germany_44ca.html" title="List of schools in Germany">List of schools in Germany</a> and most other similar lists. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulius_Sahara_5577.html" title="User:Julius Sahara">Julius Sahara</a> 22:41, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> (and the Germany list too even while it contains only gymnasiums and didn't yet expand elsewhere). Such lists tend to grow w/o regard to notability, just to cover everything and result in one line stubs "xyz is a school in abc". If Wikipedia implements some database mechanims schools may be good candidate to be covered completely but current structure does not fit. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 23:30, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The initial AfD is a classic example of a terribly argued justification for deletion, followed by a series of unreasoned votes for deletion that use such inspired arguments as "schoolcruft" and "red-link farm". Without any valid justification referring to Wikipedia policy, this article was deleted. The article was recreated, addressing the limited number of minor legitimate issues raised in the initial AfD. Despite the meaningless rhetoric in the initial AfD, lists and categories are not equivalent and do not -- and never can -- serve the same purposes. The fact that the nominator (and those voting delete, for that matter) doesn't even bother to refer to any Wikipedia policy that bans lists, or articles with many red links, speaks strongly for the retention of this and other, similar articles. While there are a few red links, these are NOT a justification to delete an article, but can serve as placeholders for future articles and will magically turn blue once the corresponding articles were created. The fact that lists CAN have red links is a point in their favor. This article groups the various schools into categories, yet another function that categories cannot fulfill. Any AfD (see the initial attempt) that uses any form of the word "cruft" is a strong argument for a <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 05:37, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> In violation of policy, the above comment was deleted, and has been restored as strokethrough, which I assume was intended. My comments aim specifically at the issue of whether or not this article should be retained. I would suggest that any discussion regarding the deletion of this or any other list make specific reference to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a> that would justify deletion of this particular article. We need to see a far more meaningful explanation of what is not being fulfilled in this particular article under this or any other policy, and none has been provided. This list fulfills all three of the primary purposes of a list as specified in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a>: Information, Navigation and Development; none of which are fully satisfied by a category. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 06:20, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>There is nothing I can find in the AfD policy that says I cannot delete my own comment if I so desire. I realized after reading your comments a second time that they were not as harsh as I thought and removed my message asking you to be more civil, having concluded that you were perfectly civil and I was in error. If my reading is incorrect, then cite me the rule saying that comments cannot be deleted and then restore the comment again. Otherwise, just let it be.</li>

<dd>Hmmm, I see you feel rather strongly on this issue, but in your haste to bash the original AfD, you appear to have gotten a little carried away. You are correct that policy does not dictate that there be no redundant lists and categories, but that does not mean that being redundant is not bad form. When a list is not doing anything that a category cannot do, it is generally not that useful to have the list as well. One reason for this is just plain old efficiancy. Doing the same thing two ways can lead to confusion and contradictory organization. Second, categories would have absolutely no point if we just used lists, so the fact that the category system was created after people started making lists implies that these were intended to replace lists in some areas. Finally, despite what you have said above, redlinks can be a very bad thing. Allowing for redlinks may enocurage the creation of things that do not belong on wikipedia, which is why categories are a much nicer way of corraling this information. Also, redlinks are just plain ugly, and while some may be filled, they will not all necessarily be so. If redlinks are so good, why do we not create disambiguation pages for every possible topic that can have more than one entry even when only one entry exists with an article?</dd>

<dd>Furthermore, the original nomination was never about schoolcruft as was made very clear in the nomination itself. There were votes that were cast solely on the issue of the school debate, but I never went there and still do not intend to here. Also, to say that categories and lists cannot ever serve the same purpose as you say above is a most ridiculous statement. If a category contains all the articles on wikipedia that pertain to, say, Cincinanti Reds players and a list exists that does the same thing with no redlinks or annotations and with the same organization, then the list and category are exactly the same. I would avoid absoultes if I were you. I am not claiming that this list is exactly the same as the category of the same name, but your claim that lists and categories can never be the same is just not true. As for your other point that a categories cannot group these schools into categories (that just sounds silly on its face now, doesn't it), this is also not true since it is possible to have subcategories. I do not harbor any illusions of convincing you to change your vote, as anyone who makes blanket statements like "Any AfD (see the initial attempt) that uses any form of the word "cruft" is a strong argument for a Keep" is not interested in looking beyond shallow surface considerations, but I am hoping to illustrate that there is room for debate on this issue as there are with many others. If there was really no other way to vote on this article, then people would not do so. Try to assume a little more good faith and tone down your own rhetoric a little too please. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 06:35, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If you are picking up any issues regarding rhetoric, they are solely based on the tone of your nomination. While I appreciate your narrowly-worded baseball scenario where a list and a category would be equivalent, there are many situations that simply cannot be handled by categories, red links being among them. I appreciate your aesthetic issues with red links, and your assumption that "the category system was created after people started making lists implies that these were intended to replace lists in some areas", as well as your worries about potential confusion. However none of these are valid justifications to delete this or any other list. Lists and categories serve different purposes that work in synch with each other. Again, we need to seem a well-argued case that makes reference to a <b>Wikipedia policy</b> that would justify deleting this list. You have failed to do so in your initial nomication, in the current nomination, or in any of the replies included here. Aesthetic issues or fears of red links run amok are not valid justifications. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 06:47, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fair enough. I agree that I was a bit sloppy in looking to official policy the first time around, perhaps relying too much in the language of my nomination and arguements on "gut instinct" to pave my way, and I applaud your efforts to dig deeper than these gut impressions. Now I hasten to point out that this is actually the way AfD works in 9 out of 10 cases, as admins do not usually get to the substance of debates and just look at the votes. Not a justification per se, but an observation on life. As for an official policy arguement, I am prepared to make one. I understand you will probably disagree with me and not change your mind, but I do not see this as a problem since many interpretations are valid and yours is not at all out of line.</li>

<dd>According to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, Wikipedia is not a directory or a yellowpages that merely exists to list what institutions exist and where they are located. Now obviously, the organization of articles is excepted from this rule, but when it comes to listing insitutions this line is easily blurred. A list of this kind with a lot of redlinks is serving as a directory; a list with no redlinks is redundant with a category and therefore not needed for organization. While this list is annotated, the annotations do not enhance the organizational structure in a meaningful way in my opinion. It is actually conceivable to have lists of nearly anything that are vaguely connected and make a few annotations, but this does not seem a sound way to build an encyclopedia. Perhaps this would be indescriminate collecting of information, also in violation of policy, but I am not sure. I remain unconvinced that this list is doing anything that a category system cannot. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 07:03, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Given the equivalence of lists and categories for many purposes, an argument to delete a list on this basis would be an equally valid reason to delete a corresponding category. We have been given a clear set of rules on this exact subject at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a>, none of which provides a justification to delete this article.

<li>I disagree with you on two counts. I do feel this is a directory and that this term is loose enoguh to encompass a list like this. I figured you would disagree and as stated before agree it is open to interpretation, but there you have it. As to your other points, I completely disagree. The list and category policies are just guidelines. While they do have persuasive authority and are valid to cite to in an arguement to keep, they do not have controlling authority and do not leave us "no choice but to keep this article." <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 16:40, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>While I thoroughly disagree with your interpretation, I think it is clear that the argument for deletion is nowhere near as clear cut as you had made it appear in the nomination for this article. As the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes_edc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes">Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes</a> guideline provides clearcut support for retention, I hope you will recognize that the deletion of this and other lists boils down to personal aesthetic preferences, not policy violations. As this article has an eminently supported justification for retention, I sincerely hope that you can see that there are many users who would prefer to see this (and other similar articles) retained for their benefit. You can feel free to refrain from using this and other lists, while allowing others to enjoy the policy. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 16:53, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As I already said in my comment above, it is absurd that this particular article is nominated for deletion while other similar lists are not. In the end this one is compact, well structured and not a "red link farm" (although, as already mentioned by someone, red links in lists are not that bad). Yet, I believe these lists are somewhat problematic, since they are just list of random schools. It would be easier, if this list contained only most notable schools, but defining notability in this case may be difficult. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulius_Sahara_5577.html" title="User:Julius Sahara">Julius Sahara</a> 20:54, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The board messages that are referred to above are not advertisments but information approved and sometimes even <i>requested</i> (on heroesportal.net) by the board owners. There is no copyright note at the end of the article. Why do you think non-wiki Google hits are bad? The only real reason that could be taken in account out of everything listed here is 'non-notable', but is that really the best reason for get rid of one kilobyte of data? Wikipedia is the Free Encyclopedia, and this means everybody can and <i>should</i> add information to it as much as possible.

<p>I nominate this page for deletion on the grounds that the person is not notable except for the fact that he is a BNP councillor. I suspect a bit of BNP self-promotion.--Ketlan 23:37, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> In the article's discussion page I wrote "He's prominent all right. Elected as a Bradford councillor (beating Conservative sitting member). Features regularly in BNP publications." (And my apologies for the oversight in not signing that.) I don't know why this article was started, but I have added some detail to it. It is not my intention to promote the BNP and self-promotion is out of the question here. Here's why he is notable. (I am now going to stray into POV areas, but this is a discusssion where views are allowed and expected, not an article, so OK.) He is notable not because he was ELECTED, not because he is a COUNCILLOR, not because he BEAT A SITTING CANDIDATE from a mainstream party, but because he is all of that AND represents a neo-Nazi party. That makes him stand out from the run-of-the-mill. The BNP uses him as a mask of respectability ("look, we have a councillor who beat the Tories"). In addition, there are background issues (not yet resolved, but you will find them if you do a Google search) that suggest bribery of voters, police raids etc etc. How to cover these in the article without accusations of bias I don't know, but I'm working on it. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 00:09, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The fact that he's a current councillor, having beaten an assortment of other parties, is irrelevant - other BNP councillors (indeed, many councillors from any party) are in precisely the same position of having beaten a sitting councillor to get where they are. I used to be a councillor and I beat a sitting councillor but I'm not in here.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know of the background issues involved (and I'd leave off mentioning that in the article at all until verdicts are in if I were you, to avoid any chance of litigation) but I don't consider that this marks him out - so many BNP councillors have criminal records that he would still be no great exception even if he should be tried and found guilty. I'm inclined to let it go just because you used the phrase 'neo-nazi' but I don't think these people should be legitimised in any way unless they've done something exceptional (like Derek Beacon, for example).</p>
