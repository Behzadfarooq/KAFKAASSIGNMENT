<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Neologism? I have seen the term used in books and magazines decades old. For example, <i>A Margin of Hope</i> by <a href="../../../i/r/v/Irving_Howe_fb28.html" title="Irving Howe">Irving Howe</a> was reviewed in the Winter 1982/83 issue of <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_Affairs_e653.html" title="Foreign Affairs">Foreign Affairs</a></i> as <i>"A compelling account of the author's youth, education, and decades of warfare in the <b>anti-Stalinist Left</b>."</i> So the term was clearly well-understood by then. The term is also used in the May 24, 1982 issue of the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i>, on a separate subject from Howe and Wald's books: <i>"Nowhere were these issues more vigorously debated than in the offices of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partisan_Review_1bf0.html" title="Partisan Review">Partisan Review</a> - the leading magazine of the <b>anti-Stalinist left</b> and for many years a kind of highly tuned seismograph of the intellectual climate."</i> This was a major intellectual current within the Left in its time. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 11:31, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And in another context (still relevant to the article, though), here's <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_%28magazine%29.html" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> Magazine way back in <i>1946</i> talking about "Anti-Stalinist leftists": <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,776652-3,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,776652-3,00.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> And <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanna_Rosin_2364.html" title="Hanna Rosin">Hanna Rosin</a> in <i><a href="../../../s/l/a/Slate_Magazine_82e2.html" title="Slate Magazine">Slate</a></i> freely talking about the "anti-Stalinist leftists of the 1930s and '40s": <a href="http://www.slate.com/?id=2073672" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.slate.com/?id=2073672" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>" <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 11:44, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I created this page, so I've got a vested interest. I'm not sure what you mean by "neologism" - yes, it was coined at some point in the 1930s as a neologism, but has become part of the vocabulary of the left. The collections of political tendencies are diverse, but they are not arbitrary: as the article says, "The term anti-Stalinist left tends to be used in relation to those currents of the left that <b>define themselves centrally</b> in opposition to Stalinism, rather than anyone on the left who is critical of Stalinism." <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobfrombrockley_29ed.html" title="User:Bobfrombrockley">BobFromBrockley</a> 11:58, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, the problem is exactly in the formulation "tends to be used". The term is a POV usage by certain groups for their own self-identification, rather than an encyclopediatic criteria. There are many other contextual identifications, like 'Revolutionary Left', 'Progressive Left', which have no encyclopediatic article value of their own. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 12:45, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: What you're essentially saying here, Soman, is that only proper nouns deserve encyclopedia pages, as pretty much everything else falls into the "tends to be used" category, from <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revisionism.html" title="Revisionism">revisionism</a> to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressivism.html" title="Progressivism">progressivism</a> to, for that matter, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist.html" title="Socialist">socialist</a>, which are all context-bound, but surely deserve pages? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobfrombrockley_29ed.html" title="User:Bobfrombrockley">BobFromBrockley</a> 13:20, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: No, that's not what I'm saying. Ideologies like <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">Socialism</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">Conservatism</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotskyism.html" title="Trotskyism">Trotskyism</a> are ideologies that can be quite clearly defined, an should thus have separate articles. 'Anti-Stalinist left' concernes various ideological tendencies, grouped together. This is where the contextuality becomes problematic. Who defines that it is these tendencies comprise one single movement, in spite that their formulations of policy and political action are separate? --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 13:42, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: <i>"'Anti-Stalinist left' concernes various ideological tendencies, grouped together."</i> The exact same can be said of <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">Liberalism</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">Conservatism</a>. Why not delete those, as well? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 19:36, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment'</b>:&#160;? Liberalism and Conservatism are rather clearly demarcated ideologies. There is for example, a Liberal International. This doesn't mean that they are homogenous ideologies. Is there any Anti-Stalinist left movement? No. However there are left movements which oppose Stalinism. But these various tendencies have no other common denominator than their opposition to Stalin. We cannot have categorizing article on every issue that 2 or more groupings take a common standpoint. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 19:40, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> JSTORE gives 339 hits, Google Scholar gives 985, one substntial academic book uses it in the title: <i>The New York intellectuals&#160;: the rise and decline of the anti-Stalinist left from the 1930s to the 1980s / by Alan M. Wald</i> <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0807841692</a> - I think thats enough to rebut neologism (which I understand as not making terms up to use on WP, rather than them having small currency IRL).

<li><b>Comment</b>: "Revolutionary left" gives 147 000 hits, but that by itself doesn't motivate an article that simply states "The term revolutionary left tends to be used in relation to those currents of the left that <b>define themselves centrally</b> in opposition to reformism". Likewise with "democratic left", etc. Just cause a wording is used in a book title doesn't mean it should have an article of its own. (For example, "Revolutionary Idealism and Parliamentary Politics: A Study of Trotskyism in Sri Lanka" by M. Somasundram alone does not motivate a separate article for Revolutionary idealism). --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 13:46, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Well known term, and one that's also useful as many leftist grops defined themselves by their opposition to Stalinism, as pointed out above. 'Neologism' as a reason to tag for deletion is clearly ridiculous-the term has been around for years and is widely used, to refer to this specific movement. Why wasn't this raised on the discussion page before it got to this extreme stage?<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFelix-felix_6e81.html" title="User:Felix-felix">Felix-felix</a> 14:05, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> and <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFelix-felix_6e81.html" title="User:Felix-felix">Felix-felix</a>'s question should be addressed: Why is this on AfD before other discussion on the page itself? Wikipedia is institutionally a tertiary source reflecting existing peer reviewed secondary sources. The fact that the term is specifically referenced in a Univ. of NC Press book title is ON ITS OWN evidence that this article reflects scholarly work, and the numerous citations of the term given in this discussion only reinforce that. Whether the original nom or anyone else has issues with the term is irrelevant from wikipedia standards as the term passes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I'd like to see more direct footnoting in the article to ensure there's no OR taking place, but as there are references, any OR issues (as is standard) can be addressed by article editors, not AfD. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 15:20, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, and suggest <b>speedy keep</b> per <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> if nothing else. This is historically quite important. Given the twentieth century equation of the Left with various Marxist tendencies, it became quite important for non-Stalinist leftists to distance themselves from Stalinism. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:30, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b> Essential part of 20th century political history.

To clarify, I used the term neologism in the sense that the definitions set here constitute an invented usage of a term for POV purposes.

<li><b>Keep</b> I remember this term too. It's an important concept in American history. I would look up the sources for this, but I can see that others already have. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 03:19, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
