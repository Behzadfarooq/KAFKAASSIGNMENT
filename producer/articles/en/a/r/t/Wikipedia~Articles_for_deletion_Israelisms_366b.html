<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. It is unfortunate that so many people's first experience with Wikipedia is AfD. We have nothing against the show. It just does not meet the notability requirements we have for articles. Perhaps it will in a couple of years. If anyone is puzzled by the outcome: AfD is not a vote, though it may look like one.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The Alexa ranking indicates that the show / site is NOT popular and has extremely low traffic (for comparison, Google.com has an Alexa ranking of 3). Wikipedia is not an advertising platform to "get the word out". <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 12:35, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. Since you felt the need to add the big pink box lower down the page it seems that traffic is flowing to wikipedia. Therefore, I think it's fair to say that this is not an being used as an advertisement, but a way to share information - which is my understanding of what wikipedia is supposed to be about. I've learned a lot about the show and its creators by reading this page. I would hope that if given a chance there will be an episode by episode account - similar to what was done with many television shows. DrumIntellect 18:34, 18 August 2006 (EST)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. The "big pink box" was added because of the flood of <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose accounts</a> that have been voting here. That's generally considered questionable, and is usually a sign that somebody is trying to "stuff the ballot box". <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 03:03, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Preserve</b> I am regular listener and also a member of the same podcasting network. I'm pretty new to Wikipedia, but I have seen listings here for radio shows, so I would think that rules for a podcast would be similar. Also note, Israelisms has an active forum board, so this is more than just a podcast. As far as I know, Israelisms is the only podcast of its kind that provides a man (and woman) on the street perspective of current news events in Israel. I think it has value. The listing as it is currently written doesn't sound overly promotional to me. --Mfogarty 15:30, 18 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Mfogarty (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mfogarty_618a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mfogarty">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Preserve</b> The Israelisms Podcast is unique in that it brings perspectives on Israel to the world in a way that is not available through mainstream media. My family and friends use the program as a starting point of discussion on political and moral issues. In that sense, it is an important Podcast. It seems like a user here has an issue with the listing being promotional, a grievance that may be better addressed by suggesting an edit, rather than a deletion. <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Sgersh (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sgersh_adb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sgersh">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Preserve</b> Why on earth would you delete this page? This is a well-known entity. It is notable. It is not transient or temporary. Even if it was terrible (which it isn't) it does, in fact, exist and is public, and people might want to research this to find out more about it -- which are all pretty good critieria for having an entry on Wikipedia. -- Ron in Croton <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: 64.115.214.26 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.115.214.26_e91b.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.115.214.26">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<ul>
<li><b>What issue</b> I have viewed the wikipedia entries for The Closer,Hell's Kitchen,JawBone Radio, and I fail to see any issue that would cause this article to be nominated for deletion Other than the Fact that the name for the entry is Israelisms. I have looked at all the guidelines about article deletion and find no disparity against said guidelines. I am not a contributor or a user therefore I have no biased opinion except for the facts that are spelled out by Wikipedia users. This is a new site - I see no issues with it compared to any other site except for someone's personal bias. It would benefit the administrators to look into all the other sites mentioned above before issuing their decree upon this article. --John M. 21:32, 18 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Gigasr (<a href="../../../g/i/g/User_talk%7EGigasr_d739.html" title="User talk:Gigasr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gigasr_6d68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gigasr">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>This is a single purpose account.</b> After all, I just created it. The longtime editors can ignore all new voices as "Single Purpose Account" all they want to, and ignore the fact that once upon a time, THEIR accounts could also have been tagged as "Single Purpose" but the fact remains -- just because this is the first time I have felt the need to say something doesn't mean that I am not a Wikipedia user. It simply means that this is the first time I have been aggravated enough to SAY something. It's clear that everyone arguing in favor of keeping the page are using "Single Purpose" accounts, and that they are Podcast listeners. What is not as clear are the motives of the "editors" who have seen fit to comment on the legitimacy of this page. Editors acting in good faith would actually address the questions raised by those here -- how is this page different than others referenced above that have not been challenged? How can the page be edited to make it more closely conform to Wikipedia policies?<a href="../../../y/c/a/User%7EYcartreel_ddd0.html" title="User:Ycartreel">Ycartreel</a> 03:34, 19 August 2006 (UTC)ycartreel <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: <a href="../../../y/c/a/User%7EYcartreel_ddd0.html" title="User:Ycartreel">Ycartreel</a> (<a href="../../../y/c/a/User_talk%7EYcartreel_af99.html" title="User talk:Ycartreel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ycartreel_ab05.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ycartreel">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

And, I know that the Israelisms web site asked for help in maintaining the article here in Wikipedia, but in all honesty - we are all amateurs in the Wikipedia process and are learning. Please know that the Israelisms site receives no funding for its podcast and we pay nothing to listen. And I know that the Israelisms article may not have a huge readership, but a small crowd is valuable too...yes? I would ask that the contributor who is asking for the deletion please help us instead to change the wording or make it a better article. In fact, I would ask that all who come here would please help us to do a better job. Thank you, --Staceyferguson 11:13, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Preserve</b> I too am a first time contributor and have come here because, as a listener of the Israelisms podcast, I have been made aware of the fact that someone is challenging the right for Israelisms to have an entry in Wikipedia. It is not like this is the first podcast to have an entry. Two of podcasts I listen to - Extralife and Jawbone Radio - have entries and I have read all three entries again before making these comments and I really don't think that the Israelisms entry is any more an advertisement for their show than the other two. Therefore I really must question Dseryn's motives for singling Israelisms out.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I didn't "single out" Israelisms; I stumbled across it while doing some disambiguation. However, your point about the other podcasts is a good one - perhaps those should be scrutinized also.

<li><b>No delete'</b> Thanks for the comment Weak Delete: we agree 1 criteria has been met.Podcasting at best has been main stream for only about 18 months,[check Adam Curry's wiki]I say why kill off an entire growing industry,let alone one podcast out of 123 <a href="../../../p/o/d/Category%7EPodcasts_42a2.html" title="Category:Podcasts">Category:Podcasts</a>.The community has set this precedent not the One but the many. The Web! Tell me what's a webby award or a blogger award.These are Products created by those to foward their creations ie Blogging software,web site design etc. These also are niche awards for the few do they deserve a Wiki. This i can say the birthing pains of an industry are tough enough to overcome,But the narrow mindedness of a few over this one article is intolerable. Should we accept the rough guidelines a few recklessly use as their athority the wiki would count in the 10's of thousand and not the millions.Israelisms should no more be deleted than the first bloggers or the first web designer placed in this community.

<li><b>Preserve</b> Questionable notability for this deletion seems to be it is considered Advertising. Wikipedia defines advertising as "Advertising is the commercial promotion of goods, services, companies and ideas...". Israelisms is NOT a commercial enterprise or affliated with any commercial enterprise. Israelims does NOT promote goods or services. Therefore the Advertising basis cannot work.

<li><b>Preserve</b> There are many entries in Wikipedia for "pop culture" items that wouldn't be the subject of a traditional encyclopedia - I kind of thought this was the point of Wikipedia - it can be more current and responsive to new trends than a traditional encyclopedia. Yes the article could have some information added but what is already there is accurate and would be helpful to people who are looking for background information about the show. As others have said there are articles about other podcasts, radio shows, books, tv shows etc that are similar in style and content to this one and unless we're going to rid wikipedia of them all there is nothing to separate the Israelisms entry from those others. Oh and yes I have just created this account - I last contributed to Wikipedia a year ago and I don't remember the password I had then. But why should someone have to be interested in more than one wikipedia article in order to have what is considered a valid opinion? Why isn't the wikipedia community seeing this as an opportunity to engage a whole swag of new participants? How can an article that generates lots of 'single purpose accounts' be considered an article that there is no interest in (I'm reliably informed you cannot have your cake and eat it too) BSquaredInOz 03:50, 21 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: BSquaredInOz (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BSquaredInOz_31ab.html" title="Special:Contributions/BSquaredInOz">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>.</li>

<p>Firstly I am a First Time Poster, but I would like you to consider my point of view. I did become aware of this discussion, through mention of the website, but I am here voicing my own opinion. This is not about winning a Vote.</p>
<p>Please consider keeping Israelisms, in your Wikie Encyclopedia. Their show may be controversial to some, due to their point of view, being Jewish.</p>
<p>Although their opinions, may not match other people's, Ideals, it is none the less valid, because it is the perspective of those living within Israel, today.</p>
<p>This makes them Unique, and I challenge anyone to find another Podcast, that compares to it. It is their Uniqueness, that should qualify them to be in your Wikie.</p>
<p>To what I am aware of, they at no time, try to attempt to sell anything, while I have been listening to them. It is seems more of a Political Show, that reflects what it is like to live in Israel today. I fear, that the questioning of Israelisms, in the Wikie, may be more about Censorship, than concern about Advertising. I enjoy listening to their show, because I get a Window into their world, that I could not obtain through other means, including the various News Broadcasts.</p>
