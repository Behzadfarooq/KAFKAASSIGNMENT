<p>From the history, this page was created on 26 May 2005. Has only always consisted of one line, "<a href="../../../h/u/d/Huddersfield.html" title="Huddersfield">Huddersfield</a>, Jamaica (or Haddersfield) is a small settlement located in the St Mary parish Jamaica." Wikilink is to a Huddersfield in England. Am unable to find any evidence that there actually is a Jamaican Huddersfield through quick google. If there really <i>is</i> a small settlement called Huddersfield in Jamaica, it may be so small as to be difficult to write a meaningful article about; there is as yet no evidence I can see that this is even real. Somewhat shockingly, however, according to <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,22989-1696415,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,22989-1696415,00.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> <i>Times</i> article, one of those horrible London bombers was born in Jamaica and went to live <i>in the British Huddersfield</i>.

<ul>
<li>So remove the link and bold the title, which is the appropriate way to format Wikipedia articles. If this is a real place, <b>keep</b>, we have lots of articles on tiny towns, and I encourage the creation of more, since the lists of small towns are highly US-dominant, since nobody has done a Rambot on other countries. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 23:27, September 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>According to this link <a href="http://www.go4yp.com/Country/Jamaica/Parish-of-Saint-Mary.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.go4yp.com/Country/Jamaica/Parish-of-Saint-Mary.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> there <i>is</i> a Haddersfield (or Huddersfield, both spellings are current) in the parish of St Mary. <b>Speedy Keep</b> and off to Cleanup once the discussion is closed. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 23:30, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> and enter as a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_7c5b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles">requested article</a>. I think that things like this should not be considered articles at all, but as badly executed article requests. The only information they convey is the fact that somebody wanted there to be an article on this topic. Put it up as a requested article and then as soon as someone actually feels like writing one, we'll have one. In the meantime, there's no point in keeping this around. Nobody who happens to look up "Huddersfield, Jamaica" in Wikipedia will be pleased at finding this. If nobody has expanded it in three months it's highly improbable that anyone will soon. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:45, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</s></li>

<li>I'd say that unlike sch**ls, towns and villages are inherently notable. The trouble with this one is that it is in the poorest part of Jamaica and apparently very small on top of that. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 00:14, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Thanks everyone. I couldn't myself find evidence to decide the question of whether this was a hoax (which if it were is grounds for deletion) or real (which if it were, I was sure my talented fellow WPns would discover, even if I could'nt). This is why I waited before entering a vote rather than place it along with the nom like I normally would. Pilatus, good job finding that link. So there definitely seems to be a H<b><u>a</u></b>ddersfield in this Parish St Mary place. I'm not sure why you said it's known by both names; the link only describes a Haddersfield. Do you have further info? Grutness' link is to a place in St.Mary; would this be the same place as the Parish? Given the available info, my vote would be to <b>redirect</b> this page to one created at <a href="../../../h/a/d/Haddersfield%2C_Jamaica_bce3.html" title="Haddersfield, Jamaica">Haddersfield, Jamaica</a> which would contain the current text and Pilatus' link as a basic ref. A disambig page for this and the British city would be good. There seems to be a general consensus for the name to include Jamaica, as seen <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities_in_Jamaica_c06f.html" title="List of cities in Jamaica">here</a>. If this is eventually closed without a consensus to delete, I'd be willing to do the legwork (creating the new page, the disambig, and doing the redirect).—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">encephalon</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#606060">έγκέφαλος</font></a>&#160; 07:21:52, 2005-09-09 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>LOL. I see that Kappa and Pilatus are already on it (except the redirect is going the other way). Cool. I think, given that the evidence we currently have only substantiates the name with an "a", I prefer the redirect the other way. But since one can't redirect a page that's under AfD, I'll wait. Thanks guys.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">encephalon</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#606060">έγκέφαλος</font></a>&#160; 07:27:50, 2005-09-09 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I've added a bit more information. It's still very stubby, but at least it's been pinpointed now. Oh, and I reversed the direction of the redirect! <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 13:40, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font>

<li>Oops. Forgot that I shouldn't do that while there's an AfD in place... hope there won't be any problems... <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a></i></small></font></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - <b>Haddersfield</b> is the correct spelling but it is known locally as Huddersfield.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. All cities, towns, villages, or any other things you'll find in a real atlas or encyclopedia are notable, no matter what country in which they are located. (Even RickK agreed - see <a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERambot_Delete_992c.html" title="User talk:Rambot/Delete">User talk:Rambot/Delete</a> for precedents on deleting Rambot articles.) <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html" title="User:Rambot">Rambot</a>'s contributions on cities, which were mostly computer-generated rather than written by human users, have been great, and they've really helped us with building up articles on places and other things one would find in a real encyclopedia. I'd love to see projects like Rambot's extended to other countries besides the U.S., to keep us from getting too US/UK-centric around here, but until we have bots covering every city in the world, we'll just need to rely on human editors. Also, having articles for all of the towns helps keep people interested in editing here, if they can go find an incomplete article on their town and add information about what makes their town unique. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 19:33, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
