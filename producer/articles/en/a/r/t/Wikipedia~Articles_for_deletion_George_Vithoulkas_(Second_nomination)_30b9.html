<p>The subject's work has been the subject of uncritical reviews in a hoemopathy journal (of unknown significance), but there is a dearth of independent review of this man and his work, and the book reviews indicate that this work is at the hard core pseudoscience end of homeopathy. The text is still pretty much the original lifted from his website, since he (or his webmasters) changed the copyright notice specifically so the article would not be deleted as a copyright violation. I can't find any evidence of mainstream coverage, certainly nothing outside of sources which are promoting homeopathy. I do not myself consider a review of a book by a journal committed to promoting the subject of the book to be independent under the meaning of the act, but even if we did this is a source for the book not the author, I think. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 16:34, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

It clearly gives an alternative viewpoint of the work of Vithoulkas, and as WP:NPOV requires, viewpoints should be shown: the credentials and position of the author indicate that he is <b>well informed</b> on the subject and his <b>views are noteworthy</b>. " So, 3 positive reviews, from the same source (bookshop and journal), and authors including MDs that work in the same hospital, are now "of unknown significance"&#160;?

<li><b>Absolute keep</b> Is this some kind of sick joke? It is completely absurd that this article is again being proposed for deletion given the amount of sourced information in the article and the amount of information that was posted in the last AFD. The guy has 100,000 hits on Google (and before anyone jumps in again and says "how do we know those hits are for "this" Vithoulkas", please do a random browse through those hits. You'll find that at least 98% (if not more) are for George Vithoulkas, the subject of this article). His books have been translated into twenty languages. His writings are considered fundamental to modern homeopathy and have been integrated into the main software applications used by thousands of homeopaths all over the world. You can find him cited many times in PubMed, the Who's Who directory(!), Google Scholar and virtually anywhere that homeopathy is discussed. People travel from all over the world to study with him or to receive treatment. He's the winner of the Alternative Nobel Prize and has been honored by various governments. Whether homeopathy is "pseudoscience" as User JzG claims above, is entirely irrelevant to the question of notability and to suggest that someone of his statue and fame (or notoriety if you please) is somehow not notable enough for Wikipedia is just preposterous. The guy has been famous for over 30 years. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 16:59, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No it is not a "sick joke" it is the result of a lengthy debate at the admin noticeboard and largely procedural as the previous debate was curtailed as a result of the previous deletion (which was, as Adam points out, perfectly proper, since the copyright terms <i>at that time</i> meant that it was indeed a copyright violation). Comments like "is this a sick joke" <i>might</i> apply if this had been subject to multiple debates with a keep consensus, but actually it had one partial debate ending in deletion.

<dd>Yes, but none of those quotes hints at very much detail about him being in those books. That's the problem - if we're required to use only sources from the subject himself, because the other references to him are trivial or promotional, we don't have any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, one of the key requirements of writing an encyclopedic article. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 20:13, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"Reliable sources"? Adam, these are published books. They are as reliable as it is possible to get. "none of those quotes hints at very much detail about him being in those books." Huh? What do you mean? We have him described as "a respected contemporary homeopath", "the greatest living homeopath", "one of the world's leading" etc This is such a strange interaction I can't quite get my head around it. WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED TO SEE? I have shown you that there are dozens of books published all over the world by a variety of publishers that describe him as THE central figure in modern homeopathy. There's even a bio of Vithoulkas in German that I didn't mention. I can no longer accept that you are discussing this matter in good faith. Every time I come up with a new overwhelming batch of information you turn around say "Is that it?". This is reaching some sort of new level of absurdity even for Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 20:26, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

The challenges of writing a balanced article can be addressed within the talk pages over time.

<dd>"Above reproach"? May we ask, reproach by who? I think we can assume that the subscribers to the publication are satisfied that the publication is "above reproach". This is the first AFD I've encountered that gets into strange existential arguments about whether a publication that's indexed by PubMed is above or below reproach. Again you seem to be under the delusion that the purpose of an AFD is to determine whether someone is legitimate in the eyes of mainstream science. The question is notability (period) not mainstream respectability or something to that effect. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 18:22, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. It's granted that he's considered bogus at large in mainstream science, but Lee is right: we're not here to talk about that, because mainstream science considers <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathy.html" title="Homeopathy">homeopathy</a> to be <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bollocks.html" title="Bollocks">bollocks</a>. We're here to talk about whether he is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>. I see the assertion and acknowledge it, but I don't see much - only notability given is within the realms of homeopathy, and homeopathology is a pretty insular realm - so there could be perceptions of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>, no matter <i>how</i> remote.

<p>He's far more notable than most modern homeopaths, so if we're going to include modern homeopaths, it's pretty much down to him and <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajesh_Shah_ec37.html" title="Rajesh Shah">Rajesh Shah</a>, as far as I can see. Both seem to be the ones judged by homeopaths themselves as the best, and the ones put forth for awards recognising Homeopathy when they come available.

<dd>The Pubmed, Google, and Google Scholar bits are just indexes - they reference anything they can. Surely every scientist who ever published research isn't notable enough for an encyclopedia. Any of the following would probably make him notable:
<ul>
<li>Newspaper reports, in any major newspaper, detailing the awards and putting them in context. Why was he chosen? What does the award mean? (This is, of course, slightly dependant on the award's significance. An <a href="../../../o/b/e/OBE_5508.html" title="OBE">OBE</a> isn't particularly notable, for instance - Any person in the higher ranks of a charity is likely to get one, and, while they deserve recognition for their work, this doesn't necessarily make them notable.</li>
<li>A few articles about him in major newspapers, of reasonable length, and reasonably independant of him himself.</li>
<li>A few criticisms of him by a reasonably notable <b>anti</b>-homeopathic people or organisations. If he's notable to attract their eye, he's probably notable, and POV problems cease.</li>

<dd>My point is that Wikipedia includes articles on very obscure subjects. The standard for notability is generally the publication of a couple books that have been noted at least within the author's field. For musicians, you only have to be pretty well-known in your local area (representative of the local scene). Here's a person who has written many books some of which have been translated into twenty languages and they are acknowledged as standard references for his field (ie. they are incorporated into the two or three main software databases for homeopathy). Aside from all the other stuff (listing in Who's Who, the awards, etc) that ALONE would make him more notable than probably 50% of the bios in Wikipedia. What we have here is a strange new bar that's been set only for this article. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 19:31, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Books published by mainstream publishers are inherently reliable sources. I've shown that he has been cited (often explicitly calling him one of the leading experts in his field) in dozens, maybe hundreds of books. He has written books that have been published by mainstream publishers. Homeopathy is practised by millions of people around the world including thousands of medical doctors (many of whom traveled to Greece to be trained by Vithoulkas). There is absolutely no basis for the assertion that he is not notable. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 20:59, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But every single one of the books I cited (and most of the hundred+ that are available) is independent by any reasonable definition of the term. <b>Your</b> personal definition of independent means "not favourable to homeopathy" and this has no basis in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>. I defy you to show me anything in that guideline that would preclude even one of the books I cited. The notability guidelines, while they don't specifically talk about medicine, do give examples of notability being people who are leaders in their field (Vithoulkas meets this criteria), a credible independent biography (Vithoulkas meets this criteria), a large fan base (Vithoulkas meets this criteria), endorsements of notable products (Vithoulkas meets this criteria, maybe arguably if you don't think homeopathy is notable), wide name recognition (i.e. hits on Google), known for originating a significant new concept, theory or technique (Vithoulkas certainly fits this criteria), has won significant critical attention (Vithoulkas meets this criteria). Now even ONE of those criteria would establish his notability, but Vithoulkas meets every possible angle you can come up with. No, he hasn't yet competed on American Idol, but otherwise, I can't see any area in which he fails to meet the requirements. Unless, of course, you believe that homeopathy is just rubbish and the tens of millions of people who practise it don't count.

A clip of a few people in professorial gear standing about, purporting to be Vithoulkas getting a professorship. The video claims the award by the Indian Ministry of Health was for him as Homeopath of the Millenium. This is NEVER SAID in the video clip. Why on earth would that be left out if it was said, given the video was assembled by Vithoulkas according to the first splash page. The BBC documentary is mentioned in the last few seconds, of the google video, after which it abruptly ends.</dd>

<dd>Nothing would convince you Adam...</dd>
<dd>MarcoTolo, Vithoulkas was awarded the Indian 'Gold Medal' as Homeopath of the Millenium for his contribution to Classical Homeopathy. This video on Google is a shorter version of the original one, in which it is stated clearly. Same goes for the BBC documentary (is not included in this specific video, besides the final note) - it is an old one (1986) and it's a miracle i even found that reference. As far as the Hungarian award is concerned, that is in Hungarian, which would not make much sense for english-speaking users - same goes for the award in Kiev, the speech is in Russian. The purpose of this short video was to include the highlights of the awards. Now, BEFORE someone doubts again what i'm saying, i'll be more than happy to contact the webmaster of Vithoulkas.com and ask him to upload the FULL video (which i have too, containing the BBC doc, the Indian, Hungarian, Kiev ceremonies). If some extra time for the AfD is given (48 hours at least), i can prove this is the truth (if there's any point in it).Homeopathic 22:16, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, just like the above article. We are not called upon to decide the merits of homeopathy, We just present what they say for themselves. He is considered notable among his fellows, so there is an article about him and his views fairly presented. Nobody could possibly mistake them for ordinary medicine. If the article makes advertising type claims, or tried to expound the theory in excessive detail, that's for the talk page. I think the article is sober enough. Every believer and ever disbeliever should equally want the views expressed. I am among the total disbelievers, and to let the views be presented is the strongest and most effective, and fairest criticism.</li>

<dd>One of the comments above amounted to saying that homeopathic sources are inherently not reliable. If we were trying to prove the truth of the matter, perhaps. If we were qualified to judge the science, most decidedly. As a source for what homeopathy say, and how any particular homeopath is regarded, of course they are. I can not see how anyone without bias would regard this as biased in favor of the subject. Keeping this is NPOV. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b></dd>

<li><b>Background information</b> <i>There are literally hundreds of books on homeopathy that cite Vithoulkas</i>. I've provided a tiny sample earlier in this page. This was met with, what I consider, the entirely fatuous argument that they don't count because they are written by people who favor homeopathy. This seems absurd and kafkaesque (since when did we need the confirmation of people outside of one's field to confirm whether you might be notable). Remember we're only trying to determine whether he's well-known in his field not whether he's right or whether he's the most famous person who ever lived. In any case, there was an insistence, particularly by Cuerdon, that there be some non-homeopathic publications cited to prove his notability. Here are two which I think should suffice. He is cited in <i>A New World Order</i> by Paul Ekins <a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-World-Order-Paul-Ekins/dp/0415071151/ref=sr_1_8/103-5082920-2572631?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1174699713&amp;sr=8-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/New-World-Order-Paul-Ekins/dp/0415071151/ref=sr_1_8/103-5082920-2572631?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1174699713&amp;sr=8-8" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> a book that was reviewed favourably by the Times Higher Educational Supplement, New Statesman and Society and Third World Quarterly. It's a book about military statistics. Why he talks about Vithoulkas I don't know but he does. We also have the <i>Handbook of Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Mental Health</i> by Scott Shannon, a book that received a glowing reviefrom the International Review of Psychiatry, from Andrew Weil, M.D and others. The author describes Vithoulkas as a "contemporary master of homeopathy". One of the specific indicators for notability is the existence of an independent biography. I draw your attention to <i>Georgos Vithoulkas Der Meister-Homöopath Biographie und Fälle</i> published by Random House (Germany) <a href="http://www.randomhouse.de/book/editiondetail.jsp?edi=107914" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.randomhouse.de/book/editiondetail.jsp?edi=107914" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. So now we have a person who has many publications (published by major publishing houses), has several books translated into twenty languages, is cited in hundreds of books in many languages also published by mainstream publishers, has an independent biography published by a major publishing house, is cited in medical journals, is almost universally acknowledged as the leading person in his field, has a listing in Who's Who, has received a major international award, has been honored by several governments and on and on. How can there be the slightest doubt of his notability? --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 01:46, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>based on notability, if nothing else the controversy makes him notable. WP doesn't require biomedical research to be reveiwed by cosmologists or literary critics or homeopaths. Homeopathy and GV may be nonsense (is, in my opinion), but the same argument could be made for endless people and ideas. Anyone who has written, had published, and sold many books on any topic is notable. Wrong maybe, but still notable.

<li>Changing&#160;!vote to <b>keep</b> per provided BBC documentary ref. The "consolidated" format of the ref is a little strange, but I think this tips the balance of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> for me. -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcoTolo_8040.html" title="User:MarcoTolo">MarcoTolo</a> 17:43, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I wish i could find a better ref, but the film is old. At least the link proves a film was made by the BBC and was aired on 25/07/1986.Homeopathic 17:54, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>What I can say about this article is that I checked its reference to Papyrus-Larousse-Britannica, because I was indeed suspicious after the long discussion in WP:ANI. Well, the reference is absolutely accurate! There is a long article about him in the encyclopedia, where he is called one of the most important personalities in his domain. And Papyrus is regarded as the most prestigious encyclopedia in Greece. My conclusion is that, at least in Greece, he is important enough to deserve a full page of biography in the country's most prestigious encyclopedia. And there are references in this article, indicating that in his domain he has made his presence noticeable even outside Greek fronteers. Therefore, after that, I am obliged to vote for <b>keep</b>, asking for the article to be improved.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 17:44, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Ending the AfD (second nomination)</span></h4>
<p>I think it's high time this AfD ended here. A lot of reliable sources have been posted, from inside and outside the Homeopathic community, that prove George Vithoulkas is a world-wide recognized Homeopath.Homeopathic 05:31, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The AfD will be closed, when it is time to Homeopathic.

<dd>(note to Miri: This is a page for discussing whether or not a biographical page on George Vithoulkas is acceptable content for the encyclopedia. This topic you are raising is more relevant to the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Vithoulkas_c798.html" title="George Vithoulkas">George Vithoulkas bioraphical page</a> itself, so I'm going to copy the discussion to the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Talk%7EGeorge_Vithoulkas_4714.html" title="Talk:George Vithoulkas">talk page of that biographical article</a>. If you haven't voted to "keep" or "delete" you should do so above. To discuss the article content, go <a href="../../../g/e/o/Talk%7EGeorge_Vithoulkas_4714.html" title="Talk:George Vithoulkas">here</a>; to edit the article itself go <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Vithoulkas_c798.html" title="George Vithoulkas">here</a>). <a href="../../../a/b/r/User%7EAbridged_690f.html" title="User:Abridged">Abridged</a> 12:50, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
