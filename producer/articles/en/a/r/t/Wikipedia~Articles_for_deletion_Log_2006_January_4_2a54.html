<p><b>Argument for Delete:</b> An article about a legal case which has barely begun, and about which there is no evidence any newspaper or journal has written, concerning a matter which itself does not appear to be notable or significant. Ordinarilly I'd be reluctant to nominate an article only a day old for AfD, but the submitter's other contributions (particularly those on <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unincorporated_reciprocal_inter-insurance_exchange.html" title="Unincorporated reciprocal inter-insurance exchange">Unincorporated reciprocal inter-insurance exchange</a>) strongly suggest he intends to use Wikipedia as a vehicle to publicise his ongoing lawsuit. That's not a fit purpose to which Wikipedia should be put. <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 00:04, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Argument to Keep:</b> True v USAA was commenced (filed) 10 Feb 2004 (Docket # 04 L 79, St. Clare County, IL). Thus, this is hardly a new case: in fact it is almost two years old. True is singularly the most challenging law suit and easily the most significant event presently bearing on <a href="../../../u/s/a/USAA_01b4.html" title="USAA">USAA</a>'s finances. It demands the immediate return of all unallocated surplus <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surplus_at_a_URIE_54c0.html" title="Surplus at a URIE">surplus</a>. If Col True is granted <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class_action_status.html" title="Class action status">class action status</a>, and if Col True prevails, USAA will <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tautologically.html" title="Tautologically">tautologically</a> become insolvent and will then be disolved by the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Department_of_Insurance_0884.html" title="Texas Department of Insurance">Texas Department of Insurance</a>.</p>
<p>USAA's April 6, 2005 24-page <i><b>response to interrogatories</b></i>, in which USAA's lawyers essentially argue that the "members" own nothing, is one of the most revealing documents in USAA's history. This document will soon be available on a server located in Ulan Bator, with simultaneous mirror-service out of Vilnius and Yekatarinburg, and Irkutsk.</p>
<p>True v. USAA focuses on the fundamental issue <i>that USAA lacks any capital structure</i>. USAA exists off of money "borrowed" and then perhaps not faithfully returned to the subscribers. This law suit demands that USAA repatriate money questionably deposited in the Arran Master Trust - and that this money be returned to the subscribers who own it.</p>
<p>If there is some argument which dignifies the improper retention of these funds</p>
<p>(Author note as to argument to keep: I have absolutely no financial interest in how True v. USAA turns out. Will every signatory below please declare his/her "independence" in this matter.)</p>
<p>Critics: listen to this and listen carefully. <i><b>" . . . and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee."</b></i> John Donne 1623. St. Paul's Cathedral, London. USAA's days are numbered. Look at all of you laid out below, as if you were tree huggers lying in front of a bull-dozer. You'all make a sad sight.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am new to articles but I disagree with assessment of "non-notable" as well as that of "vanity." As a resident of CT, I feel I am in a position to assess notability of people from the state.

<li>Feel free to disagree, but our policy (<a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>) is quite clear on this. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertR_0869.html" title="User:AlbertR">Alr</a> 01:14, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thanks for the link to vanity pages. I still fail to see how the article is in itself "vanity." Is it an issue of verifiable information? I can tell you that the subject is well-known and people in the region would be interested in the information. Published facts attesting to the "notable" status of the subject is well-founded. If there are parts of the article that are deemed "vanity" then they can be deleted, but I think the article as a whole is not. Information about the subject is of value, but perhaps not all of it. Moreover, it seems as if the policy is a little vague (as it concedes) and I think this issues can be remedied without deletion of the article. Also, per A7, the article's subject does not lack importance, and is in fact fairly important in its respective region.--68.9.241.103 01:29, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>: This is a valid language problem.

<li>From article writer: I admit the idea for the article was a little undeveloped. But I was hoping that other editors would help make something of the idea. In math and science and law, humans are very specific about time and quantity. But in everyday language, we are vague. As to the difference between "to" and "to and including", we are very vague. I can accept the article being deleted. I cannot, however, accept that the Wikipedia model does not provide a way for putting a fine point on vague injustices. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony717_7fd0.html" title="User:Anthony717">Anthony717</a> 06:55, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note that I never said this was not notable, just not encyclopedic. Does the Snuggle bear have any real cultural significance? Has it influenced other brand mascots? The Energizer Bunny caused Duracell to make parody commercials, the Kool-Aid Man has a star on the Walk of Fame (OK, I can't verify this but I totally remember seeing it in the news), and the Pillsbury Doughboy inspired the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man. The Snuggle bear has done nothing but hawk fabric softener and thus, to me, is unencyclopedic. <span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color: #33C;">howch</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0F0"><i>e</i></span></a><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color:#33C">ng</span></a></b> <small>{<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">chat</a>}</small></span> 07:44, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have updated the article and added some more content which can be verified. <del>Given the nature of phreaking groups generally being 'underground' and quiet to the outside world, 293 google hits is not actually that bad.

You need better content, smes. 3) If they manage to accomplish anything in the next few months and word gets out, I would be more inclined to vote 'keep', and even help edit the article- it would be a pleasure, but only if they do work on their end as well, like learning something besides cell freqs, which any n00b can snag from bottom-feeders in the scene. And red boxes? Come on.... Put some better instructions and designs on your site, smes. Tone generators are old hat.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have no idea if this is relevent to this discusion, but some German words pluralise to end "-en", and Dutch is similar to German in many respects, so this might be what has happened to make the word translate as "Staten" and not "state".

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. It's hard to work out what to make of Aeropagitca's comment, since it demands a judgement from me, the closer, on whether it can be cleaned up or not.

<dd>You'll probably find that this article doesn't actually come under any of the things listed in "Why this is wrong" on that particular page, Thesquire. It is not a made-up word, nor is it seeking hosting, nor is it the first instance on the net of its existence. The Pissboy World Cup is a competition with a growing fanbase in central Scotland, and its cult popularity is spreading due to advertising campaigns in the form of posters and flyers. Also, referring to what cookiecaper said, why does a website that is hosted by Bravenet automatically get a bad mark against it? Does the Pissboy World Cup have to pay for hosting before it can be accepted as part of Wikipedia? I don't think that's outlined in any Wikipedia rules anywhere. Radioshed

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't dispute that.

<li><b>Comment</b> I mentioned that you were the author to inform others who may or may not consider your comment on the situation. If you can bring in others who can vouch for this sport's "popularity", fair enough, but I doubt it would swing many of us. I don't doubt you have a few friends that invented the sport with you. If the sport was really gaining popularity, it would have more than the three results displayed <a href="http://www.google.de/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22pissboy+world+cup%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.de/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22pissboy+world+cup%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You're right, a Bravenet site doesn't deserve to be automatically shrugged off, but the event itself is inherently non-notable. Prove its notability (other than saying that it is growing) and I'll change my vote.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I actually take offense at this. For a start, there is nowhere that claims that the Pissboy World Cup is a "sport", as you have accused. The Pissboy World Cup is nothing more than a game, and doesn't claim to be anything more. Also, the Pissboy World Cup was invented by one person and one person alone - me. The fact that you're already making assumptions as to how this competition came into being shows how arrogant you are, and that you've most likely already made up your mind before anyone can say anything against you. The fact is, none of the creator's "friends" had anything to do with this. On top of this, the fact that you base your confirmation of something's existance on google search results just shows that you are also narrow-minded. There's more to something than just what a typical search engine claims. Did the Olympics exist before Google came into being? If we were to go by your train of thought, then no, the Olympics must not have existed until 1996, when Google was created. What do you need before you confirm something's existance? And even after you confirm this, that something is "notable"? Do you want me to give you a free trip to Scotland so you can gather information on the popularity of the Pissboy World Cup? Unfortunately I don't think that will be happening. Radioshed</li>

<li>This helpful reference definately must be kept for posterity. In years to come your children will be saying "Daddy, what were you doing during the pissboy world cup" and you're reply will be that you were trying to cover up it's existence for no other reason than to gain status in your ridiculous web community. Look this nonsense, it's all is written in HTML. You are worthless people, keep your grubby paws off our competition and your opinions to yourselves. I assure you the pissboy world cup is not a 'hoax competition' it is a highly organized event which provides much employment in the East Lothian area. People have worked very hard to make something of this and if you want to destroy all that then you will have to deal with them. Personally.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm getting seriously sick of this. I've moved your little essay to the end here. You have provided no evidence whatsoever of this event's notability. You cannot provide a single verifiable source of information to back your claims up. Like any other, this "ridiculous web community" has rules, and you will abide by them. This is a forum of discussion and as such there is no need to "keep our opinions to ourselves". I find it very unlikely that this competition is known to anyone beyond the select group of individuals mentioned on the website. Also, if this event is so important, I fail to see why it is so critical that this article stays. How exactly are we "destroying the hard work" of these people? Is Wikipedia the only basis for this "competition"? That alone would be criteria for deletion. Another thing: don't try play on people's consciences, and certainly don't go threatening members on here. It will bring you nothing, trust me. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamyskis_2c95.html" title="User:Jamyskis">Jamyskis</a> <font size="-3"><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamyskis_5b40.html" title="User talk:Jamyskis">Whisper</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jamyskis_a771.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jamyskis">Contribs</a></font> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" class="image" title="Germany"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/25px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png" alt="Germany" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" /></a> 14:52, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I make no idle threats sir. But perhaps I did go a little too far. I merely mean to demonstrate that we take this competition very seriously and any publicity to the wider world is a tremendous boon for us. The suggestions made on this discussion board that the competition is a hoax deeply anger myself and my associates.</dd>
<dd>I myself work for a group of 'notables' in the East Lothian county who are very much concerned with the history of the area as well as the ongoing cultural contributions of the younger generation. Such things have far reaching effects, that could even be of benefit to the wider scottish community. Having looked at the wikipedia regulations that have been highlited with regard to this entry, and after much discussion with my employers, the creator of the site and pissboy world cup officials, It has been decided that we may have to make some concessions.</dd>
<dd>Beginning from today I shall be preparing resources with which to begin the writing of an academic paper which will detail the strong links between the cultural phenomenon of the pissboy world cup and rich and vibrant history of Scotland. I will be in discussions over the next week with the foremost representitives of East Lothians cultural elite who have in their extensive studies compiled an unrivalled knowledge of the land and it's people, covering topics such as the battle of prestonpans, the popular music of the Proclaimers, the strange circumstances behind the Tennent's brewery fire in 1979, and of course the Sammy Burns mythos.</dd>
<dd>I ask only for your continued patience in this matter, I hope that this will go some way to satisfying your demands. I see it as my priviledge to be working on this project and will certainly be happy to provide some provenance of the pissboy world cup and it's distinguished roots.</dd>

<dd>That said, I still think that this is non-notable, and unfortunately does not meet the standards of Wikipedia.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> Yes, delete it. Go on. If none of the Wikipedia people have heard of it, then it obviously doesn't exist, and it wouldn't even be worth taking notice of if it did.

People on here have invited you time and time again to present proof or sources related to this. Your answer has been to verbally insult anyone who challenges the legitimacy or notability of it. You have turned up nothing, except a Bravenet website and three Google links, two to your own site and one to a forum you posted to. If this was such an important event, it would have garnered at least a mention in a regarded weblog, a newspaper, or at least a number of fan sites. But there is nothing.

<li><b>Transwiki</b> and <b>link</b> per Ihcoyc. It was written on April 1, 1965, according to a bit of <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/04/01.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/04/01.htm" rel="nofollow">research</a> (other sites confirm, that was just a high Google hit), but I'm unsure how that applies to copyvio status.

<li>Well, according to <a href="../../../c/h/e/Che_Guevara_7c64.html" title="Che Guevara">his article</a>, he was most likely in Congo on April 1, 1965, so the copyright status would have more to do with the copyright law in Congo and/or Cuba in 1965. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECookiecaper_cd84.html" title="User:Cookiecaper">Cookiecaper</a> 06:34, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not even sure that matters in the first place; the editor claims he translated it from Spanish and released it to the public domain, which would seem to nullify where or when the original was written. <font face="futura"><a href="../../../s/n/u/User%7ESnurks_9a10.html" title="User:Snurks">Snurks</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/n/u/User_talk%7ESnurks_2400.html" title="User talk:Snurks">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snurks_439e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snurks">C</a></sup></small></font> 06:58, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A translation is a derivative work, so you can't just translate someone else's words and release them.

<ul>
<li>This is an official statement from some sort of government figure or would-be government figure, or officer or agent of the Cuban government.

<p>Fixing corrupted nomination (attempt at second nom at the first nom's page). Below is the nominator's provided reasons for deletion, (cut from the previous debate before I restored it.)...</p>
<p><i>I've revived the deletion request for the following reasons:</i></p>
<p><i>1.) The article is largely POV that violates not only the NPOV policy but also the no original research policy and, to top it off, the talk page makes it clear that it is a vanity page for the original author. Essentially, the author is attempting to create a genre to promote his band.</i></p>
<p><i>2.) Subsequently, it has since become nothing but a magnet for vandalism. The valadity of the article is clearly disputed all over the relevant talk page. This seems to be pretty clear to most people who approach the subject who are familiar with the genres that are cited here as reference material. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBloodofox_6b7d.html" title="User:Bloodofox">:bloodofox:</a> 06:17, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<li>George Bush (for good or bad) is an encyclopedic topic. A musical genre (and all this is according to the Wikipedia article and the inbound wikilinks) that is unsure of what it's origins are, claims minimal mainstream popularity, thinks it might just be a Metalcore with a different name, and appears to have no "WP:MUSIC-notable" bands as a part of the genre, <i>combined</i> with the "We're Goths / No you're not, you're poser-Goths" debate being held on the article page itself, does not inspire me with much hope for this topic in regards to encyclopedic-ness. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> - 10:50, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Just because AFI wants to create a new genre for themselves (which seems to be the only reason why the topic/term exists in the first place) doesn't mean that the genre exists, should be created, or has any sort of following outside of some fans of AFI. While one could argue that Goth music genre should have more distinctions, Wikipedia cannot and should not be used as a vehicle for the creation, designation, or promotion of this term (or any others, for that matter.) --<a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwazzap_3d0f.html" title="User:Mwazzap">mwazzap</a> 07:51, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually, AFI has repeatedly said that they are not Goth related and have apparently denied being called "goth punk" so obviously your reasoning for deletion is untrue since AFI has no part in this (also see Saberwynd's google search for gothcore and AFI together returning nothing). - <a href="../../../d/n/e/User%7EDNewhall_a69a.html" title="User:DNewhall">DNewhall</a></li>

<p>GeorgeStepanek,</p>
<p>The identification of 'A Fire Inside' as gothcore that you indicated occurs on what looks to me like a blog. According to <a href="../../../a/_/f/A_Fire_Inside_7d5e.html" title="A Fire Inside">A Fire Inside</a>'s wikiarticle, they are <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_punk.html" title="Hardcore punk">hardcore punk</a>, an editor consensus established sometime around July-August 2005, after a series of edit wars (based on a comment on the talk page and a very brief browse of the edits in that timeframe.</p>
<p>A Google for <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22A+Fire+Inside%22+gothcore&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22A+Fire+Inside%22+gothcore&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">"A Fire Inside" gothcore</a> comes up with 29 unique out of 54 hits. Of these, we have two hots for the 'blog entry', a large series of Wiki-mirrors and Wiki-copyers, a scattering of other blogs, and a couple of forum postings where the poster appears to be unsure of the validity of the term gothcore. Googlesearching the <a href="http://www.afireinside.net/" class="external free" title="http://www.afireinside.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.afireinside.net/</a> domain for use of the word 'gothcore' came up nada for me.</p>
<p>Based on this, I believe that AFI, while notable, is not gothcore, and my previous comments still stand. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> -13:16, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Fair call. I still believe that "gothcore" isn't just a term invented by the authors of this article, but you're right in that it does not appear to be widely used.

<li><b>Comment</b>. They have released an album; normally that is enough to satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. But on closer inspection, it's more like <a href="http://www.merchdirect.net/x/c/product.php?productid=573&amp;cat=&amp;page=1" class="external text" title="http://www.merchdirect.net/x/c/product.php?productid=573&amp;cat=&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">a compilation album</a>, and it was only a limited release. And a DJ crew is not exactly the same as a band. If it is to be kept, the article needs a decent cleanup, as it stands at the moment. If the reason this is interesting is because <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Delgado_8b30.html" title="Frank Delgado">Frank Delgado</a> is in it, then the lead section should make that prominent.

<p><b>keep</b>. You can't go around deleting every indy artist your itchy fingers find. If they're non-verifiable and/or are some local band, fine. These guys appear to be semi-professional, have been around awhile and have released several albums. While the article may be written by a band member, I'm sure we can rectify the neutrality issue by cleaning it up. Not being signed to columbia or atlantic is not criteria for exclusion. --<a href="../../../t/a/e/User%7ETaeKwonTimmy_172e.html" title="User:TaeKwonTimmy">TaeKwonTimmy</a> 08:56, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> - Definitely notable, and their music is excellent as well. They have been popular since at least 2002. To aeropagitica: Allmusic.com has more errors than accuracy in their content, and too many holes where good (and notable) bands should have far more information available than is usually found. Allmusic.com is about as useful as religioustolerance.org in terms of comprehensive coverage of content. → <a href="../../../p/%C3%A1/d/User%7EP%C3%A1draic_MacUidhir_7486.html" title="User:Pádraic MacUidhir"><font color="#006400"><b>P</b></font><font color="#4B0082"><b>.</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>M</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>a</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>c</b></font><font color="#228B22"><b>U</b></font><font color="#228B22"><b>i</b></font><font color="#228B22"><b>d</b></font><font color="#228B22"><b>h</b></font><font color="#228B22"><b>i</b></font><font color="#228B22"><b>r</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/%C3%A1/d/User_talk%7EP%C3%A1draic_MacUidhir_6a00.html" title="User talk:Pádraic MacUidhir"><font color="#9400D3">(t)</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_P%C3%A1draic_MacUidhir_6232.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pádraic MacUidhir">(c)</a> 10:06, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> TRSI is one of the few major players in the online anime/manga retail market. This itself may not be notable, but the fact that the company also licenses anime series from Japan and produces well-received domestic versions is. Though they release very few titles per year, they give them high-quality treatments. The series listed in this article are major anime titles that have won acclaim within the industry. See for example <a href="http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/4175.php" class="external text" title="http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/4175.php" rel="nofollow">this review on animeondvd.com</a> <a href="../../../p/f/a/User%7EPfahlstrom_9da9.html" title="User:Pfahlstrom">pfahlstrom</a> 18:55, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>When it the article was first created it was a copyvio (I found the source); I put a speedy tag on it, but the creator removed the tag and, it seems, edited out the offending material, so I don't think it is a copyvio.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. Although the creator cannot (and does not) demand deletion, he can participate like anyone else can, in the same way as for a more usual 'keep'.

<dd>That's from the first 20 pages of Google hits. I believe that would show it had had some effect outside it's community. Oh, and most of them don't name the lead characters, so your "elimination of false positives" was more like elimination of anything that didn't give the full storyline. In fact, a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Pure+Pwnage%22+%22FPS+Doug%22&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Pure+Pwnage%22+%22FPS+Doug%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Google search with FPS Doug included</a> gets 10,200 results. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKel-nage_e5d8.html" title="User:Kel-nage">Kel</a>-<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKel-nage_73a2.html" title="User talk:Kel-nage">nage</a> 00:20, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What competitive online gaming have you done? Ownage, Pwnage, Owned, Pwned, Pure Ownage, Pure Pwnage. It's an expression that means to beat someone easily. In military for instance, the 2-week (or so) destruction of Iraq's former government (the aftereffects were bad, but the initial victory was easy), The Vogons destruction of earth, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Vadar_da8f.html" title="Darth Vadar">Darth Vadar</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lexx_9889.html" title="The Lexx">The Lexx</a> blowing up a planet.

Odd in <a href="../../../p/w/n/Pwn.html" title="Pwn">pwn</a> 5 "citation needed" tags. I've often seen editors remove the information if it's unproven, as well as remove citation tags claiming it is unnecessary, as well as articles filled with information lacking citations that can be proven wrong (and editors revert any citations that prove otherwise), etc. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexicEditor_aec8.html" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 14:46, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you may've missed what the article concerns. The article does not discuss the concept of "pure pwnage" (i.e. those frags looked like pure pwnage).

<li><b>Keep.</b> It seems like it may be somewhat vain now, but I don't think one should go as far as to delete the entire article. It definitely requires cleanup, and then perhaps some information on its impact on society. At the moment, I can't find any more good evidence of notability to add to the ones above. The best thing I can say (empirically) is that I've played in lots of CS:S servers with a large amount of players, and in many of them, there are people who seem to recognize the "BOOM HEADSHOT!" and FPS Doug when I acted like an FPS Doug fanatic (for jokes, of course).

<li><b>Very obvious keep</b> Not to be too vulgaric here, but all I can say is FUCK YOU. 11 000 registered forum members, and let's say, that about 4/5 of every viewer does not register, yet regularly follows the show? Dig your fucking head off your ass, if you want to go CONTRIBUTE to Wikipedia, (which you obviously can't, but you should give it a try) then go CREATE and ADD, don't fucking start PROPOSING DELETION OF A REMARKABLE THING such as Pure Pwnage. Now may I ask you, have you ever fucking even visited the website, seen any episode, or otherwise fucking seen that Pure Pwnage is a serious project and has at least 40 000 viewers and 1,5 million web page hits?

<p>Biblecruft. There is nothing specifically notable about this verse. It comes part of the way through a large genealogy, which is notable as a whole but not in fractions. The division of the bible into chapters and verses is a somewhat mediaeval invention and so there is nothing significant, religiously, about this verse in particular.</p>
<p>The only content of the article is two translations of the verse, a few sentences repeating who is listed in it (as if you couldn't tell from either of the preceeding two translations), and a brief comment that Rahab is spelt as Rachab, and is in an odd position - a comment that would much better fit in an article on the genealogy as a whole.</p>
<p>This is all it is ever likely to contain. --<b>User talk:FDuffy</b> 14:12, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This may be a stub, but there is still considerable room for expansion. The article contains no discussion on the various translations of this verse, and the arguments between translators. The Rachab issue is only given brief mention, while volumes have been written on the subject. There is also no discussion of the apocryphal traditions that have developed around the figures known only from their place in the genealogy. It is also useful since we have every other of the first 200 verses in the Gospel of Matthew, and it would be confusing and off-putting to readers if we only had the first 190 articles, and had unexplained gaps every once and a while in the middle. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 15:02, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>This "some cruft exists, therefore no cruft may be deleted" argument has never seemed particularly persuasive to me. Please explain what it is that makes the verse <i>Salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth. Obed became the father of Jesse.</i> anything other than trivia? For example, it almost certainly does not appear in the list of set Gospel readings under Anglican Church, since I have never heard it read out. Are any hymns based on this, as is the case with Ps.23? Is it well known to a lay audience, like John 8:1-11? Is it liturgically important like 1 Corinthians 11:23-26? This is a <i>single</i> verse in what appears to be one of the <i>least</i> important sections of Matthew's gospel, and it seems to me there really is nothing encyclopaedic to say about it! - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 15:40, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Previous AfDs have indeed resulted in either keep or no consensus votes for <i>those</i> verses. Moreso, the discussion on bible verses as a whole achieved a consensus of keep only because, as I read it, it was decided that the nomination was inappropriate for AfD and instead needed to be discussed as a merge at <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerge_Bible_verses_33ff.html" title="Wikipedia:Merge/Bible verses">Wikipedia:Merge/Bible_verses</a>. Where there was no clear consensus, but there does seem to be a general idea that while some Bible verses <i>are</i> notable enough to have their own articles, each case needs to be judged separately. In other words, the previous votes say that there is a precedent for keeping Bible verses if they're notable. A list of begats is not notable, not encyclopedic (although valid as part of a more general Biblical genealogical article) and not capable of generating more information than this tiny stub. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 16:03, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

The only reason they weren't deleted/merged half a year ago is because the closing admin was biased and chose to count the vote as a keep despite the fact that twice as many people voted to delete and/or merge the articles than did to keep them. --<a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">Victim of signature fascism</a> 01:47, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Two wrongs do not make a right. Wikipedia is by nature inconsistent; we're here debating <a href="../../../5/_/_/Matthew_1%7E5.html" title="Matthew 1:5">Matthew 1:5</a> and nothing else. Moreover, it's not just a question of whether the verse "deserves" an entry, it's what is genuinely useful. Merging verses that aren't particularly notable in themselves into topics creates articles that are more useful to the reader. (Moreover, nothing on Wikipedia is set in stone. If in a few months' time a merged article covering various verses is bulging at the seams, we can consider splitting it then. For now, merging is clearly the most useful step.) <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 10:31, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There has probably been enough commentary on every single verse of the Bible to fill a very long article. Even if merged version are also useful, some people will find these single-verse entries valuable, especially as they are fleshed out further. Can't articles on longer merged sections co-exist with single-verse articles?

<li><s><b>Merge</b> and <b>Redirect</b></s> with no prejudice against recreating once there is more content. I don't have a problem with keeping articles on minor individual bible verses <i>once they have been written</i> but while the content is so meager it is best kept in a larger article with a redirect from here. Once the content of the larger article has grown enough to warrant a separate article then it can certainly be created. That seems to me the most useful way of arranging the information we have. I find this problem interesting because I'm often wondering about the best way to split the content of the <a href="../../../e/d/d/Edda.html" title="Edda">Eddas</a> and such into Wikipedia articles. We basically already have an article for every verse of the <a href="../../../y/n/g/Ynglingatal.html" title="Ynglingatal">Ynglingatal</a> and we'll eventually probably have an article for every verse of the <a href="../../../v/%C3%B6/l/V%C3%B6lusp%C3%A1.html" title="Völuspá">Völuspá</a>.

<dd>As with the others this may be a stub, but there is still considerable room for expansion. It is also useful to have this article for ease of readability, as some readers will want to read several verses in order. While this verse might be short, those around it are quite substantial. Deleting the stubs breaks the navigation bar at the bottom of the article, and prevents readers from moving from <a href="../../../1/3/_/Matthew_4%7E13.html" title="Matthew 4:13">Matthew 4:13</a> to <a href="../../../1/5/_/Matthew_4%7E15.html" title="Matthew 4:15">Matthew 4:15</a> and beyond.

<dd>The navigation bar at the bottom of the article is POV. It seems to suggest that there is something automatically noteworthy about all verses in the bible. Verses were created in the mediaeval era. The division is entirely artificial, as acknowledged by many modern bibles which re-arrange verses into paragraphs and quotes, reading verses in order is NOT the purpose of an encyclopedia. --<b>User talk:FDuffy</b> 15:50, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Organization by verses is still the universal scholarly standard. It is far better to go with this than try to develop our own divisions, which would infinitely more POV. All verses may not be noteworthy, but there is no notability requirement. Verifiability is a requirement, but with the vast literature on Biblical criticism, writing a verifiable non-original research article on each verse is quite straightforward. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 16:02, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Talk about subjects like the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy_of_Jesus_8dec.html" title="Genealogy of Jesus">Genealogy of Jesus</a>, not the verses one by one. The verse structure is a mediaeval construct. Often the books were divided into verses and chapters simply in such a way as to get a nice or significant number of them, like 50 (n.b. one of the gospels, I believe it is Mark, has <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number_of_the_beast.html" title="Number of the beast">666 verses</a> in total), rather than trying to respect the original sentence divisions.

I was slightly surprised by this on reading the article (although certainly much of it is of tangential relevance at best), but it is essentially unchanged from its state prior to the AfD nomination, and so it seems very clear that people are not persuaded by the material that is included. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:17, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> While the subject matter may be based mostly on rumors, how could such subject matter not be based on rumors? If so-stated (meaning "rumors have circulated that ..."), then why should such an article be deleted? Certainly there have been efforts throughout church history to repress such rumors, but that in itself doesn't indicate that the rumors were false. I think the article should be kept, but that it should be made clear that such information is (probably by its very nature) not always verifiable. I also believe that the title should be changed to something like "Popes Suspected of Homosexual Activity". 21:04, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Talk about subjects like the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy_of_Jesus_8dec.html" title="Genealogy of Jesus">Genealogy of Jesus</a>, not the verses one by one. The verse structure is a mediaeval construct. Often the books were divided into verses and chapters simply in such a way as to get a nice or significant number of them, like 50 (n.b. one of the gospels, I believe it is Mark, has <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number_of_the_beast.html" title="Number of the beast">666 verses</a> in total), rather than trying to respect the original sentence divisions.

<li><b>Comment</b> -- At the end of the day there is very little value to individual articles on most Bible verses; there are of course exceptions, but for the most part it's logically fallacious to draw any conclusions from a verse in isolation. In addition, if an effort was made to put said verse in context (both Biblical and cultural), the resulting article would be ungainly and suffer from redundancy issues with nearby verses. If there is a precedent set for indiscriminately keeping articles on arbitrary Bible verses, then it's a bad one. If there's an acceptable level of granularity for such writing, it isn't this (except, possibly, in the case of Proverbs). (In the case of the Quran, it's likely to be by sura, though even then there's individual verses that stand out. I make no such definitive claims for the Bible, as even chapters are later emendations.) <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 04:45, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, whoa whoa whoa, guys, I'm not religious at all, but the Bible (and the New Testament as part of the Bible) is the most obsessively studied and interpreted and commented upon book in human history. Every single verse has been subjected to endless hair-splitting and analysis by theologians. There is more than enough material out there for a lengthy, informative article on any bible verse. Are Bible verses less notable than individual characters from video games? I think not. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 01:24, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You presume that I think characters from video games should have articles. This is a single, unimportant verse from the Bible. You might find, in a very large concordance, an analysis of every single verse in this way, but it's far more likely that you would discuss a passage rather than a verse. I can't think of very many verses which are in and of themselves notable, one being John 11:35 ("Jesus wept") which is famous mainly for being the shortest verse in the Bible. What people remember is passages, like Ps.23 or Is 9:1-6 (The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light, etc. - an aria from Handel's Messiah). Individual verses are almost without exception ridiculously trivial. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 12:01, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article discusses solely the implications of a theory presented in another article <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_oil.html" title="Peak oil">peak oil</a> or <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubbert_peak.html" title="Hubbert peak">Hubbert peak</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> purely because the <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubbert_peak_theory.html" title="Hubbert peak theory">Hubbert peak theory</a> article (Jmabel's <i>peak oil</i> and <i>Hubbert peak</i> are redirects to it) is already too large (34Kb) and there is thus no room to merge this article into that one without losing a significant amount of valuable content. So while in principle it would be a good thing in the practicality it is impossible to merge these 2 articles. Normally a subject is covered in 2 articles when there is not enough space in the original (there are 1000's of examples of this), and that is the case here, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 15:19, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> So long as we do not have a <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_oil_theory.html" title="Peak oil theory">Peak oil theory</a> page, but rather a <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubberts_peak_theory.html" title="Hubberts peak theory">Hubberts peak theory</a> page, I feel it is sloppy to attribute to one Hubbert, any more than what in fact Hubbert has said. This Implications section is horrid, and everything that Wikipedia is not, however, we need a place for the puss to drain, and if we remove this article, all this lucy-goosey, the sky is falling pseudo-scientific cultish nonsense will be attributed to Hubbert personally - and I see no evidence that he deserves that end. I would suggest a better solution: Create a Peak oil cult page on which to place all the true believers, followers, doomsayers, and fear mongers, under the category of religion which in my opinion is where any conjectures of the <i>end of the world as we know it</i> belong - then do a nice article about Hubbert personally, his one nearly successful prediction, and his other far less successful corollaries and move on.

<li><b>Keep/Comment</b> I agree with Mr Gatti - a Hubbert article, then a seperate peak oil cult page (although possibly Peak oil cult would not be my choice of title).

<li><b>Comment</b> some kind of reworking is clearly necessary, I agree that a peak oil theory article separate from or created instead of Hubbert sounds promising, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 16:53, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and NPOVify, per Squeakbox. POV is not a reason for deletion.

<li><b>Merge</b> the Hubbert article already has a section on this, and if it's too big that can be fixed by using categories to replace the long, long lists of people in that article - about half of it seems to be lists of one sort and another (including refs, of course). <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 22:50, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> Agreeing with JzG above. This belongs in the main article space, sinc eit is a natural offshoot of the phenomenon. If that article is long, that is a copy-edit issue.

<dd>May I ask then where Mt. Hubbert suggested the that very bad things would happen if/when cheap oil ended? And May I suggest that if <i>he</i> did not say it - then it doesn't belong and that we should tag the true authors of such tripe with their predictions of gloom. You call it a natural outgrowth - but there are many such natural outgrowths, some of with include windmills, solar panels, nuclear plants, bio-diesel, population reduction, urban planning for energy efficiency, and in short where would it end? I respectfully suggest that Hubbert's article should begin and end with Hubbert. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a> 22:06, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You have strangely conflated the man with the theory. Implications of a development (good or bad or indifferent - it is a neutral term) are not beyond the scope of an encyclopedic discussion of that topic and that is where they should remain (and presumably be better discussed). I believe you correctly identify the problem with uncoupling this from the main discussion in that it could lead to wide range of essentially peripheral topics. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 02:17, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I suggest that the <i>title</i> has conflated the two.

<dd>This point and your comment above are both valid. The problem is with <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubbert_peak_theory.html" title="Hubbert peak theory">Hubbert peak theory</a>; it seems to me that peak oil theory is sufficiently well-advanced that it is no longer rightly characterised as Hubbert's peak theory even if that is how it originated. We can fix that by renaming the article and refactoring slightly to refer to Hubbert's role. Implications should still be wound in, as the separate article implies in its premises for existence acceptance of the theory, which is <a href="../../../b/e/g/Begging_the_question.html" title="Begging the question">begging the question</a>.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. This one stands apart from the other biblical nominations (there must be a pun in there). SimonP's defense is absent; he recommends outright deletion instead. The numbers opting to delete this are substantially higher than those opting to keep, and the gap between them is much wider than in the other nominations, so clearly there is a desire for an otherwise-inconsistent result in this case. Clearly, the concern is the extreme paucity of actual non-source content; the semi-sentence that there is is subtrivial and a repetition of the title in words. Babajobu, do note that this article <i>does not</i> even come close to beginning to consider doing any of the things you mention, unlike some of the other bible entries. I'm not going to orphan this article as is often done at the end of an AfD, however, since there remains the possibility of a non-'cruft' version emerging into the light. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:15, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Delete - indeed speedy verse article with no commentary as empty.

<li><b>Delete</b>, permanently, without this article being re-created in any form. This is simply not the way to treat books of the bible. Talk about subjects like the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy_of_Jesus_8dec.html" title="Genealogy of Jesus">Genealogy of Jesus</a>, not the verses one by one. The verse structure is a mediaeval construct. Often the books were divided into verses and chapters simply in such a way as to get a nice or significant number of them, like 50 (n.b. one of the gospels, I believe it is Mark, has <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number_of_the_beast.html" title="Number of the beast">666 verses</a> in total), rather than trying to respect the original sentence divisions.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, whoa whoa whoa, guys, I'm not religious at all, but the Bible (and the New Testament as part of the Bible) is the most obsessively studied and interpreted and commented upon book in human history.

<p>This is a combined nomination for <b>Harq Obispal</b> and <b>Stalinvast</b>. <s>Both these articles are non-canonical in the Warhammer 40,000 fictional universe, and appear to be the subject of a role-playing character and setting, respectively. <b>"Harq Obispal"</b> attracts nine unique Google hits, the majority of the non-Wikipedia ones are for role-playing forums.</s> -- 22:59, 29 December 2005 (UTC)<a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> - The <a href="../../../z/o/i/Zoids.html" title="Zoids"><font color="blue">Zoids</font></a> Expansion Project</p>
<ul>
<li>I strike my previous charge, but still believe this is a candidate for deletion. See below the relisting notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Stalinvast and Harq Obispal are sourced in the Black Library Publication of "Inquisitor" by Ian Watson and as such exist properly inside the Warhammer 40K Universe at large and not any specific gamers campaign.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, please rewrite the articles to show this information. I can only work off what I find in the article, and what I find in Google, which did not say anything about the Ian Watson novel. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> - The <a href="../../../z/o/i/Zoids.html" title="Zoids"><font color="blue">Zoids</font></a> Expansion Project 23:45, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Stalinvast is key to the story in question while Obispal is an essential but relatively minor character-still working on template for Draco and the other main figures-though more worthy of a seperate entry than say planetary governor Lord Voronov-Vaux. The book I have is entitled Inquisitor and is the first of the Inquisition War Trilogy. it was reissued by the Black Library as Draco in 2002. Found it easily on a google search.</li>

<p>I admit that my first claim of non-canonocity is false, in light of the evidence. I admit I was wrong. However, I still find myself questioning this article's 'place' in the grand scheme of <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warhammer_40%2C000.html" title="Warhammer 40,000">Warhammer 40,000</a>-related articles on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Many of the characters in the fictional universe do not have their own articles. The Emperor Himself, arguably the single most important character/'historical figure' in the game and fiction, is <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperium_%28Warhammer_40%2C000%29_7b95.html#The_Immortal_God_Emperor_of_Mankind" title="Imperium (Warhammer 40,000)">a section in another article</a> (although I do concede that there are plans to move him back out, and support this move). The majority of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primarch.html" title="Primarch">Primarchs</a> are included in the article on their Legion (with one exception, who is arguably the <i>second</i> most important character/'historical figure' in the fictional universe.</p>
<p>I have never read the <i>Inquisition War</i> (and knowing my luck, will probably never get the chance to), and don't know how important the character of Harq Obispal, or the world of Stalinvast) is to the plot. I think the best place for this information would be either in an article on the <i>Inquisition War</i> trilogy, or in an article on "Jac Draco", who appears to be the primary character of the trilogy. Failing that, my call for deletion still stands. No offense to the article author or the subject material, but to me, this is at the moment little more than <i>Warhammer40K-cruft</i>. -- Saberwyn</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> Most (if not all) the articles for Home And Away are very short and the characters wouldn't pass the "google test" if they were real people, much less characters on this TV show.

<li>I'd say we should hold off the deletion yet until someone with indepth knowledge of H&amp;A could come and merge the details either into the character section of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_and_Away_4142.html" title="Home and Away">Home and Away</a> or else their own article, say, Characters of Home and Away. I'd like to point out how <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighbours.html" title="Neighbours">Neighbours</a> has done this. They have a families and other characters section on their page detailing current characters, with a separate article for past characters. I think H&amp;A should go along similar lines.

<li><b>Comment (and vote at end)</b>. I've decided to go through with the idea I mentioned above and I'e created a new article incorporating most of the info from the individual articles. Thinking about it now, maybe it should have been done on my user pages or something, but it's too late now (sorry). You can find the article at <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_Home_and_Away_characters_9aa3.html" title="Current Home and Away characters">Current Home and Away characters</a>. You can see it is rather a rough effort and some characters would need to be expanded while others seriously cut back (we don't need details of every story every characters has been involved with). I also propose a second article, <a href="../../../p/a/s/Past_Home_and_Away_characters_0c30.html" title="Past Home and Away characters">Past Home and Away characters</a> to which this information is moved if/when a character leaves. I feel it is better to have all this in one article as it compares H&amp;a WITH EUALLY POPULAR SOAPS (LIKE neighbours) rather than comparing it with soaps which have much higher global viewing figures or are more widely known about (like Easterners and Coronation Street). It also provides an easily comparable source detailing info on all characters in one place, rather than having many different articles with very little info in each. If we want to keep thi article, we would need to make a link on the main article page, do some serious work on improving the content and I propose a box on the page detailing and ranking the episode and order characters first appeared (like in the <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighbours.html" title="Neighbours">Neighbours</a> article.

The Idea of deletion is anopther example of the <b>UGLINESS of colinalism</b> and bigotry- one thinks only American characters from buffy should be allowd to saty and a british poster thinks someone actually cares about Eastenders and CS' who's number of viewers outside the UK (combined) is not even a quarter of the H&amp;A viewers.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> (or redirect). I agree with 23skidoo. I can't find any evidence that "New Jersey films" is an alias for <a href="../../../v/i/e/View_Askewniverse_0618.html" title="View Askewniverse">View Askewniverse</a>. In fact, I suspect the article came from someone filling in a redlink that started out as "The New Jersey films:" in that navigation at the bottom of the View Askewniverse film articles. With the "the" article it's clear it wasn't a formal name, only an informal way to group some of Kevin Smith's films. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_5.html" title="January 5">01-05</a>&#160;04:32<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span>

<p>Added by an anonymous author, zero non-wiki google hits, I put a <i>If this page does not list a reference by the end of the week, I am nominating it for deletion</i> on the talk page a week ago. Its writing style alone makes me suspicious that this is a spurious work of imagination, for example <i>Her power over the camp, the more than 60,000 female and juvenile inmates, and more than 1,000 female guards, was absolute.</i> - it's possible that she was an actual person, but even if she was, Wikipedia is unlikely to be lessened by losing this article, and since it seems "likely" to say it's a hoax (since all other female Nazi guards listed on Wikipedia are google-able), I'd rather we be safe, and not used at another plaything for the media ("I put my three year old daughter on Wikipedia as a Nazi guard, and it stayed up for months", etc) <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherurcij_a3b4.html" title="User:Sherurcij">Sherurcij</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherurcij_4567.html" title="User talk:Sherurcij">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 18:07, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The band split in the nineties, I believe, but are back now. Anyway, as I said, I'm no fan, but I think you should consult the Doom Metal people before saying they are non notable.--<a href="../../../k/f/d/User%7EKFD_6a47.html" title="User:KFD">KFD</a> 17:53, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The labels are apparently sufficiently significant to have articles on them. Allmusic has a brief bio on this band that appears to confirm the records. So I don't see any good reason for deletion here at all. I bet they even meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines.

<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_locomotion.html" title="Animal locomotion">Animal locomotion</a> links to the page. That's how a researcher would find it. The "point" of the article is that meniscus climbing is a totally new mode of animal locomotion. Read the Nature paper; it's really good (and, BTW, is a contraindication for the page being OR). Meniscus climbing happens to be "animal locomotion on the surface layer" but the energetics are different from water striders. <b>Sliggy</b>, you ask some good questions on the talk page. I'll do my best to answer them. I am corresponding with Jonn W. M. Bush (co author on the Nature paper) so maybe we can have some authoritative answers.

<p>The <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berabow_Man_81e3.html" title="Berabow Man">Berabow Man</a> article appears to be a shallow copy of the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bravoman.html" title="Bravoman">Bravoman</a> article with just changes in the names, no images, and no apparent reason for creation e.g. like "Berabow Man" being an actual alternate name for the actual Namco's game <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bravoman.html" title="Bravoman">Bravoman</a>. Also, its author vandalized the original Bravoman page and redirected to his/her version. This article offers little or nothing extra information compared to the original, and has little reason to exist.</p>
<p><b>Berabow Man</b> is NOT a shallow copy of the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bravoman.html" title="Bravoman">Bravoman</a> article. The game name is BERABOW MAN based upon Namco's own listings: - BERABOW is in the default high score listing - BERABOW MAN is listed in the history of Namco games in Namco Museum Volume 1 (PS1) - BERABOW MAN is listed in the history of Namco games in the end credits of Dragon Saber (1990). Bravoman is just an NEC PC-Engine conversion of the game, translated into English.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I cross checked, and seen that there is indeed an arcade (Japanese only) "Beraboh Man" (the sources are uncertain between Berabow and Beraboh, however it's even emulated under MAME). But still, IMHO the best thing would still be merging the "Berabow man" info with the Bravoman article, as this is the most common name under which the game is known and under which its ENGLISH versions are known. And, gingerfield rocks, your article IS just a copy of the original, and claiming that it focuses on the original japanese arcade version while keeping the NEC's version english texts unaltered iand deleting the whole article is a bit hypocritical... <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiVictor_855c.html" title="User:EpiVictor">EpiVictor</a> 12:14, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, I think the article needs to be expanded a bit to provide <i>context</i> on why it is encylopedic.

Also, the article should be renamed to "Merry Christmas From the Morse Family".

<dd>With all due respect, I don't understand how this article is "advertising" the album. There is no information on how to get it, no price listed, and not even an external link to Morse's website or the website of his record label. I'm looking at it as objectively as I can, and all I see is an explanation of how this album came to be and how it differs from the rest of the artist's considerable body of work. If you can convince me that it's advertising, certainly I'd be willing to rework the article so that it was much more NPOV. -- <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitchell_k_dwyer_69ef.html" title="User:Mitchell k dwyer">Mitchell k dwyer</a> 10:42, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Maybe the individual album could be considered not-notable - the artist is however. The inclusion of this helps to keep the encyclopedic record of his canon of work.

<li>Here is my problem with this album: Allmusic doesn't list it. It does list Morse, as a member of Spock's Beard, but Spock's Beard themselves are clearly no supergroup, having no chart hits or awards to their name. So to allow this unlisted album because it is by someone who was once a member of a slightly famous band seems like a bit of a stretch. Perhaps someone could help out and show me some actual data showing that this album is important? - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 20:03, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>*Chart hits are no way to measure the notability of a band or a musician. Frank Zappa never had a hit, and as far as I know, never won a mainstream award. Within the world of progressive rock, there isn't a soul who doesn't know Neal's name. Googling "merry christmas from the morse family" returns over 11,000 hits, including just about every website and publication that deals with this genre of music. Now, I'm not saying that Google should be the measuring stick; I'm merely saying that, considering the genre and this musician's importance within it, there's no denying the notability of the artist. As for the notability of the album, I've already conceded that it's questionable; however, as JoaoRicardo points out above, albums by notable musicians have been determined important enough to keep. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitchell_k_dwyer_69ef.html" title="User:Mitchell k dwyer">Mitchell k dwyer</a> 21:11, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Frank Zappa charted a few times, with the tune his daughter sang on and a few other albums from the early 70's, and won a Grammy or two along the way. More to the point he left behind hundreds of thousands of enthusiasts, on several continents, many of us fanatic, who can describe his works and talent at length by citing references in the most popular media (Time Magazine, the New York Times, etc). This individual has no such body of work or impression of impact. Even if he were an "important" contributor to the art form, the form itself has shrunken to a few dozen listeners and given up the ghost (hence the Christmas album with the family). Mostly, this entry is embarrassing: There's a sense that if he can't maintain a listing in Wikipedia, all those hideous rehearsals were for naught. Wikipedia ought not record such things. Charlane's Sugar Shack is the premier ice cream parlor in the town of Creosote, Texas; It is not therefore notable. Delete. Crid 04:25, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The "isn't a soul" phrase isn't defendable, that this is a major album isn't defendable, that it sold well isn't defendable, that we are trying to sell this is also not defendable (surely you aren't claiming we are that naive). What is at stake here is the principle of Album articles for notable artists. Within Progressive music Spock's Beard, Transatlantic and Neal himself have become notable, if only in the regalvinising of support for modern progressive music. It is possible that your connections with progressive music are dated back in the 1970s and 80s (you quoted Gensis, of whom I am also a fan). Which is fine but this is a vibrant and growing part of the music world today. One of the interesting side developments has been the growth of <i>Christian Prog</i> (Cprog). Not major, but definitely noteworthy and notable. Ok, so if the artists are notable there should be nothing to cause the album articles to fail the following precidence test. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents</a> or are you trying to challenge this.

<dd>This is silly. Which do you hate Crid, the article, the album, Neal Morse, or modern progressive rock? Sure, the article could use work. I've made it a little more formal today, but it still could do with some tweaking. Yes, the Christmas album is a minor one of Neal Morse's CDs, but it sounds like from the discussion that minor albums by notable musicians are okay. Neal Morse albums do well. They are well received by reviewers, he gets some radio play on progressive radio stations and is starting to be played on some Christian radio stations. I don't have the numbers, but I think the TransAtlantic and latter Spock's Beard albums were selling hundreds of thousands of CDs--not a few dozen. His Christian solo albums are selling less than that, but are still doing pretty good. Modern prog rock isn't what it was in the 70s, but there are a few bands that are doing well. They are not top 40 bands, but do we really want to delete stuff from every artist/genre that isn't in the top 40. Yes, Neal Morse is a genre artist, but so what? <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChiok_b81c.html" title="User:Chiok">Chiok</a> 05:24, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added the stub content of <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Wilson_%28hockey%29_b5eb.html" title="Ron Wilson (hockey)">Ron Wilson (hockey)</a></b> to a preexisting entry for an NHL player/coach, <b><a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Wilson_8b1c.html" title="Ron Wilson">Ron Wilson</a></b>.</p>
<p>Having two NHL player/coaches in separate entries, with only one marked "(hockey)", was confusing, and looked at first like entries for the same person. Their birth years are only one digit different, as are their Overall draft positions, either at which, at first glance, could pass for typos. A dual entry follows the style of other such entries as <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_Rider_fe79.html" title="Ghost Rider">Ghost Rider</a>.</p>
<p><b>Part Two to this</b>: Deleting "Ron Wilson (hockey)" will allow the current "Ron Wilson" to be be <i><b>renamed</b></i> "Ron Wilson (hockey)".</p>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>: Just because the two players have the same name does not mean they are not worthy of their own articles. And the <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Wilson_8b1c.html" title="Ron Wilson">Ron Wilson</a> page is there because he is the most notable of all the Ron Wilson's that had a page. I have now added the little disclaimer at the top of each page. Also they are both listed on <a href="../../../n/h/l/NHL_players_W_032d.html" title="NHL players W">NHL players W</a> as two separate articles, so it is not like we are dealing with orphaned pages here. P.S. I did not know this page was even up for deletion until I scrolled the Afd page, so make sure to put the deletion notice on the actual article next time and do it correctly.

<li><s><b>Speedy Keep</b> While the tone of the article is a bit off, I think the guy is real and probably notable.

<dd>Changing to <b>Delete.</b> Do deletion discussions ever get anywhere? Evidentally. I am changing my opinion.

<li>Even if he is the same guy, what makes him more notable than any other professor?

Ifnord 22:13, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps we should delay deletion until a consensus emerges? I think it is certainly the case that a claim of notability is made in the article. According to the article, Edward Smith created a new field of psychology (so-called "abstract spatial psychology"). I know nothing of the field, but this is certainly a <i>claim</i> of notability (whether true or not, I can not judge). I think we should avoid the "let's delete it until we know more" approach. This article is about a real person with verifiable contributions to the academic literature. Lacking a criteria of notability for those contributions, it seems premature to delete. To delete until a consensus on deletion emerges is to <i>de facto</i> enforce a policy for which there is no agreement. The article can always be deleted later, but not so easily is it recreated. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansnesse_9523.html" title="User:Hansnesse">Hansnesse</a> 23:23, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Psychologist_e8af.html" title="American Psychologist">American Psychologist</a> (1998 Apr Vol 53(4) 368-370) has a note about an "Edward Smith" recieving an award "For his outstanding and diverse contributions to the study of cognition, including word perception, semantic memory, concept use, and reasoning." As I noted, I don't think the article is well written. I don't know if this is the same Edward Smith as in the article. I don't even know (and in fact, I suspect not) that he is the same as Edward W.L. Smith, since the citations in the American Psychologist article are to an E.E. Smith. A poorly written article, however, is no reason to delete. I think rewrite is needed, maybe a quality or dispute tag, but not deletion. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansnesse_9523.html" title="User:Hansnesse">Hansnesse</a> 03:44, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have verified the scientific findings of Edward Smith (such as the correlations of abstract spatial psychology) via observation and experimentation. I too am bothered by the fact that Edward Smith's exact identity and educational certificates are uncertain, and that his work has not been published in any major scientific journal, but the fact remains that his contributions are major and scientifically verifiable, not even mentioning the catalog of correctable omnipresent human flaws, which is not even a scientific thesis, but simply a readily-observable large contribution to society. I know, I know, we would all like to believe that all people that make major contributions to society, especially in scientific advancement, must meet those social prerequisites. We would also like to believe that everything that is abstract and/or humbling is b---s---. I too feel the temptation to suppress this article for those reasons, and to word that reasoning as you have -but come on, we're supposed to be responsible adults here, not like children in an unsupervised candy shop. I know it's hard though, despite being comical when viewed from the outside or in retrospect. Besides, wikipedia also has an NPOV policy. We shouldn't be selectively deleting information just because it goes against beliefs that we hold dear. IrreversibleKnowledge 04:02, 6 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We are not deleting the article because it goes against our beliefs. In fact, I don't even remember what Edward Smith is supposed to have said now. Our concern here is notability, not importance. Different things. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a><sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 04:29, 6 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Come on, Joao, don't misrepresent what I said. I don't like to admit it either. To reiterate, for the sake of clarity, I am not referring so much to the specific findings of Edward Smith as going against our beliefs, but more so, the way that we want to delete this article because the fact that he has made major contributions is evidence against our belief that 'in order for a person to make large contributions to society, and especially scientific advancement, they must have certain social prerequisites, namely having been published in major scientific journal(s), having gone through the official educational system, and/or having a certain identity'. IrreversibleKnowledge 13:44, 6 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am quite confused. Can you enlighten us as to whom the article refers to? If this is an unpublished Edward Smith, he is clearly not notable. If you know what material the Edward Smith of the article has produced (in a professional publication sense), by all means, please note it. I don't think Wikipedia is the place for a person's work which has never seen the rigors of professional scrutiny. Moreover, I do not think "scientifically verifiable," in the sense that such discoveries could be independenly reproduced by readers, is a good standard for Wikipedia (to say nothing of trying to "verify" the material based on such a short discussion, no lab report, etc.). Such a standard would invite all manner of crackpot. If you have information about who is Edward Smith, please let us know. I maintain my position to keep the article, as I noted above, as long as the aricle refers to someone with academic credentials. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansnesse_9523.html" title="User:Hansnesse">Hansnesse</a> 18:03, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't know what Edward Smith's academic credentials are and aren't, so if you intend to delete all articles about people that lack credentials, then you may as well delete this article. However, that is not an honest policy, as we both know. I can see clearly from your sentences that you strongly adhere to the belief that 'in order for a person to make large contributions to society, and especially scientific advancement, they must have certain social prerequisites, namely having been published in major scientific journal(s), having gone through the official educational system, and/or having a certain identity, and anyone that lacks those social prerequisites that claims to have made such contributions is a crackpot'. I too am tempted to believe that. I know the feeling. It is a pleasurable crude forceful feeling of disrupting fine subtlety, in this case, the value of people that lack those social prerequisites, as such people are perceived as having the abstract property of subtlety, just as children and animals are. This is precisely one of the things that Edward Smith has discovered, so you have inadvertantly supported his findings with your very reply. However, I am responsible enough to resist that temptation so as not to make this encyclopedia biased. Anyway, it is clear that we will not resolve this dispute with personal discussion, and this dispute involves more general policy principles, so this is a matter for an RfC. IrreversibleKnowledge 21:40, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sorry, I didn't intend to misrepresent what you said. But I'm affraid you don't understand the situation here. You claimed that you had reproduced and validated Smith's experiments, but this is not the point. His experiments may have arrived at true conclusions, but they are not notable yet. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a><sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 20:12, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have followed your link to the cubicism / time cube page. Cubicism isn't even a real belief; it is a hoax that was created for the sake of creating an extremely ridiculous belief.

<li><b>Comment</b> I made no claims whatsoever as to the validity of Gene Ray's research, or Edward Smith's research, only noting that they were similar in the way that they read (and note that I said it was a "[f]un read"). I did not denigrate either source, I merely noted similarities. If Edward Smith and Gene Ray were equally sourced, and cited, and discussed, and verifiable, then I would put them on the same level of notability, regardless of whether or not some other people viewed their works as... how did you put it? "[P]ure absurdity", "pseudoscience" or an "extremely ridiculous belief", to use your own words.

<li>So now you are falsely portraying me as being uncivil toward the very person that I am defending, and you have also falsely portrayed me as being uncivil toward some remote person, when you are well aware of the fact that I would not have described time cubism in that way unless I believed that that description was the consensus to begin with (and therefore not meant as uncivil persuassion). About 99.9 percent of people, including yourself I'm sure, would agree with me about time cubism. Besides, Gene Ray wouldn't mind, because his belief is a hoax. Lying, and especially lying about the policy violations of others, is a gross violation of the policy <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a> .

<li>This is <b>not</b> another article on the same subject. This is another subject.

<li>Stop right there. Pedelec is a class of electric bicycle is a class of motorised bicycle. It says so right there in <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> and has done for ages - there is even a picture of one. Your legal case in Ontario notwithstanding, nobody else seems to have this problem with somehow thinking a "pedelec" electric bike is in any way a separate class of machine from all other electric bikes. Since that demolishes your point 1, the rest of the house of cards goes with it. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 18:49, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Pedelec is a title that is not a synonym of an existing article title <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a>. A motorized bicycle in canada is a totally different class of vehicle (ie.:limited speed motorcycle vs a pedelec often considered a <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power-assisted_bicycle.html" title="Power-assisted bicycle">power-assisted bicycle</a>. Also, in certain jurisdictions, such as Oregon, a motorized bicycle is like a <a href="../../../m/o/p/Moped.html" title="Moped">moped</a>. We have had a discusion in regards to <a href="../../../m/o/p/Moped.html" title="Moped">moped</a> vs <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> and the concensus was not to merger these articles. Again, for other jurisdiction such as Canada that consideres a <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> a A pedelec is considered a type of electric motor assisted bicycle. Once the detailed specs on pedelecs are cleared up it will be far much easier to understand that this is non synonymous of the existing article.</li>
<li>The content in the pedelec article is being developed not according to personal view but according to consensus elaborated in the German article, and probably the content from the french article.. There is much content that exist on the subject. Not only that, but there was never any issues brought up in the talk page in regards to lack of consensus.</li>
<li>There are no personal theories that are at issue for inclusion. Au contraire there may be some interesting research on Food consumption vs. electric consumption and that is a published document. etc...)</li>
<li>It is bad faith to assume because of my knowlege about the article "motorized bicycle" it may be a content fork. I believe one should give the benefit of the doubt to the creator. This is not a duplicate article. This is a different class of vehicle.</li>
<li>According to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html#Article_spinouts_-_.22Summary_style.22_articles" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking#Article spinouts - "Summary style" articles</a>,: <small>(for the ease of reader I include it hear)</small>:
<ul>
<li>Even if the subject of the new article is one about which people are bound to hold strong POVs, this does not automatically make the new article a POV fork. Even if the new article was created because it's a particularly controversial aspect of the article subject, that does not mean that the new article is a POV fork; if one aspect of the article subject is more controversial than the others, it is perfectly legitimate to isolate that aspect as much as possible to its own article, in order to keep editing of the main article fairly harmonious.</li>
<li>(Seeing as there is difficulty in editing and adding anything to the article of motorized bicycle... such as the current debate we are having in regards to the inclusion of a picture of a motorcycle/motor assisted bicycle/motorized bicycle from Triumph. It is 10 folds harder, even though it may fall in as a sub-category of motorized bicycle, to place a little information on a class of vehicle that is not trully related.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Furthermore, According to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html#Article_spinouts_-_.22Summary_style.22_articles" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking#Article spinouts - "Summary style" articles</a>;
<ul>
<li>Summary style articles, with sub-articles giving greater detail, are not content forking, while the main article, written in summary style, will give a balanced summary of each of the subtopics. The sub-articles can each treat a particular aspect - which might reflect a point of view for each of the sub-articles - but these sub-articles should anyhow be linked to the other subarticles and to the main article, for instance by a navigational template.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Though it is possible for editors to act in bad faith and make article spinouts as POV forks, this is clearly not the case and nor has it been proven in this instance. Or previous instances. (assides from maybe the in september when I first joined and was new a though I could include a bunch of laws... and that was not a content fork but more or less a fueding debate about what should be included). As soon as user found out about the article he nominated it for deletion. This justs seem to re-enforce my belief that user nominating this article has absolutely no faith in my editing.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Conclusion:</b> There is nothing left for you to argue according to those guidelines. Nomination of this page for the above reason <a href="../../../f/o/r/WP%7EFORK_4e79.html" title="WP:FORK">WP:FORK</a> is not justified. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CylePat</a> 03:03, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>CyclePat, please go back and read the part of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking</a> which clearly states that those are not affirmative defenses -- if you're the only one who thought that there should be a separate article on electric bikes, creating one and calling it a "spinout" (weren't you just claiming that it was a translation of the German "Pedelec" article? It can't be both!) doesn't make it not-a-content-fork. Neither can you justify it by claiming that the consensus reached at the <i>German</i> Wikipedia means you can ignore consensus at the English Wikipedia, not when your article's in the English Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 03:44, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>You address the subject very vaguelly. I understand that some of those issues such as "is not a synonym of an existing article title" is not an affirmative defense. But you are reversing the roles here. You are attempting to make me prove my innoncence, when you haven't even proven that there is guilt. There is no doubt that this is a translation. And yes it can be both! This is because it is a "sub-class" of <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a>... or in the case of this alleged POV FORKING, a "spin-out." (I call it an article with more details.) These vehicle may be, in some instances similar, but they definatelly warants their own pages. The first part of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking</a> stipulates:</p>
<ul>
<li>POV forking, occurs when two or more contributors disagree about the content of an article or other page, and instead of resolving that disagreement, someone creates another version of the article (or another article on the same subject) to be developed according to their personal views rather than according to consensus. This second article is known as a "POV fork" of the first. Wikipedia does not view article forking as an acceptable solution to disagreements between contributors, and such forks may be nominated for deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't experienced any disagreement <b>about the content</b> of "pedelec". What content don't you agree with? You see none of this was discussed, even with past issues that might have occured with the totally different class of vehicle called the "electric bicycle." This makes it difficult to assume good faith when you don't prove your case. I'm sorry but if the German Wikipedian have decided to "spin-out"(I call it have more details in another article), I see no reason why this precedence could not be used?... But that doesn't really matter because it's not a spin-out or a POV FORK. The key idea here is "summary". When "motorized bicycle" was created consensus was that this was a summary file. Editor firgured it would be better to have all articles under one roof. It was created to <b>summarize</b> power assisted cycles and power assisted bicycles and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_bicycles.html" title="Electric bicycles">electric bicycles</a>, etc... Again, as per <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking</a> <b>Summary style articles, with sub-articles giving greater detail, are not content forking.</b> Again: there is no disagreement on content and motorized bicycle article is a summary style article. We need to go into more details. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CylePat</a> 04:51, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I think that there is a good argument that the Pedelec article should exist. Amongst other things, the "Electric bicycles" section in "motorised bicycles article is hopelessly inadequate regarding technical explanations of the operation of these vehicles (as is that entire article). The pedelec article is clearly not a content fork, duplicate or stub, and I think that the grounds stated by the nominator for deletion are not sufficient. <i>However</i> The pedelec article is no better than a babelfish of the German article, not including the (excellent) formatting of that page. Cyclepat is clearly not competent to do the translation (or there wouldn't be an AFD). Therefore, the article in question is no better than the babelfish link to the German article [<a href="http://216.239.37.104/translate_c?hl=de&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;langpair=de%7Cen&amp;u=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedelec&amp;prev=/language_tools" class="external autonumber" title="http://216.239.37.104/translate_c?hl=de&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;langpair=de%7Cen&amp;u=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedelec&amp;prev=/language_tools" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>], and I might add that the link preserves the formatting. Wikipedia, is not a personal sandbox, and unusable rough versions belong on user pages. I therefore support a delete until (or unless) a good quality translation results. I would note to Cyclepat, that wikipedia has all sorts of articles with dubious content but excellent quality, but having low quality (even with excellent content) is a guaranteed way to end up on AFD. <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKAF_4851.html" title="User:AKAF">AKAF</a> 13:29, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b>: Now, Cyclepat, don't take this badly, because I can see that you mean well, but [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Precedents" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Precedents" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>] has an option for Gibberish, and I think you'll agree that the article is not readable english by any stretch of the imagination. Also, if you delete all of the gibberish (all of it) and replace it by the link I provided, then the article is a substub [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wp:substub" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wp:substub" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>], which is grounds for deletion. Additionally, due to your association, the article probably would qualify as a vanity page [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vanity_page" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vanity_page" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>]. Now, if the article was well written, you'd have a good ground for dispute, but as it is, there are plenty of grounds to delete, and none to keep. So, I have a couple of suggestions for you. (1) Move the article to your user space and accept the deletion. (2) Ignore this, and other comments, and focus your attention on improving the article. If you spent the energy on improvement that you've spent on this article, there wouldn't be an AFD (3) Spell and grammar check the article and add cross-references (but no references to any companies or organisations with which you are personally involved). (4) Wait 7 days and then re-read (5) Re-create the article and leave a note on the user pages of everyone who participated in the AFD.&#160;; Good luck with the article. <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKAF_4851.html" title="User:AKAF">AKAF</a> 14:48, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I really don't understand how this can be a POV fork when it is a work in progress from a translation... This is typical bad faith on behalf of the nominator because he knows I have built 2 electric bicycles and he assumes I have an agenda. Since when do we punish people for their knowledge and previous wikipedia edits (That of which I was fairly new to experiencing, lacking arguing skills, and having poor wikipedia etiquette.) Next thing you know you'll be saying <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granny_Smith_cbc9.html" title="Granny Smith">Granny Smith</a> smith and <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gala_%28apple%29.html" title="Gala (apple)">Gala (apple)</a> are POV Forks from <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple.html" title="Apple">apple</a> article because the primary creator really likes these types of apples. If the issue of delete is not about formatting, {attention}, etc... and solely about a POV fork, I think, this issue should be closed. Again, according to "content forking": "Summary style articles, with sub-articles giving greater detail, are not content forking, while the main article, written in summary style, will give a balanced summary of each of the subtopics." There is obviously a mistake in the nomination of this article for deletion. This, I believe is an error in procedure and may lead to an appeal. As for the gibberish... well... I couldn't possibly comment on that, except for the fact that I am working, slowly but surely at translating this page so inherently there be no POV. (It's a win-win or lose-lose situation.) (I'll be gone for the weekend so if anyone wants to start translating!)

<dd>This above quote demonstrate that "pedelec" article is a subcategory of motorized bicycle. It easy to see that motorized bicycle will never really be able to go into as much details as that of the pedelec article. Hence, motorized bicycle is a summary article to pedelec. Hence, pedelec is a sub-article giving greater detail.

<dd>I have expanded the electric section of <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> slightly to include some additional detail alluded to in the German article and other sources. I have also created two new stubs for <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crank_sensor.html" title="Crank sensor">crank sensor</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torque_sensor.html" title="Torque sensor">torque sensor</a> since we didn't have those.

There is, however, still no article on storage density or half a dozen other related topics, none of which are addressed by the <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedelec.html" title="Pedelec">pedelec</a> content.

<dd>One minor update to respond to a specific point: you say you don't think there's room for this content in the existing article, but <i>you did not even try</i>, let alone talk about it on the talk page. Whereas you <i>have</i> previously tried to turn the redirect at <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_bicycle.html" title="Electric bicycle">electric bicycle</a> into a separate article, against conensus. I <i>do</i> think there is room for the additional content, not least because <i>most of it is already there</i> and I have recently added some of what little was not. It is useless to appeal to the clauses on splitting out controversial content, because the inclusion of electric bikes in <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycle</a> is not controversial. It represents a consensus position with, as far as I can make out, only one dissenter, who is acknowledged to have a vested interest. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_AfD_78f4.html" title="User:JzG/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 16:05, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obejection... bagering the defence. euh! Yes...&#160;:) I think if you calmed down and explained yourself you would make a litle more sense. YOu might then be able to see that my second comment, way up top, shoot down every hypothesis that this is a fork. I suggest you present your counter arguments instead of claiming bad faith. (You really haven't proven anything we don't know.) You see, to argue something I have to take a side... it is your responsibility to try and point out these things. I am clearly aware that "it is possible for editors to act in bad faith and make article spinouts as POV forks," however I still haven't seen any proof. As I indicated this is a translation page. No agenda's. And I don't think I am close at all to meeting the situation <s>that is portrayed in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html#Article_spinouts_-_.22Summary_style.22_articles" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking#Article spinouts - "Summary style" articles</a></s> for content forking.</dd>

<p>A precedence exists at [[Wikipedia:Arbitration policy/Precedents#Content of articles ]] that is related to this article. <i>"Statement(s) of principle:</i> An encyclopedia article is a summary of accepted knowledge regarding its subject, not a complete exposition of all possible details." <i>Using this precedence, we may argue that motorized bicycle, should remain a summary article.

I would say yes, but that's only because we have mis interpretated Wikipedia's neutral point-of-view (NPOV) policy which "contemplates inclusion of all significant points of view regarding any subject on which there is division of opinion." We are meeting the wiki policy of NPOV in the article of motorized bicycle and I think we need some supporting sources regarding the subject of the article.

<li><b>Delete</b>; he isn't notable. If he writes a book, he'd be notable, but as-is, he's just a random name and a picture in the media. There isn't enough useful information about him, and even if there were, his only "claim to fame" is this mining disaster. He should simply be mentioned in the mining disaster as the sole survivor. Mining disasters happen fairly frequently, and surviving random disasters (unless you survive, like, 10 in a row) is not noteworthy enough for an article. If he writes a book or brings down the Bush administration with his testimony about how they beat coalworkers with sticks, then he's notable. But surviving? No. That'd be like mentioning every single soldier who has been mentioned on the news for dying in Iraq; it just isn't noteworthy enough. 69.59.212.172 05:29, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Right now, Mr. McCloy is notable considering the current media coverage of his condition and survival. He's not just a random name and a picture in the media, but on the contrary, he is a media darling and has the potential to recover and be outspoken about the events that took place within the mine. He is the only eye-witness to what occured within the mine before his recovery and has the potential to write a book, which meets one of your criteria for making a notable person. Also, not every single soldier has four days of intense media spotlight directed towards them including non-stop 24-hour footage of their ambulance being taken to the hospital and journalists reporting their vital signs and progress from the parking lot of their hospital. To deny Mr. McCloy his deserved and merited status is ridiculous.

Randal McCloy, on the other hand, was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, and the only notable thing that he did was endure longer than the others. Someone said "I'd like to see you breathe CO for 42 hours and not die. I think that makes one pretty notable." Well, no, it doesn't; it may qualify you for the Guinness Book of World Records, but it doesn't make you encyclopedically notable. Now <b>if</b> the various predictions that have been made for Randal McCloy <b>did</b> come true -- that he's going to be a major spokesman or get his own talk show, or <i>something</i> -- <b>then</b> those actions would be an argument for keeping a separate article instead of merging. But none of those things have happened <i>yet</i> and we don't know that they will. According to the latest news, his biggest achievement is having some signs of brain activity even though he is still not out of a partial coma. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:36, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Although, after reading the latest reverts and additions, I'm doubting that this could ever be anything more than an advertisement.

<p>Nothing is wrong with this post. Keep in mind there are other brand names which are posted here. Does this mean we are going to remove Coke, Pepsi, 7up, etc...?</p>

<dd>It looks like the mentions on Oprah and by Doctor Perricone were mentions of "Acai fruit," not of MonaVie. I don't really find any media coverage of the company, but maybe I'm overlooking it. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 02:46, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. No evidence of notability. Wikipedia is not a repository for miscelany info appearing on American TV shows. And for God's sake, the name is <a href="../../../a/%C3%A7/a/A%C3%A7a%C3%AD.html" title="Açaí">açaí</a>.&#160;:-) If you write it "acai", it becomes "a-KA-ee". If you want to adapt it to the English orthography, do it properly.

<li>Well, that explains why I didn't find an article about it. Would a redirect using English orthography be appropriate? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 14:37, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Tom, I didn't understand what you are proposing. Are you suggesting a redirect from the English spelling of "açaí" to <a href="../../../a/%C3%A7/a/A%C3%A7a%C3%AD.html" title="Açaí">açaí</a>? If that is the case, I surely agree, and I would make one myself if only I knew what is the English spelling for this word. Googling came up with "assai", which looks awkward to me, and is ambiguous (it could be pronounced "a-SAY", couldn't it?). <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a><sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 19:58, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, a redirect from the English spelling. I have no idea even how to type in "açaí," except to copy and paste;) Is there an official method of transliteration? If I <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=a%C3%A7a%C3%AD&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=a%C3%A7a%C3%AD&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial" rel="nofollow">search Google for açaí</a> I get lots of links to <i>acai</i>. That may be wrong, but if it is a common misspelling, maybe a redirect or dab would be useful. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 20:33, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>There must be some rules for transliterating Portuguese into English, but I don't know them. Well, let's leave it at that for the time being.&#160;:) <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a><sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 04:23, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>No, even in English, Portuguese and Brazilian words and names should be written with the correct accents, tildes, cedillas, etc., as in <a href="../../../s/%C3%A3/o/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_23d2.html" title="São Paulo">São Paulo</a>.

<li>In Microsoft Word, type CONTROL-comma, then type "c" and you will get the "c" with cedilla. To type "í," type CONTROL-apostrophe, then type "i" and you will get an "i" with acute accent. Or just go go to the Wikipedia article on açaí, which redirects from "acai." <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 22:18, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In Wikipedia, when editing look down below the edit screen and you will see all these characters there for you in blue. Just click on the character you need and it will be inserted into the article. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 22:19, 5 January 2006 (UTC)
