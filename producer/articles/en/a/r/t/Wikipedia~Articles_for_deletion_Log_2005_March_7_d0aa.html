<li><b>Delete</b> probable spam. Their blog put up a "We're in the encyclopedia" entry within moments of the WP article being created. Previous entry before that was in January. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 00:50, Mar 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Who would spam a website that you couldn't profit from? Serves as an easy to manage/update FAQ for the site. Keep it! <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKaneda_ae97.html" title="User:Kaneda">Kaneda</a>

<li>Wikipedia isn't here to advertise your site. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKaneda_ae97.html" title="User:Kaneda">User:Kaneda</a>'s only edits are to the article up for deletion.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 00:57, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's not an advertisement...it's a reference. I highly doubt any random user would go onto wikipedia.org and type in NoPoint.org in the search box. You advertised the website when you put this page up for deletion, now people who never knew that the site existed, and would have never known the site existed are discovering it. The only reason this article is the only one I've editied is because I just signed up for a username on Wikipedia, I planned on editing other articles besides this one. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKaneda_ae97.html" title="User:Kaneda">Kaneda</a></li>
<li>There's no reason for Wikipedia to manage, store, serve, and maintain the FAQ for <i>your</i> web site. A site described as a "news blog and messageboard" ought to be able to find <i>some</i>place to store their own FAQ. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">Talk</a> 03:52, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Sites on Wikipedia should already be notable when they are listed on WP. When sites are listed for the sole purpose of trying to gain notability through WP, that is advertising. --<a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubutler_551c.html" title="User:Tubutler">Tubutler</a> 02:06, Mar 7, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To clear up any confusion; the sole purpose of the WP page is to serve as a reference to users/new users of the site; not to gain notability through WP. Again, the only people who will read this article on WP are people who have been to the site. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKaneda_ae97.html" title="User:Kaneda"><font color="#FF0000">Ka</font><font color="#FF5500">n</font><font color="#FF8000">e</font><font color="#FFC000">da</font></a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Possible spam? Hogwash! Merriam-Webster defines spam as "unsolicited usually commercial e-mail sent to a large number of addresses". This article spam? I think not! I think any attempt to find a commerical connection here will be ultimately futile. Keep im mind, this article is a major work-in-progress. The final product will no doubt be a major contribution to academia. Concentrate your efforts on why a search for "pig roast" links to "group sex". - <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarab_132e.html" title="User:Barab">Barab</a>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia defines <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">spam</a> as "advertisements masquerading as article". <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremyA_6669.html" title="User:JeremyA">JeremyA</a> 02:42, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia also admits (from the FAQ) that information from this site "is of course possible for biased, out of date or incorrect". Ergo WP's definition of spam may be innacurate. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarab_132e.html" title="User:Barab">Barab</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. You people have no right judge the social and cultural implications of NoPoint.org based on your narrow viewpoint. For example, I do not study astrophysics, yet I do not go and mark the astrophysics page for deletion because the subject is not of immediate importance or interest to me. I understand and respect the fact that there is a community that astrophysics is important to, so I believe they are entitled to a page. Although it may not be apparent to you people sitting in front of your monitors, there is a community that appreciates the existance of a NoPoint.org wiki entry, albiet smaller than the astrophsyics community, yet no less important. Who are you to judge?

<ul>
<li>That's a perfectly fair question. There are two major reasons: <b>(PRECEDENT)</b> In a way, every VfD is a precedent. Nopoint.org has <i>absolutely no Alexa rank at all</i> (proof here: <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=nopoint.org" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=nopoint.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=nopoint.org</a> ) and next-to-no Google presence. If we were to keep this article just to be nice, then literally any website could argue that they deserve an article too, on the basis that Nopoint.org was kept. <b>(REPUTATION)</b> Wikipedia is, above all, an encyclopedia: a tool for people doing research. While articles like this are not personally offensive to us, a reader who finds Wikipedia to be clogged with unimportant, nonsensical, silly, trivial, and useless information is less likely to take wikipedia seriously as an information source. This is detrimental to Wikipedia as a whole and all the editors who work hard to make it a useful information source. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:33, Mar 8, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ok, I see your point. And thank you for a decent, reasonable explanation. The precedent case makes sense to me, as all the other website articles you guys shut down would want to be brought back up if you kept this one up. But can we make an exception? Ok, haha, probably not. I have to admit though, I was shocked by how passionate people are about shutting this page down. And although I do see your point about how people might not see WP as a serious information source...I'm not really sure how many people would consider WP as one. I use WP just as a hobby, but I would never use WP as a 'serious' source if I was going to write a paper, or even a short article. I can't imagine citing an open source encylcopedia ever as reference...the only thing it would be good for is perhaps references itself to other materials. Just my two cents. And also, I'd suggest some people who browse the VFDs so often read up on these: <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobby.html" title="Hobby">hobby</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recreation.html" title="Recreation">recreation</a>. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKaneda_ae97.html" title="User:Kaneda">Kaneda</a> 22:39, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, his British neo-Nazi group (the <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_9th_Society_36b7.html" title="November 9th Society">November 9th Society</a>) seems weakly notable, garnering 158 unique Google hits under that name. On the other hand, "<i>Kevin Quinn</i>" himself is a bit harder to find. Searching on that name reveals nothing about this particular Kevin Quinn in the first seventy or so hits (I gave up looking at that point.) The top Google hits are for an assistant professor at Harvard <a href="http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~kquinn/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~kquinn/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, an athlete <a href="http://www.warrenmiller.com/wmiller/athletes/impact/kquinn.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.warrenmiller.com/wmiller/athletes/impact/kquinn.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, and a reporter <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/aboutus/Kevin_Quinn.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/aboutus/Kevin_Quinn.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

<ul>
<li>If you feel it was an ad hominem, which it wasn't, then comment on it, rather than deleting it. I didn't mean to be rude, but is pertinent to this discussion. You may have contributed much more to WP than your user history shows, but this is <i>unverifiable</i>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> 05:05, Mar 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's ad hominem in that you're attacking the person (or the person's credentials) instead of his argument. The issue here is whether the band should be able to have an entry. Whether or not I've ever contributed to Wiki has nothing at all to do with the answer to this question. -- Doubleplus
<ul>
<li>Look, you're taking this entirely the wrong way. This sort of tagging of new or low-edit users is a common occurrence in VfD discussions. The idea is that, if a user has very few contributions to date, there's a good chance that the user may be arguing <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Votes_for_Deletion_c9d4.html#Discussion" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for Deletion">in bad faith</a> or engaging in <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">sockpuppetry</a>. I was not implying that you <i>were</i> doing either of those things; I was just pointing something out that will be useful to both the discussion and to the administrators that make the final decision.

<li>I wasn't taking it personally; I was pointing out what I believed to be a logical fallacy. But thank you for making the effort to clarify what you were saying.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who's saying that credentials are irrelevant? If you were overseeing a local election and a 14-year-old came in to vote, wouldn't you turn him away and say "Sorry, but you're below voting age"? If someone walked in and couldn't show evidence that he actually lived in the municipality whose next leaders he wanted to help choose, wouldn't you turn him away? One of the biggest myths of VfD is that, just for showing up, any random editor gets an equal vote -- even if they show no signs that they've been around long enough to understand Wikipedia's standards, or even any sign that they give a damn about Wikipedia's standards. If you don't think that's fair, then let us manage your band. It doesn't matter that we have no experience, aren't familiar with your music, and may in fact only want to sabotage you -- we showed up, and no other "credentials" should be relevant. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 16:59, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What do you mean by "your band"? I don't have a band. I've been following the Ponies for a couple of years now and I decided to post a stub for others in their sizable fan base to expand on. And using your own logic, you shouldn't be taking part in this decision anyway. You don't live in SD, and you don't follow free-form jazz/rock acts (as far as I know), so how can you say that this band isn't notable enough in either of those regards to merit an entry? The "sole representative" line that's being beaten about is just a conceit on my part and can easily be edited. -- Doubleplus 17:25, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Here's a hint for you: A Wikipedia article is not a right. The standard is not "The band gets an article unless someone shows they shouldn't", it's "The band doesn't get an article unless someone shows that they <i>should.</i>" Claiming that I don't have the knowledge to dispute the evidence presented for their notability is moot until such evidence is presented. And if you don't want to play by those rules, then go elsewhere. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:44, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>This is not my only edit, I simply do not feel the need to maintain a vanity account on wiki and make my edits as such. I think the real purpose to which user accounts appears to be turned is to establish a criteria for rejecting contributions, which is absurd, and potentially marginalizing. "He's not one of us, just delete him, folks. Move along." Wikipedia has real fears, I recognize that and have seen some of the abuses of wikipedia, but most of the real abuses don't revolve around one-time edits. In addition, you are basing your arguments on a position of ignorance claiming we don't deserve an entry because you've never heard of us. As I and Doubleplus have shown elsewhere, Bologna_ponies do have contacts, affiliations, and influences in the local music community. BologniumNitrate</li>
<li>Even with the no commercial ethos, your groups hasn't toured, been featured in the media or hosted by any arts institutions, which may have pushed you over the line for notability--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 06:37, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It is only more difficult for a Creative Commons-licensed band to show notability; it is not (as you seem to be implying) impossible-and-therefore-irrelevant. Look at <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Sucks_8ff4.html" title="Brad Sucks">Brad Sucks</a>, whose music is all CC-licensed; his music has been licensed for use by TV shows and for commercials. That's evidence of notability. Merely saying "CC-licensing means you can <i>never</i> show evidence of notability and therefore Wikipedia should just waive that entirely for us" is a false statement followed by an unreasonable interpretation. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 15:57, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>From the above cited Music/Notability Guidelines</b>: "These are merely rules of thumb which some editors choose to keep in mind when decided whether or not to keep an article that is on votes for deletion." and "Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city." and "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise extremely notable." The last applies since Monk played in the past with <b>Tristeza</b>, which is a much more pop/profit minded band that you can "verify" if you like. -- Doubleplus
<ul>
<li>Well, the guidelines exist for a reason; they're generally applied equally to all musician VfDs that come up. As for the guidelines themselves: <i>emerging post-indie San Diego improv jazz/rock sound, of which the band remains the sole representative</i> does not exactly jive with calling the scene/sound <i>notable</i>, as you yourself describe it as <i>emerging</i> and the band being its <i>lone representative.</i> As for <i>was once a part of [...] a band that is otherwise extremely notable</i>, I'm not sure if Tristeza would qualify as <i>extremely</i> notable. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> 16:50, Mar 7, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The use of the term 'extremely notable' would appear to disqualify Tristeza completely (particularly since nobody has bothered to write an article for them yet). I mean, extremely notable would be a band such as, say, <a href="../../../j/o/y/Joy_Division_0c14.html" title="Joy Division">Joy Division</a>, hence <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Order_69d3.html" title="New Order">New Order</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monaco_%28band%29.html" title="Monaco (band)">Monaco (band)</a> would qualify for articles even if they didn't on their own (off the top of my head example).

<li>The reason for continuing, IMHO, is to establish a solid consensus. If someone were determined to flout consensus, they might try to delete the page in question and say "OK, I give, call off the VfD" -- and then, once the VfD was called off, recreate the page somewhere else and say "No VfD ever actually called for it to be deleted!"

<li><b>Delete</b>, See <b>What Wikipedia is not</b>, also the edits and reverts on the article show disagreement over article being objective and bias. The article states, "as the name suggests", which is not objective wording. The article was also created by Wikipedia user, Daniel C.Boyer, who is a contributor to the book(as indicated in article contributors) and has obvious <b>vested self-interest</b>. This is another violation of Advertising, also the redirect to AUTONOMEDIA, that page shows that the, Autonomedia, is in need of a cleanup as indicated by tag on that article. Also, there exists no credible reference sources regarding literary or critical review outside of the independent press. Author, Ron Sakolsky, is a pirate radio expert, not a surrealist with any literary or critical notability. <b>NON-NOTABLE</b><a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 16:45, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think it should be renamed "The Kiski School" as it says on the school's webpage. After looking at their website for awhile I did find that they were the oldest all-male boarding school remaining in the United States. I do not know whether or not this includes military schools or not. It does look pretty exclusive and boarding school enrollment in the U. S. has been on the upswing in years so it may as well be kept.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> and expand. (Agree on rename.)

<p>The school also had one of the longest serving headmasters in U. S. history. His named was John A. Pidgeon. Apparently, he served for at least 40years. He went to Andover where he played on the same baseball team as George H. W. Bush. Pidgeon retired in 2002. His wife is the state treasurer of Pennsylvania named Barbara Hafer. The Kiski School also has a noted football program. Joe Paterno, the coach for the Penn State football has often sent prospective players who could not make the grade academically to qualify according to NCAA standards. An example of this was Curtis Enis. U. S. Representative John (Jack) Murtha also went there. The schools that Kiski competes against include Mercersburg Academy, The Hill School, University School, Western Reserve Academy, Shady Side, and the Valley Forge Military Academy.</p>

<p>If a clothing item, such as a "bunny hood", makes an appearance in 3 different Nintendo videogames, does that somehow make it noteworthy and encyclopedic?

<li>Not by itself, obviously, (a well-written article about my favourite hat would likely go) but it's certainly a point in the right direction. My own personal criteria has always been--and is likely to remain--<i>A subject should have an article if it is reasonably evident that a non-stub article about the subject could be created without resorting to filler, trivia, or unverifiable information.</i> In this case, that is clearly true. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 18:14, Mar 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Point taken, changing my vote above to Merge only (should take some dude 15 mins to do that). But my google searches seem to return at least twice as many hits as you say occur for "Metal Box" in Super Mario context. (I found the minimum was 584 with ["Metal Box" Super Mario]). Given the order of magnitudes, this is a non-issue here.

<li>Well, it appears in a well-known franchise; someone has already written an encyclopedic article about it; and the content, while it could be merged elsewhere, would not mix well with other items (such as <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freezie.html" title="Freezie">Freezie</a>, which you've also nominated.) <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 07:34, Mar 8, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Again, thank you for your expeditious response.

<dd>Correct me if I'm wrong, but Star Trek has five TV shows, ten movies, about four hundred novels, some computer and video games, and has been known for four decades. I don't think "Friends" has reached quite the same level yet.<br />
But anyway, on second thought, I don't necessarily think <b>all</b> Star Trek characters deserve a mention. Characters like Commander Bruce Maddox, Captain Okona or indeed Dexter Remmick do. Even though they only appeared in one episode or so, they were an important part of that episode. Characters who have only appeared in the background (or worse yet, in some statistical listing in a Star Trek game) and could just as easily have been any other character, do not. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"></a> — <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 10:43, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I would have to suggest that, yes. In Canada, there's technically no such thing as a provincewide or nationwide elected office <i>per se</i>; we only vote for our local candidate and the premiership or prime ministership automatically goes to the leader of whichever party won the most local candidate races.

<li>I'm not a big fan of separate articles for non-starring fictional characters, but appearances in 15 episodes over five of DS9's seven seasons, including the finale, certainly makes her more notable than <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunt.html" title="Brunt">Brunt</a> or Data's cat, <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spot_%28Star_Trek%29_2e34.html" title="Spot (Star Trek)">Spot</a>.

<p>Just a question: this article was pushed to VfD on March 7th. Under normal circumstances, that would mean that a decision should have been reached on or about March 12th. It's now March 20th. What's the hold up? — <a href="../../../d/l/j/User%7EDLJessup_f14d.html" title="User:DLJessup">DLJessup</a> 02:21, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>No idea, but I personally think that if you take my vote out and a few others, I think the vote will still swing towards deletion. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> 02:47, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>This page is now preserved as an archive of the debate and, like some other VfD subpages, is no longer 'live'. Subsequent comments on the issue, the deletion, or the decision-making process should be placed on the relevant 'live' pages. <b>Please do not edit this page</b>.</p>
