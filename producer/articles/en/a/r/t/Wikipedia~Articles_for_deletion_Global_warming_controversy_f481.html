<p>In the heated climate of global warming, rational editing is impossible. The article is untidy, occupied by highly partisan groups on both sides, impossible to edit sensibly and is bad for the reputation of Wikipedia and so unfortunately should be deleted. I can see why it is separate from <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> but it really belongs with thart article and should be merged but in the present climate that would be impossible. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 09:46, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One side is clearly the group of editors that revert or remove text they simply disagree with. It is a pattern for nearly 2 years and it destroys the credibility of Wikipedia in the meantime. In fact, one of them has had an arbitration ruling against them for that very abuse. 4 of the 'speedy keep' votes are of members of the one side abusing the system to protect their POV. -- <a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_aboutme_96fb.html" title="User:Mnyakko/aboutme">Tony of Race to the Right</a> 14:44, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><strike><b>Delete</b></strike> I think the reputation of Wikipedia is more important than the existence of any page. There has been an ongoing dispute and all I can see is people at each other's throats. I have tried to help out as a neutral person on the Global warming controversy page, but it is beyond me. I have suggested a different split in the articles in a hopefully win-win scenario which would allow both sides to have their say with less conflict an ill fealing: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Global_warming#Time_to_accept_change" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Global_warming#Time_to_accept_change" rel="nofollow">Time to accept change</a> this has gone off topic.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> -- I agree with Mike the article is currently of poor quality, and editing is as frustrating for the rest of us as it is for him.

<li><b>Delete</b> The page is a constant edit war and it chases people away. The version that the administrators 'overseeing' the article continuously revert and delete for implies there is actually very little controversy. Read the talk page and you will see that there is clearly little "weight" due to one side of the controversy relegating the entire article to an encyclopedic equivalent of Flat-Earth Controversy. Much of the content is duplicating other articles. The function for the entire article is singulary: perpetuate edit wars for admins to exercise the influence. -- <a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_aboutme_96fb.html" title="User:Mnyakko/aboutme">Tony of Race to the Right</a> 14:33, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

The way the article is being used (by 5 of the people voting on this page) clearly makes the case that the article was created as a POV fork. Reading the history of the page also shows that the admins will agree to a consensus and then revert the edits weeks later. Wikipedia's process may seem to be disrespected with the RfD, but Wikipedia's credibility is diminishing the longer the article exists. -- <a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_aboutme_96fb.html" title="User:Mnyakko/aboutme">Tony of Race to the Right</a> 14:35, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> If Wikipedia had any value as an information resource, this article would not be aloud to get as bad as it is, but the majority of people don't want Controversy to be listed in the page about Global Warming Controversy. Much of the information in this article is listed with "yea but's" and even the opening paragraph has been constantly changed back to a version that states how little "controversy" there is. If that is the way it will be (as from what I can tell, there is a group of several users who have made this, among other "Environmental" pages a cause they are standing behind) then there is no reason for this page to exist. A "Global warming controversy" page should include as much "Controversy" as can be put into it, or should be deleted.--<a href="../../../z/e/e/User%7EZeeboid_0e8f.html" title="User:Zeeboid">Zeeboid</a> 14:42, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Info</b> I fully support both comments above mine (Tony and Zeeboid) and make them mine also. I would although wait for the neutrality issue to be settled before deleting the article. But this cannot be stressed enough&#160;: <i>A "Global warming controversy" page should include as much "Controversy" as can be put into it, or should be deleted</i>. Right now, a group of editors, some of whom are admins with strong opinions about GW, is using this controversy article to promote GW theories that are already presented in many other articles about GW. <b>An article about a controversy is neutral by focusing on the controversy, not on the majority opinion.</b> There is much to say about the controversy surrounding GW and I would be sad to see this article disappear, as it (could) also contains valuable information. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChildhoodsend_bd14.html" title="User:Childhoodsend">Childhood's End</a> 15:26, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I would have like for the RfD to have waited until the neutrality issue was closed, but I do think the logical step shortly afterwards would have been to delete the article as unnecessary and irrelevant since it portrays the topic as resolved, implies any controversy is overhyped and undersourced and thus equivalent to flat-earth types and the article functionally serves one purpose: to justify preventing the topic from being mentioned on any other global warming page. Kind of a reverse POV fork, to be quite honest. -- <a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_aboutme_96fb.html" title="User:Mnyakko/aboutme">Tony of Race to the Right</a> 16:34, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'm new to this article and debate (to avoid any of the seeming straw man arguments above) but I've now read through the entire article and the majority of the links to talk page debates. As far as I can see this article is well-written, evidently notable, and extremely well cited (although the article needs to be edited to arrive at a uniform footnoting format, currently there are two overlapping numbering systems representing either true footnotes or external sources). As such, this article clearly passes wikipedia's standards to be kept, particularly since POV issues are generally not considered sufficient reason for an AfD nomination (please see <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_not_be_needed" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">here</a> for that policy). I believe the only real AfD issue here is whether editor disagreement is sufficient reason to delete an article. As such, this is clearly a keep. There is no such thing as an article that is impossible to improve or maintain. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 15:49, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Are you volunteering to come and help ensure that happens? But seriously, Markeer, I would be very interested to know how we can tackle this problem. To be honest it almost needs a full time editor to ensure the more resourced side doesn't just squash the other - this just isn't practical. I don't think it is possible to reprimand people for enthusiasm, nor is it easy to convince the scientists that evidence from a non-science article (of an opinion) is evidence. My recommendation would be to totally reorganise the pages to better demark the science articles from those that are a record of opinion so that it is better understood what constitutes "appropriate sources" .... then have an experienced editor to monitor the situation to ensure that science articles were based on scientific sources, and opinion articles didn't e.g. reject opinions simply because they aren't in scientific papers by climatoligists. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 16:50, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps I could say that better. In order to document a controversy which is now essentially between a mainstream science/climatologists on one side and various people including geologists/economists/politicians/"opinionists" and others, if the only evidence that is permitted is science evidence from respected climatologists, then obviously the article will not accurately capture the nature of the controversy. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 17:13, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Are you both arguing that when a plurality of scientists believe something, it is therefore suspect? Because it strikes me that you're on shaky ground with that argument.&#160;:-) However, regardless of your point, it has nothing to do with whether or not this article should be deleted, only how or if it should be improved...which is of course the point I was making. This is not an AfD candidate article, this is a "Cleanup" or "has NPOV issues" article. Even Mike's reply to my "vote" was to suggest expert oversight or reorganization of the article instead of deletion, which of course highlights the inappropriate nature of this AfD nomination. Not liking the way an editors' debate or disagreeing with an article's thesis are NOT, emphatically NOT valid reasons for deletion according to wikipedia's guidelines. I voted Keep above having absolutely no opinion on the issues addressed in the article. MY issue is with this nomination, which in my opinion should never have been brought to AfD.

<dd>Hey, wait, I'm a computer expert, and I always thought the Y2K thing was bogus nonsense that would have no impact. I was correct. And for those of us who bothered to make their thoughts known, in the circles I was in, it was the prevailing opinion. But in general, that's not what was reported and not the experts quoted. (Kinda reminds me of Lindzen or most "man on the street" interviews.) Regardless, it was just my opinion, and there was no way to prove it -- but with time. Kinda like GW. Only time will tell. As such, since we'll all be very long dead before it gets <i>proven</i>, that provides the controversy on GW. With that in mind, how else would anyone think this page would be? I do agree mainly all the GW pages are in general controlled by those with an obvious POV that the evidence is clear. When others of a more um neutral stance on it make points that are against that view, they are looked at as being "on the other side" so it becomes very difficult to get anywhere. All that said, this article needs to stay, simply because it illustrates the lengths some will go to to keep their own ideas of what the truth is as being portrayed what the truth is. <a href="../../../s/l/n/User%7ESln3412_14b9.html" title="User:Sln3412">Sln3412</a> 19:59, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tony, when a few lines on the Hockey stick controversy are so heavily censored that one side will not permit it to say what the hockey stick controversy is, then it is obvious the page will never be worth having in Wikipedia. Most people are not employed to edit Wikipedia - it can't have permanent editors, without someone to enforce the normal give and take which builds good articles the page will never tell the reader what they need to read to understand the issue. There has got to be a point when Wikipedia admits it can't cover every article with a NPOV because too many people (including me) are here because they have an opinion - like Iraq, it is time to retreat! <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 14:32, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not "lots of controversy so delete", it is "controversy is not valid so article is irrelevant/unnecessary". -- <a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_aboutme_96fb.html" title="User:Mnyakko/aboutme">Tony of Race to the Right</a> 19:28, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Mike, its not about a oversourced side Vs. another, its about people pushing their POV to keep the Controversy about the topic out of the Controversy page. Users in the same breath have removed links to sites they don't agree with saying the sites are biast, while defending sites like ExxonSecrets.org and Mother Jones. the whole point of a <b>Global warming controversy</b> page is for the <b>Controversy</b> however this <b>controversy</b> is being hidded with opening paragraphs citing "concesus" and pointing out how wrong the <b>Controversy</b> is.--<a href="../../../z/e/e/User%7EZeeboid_0e8f.html" title="User:Zeeboid">Zeeboid</a> 19:31, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed for the whole. The main issue with this article is neutrality. It will be solved by focusing on the controversy rather than on the validity of GW theories, which are quite adequately detailed in many other articles. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChildhoodsend_bd14.html" title="User:Childhoodsend">Childhood's End</a> 14:32, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I dont see how it can possibly be considered WP:SNOW since there is significant evident opposition. There are other topics, such as some involving evolution, where a specific controversy page is used this way, to provide a place for all the opinions in a balanced way, and making it easier to have a NPOV main article. If it's not being edited in a balanced way, that should be addressed elsewhere. We can't say an important topic should not be covered because NPOV is hopeless--that's admitting the failure of the principle.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:26, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>: This is the most important scientific debate of our time. And Wikipedia should avoid it? why?? if it is heated, then calm it down. We shouldnÂ´t avoid debate - specially such an important one. There are more heated debates abour sports or celebrities, and these are far less important and far less encyclopedic than this one. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeibid_d985.html" title="User:Deibid">David</a> 12:31, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: If only we could have the page edited by somebody with a neutral point of view. Oh, wait, nobody like that exists, since whatever they'd come up with would always be seen as biased, since some never like their conclusions or line of reasoning. What is it, 17" or 20'? Or -5"? Make the big bad USA pay for all the cleanup, while letting polution-laden countries like China and India off the hook. See? Controversy. For those of you that might be upset about what I'm saying, that proves my point. <a href="../../../s/l/n/User%7ESln3412_14b9.html" title="User:Sln3412">Sln3412</a> 19:59, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but Tony of race to the right needs to make a Request for Comment, if he feels one "side" of the controversy is trying to "win". When people feel strongly that they have the truth (rather than an opinion), it's hard for them to even acknowledge that other can disagree. Let's stop calling each other out on "violations" and just try to figure out how to describe <b>each point</b> in the controversy neutrally. So that each side will say, "Yep, that's what my side says."

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>: I love the idea of a <a href="../../../w/r/i/Wikipedia%7EWrite_for_the_enemy_6f32.html" title="Wikipedia:Write for the enemy">Wikipedia:Write for the enemy</a> truce. I just re-read the whole page, and it has several good sections already. The NPOV comes through pretty well in these. The list of statements sampling claims by each side have similar numbers of entries, and the skeptics' claims cover a lot of what I've seen put forward for this side. I would like to see more history of the earlier stages. I'd have to go review some diffs to see what kind of edits have been facing reverts leading to so much frustration from Mike, ChildhoodsEnd, and Zeeboid. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirdbrainscan_dd4d.html" title="User:Birdbrainscan">Birdbrainscan</a> 03:20, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
