<dd>Oops. Should have known better. Anyway, Ducharis and I clashed over on <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_Damadian_6f18.html" title="Raymond Damadian">Raymond Damadian</a> and I made the error of revealing my true ID. Bad mistake, as events proved. Ever since he has been vandalizing pretty much everything I have posted on wiki that he can find. Erasiers, reversions, the whole bit. No good reasons and of stuff that nobody else has objected to. This last one just tears it. BTW, Ducharris in his rant missed the fact that I also am an MD, FWIW. Apparently others have had difficulty with Duch's erratic behavior.

<dd>Anyway, it is difficult to see how a bio of a researcher I published a few papers with three decades ago is a "vanity article". The article is cited and linked ad nauseum. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McGinness_1e08.html" title="John McGinness">John McGinness</a> PhD, MD is a major figure in <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organic_electronics.html" title="Organic electronics">organic electronics</a> and arguably produced the first <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanotech.html" title="Nanotech">nanotech</a> device. As if we need more endorsement-- This device is now in the Smithsonian instutions "Smithsonian chips" collection of early electronic devices. John's role in this field is generally acknowledged, e.g., in <i>"An Overview of the First Half-Century of Molecular Electronics"</i> by Noel S. Hush, <i>Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci.</i> 1006: 1–20 (2003).

<dd>I am by no means qualified to make any type of determination as to whether his work is of Nobel quality or not. However, being <b>nominated</b> for a Nobel Prize is enough to be considered notable. Let me rephrase the above statement in that he is angry that he was not nominated for a Nobel. Every research scientists loves their work and feels that it is very important; otherwise, why do it? But the wonderful thing about science is the entire peer-review process. He could think his research is wonderful, etc. But that doesn't matter. We need to see multiple, verifiable sources say that this individual is a "Pioneer" in organic electronics. Most textbooks give a history of those scientists that played an important role in their field. A google book search shows zero quotes for "'John McGinness' + organics." If he was truly a pioneer, then he would certainly be more notable and discussed a great deal more. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 23:33, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, after the 2000 Nobel business, John was nominated for a Nobel. By pioneering Melanin researcher Roberto Nicolaus, Head of the Accademia Pontanian in Naples. If memory serves, he is ex-officio a Noble nominator.</p>
<p>Second, John is like <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herman_Carr_2f9d.html" title="Herman Carr">Herman Carr</a> and figures making a fuss about "discovery credit" is, well, tacky. But even Carr finally came foreward, not to complain about the Nobel, but about getting deprived of credit for his discovery. I'm the pushy culprit here-- for years, I watched others take credit for stuff he had originally done and bugged him to step foreward, at least a little. When people he had a patent issue with won the 2000 Noble, I finally took matters in hand. Similarly, the issue is not the Nobel, but discovery credit. How would you like to discover something really important and then see somebody else grab credit for it?</p>
<p>Second, Hush in his PNYAS history of molecular electronics specifies it well. John was too early. BTW, this is not unknown--<a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregor_Mendel_b43a.html" title="Gregor Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a>'s work in classical genetics took 30 years to be recognized and Peyton Raus' 1910 discovery of a cancer virus in chickens waited even longer. This does not mean their discoveries were unimportant, Just too early.</p>
<p>Another major problem was Shirakawa <i>et al</i>, who came along three years later, rediscovered the high conductivity potential of the oxidized polyacetylenes and then proceeded to produce over 400 papers and patents with out a single reference to John's work. Under such circumstances, how could anybody coming later have known there was something prior to them? Also see Dulbecco's law. BTW, when I asked one of the Nobel winners about this situation and noted that we had sent them several letters, his dismissive reply was "Well, there's always history". Right about that.</p>
<p>The real problem was not missing a Nobel. As I keep being correctly reminded, that is just a matter of luck. The real issue was being completely stripped of any credit at all for an important discovery. Who gets the Nobel is a subjective judgement. However, here the 2000 Nobel citation is obviously <i>factually</i> incorrect. When I asked for a slight correction, noting our "prior art", I got the usual stony silence. The reputation for infallibility of the Nobel is more important to them than the true history of discovery.</p>
<p>More recently, my efforts have made people aware of this earlier work. Which is why you are now starting to see it referenced. BTW, if you want to see the references to Johns work, use "<a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanin.html" title="Melanin">melanin</a>" as a key word. The pigment cell people always knew about John. Same with people who work with the toxicity of <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adriamycin.html" title="Adriamycin">adriamycin</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/s/Cisplatin.html" title="Cisplatin">cisplatin</a>, or <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleomycin.html" title="Bleomycin">bleomycin</a>.

At the time nobody but cancer researchers had any reason to look at the electronic properties of the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polyacetylene.html" title="Polyacetylene">polyacetylene</a> blacks. Otherwise, it was a complete backwater. So, they hired John, a "real' solid state physicist. Which is why, by a delicious irony, the generally-acknowledged first molecular electronic device came from a cancer hospital.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The device was a "proof of concept" to see whether John's theory of electronic conduction in such materials (published in <i>Science</i> in 1972) was correct. Ironically, the Nobel winners did it the other way-- they stumbled upon high conductivity in another oxidized polyacetylene and then developed a model (pretty much the same as John's with the addition of <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solitons.html" title="Solitons">solitons</a> for the special case of pure polyacetylene) to explain it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Many anticancer drugs generate <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reactive_oxygen_species.html" title="Reactive oxygen species">reactive oxygen species</a>. So John was also looking at that too. All "physics". In a later reincarnation, John became a psychiatrist. Midbrain melanin is thought to play a role in psychiatric disease. So he also worked with psychiatric drugs. BTW, the inventor of the personal computor also eventually became a practicising physician. I'll expand upon John's interesting story later. <a href="../../../p/p/r/User%7EPproctor_c510.html" title="User:Pproctor">Pproctor</a> 13:43, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The exact exerpt from Hush's ANYAS article reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Also in 1974 came <b>the first experimental demonstration of an operating molecular electronic device</b> <i>(emphasis-added)</i> that functions along the lines of the biopolymer conduction ideas of Szent-Gyorgi. This advance was made by <b>McGinness</b>, Corry, and Proctor57 who examined conduction through artificial and biological melanin oligomers. They observed semiconductor properties of the organic material and demonstrated strong negative differential resistance, a hallmark of modern advances in molecular electronics.58 Like many early advances, the significance of the results obtained was not fully appreciated until decades later...(p 14)"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Similarly, the abstract of the review article <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=1546980&amp;query_hl=1&amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=1546980&amp;query_hl=1&amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum" rel="nofollow">"The Function of Melanins"</a> says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>" Aside from camouflage, its (<i><a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanins.html" title="Melanins">melanins</a></i>) other roles can be brought together by a unifying hypothesis as first proposed by .... and '<b>McGinness</b> nearly 20 years ago."</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> likes multiple accomplishments. Remember, besides characterizing the electronic and physical properties of the melanins in these and later papers, John did two things WRT the gadget at issue. The first was to define conduction mechanisms in polyacetylene-like compounds (ref. 1). This is a large part of what Shirakawa <i>et al</i> got the Nobel for. BTW, they claim not to have seen John's previous analysis in <i>Science</i>. So these were independent developments.</p>
<p>The other was, as Hish notes, <i>"the first experimental demonstration of an operating molecular electronic device"</i>. That is, John occupies the same position in the history of organic electronics as the guys who built the first transistor. Nothing analogous showed up for a decade or two. John also got two patents for solid-state organic polymer batteries, at roughly the same time as did the Nobel winners. Interestingly, the description of the material they ended up using in their batteries is essentially identical to the one John started with in 1972.</p>
<p>Similarly, I haven't listed this yet, but John was also the first researcher to demonstrate that the toxicity of the anticancer drug <a href="../../../c/i/s/Cisplatin.html" title="Cisplatin">cisplatin</a> is due to generation of <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reactive_oxygen_species.html" title="Reactive oxygen species">reactive oxygen species</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/ROS_0566.html" title="ROS">ROS</a>, as well as the fact that the toxicity of <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adriamycin.html" title="Adriamycin">adriamycin</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/s/Cisplatin.html" title="Cisplatin">cisplatin</a>, and <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleomycin.html" title="Bleomycin">bleomycin</a> has an important extracellular component involving <a href="../../../r/o/s/ROS_0566.html" title="ROS">ROS</a>. All avery big deals these days and by itself enough to qualify any researcher for <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. Similarly, John did signicant work on structured water (the basis of most MRI}, and the toxicity of certain psychiatric medications. Not bad for a solid-state physicist.</p>

<p>Don't understand your objection. John meets most, if not all of the WP:PROF criteria. To give one example among many-- As I hopefully have made clear, Dr McGinness plays essentially the same role in organic electronics (e.g.) as Shockley, Bardeen, etc. play in the invention of the transistor. That is, he built the first device. This is well-documented in a recent definitive history of organic electronics, which I cite at length. Nobody doubts it, well-established.</p>
<p>If you have any reason to question this assertion in the face of such documentation, please cite it so I can give proper credit to the real inventor of the "plastic transistor". This device is the parent of (e.g.) most color displays on cell phones. Similarly, few researchers have their work the subject of a <i>Nature</i> "News and Views" article.</p>
<p>If such does not meet the definition of "notability", it is unclear to me what does. Please list your criteria so we can discuss this issue. Also, I am not sure where you get the notion that John's work has been uncited. Please cite your sources, which are almost certainly incomplete. I suggest "Citation Index". John is cited extensively in both the pigment cell literature and the literature on the toxicity of anticancer drugs.</p>
<p>BTW, ever since defending <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_Damadian_6f18.html" title="Raymond Damadian">Raymond Damadian</a>, I have been getting flack from people who seem to be anticreationists and apparently have gotten the wrong idea. Just in case this colors your view-- I am the author of a major paper in the journal <i>Nature</i> on classic human evolution which was part of an on-going issue raised by <a href="../../../j/b/s/JBS_Haldane_3b34.html" title="JBS Haldane">JBS Haldane</a>. Details on request. Similarly, see Dr McGinness' Website at <a href="http://www.organicmetals.com" class="external text" title="http://www.organicmetals.com" rel="nofollow">www.organicmetals.com</a>. The second line is ""Here is a more curious case: white cats, if they have blue eyes, are almost always deaf.", Charles Darwin. Please don't feed the creationist's paranoia any more. <a href="../../../p/p/r/User%7EPproctor_c510.html" title="User:Pproctor">Pproctor</a> 19:22, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again, this AFD only occurred because I offended certain people over on <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_Damadian_6f18.html" title="Raymond Damadian">Raymond Damadian</a> by defending Dr Damadian, an avowed creationist.

<dd>The tremendous irony is that I am reasonably well known in human evolutionary biology. E.g., I published a paper in the journal <i>Nature</i> on one of few known examples of classic Darwinian natural selection in human evolution-- <a href="http://www.drproctor.com/rev/ascorbicuric.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.drproctor.com/rev/ascorbicuric.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>Nature</i> , vol 228, 1970, p 868 "Similar Functions of Uric Acid and Ascorbate in Man"</a>. Likewise, Dr. McGinness' work pertains to the other significant example of natural-selection in humans, skin pigmentation and latitude.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One reason I supported Dr. Damadian's claims to be one of the originators of MRI was to elevate the discussion and provide NPOV by showing that we board-certified, card-carrying "Darwinists" call things as we see them, even with creationists. Next thing you know, I am accused of vandalism and promoting "creationism"--obviously, somebody had not a clue. Similarly, my posts on other pages are getting deleted under spurious "vanity" objections and this Bio gets an RFD. Pointing this out is not "clutter" and it is quite relevant to this RFD.</dd>

<dd>Back to the subject at hand. Citing <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>-- You are merely expression "opinion". Not allowed here. Do you have any cite, evidence, etc., that Dr McGinness did not do exactly as the definitive documentary evidence shows. Similarly, how can you claim with a straight face that the inventor of the "Plastic Transistor" is not "notable". If you have a new color cell phone or a color display on your car radio, you are probably looking at the ultimate descendent of Dr McGinness' device. <a href="../../../p/p/r/User%7EPproctor_c510.html" title="User:Pproctor">Pproctor</a> 14:17, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
