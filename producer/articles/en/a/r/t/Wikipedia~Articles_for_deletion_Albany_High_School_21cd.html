<p>If someone feels as if the page <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albany_High_School_9f76.html" title="Albany High School">Albany High School</a> is a message board, <b>it is not</b>. No posting is allowed, and if that happens, <b>which it hasn't</b> than it would not be me that does it. It also <b>is not</b> a school project. This page is no way associated with Albany High School or the Dougherty County School System. I created it for one reason, and one reason alone; to inform anyone who cares about this school.</p>
<p>And futher more, I would like to add, that both the articles that ESkog has mainly contributed to, appear to be about sports arenas. I don't understand about how explaining the structures and facilities of two sporting complexes is a less "vanity site" than a page about a respected high school.</p>
<p>I would ask that this page not be considered for deletion because I have worked very hard on it, and I believe that it can offer useful information about Albany High. If there are any revisions or edits to this page that I could make to make a worse candidate for deletion, please let me know. <a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwister3328_3877.html" title="User:Twister3328">Twister3328</a></p>

<li>After a bit of discussion and looking further, I would actually vote that this should be <b>revised</b> or <b>cleaned up</b> rather than deleted. Apologies for the needless vfd - I know that's a pet peeve of many and, as Twister points out, I am still fairly new here as well. From looking at what I might consider a "model" high school entry, I think a great deal of the article may need to be removed, such as the list of faculty or the detailed descriptions of clubs which could be listed under thousands of high schools. <a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a> 02:25, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Move</b> - I agree with Peter Ellis. If this article is to be kept, it needs to be moved to a more specific article title. It may be located in a larger and more politically significant Albany, but it's still ultimately just a high school, so its location does not afford this article superior right to the article name over Albany SHS in WA. Also, although the Western Australian school is named "Albany <i>Senior</i> High School", it is common practice in these parts to just refer to these schools as "Albany High". - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 15:59, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</s> Edit: I see the page has now been moved to a more appropriate title. <b>Keep</b>. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_d9f5.html" title="User:Mark">Mark</a> 16:08, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've looked at Beefstew, it's utterly pointless. It dismisses many perfectly encyclopedic facts that one would expect to want to know about a school.

<li>Part of the problem here is the presumption that there is consensus that "non-notability" is sufficient grounds for deletion. Deletionists toss around "non-notable" as if it meant something. Some don't even bother with that and shorten it to "NN". Let's be clear: no such consensus exists. See <a href="../../../f/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7EFame_and_importance_8fa9.html#No" title="Wikipedia talk:Fame and importance">Jimbo Wales' view on notability</a>, as expressed in the poll where notability failed to become an accepted reason for deletion. The school may be insiginficant to you, but that does not mean that it is insignificant to readers living in Georgia. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 19:52, 16 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, there's no consensus, but notability is often the sole reason given for a deletion vote here on Vfd, so it's become pseudo-policy. While I am definitely a mergist by nature (in that I want any and all useful tidbits to be united together, see <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia%7EPokeprosal_9c70.html" title="Wikipedia:Pokeprosal">Wikipedia:Pokeprosal</a>), when something can't be merged in order to make it more useful than it can ever possibly hope to be in its current form... I'm at a loss and choose Delete.</li>

<dd>Conversely, what role *exactly* will an article about this school play on Wikipedia? Will it be a fascinating and detailed article, will it cover interesting things that non-Georgians want to read... or could one use speedy methods like Search and Replace to turn it into an article about any of dozens of other similar schools?</dd>
<dd>You say the school is not very significant to me; that is true, BUT the schools in my town are also insignificant to me. Are they interesting to me? Yes, quite. Would I expect to find them in an encyclopedia? No, because the vast, vast, VAST majority called the Outside World don't give a ****. Things that seem great to you are useless to others.</dd>
<dd>That is the key, really, who are we writing Wikipedia for, the entire world or selective groups? Is it supposed to be collective consciousness or "schools and streets and clubs in townnamehere" with selective readerships for each cloister? "oh, the whole world of course!" you quickly reply. But who is interested in a school outside of their state/province/country? Probably very few, unless it's Colombine or similar.</dd>
<dd>As with my work at <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia%7EPokeprosal_9c70.html" title="Wikipedia:Pokeprosal">Wikipedia:Pokeprosal</a>, I'd be blissfully happy if we could have things like High Schools in Georgia with subsections for each one. On their own they are entirely non-notable to all but an extremely select few (i.e., those in direct contact with them) but when put together can become an interesting look at high-school education in Georgia as a whole. THAT would be interesting. WP pages that are virtually NPOV equivalents of enrollment handouts for parents aren't.</dd>
<dd>Please understand me when I say this isn't favouritism, that even my *own* educational institutions are completely and utterly unworthy of individual articles here. It does not matter how near and dear they are to me and others, but what the outside world knows of them, or cares of them. That is not to say you shouldn't seek to learn things you don't know (as I am increasingly doing thanks to Vfds) but... yeah... pretty much all I'm saying has been voiced before on every ****ing Schoolwatch topic to date.</dd>
<dd>We have rules about notability of books, websites, bands, people, fictional characters, songs, etc., but nothing about schools. As yet anyway. Well, there's BEEFSTEW but that doesn't necessarily help and isn't "carved on a bronze plaque" yet. This Vfd should be an open-and-shut case with people assessing it based on their own opinion and the guidelines. As it is, every one of them dissolves into an "ethical" battle between "Schoolwatch fanboys" and "deletionist cronies". Now, if you'll excuse me, I have vanity pages to cull. THOSE at least don't have hangers-on... <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 07:01, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"No, there's no consensus, but notability is often the sole reason given for a deletion vote here on Vfd, so it's become pseudo-policy." So, because deletionists throw "non-notable" around as if it meant something, then it's a pseudo-policy? That would make it, in my opinion, a pseudo-argument, i.e., not a real one. Sorry, mob-rule doesn't work here.</dd>
<dd>"the vast, vast, VAST majority called the Outside World don't give a ****. Things that seem great to you are useless to others." I can assure you that Pokemon doesn't interest me in the least. I paid some attention to it while my nieces and nephews were into it, but now that they're all over the age of 9, it is too uncool for them. But hey, if it interests you, then why not include it on Wikipedia? My area of interest is not American high schools, but minor canadian political parties and politicians. It is great that there is a space like Wikipedia for those of us with that obscure interest -- which is not just uncool for 9-year-olds, it is uncool for people of all ages -- to share information.</dd>
<dd>"Is it supposed to be collective consciousness or "schools and streets and clubs in townnamehere" with selective readerships for each cloister?" With over 500,000 articles in the English version alone, Wikipedia is not going to be a summary of the most important collected knowledge, but a vast compendium of information that its editors want to write about. Endless articles on Pokemon, or even omnibus articles as you propose, do not, in my opinion, form a part of the collective consciousness. Pokemon will be gone in 10 years or so.</dd>
<dd>BEEFSTEW "isn't "carved on a bronze plaque" yet" - I don't think you carve bronze plaques, you engrave them. (Forgive my pendantry. It is an affliction.)</dd>
<dd>"As it is, every one of them dissolves into an "ethical" battle between "Schoolwatch fanboys" and "deletionist cronies"" Right you are. I think the best solution is for each side to retreat to their own corners -- let the schoolnuts have their articles, I can go back to my obscure Canadian political stuff, and you can have yours about Pokemon and whatever else strikes your fancy. There are lots of good reasons to delete: vanity, unverifiability, original research, etc. I see no need to add the controversial and inherently POV "non-notability". <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 13:57, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
