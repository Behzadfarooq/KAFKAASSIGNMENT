<p>Gamecrufty article about an international <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee_ba8d.html" title="Super Smash Bros. Melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a> tournament that claims notability on the basis of having had a whopping 186 entrants; the article says it's the most entrants in a tournament "of its kind", which is pretty easy seeing as there's no other SSBM tourneys to compete with it. As it stands, it reads like an advertisement for the next tournament. I'm voting to just get rid of it. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 06:37, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>A few notes. This initial reason for recommended deletion was based on a bias (negative personal feelings) toward the creator of the page. Reading through this article provides both citations and reports of the notablilty of this tournament. To view an unnotable tournament see NorCal Tournament. Melee FC has been portray by the media, and thus gone beyond that of interest community. Therefore, not only having a massive impact on the Smash community, but also is known outside of interest group. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.248.218.111 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.248.218.111.html" title="User talk:71.248.218.111">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.248.218.111_d61d.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.248.218.111">contribs</a>).</small></li>

That being said, there seem to be plenty of us quite unconvinced of this small gaming tournament's notability, as well as the article's unsourced assertions of magazine coverage and size, and turned off by the cut-and-paste from a flyer.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Those familiar with the Smashboards/Smash Brothers tournament community know that this has been the most competitive and diverse Smash tournament for the last two years, even compared with the professional leagues, therefore "non-notable" is not a reason to delete. It is a meaningful part of the Smash tournament scene's culture, and not just a tournament at some college or in someone's backyard, but held and supported by professional gamers who regularly compete in professional tournaments. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.74.212.255 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.74.212.255_1f41.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.74.212.255">contribs</a>).</small></li>

Because of publicity WSOP has become notable. What makes Melee FC notable is that if someone not apart of the tournament community is interested in finding out what the largest tournament in Smash is, they could search for it on wikipedia. Smash has sold over 6 million copies and as a result the interest group is much larger than just that of the tournament players, therefore people would be interested. This article is an interesting read for any gamer, smash related or not. Both poker and smash has received Television publicity. Also, this tournament has larger notablilty than many Magic: The Gathering players, which each have their own article. Also this article has notability because it is the most notability aspect of a certain interest group. The pinnacle of all interest groups already have, or deserve an article on Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.248.218.111 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.248.218.111.html" title="User talk:71.248.218.111">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.248.218.111_d61d.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.248.218.111">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It lacks notability because it has only been mentioned in Nintendo Power, the official magazine for all things Nintendo, and the homepage that organizes the tournament. World Series of Poker is televised on a national network. Magic the Gathering has a larger fanbase than SSBM, as the Gamecube was not very popular among the PS2 and the X-Box. If I were to hold a SSBM tournament at UM, I could probably gather upwards of 100 participants, too, and it could also be determined as international, because there would be plenty of participants who go to my university and are from other countries (<a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanzania.html" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, etc.), but that wouldn't mean it requires international notability on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 19:37, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Maybe you arent reading everything, NBC news team also broadcasted it on the 6 clock news. Also if you host a tournament it will not gather anything international. Melee FC is the apex of smash tournament and is noted as the largest tournament out come for a single fighting game. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.248.218.111 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.248.218.111.html" title="User talk:71.248.218.111">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.248.218.111_d61d.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.248.218.111">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Okay, it says that the local NBC station for the area, <a href="../../../w/n/d/WNDU-TV_0dd9.html" title="WNDU-TV">WNDU-TV</a>, broadcast a news report on the tournament. It's not like <i>NBC Nightly News</i> or <i>Dateline NBC</i> reported on it (which it would then be notable, because a news program broadcast nationally would have mentioned it). MELEE-FC is not as notable as (for an example) <a href="../../../q/u/a/QuakeCon_c54a.html" title="QuakeCon">QuakeCon</a> which gathers several thousand participants in a LAN Party, during which they play multiplayer first person shooters against each other (<i><a href="../../../q/u/a/Quake_III_Arena_a428.html" title="Quake III Arena">Quake III Arena</a></i>). <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 20:13, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also note that I said fighting games. Fighting games in general do not bring even over a hundred participants. Evo and can bring around 400 because it host seven games. FC3 however, was single handly able to bring 186 participants. There will be even larger tournaments this summer, however they have not yet occured. Also FC is an annual tournament therefore people interested in going and expect one every year. As far as fighting games go Melee FC has brought the largest crowd. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.248.218.111 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.248.218.111.html" title="User talk:71.248.218.111">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.248.218.111_d61d.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.248.218.111">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Uh, there were over 200 entrants in the MvC2 tournament at EVO in 2004.

<li>First, sign your comments with ~~~~, even if you are an IP editor. Second, just because it is a fighting game that got nearly 200 players in it's third year doesn't make it any more notable than if it was a Tekken tournament that got 400 participants and got mentioned on the local CBS network in <a href="../../../d/u/l/Duluth%2C_Minnesota_117c.html" title="Duluth, Minnesota">Duluth, Minnesota</a>. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 20:36, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I think the mentioning of MELEE-FC in the SSBM article is plenty. This article is not very interesting or informative to anyone who does not attend the tournaments, and the person who wrote the article even said that he doesn't care. I've been to both FCs and I'll be at the next one, by the way. <a href="../../../a/o/b/User%7EAOB_9b4e.html" title="User:AOB">AOB</a> 00:36, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I'm somewhat sick of this notability thing. Nintendo power and local news count as reliable sources, it's just that this article doesn't back up its claims with those sources. I don't think we should compare this to WSOP, but if this is the most important/successful tournament for this game, I think that's a reason we can include it. However, the article is full of inside information that only fans would know: this is not verifiable info and needs to be removed. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 13:11, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
