<li><b>Disputing "Deletion."</b> - "Fame," as per the noted objections, is not a necessary criteria to establish the relevance or informational benefit of an article. Previous users are selectively omitting information that runs counter to the deletion agenda. Users blatantly fail to acknowledge the relevance of the IMDB as a credible, secondary source, dismiss the relevance of "non-famous" industry actors (Richard Paro, Cyra Polizzi, <a href="../../../e/e/f/Eef_Barzelay_11d5.html" title="Eef Barzelay">Eef Barzelay</a>) who clearly have multiple acting and production credits amongst them (IMDB), fail to acknowledge well cited review clips in the article (Source: The Onion, Volume 39, issue 44 and Volume 39, issue 46. Reviews by Stephen Thompson), and fail to acknowledge other, credible, "non-IMDB" links that corroborate the history of the film. Users also fail to acknowledge the importance of the "art school," narrative content of the film as relevant or unique, as per the article which states "...Predating the 2006 release of Art School Confidential by director Terry Zwigoff, Grodmin is also one of the few American films whose central narrative documents the lives of students at a university art program." -- This one fact alone (despite the film's lack of "Hollywood fame") seems to make its entry of great importance; to artists, as well as filmmakers. -- While this film does not appear to be a packed with well-known celebrities - as the users suggest is necessary for inclusion in Wikipedia, - there seems to be enough verifiable material to leave GRODMIN (film) posted for those users who may find its information of use. There is no shortage of space in Wikipedia, and the merit of this film does have clear and obvious relevance to art students and independent filmmakers whose ideas and contributions are clearly of value in our society. -- User: GrantHyde 18:31, 22 March 2007 <small>— GrantHyde (<a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrantHyde_64e9.html" title="User talk:GrantHyde">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GrantHyde_ccf8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GrantHyde">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small> .

<li>Sorry. As a terciary source, WP is dependent on secondary sources reacting to the existence of article subjects, otherwise, lofty claims cannot be verified. IMdb is <i>not</i> a reliable secondary source but, not unlike Wikipeda, one that relies on contributor effort. Please present <i>The Onion</i> source and other coverage so this can all be settled. A film depicting life at art school is in itself truly not notable. <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurgh_9136.html" title="User:Murgh"><font size="-1">M</font><font size="-3">URGH</font></a> <a href="../../../m/u/r/User_talk%7EMurgh_f175.html" title="User talk:Murgh"><font size="-5"><sup>disc.</sup></font></a> 00:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sorry, as well. As I understand it, while the IMDB relies on contributor efforts to compile and submit its information, its different from WP in that all material is subject to official IMDB staff review amid further verification of its authenticity and credibility. Unlike WP where information can be posted and linger until its confirmed, nothing on the IMDB gets posted unless it can first be confirmed. The independent actors in this film (while obscure) do have credible profiles that have already been confirmed at numerous sources (Richard Paro (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1637823/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1637823/" rel="nofollow">Richard Paro</a> at the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Movie_Database_7ea7.html" title="Internet Movie Database">Internet Movie Database</a>, Cyra Polizzi <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1655971/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1655971/" rel="nofollow">Cyra K. Polizzi</a> at the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Movie_Database_7ea7.html" title="Internet Movie Database">Internet Movie Database</a>, <a href="../../../e/e/f/Eef_Barzelay_11d5.html" title="Eef Barzelay">Eef Barzelay</a>/Clem Snide (<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7045645/clem_snide_go_south" class="external free" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7045645/clem_snide_go_south" rel="nofollow">http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7045645/clem_snide_go_south</a>)). If you do a Google search for this film and its "screenings" <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=6Gt&amp;q=Grodmin+%2B+screenings&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=6Gt&amp;q=Grodmin+%2B+screenings&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> there do seem to be some articles and related material. While a film depicting life at art school would not be notable if there were already hundreds of movies out there that had already done so, the fact that this seems to be only one of a few that does so, strikes me as notable. I am basing this on the lack of information on the Web about other art school related films. -- As far as the director, Jim Horowitz is concerned, I can't seem to find much on him, but his article doesn't claim much, either. -- He directed an independent film and is a member of this cartooning society. While he may not be a high-profile character on the Internet, I know that the NCS is a very well-established organization, and only high level artists like Charles Schulz and Gary Larson are voted in. That, in itself, strikes me as significant. -- Like you said, these articles aren't wildly significant, but I think they do represent an element of importance. Maybe we don't travel in these circles, but I think those who do would be glad to find this information in place. -- I say we leave them for now and re-visit (if necessary) in another three months. I vote to remove the "deletions".
<ul>
<li>Please don't misunderstand that I suggest IMdb doesn't screen its contributions, but the actual existence of the media is the only criterion. WP however needs sources so the article's descriptive content can be <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attributed</a> to reliable publication. Otherwise, WP can only ever be another bulletin board of random truth. Mine or your opinion of this film's notability as an "art school" film is irrelevant in WP context, and only comes into play if a reliable secondary source suggests it. As is, this film's internet presence is almost exclusively IMdb and WP mirrors, the kind of publicity 1 motivated person can spread in half a day, and until that changes (or <i>other</i> media acceptable sources are presented), the article should be removed from WP, although there is nothing wrong with <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERFY_518d.html" title="WP:USERFY">userfying</a> the article until criteria are met. <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurgh_9136.html" title="User:Murgh"><font size="-1">M</font><font size="-3">URGH</font></a> <a href="../../../m/u/r/User_talk%7EMurgh_f175.html" title="User talk:Murgh"><font size="-5"><sup>disc.</sup></font></a> 13:56, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I first saw Jim Horwitz feature film Grodmin at the 2006 Lake County Film Festival, and recognized it as a powerful story, a psychological/surreal fantasy, which would appeal younger audiences. I approached Mr. Horwitz for the DVD rights to his film. Although Dreamfast Cinema will not be the label bringing Grodmin out on DVD, I heartily support the film and its maker.</p>
<p>One thing I know about releasing a film with limited festival exposure, is that reviewers are reluctant to review the film until it is available for home-viewing, and reviews are often timed to appear very close to the DVD release date. As there has been no DVD release date set yet, (to my knowledge), it is totally understandable that there are few reviews to document Grodmin.</p>
<p>Independent films come in all forms: those with large budgets and known actors, through those with no budgets, assembled by passion. Grodmin is the latter. To expect every film to have the same resources and publicity, just by virtue of being made, is to misunderstand the entire genre. When Grodmin is released in a home-viewing format, it will be easier for everyone to track, and who knows, there may even be some reviews to feed those hungry for facts.</p>
<p>I vote to leave Grodmin in Wikipedia, whether or not it receives further verification.

<dd>Noone disputes that the movie exist, but existence isn't enough to justify inclusion in Wikipedia. We need reliable, secondary, independent sources establishing the notability of each entry and the correctness of the claims an article makes. Is the film really "groundbreaking"? We have only the article's word for it. Did it fool irts audience into believing its fictional lie? Again, we only have the article to support that claim. Being listed at the IMDb only shows that the movie exist, but nothing more. Yiou can compare this to the requirements from <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>: it is not enough to have recorded an album to be listed in Wikipedia. Similarly (per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, it is not enough to have made a movie and shown it once or twice to have an entry for that movie in Wikipedia. If the DVD release happens, and if it then gets considerable reviews (not just in the local newspaper and the University newspaper), then it can be recreated. For now, it's a completely non notable movie. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 08:21, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Disputing "Deletion."</b> - "Is the film really "groundbreaking"? We have only the article's word for it. Did it fool its audience into believing its fictional lie? Again, we only have the article to support that claim." - This is clearly not true. I have found 9 separate reviews of the film at the IMDB <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796215/usercomments" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796215/usercomments" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>; one of which is from someone in Germany. I have no data on whether or not these reviews were written by "professional" writers, but as individual voices corroborating the "groundbreaking" elements of the film, I see no reason why this audience testimony should be marked as invalid, or irelevent? These reviews clearly verify the claims of the article. The points made by the user above, Bruce Wood (a film producer, no less) all seem quite valid. I think the "deletion" users are splitting hairs over the alleged "importance" or so called "prominence" of other sources. As cited above, the film is a fact and has already been reviewed by multiple people. I vote to remove the deletion notices and leave GRODMIN (film) in Wikipedia for another 2 months, pending more investigation into its validity. Perhaps more sources will emerge, as user User:Dreamfast|Bruce Wood suggested. Let's check back on May 23, 2007. If there are no new posts about this matter in 24 hours, I will consider the matter closed and remove the deletions. [User: GrantHyde] 11:52, 24 March 2007

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't see any reason to think this is a hoax, just a low-budget independent film that received a few obscure screenings without getting a commercial release or any full reviews in significant publications. The fact that this movie deals with life in art school does not convey notability in itself, nor do the cast members who are not particularly well known themselves. If the film gets a commercial release on DVD, and then reviews start coming out in notable publications, the article can be recreated at that time -- preferably under the name Grodmin since the title isn't an acronym and doesn't need disambiguation. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 21:48, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Going on lack of notability, no reliable sources to establish notability. Despite the disputes above, unless these are fixed, the issue won't be settled. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 21:50, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Clarification</b>. As it pertains to this article, how are we choosing to define "notability?" "...No evidence to support third parties unrelated to the film are discussing it," but no reason to think that they are not. Also, what do we mean when we say "reliable" sources? Is the one film festival that the film director above mentioned "reliable?" Aren't the various, small showings above "reliable?" Or, is it going to be our claim that in addition to supporting this article "weakly" (which, in itself, seems vague) that some of these sources may, in fact, be "fake." -- That's a very slope. I don't think it speaks well for what's supposed to be a reasonable and open-minded debate While the consensus seem to be that the film needs more sources to establish its importance (which I agree), I think some of the terms used in the above statements seem a bit off. Can someone please paste the WPs "notability" criteria below. Also, that which establishes the reputability of the third party source? I think it would help us all with this discussion.

<li><b>Comment in response</b>. Excuse me, the website is a hoax. Also, see the text at the bottom of the source code for the article: <i>hoax|reason=Anything concerning the Hurley Pugh is entirely fictional. The purpose of any related documentation and anecdotes concerning the Hurley Pugh is intended to satirise the British motorcycle manufacturing industry. The marque was invented for the purposes of entertainment only. The article does appear to be suitable for Wikipedia, but more sources are needed to determine that it is a fictional bike</i>
<ul>
<li><b>Further Comments</b> This is a very clever hoax that seems to have fooled a lot of people. Let's look at some additional 'evidence' from the quoted website and Fisk a few comments...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The site claims that the factory archives were discovered in the "Linenhall Thinking Orangemen's Library" in Belfast. There is no such place but this is clearly a reference to the real <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linen_Hall_Library_1331.html" title="Linen Hall Library">Linen Hall Library</a> in that same town.</li>
<li>The site claims that a military version of one machine, the <i>HP90AM 1600</i>, had a mounting for a <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bren_Gun_db81.html" title="Bren Gun">Bren Gun</a>. The Bren gun did not enter service until 1938, was a two-man weapon, and only ever vehicle mounted on to conventional four-wheel armoured troop carriers.</li>
<li>The site claims to have recordings from the works canteen - assuming that the 'company' ceased trading in 1943 then how were these recordings made in the days before magnetic tape, and the common use of the wire recorder?</li>
<li>The rider <i>Sidney "Forelock" Tuggings</i> has a short biography in which it is claimed he served in the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Engineers_bc48.html" title="Royal Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> and attained the rank of <i>Acting Lance-Sapper</i> - there is not,and never was, any such rank.

<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>BUT WAIT, there's more! The Hurley-Pugh website is registered to a Mr Ivor Benjamin of London, E8. Its registration date coincides with the demise of the magazine 'Motorcycle International' - who carried spoof articles under the name 'Fettler'. Ivor Benjamin is also involved in other spoof projects such as this spoof Christmas letter (that namechecks Hurley-Pugh) at <a href="http://www.gland.freeserve.co.uk/gfxmas99.html" class="external free" title="http://www.gland.freeserve.co.uk/gfxmas99.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gland.freeserve.co.uk/gfxmas99.html</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but rename <i>Hurley-Pugh Hoax</i>. Instead of superficially checking the internet I should have checked my brand catalog, sorry. It is interesting just to show how far a hoax can go over the internet. Then again I should have seen that it is a hoax by just reading the page until the 10 cylinder bike. As far as I know the most cylinders ever on a motorcycle were seven (star engine in the front wheel) around 1890 <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 13:33, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Do we have sufficient third-party coverage of this hoax to keep the article? This does not seem so clear to me. But in any case, the article in its current form is entirely unacceptable as it is <i>participating</i> in the hoax rather than <i>uncovering and detailing it</i> as it should. I suggest that if this is kept, the article be indeed moved to Hurley-Pugh Hoax and edited accordingly. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 20:19, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm a student at Edinburgh and I hadn't heard of this society until very recently. When I first came across this article, I thought it was ridiculous. Recently, I went to the university library. I could only find one of the books (Heckethorn). The book has a short entry on the society and Jacobite connection was mentioned. That said, it's a very old book. I don't know too much else, but there was another mention of it in the editor's comments in the student newspaper the other day. All in all, there appears to be <b>some</b> factual basis for the society. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangrove22_89a0.html" title="User:Mangrove22">Mangrove22</a> 20:30, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Original research. No secondary sources are cited and the ideas discussed do not appear in standard secondary sources on Economics. A Google search for "Physical Economics" mostly turns up references to the single paper cited in the article and to the Wikipedia article itself. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJyotirmoyb_d7de.html" title="User:Jyotirmoyb">Jyotirmoyb</a> 06:04, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Google Scholar comes up with various uses of the term, a couple of which seem appropriate <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22physical+economics%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22physical+economics%22" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. The article has been the subject of some edit warring in the past, per talk. Perhaps there is an older version that is less scarred from these edits? <a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/m/User_talk%7ESmmurphy_5e09.html" title="User talk:Smmurphy">Talk</a>)</sup> 23:07, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Although the standard database on the subject , <a href="../../../r/e/p/RePEc_a768.html" title="RePEc">RePEc</a>, lists 0 articles or working papers with the phrase in title or abstract, some of the GS hits are indeed real &amp; I suggest the supporters of the article add them. The material in the article, as is obvious, is so undocumented and so close to OR that it is easy to see why it could have been taken as fringe social science--especially considering the reported but undocumented origin of the phrase. I removed the most obvious OR portion. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:08, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The thing is, I'm not sure the GS hits are talking about the same thing. Physical economics in the article seems to be talking at times about emphasizing physical/material capital and de-emphasizing financial market capital, while some of these articles talk about the relationship between physics and economics models.</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, van Lierop, Wal and Braat, Leon. <i>Multi-objective modelling of economic-ecological interactions and conflicts</i> The Annals of Regional Science Volume 20, Number 3 / November, 1986 p 114-129 mentions that the term is also known as Materials balance models and is used with some success in environmental economics in the 1960s and 1970s. Searching googling and GS'ing for that comes up with quite a bit of stuff, much of it fairly mainstream (this article right now is about a recent left-wing derivative of the idea). I don't know what people who have been editing the article think of that scholarship, but it seems to me that the bulk of the article could easily focus there. That would bring up the question of a change in title("Materials based models in economics"?), which might actually lead to this article being recreated as a discussion of the more recent, radical assessment of the subject. <a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/m/User_talk%7ESmmurphy_5e09.html" title="User talk:Smmurphy">Talk</a>)</sup> 02:11, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>By the way, there is a relevant ArbCom ruling on one of the major proponents of the radical version of this theory, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Lyndon_LaRouche_f54e.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Lyndon LaRouche">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Lyndon_LaRouche</a>. Again, I haven't been active in the article, and don't want to change it fundamentally, but the LaRouche issue makes me want to completely rewrite the article, depending on the outcome of this AFD and the comments of those active in the articles talk page. <a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/m/User_talk%7ESmmurphy_5e09.html" title="User talk:Smmurphy">Talk</a>)</sup> 02:21, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't delete. Physical economics is real. LaRouche is nutty enough to ruin ideas by association, but he didn't invent physical economics.

<dd>There seems to be confusion between <a href="../../../e/c/o/Econophysics.html" title="Econophysics">econophysics</a> and physical economics, which is especially understandable because the article itself is confused. My understanding is that physical economics is a term sometimes used in the field of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Ecology_7521.html" title="Industrial Ecology">Industrial Ecology</a> to differentiate between the real physical economy of matter and energy and the financial economy. It seems however that the LaRouche people have hijacked the words as googling for "physical economics" turns up mostly LaRouche garbage. Adding to the confusion, the LaRouche stuff looks like a pasted together amalgam of real concepts from Industrial Ecology, Econophysics, and other fields mixed in with their own absurdist ideas such as building railroads under oceans. Google "biophysical economics" the wikipedia <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biophysical_economics.html" title="Biophysical economics">Biophysical economics</a> article is very sparse but imagine it minus the bio. Since physical economics seems too much a larouche concept, perhaps the best idea is to redirect the article to "industrial metabolism" or "industrial ecology" as they are what physical economics should refer to. The Materials based models and Material flow analysis concepts are tools used in industrial ecology, among other subjects.</dd>

Failing that, WP has a pretty enthusiastic group of editors of articles relating to Kerala, so it shouldn't be hard to get some decent info. It's a real place (a reason enough for a <b>keep</b>), and it does indeed seem to have quite a few educational institutes. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 01:11, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Appears to be an existing community. Per tradition all physical locations, including villages, towns, and cities, are considered notable. It should also be noted that the word "village" in India may mean a community much larger than a North American or European "village"; a place with (if I read Google correctly) four high schools and one technical university likely has more than a few inhabitants. But we really need to put out a call to Wikipedians in Kerala to expand this. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 01:22, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>*<b>Delete</b> The article has been cleaned up, but I still see little evidence that any encyclopedic information can be found in reliable, third party sources. A single patent is the ONLY third-party verification that he has done anything notable, and still seems to fail the multiple criteria.

<li>One problem, I think, is that much of Omohundro's work was pre-web. It's going to take more time to track down cites than it would be for a net celebrity. I agree that the article needs citations, but believe that given Omohundro's publication record (in journals that I've heard of, and not random almost-vanity press ones) plus his involvement in the creation of two computer languages (each of which rates its own article, and which in turn refer to Omohundro in the first paragraph) that third-party cites can be developed. Might I suggest that instead of deleting the article, we flag it with a "this article needs sources" tag? --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippy_339a.html" title="User:Zippy">Zippy</a> 02:52, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Surely the cited publications are verifiable? Physica D, for one, is a major journal. And the <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Dobb%27s_Journal_57df.html" title="Dr. Dobb's Journal">Dr. Dobb's Journal</a> article is a mainstream media publication. I am surprised that we are discussing the notability of someone with multiple refereed publications (Physica D) and at least one mass-market publication (Dr. Dobbs). These plus the patent plus the creation of two computer languages <a href="../../../2A/l/i/_Lisp_da80.html" title="*Lisp">*Lisp</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sather.html" title="Sather">Sather</a> seem above and beyond the threshold. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippy_339a.html" title="User:Zippy">Zippy</a> 01:40, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Here's a source for Omohundro's connection to <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sather.html" title="Sather">Sather</a> from gnu.org: "Steve Omohundro was the original driving force behind Sather." <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/sather/docs-1.2/tutorial/intro202.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gnu.org/software/sather/docs-1.2/tutorial/intro202.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. The same source gives Omohundro as one of the co-authors of the Sather 1.0 compiler, and also cites his Dr. Dobb's article on Sather. There are many more references available via a Google query on "Steven Omohundro". I don't mean to claim that Sather is his only route to notability, but instead to show that the claims in the article are easily verifiable, and that I believe the main issue is not so much one of notability as it is one of a question of the validity of the claims. Sather and *Lisp were well known languages within the CS and AI communities in which they were developed. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippy_339a.html" title="User:Zippy">Zippy</a> 02:32, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

A caution about Google Scholar: Google Scholar works well for fields that are (1) paper-oriented and (2) where all (or nearly all) respected venues have an online presence. Most papers written by a computer scientist will show up, but for less technologically up-to-date fields, it's dicey. Even the journal Science puts articles online only back to 1996. Thus, Google Scholar should rarely be used as proof of non-notability."</i> Note that I'm not using it as proof of non-notability and that this is in fact about a computer scientist. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 15:22, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per David Eppstein. I usually prefer the ISI citation index over Google scholar, but GS favors the sorts of publications which have real currency in CS circles, even if they don't for other disciplines. (Omohundro's ISI h-index is a mere 4). It seems to me that notability is evident, but someone needs to bring the articles relating to his work up to encyclopedic standards. \begin{rant}So many academics with Wikipedia biographies seem to be in fields that have exceptionally poor Wikipedia articles, suggesting a greater interest in putting CVs on WP than on writing encyclopedic articles. \end{rant}. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 04:00, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Technically, published primary sources are not original research, but I agree, an article has to stand on independent, <i>secondary</i> sources. Cite and Google counts are only approximate metrics of notability, the proof has still to be brought that the academic output has been noted. (A cite can mean anything from a listing as "related research" to an in-depth response. Here we're only interested in the latter.) ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 06:08, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I find this need for idealogical purity baffling. Is any of the claims in the article "challenged or likely to be challenged"? In what sense do the easily found primary sources for these claims fail to document them? <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> does not say to avoid primary sources; it says only that they should only be used for clear descriptive claims. But Omohundro's authorship of various primary works about Sather, e.g., cannot reasonably be in doubt. Secondary sources are needed to document the significance of this work, but for that purpose cite counts are I think adequate. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 00:04, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Google Books has no hits. A Google search to try to identify "S. Gonzalez" who allegedly coined this phrase, was unsuccessful.

<li><b>Keep</b> It looks fine to me.

I guess I think we should be tougher in our standards for middle schools than high schools, because they are less notable and less important.

<li><b>Delete</b> Fails <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Just because someone bothers to write an article doesn't mean it should be included (unfortunately). Notability guidelines state that the onus is placed on the editor (and the community at large) to produce reliable sources. If notability can be established through the participation in the PDE's School Climate Improvement Project then it may be eligible to be kept but this depends on the size and scope of the project. There may not be a consensus between editors on the notability of <a href="../../../e/d/u/Educational_institutions.html" title="Educational institutions">educational institutions</a> but until one is reached we must attempt to follow the guidelines set down in <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> which covers <a href="../../../e/d/u/Educational_institutions.html" title="Educational institutions">educational institutions</a>. <a href="../../../x/a/r/User%7EXarr_c4f1.html" title="User:Xarr">Xarr</a> 13:51, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>In almost all practical senses, a public school's own Web site, minus the gushing and laudatory adjectives, is a reliable source, certainly for basic facts. In the United States, the <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Child_Left_Behind_37a8.html" title="No Child Left Behind">No Child Left Behind</a> Act seems to require that state governments create annual reports on schools, constituting an independent source of information. Therefore, as commmon sense will tell us, the nature of reliable sources on public schools is fundamentally different from other organizations listed at <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>, and as <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> tells us, we can overrule <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>. Just because someone bothers to write a policy that fails common sense in a particular instance (or even category), doesn't mean we have to march over the cliff behind it. Addressing notability doesn't end the matter of whether a school article should stay or go: If some school articles attract vandalism or don't take advantage of the reliable sources available, they can and should be merged into district articles, letting readers who type in the school's name be redirected to the district article. This does not address non-U.S. schools and private schools.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 17:34, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> What are the <i>objective criteria</i> for including or excluding middle schools that can be applied to <i>all</i> schools? If that cannot be articulated, then delete-voters has no objective reasons for their vote. They are just making it up as they go along (i.e. <i>notability -- I know it when I see it</i>). It's totally lame and <i>arbitrary</i>. One reading these votes to delete would come to no insight into how to write an article that you delete-voters could find satisfactory.

<dd><b>neutral</b> Most subjects are subjective to some extent--only the general requirements for RSs is always present. There are none here--the district is not independent, and the Penna. report is included within the Great Schools and gives no specific non-trivial information. The reason there are so few newspaper and other articles on middle schools is clear: the media find nothing to write about. Even the criterion of helping readers is unnecessary: anyone who goes to google will find the same sources as used here. WP is not Great Schools.

<dd>DGG, first, you can't be comparing some reader reading an article with trawling through Google to find information. You didn't write that. My eyes are lying to me. And you must not have looked to closely at the Pennsylvania DOE Web page -- that is, their <i>main</i> Web page for the school. If you click on the pyramid-shaped triangles, you get far greater detail than Great Schools provides. So much detail that your eyes will quickly glaze over. There are few articles on this middle school, but there are almost 600 in the Google Archives link I provided at the Walnut Middle School deletion discussion, and many of those focus on the school. Walnut wins <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotable_e66c.html" title="WP:Notable">WP:Notable</a> hands down; this one, not so much.

<li><b>Comment</b> Delete-voters, do you expect <i>newspapers</i> to make a middle school the subject of an article in the performance of its core function of educating the young people of a community? There are no headlines reading <i>"Sun rises as expected"</i> The criterion that a middle school has to have google-able headlines to be included is unrealistic and will excluded schools that should otherwise be included. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatsw_2d50.html" title="User:Patsw">patsw</a> 12:45, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's a classic case of an article that <i>needs editing</i> not deletion.

<li>Like I said, I nominated it for deletion because "unusual" is inherently subjective (as is "humorous"; which is why I nominated them together). How would you define an objective criteria for what to include? And, as I said, everything here that is referenced and notable already has a separate article or is mentioned in the proper context. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> (<a href="../../../k/r/i/User_talk%7EKrimpet_8927.html" title="User talk:Krimpet">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Krimpet_c408.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Krimpet">review</a>) 03:32, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> While it may not be possible to draw the precise line between what is unusual and what is not, most of the units in this interesting list are indeed unusual, in the sense that their use is limited to a narrow circle of people or to a particular moment in time. Others, such as "storeys" are in wide public use, but have no formal status. This is a worthwhile reference. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green"><small><sup>talk</sup></small></font></a> 04:36, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Perhaps rename to "List of non-Imperial, non-metric units of measurement".

<li><b>Keep</b>. At least has some references and other meritable qualities, not the least of which is being interesting and informative. A much weaker <b>keep</b> for the second nom ("List of humorous..."), not as much worthwhile material, but some entries are informative. Both articles need substantial cleanup and editing/cutting (more so for "List of humorous..."), but neither deserve deletion because they don't really violate WP policy. --<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeattle_Skier_c9bc.html" title="User:Seattle Skier">Seattle Skier</a> <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESeattle_Skier_72b9.html" title="User talk:Seattle Skier">(talk)</a> 05:51, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> While some of the units noted do have their own article, this is far from the norm, and making individual articles would make every single one of them into a stub. I have previously done major editing to remove items that violate WP policies. As for teh arbitary wacky SI-imperial pairings, they may well be arbitary, but that doesn't change teh fact that they exist and are in real use. I concede that "unusual" may be POV, but I am at a loss for a concise term that would catch the essence of such a list (non-Imperial non-SI doesn't work - too long, and ignores traditional units from country xyz). <a href="../../../r/h/i/User%7ERhialto_3647.html" title="User:Rhialto">Rhialto</a> 09:11, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>When I split out the humorous units from the original strange units (as it was then called) article, it was because the article was much too long, so re-merging the two would be a bad idea. There is a definite conceptual difference between the two articles though. Unusual units is meant to list those that see real use, and should be considered reasonably scientific. Humorous units is meant to list those units written with the specific intent of making a joke. As such, it is not scientific at all. But it does document a certain brand of humour, and articles that document humour certainly do have a place in wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/h/i/User%7ERhialto_3647.html" title="User:Rhialto">Rhialto</a> 22:10, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page was nominated for deletion once before, and survived. What was not mentioned by any of the participants, however, is that the article contains <i>no</i> references whatsoever. That's a clear violation of Wikipedia policy (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>). Furthermore, the existence of an article for an election taking place <i>two</i> cycles <i>after</i> the next one pretty clearly violates <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a>. The corresponding 2008 article is understandable because there has been a lot of notable speculation that can be cited to specific sources in the media; even for 2010 there are some decent sources. Here, there are no sources at all and no evidence anyone but Wikipedia is even talking about this future election. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 03:38, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Senate terms are six years long, so the information within the article seems somewhat feasible.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's not two cycles after the next one: the 2012 elections are the <b>next</b> elections for the senators elected in 2006. I could conceivably see deleting 2018 or 2024 elections, but not 2012. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 05:08, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Skirts WP:CRYSTAL and some speculation needs to be removed, but otherwise given the nature of American politics an article 6 years ahead isn't unreasonable as it could be argued campaigning for then is already underway. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 05:09, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The problem is that the article consists of nothing <i>but</i> speculation. Every single entry, as far as I can see, contains a claim that a particular Senator "may retire." Not a <i>single</i> source is provided for <i>any</i> of these claims. The article arbitrarily lists any Senator over age 75 as "likely" to retire; no justification is given for this particular figure. This article smells a lot like <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. If it's to be kept, any unsourced claims will have to be removed. Removing all unsourced claims would mean an empty article, which would make it a candidate for speedy deletion. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 05:45, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Real planned elections (by constitutional law) that will directly affect all the 2006 Senate elections winners, whether they step down or run for re-election. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 05:49, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This election does directly affect current Class I senators. Must have some references to back up all the rampant speculation, though. Sources can be found for some of the senators, and deleting the rest won't result in an empty article, though it may be mostly a shell. If this said "2014", I'd obviously vote for deletion, but that article would be OK to start once the 2008 elections are decided and the landscape for Class II Senators is set for 6 more years. --<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeattle_Skier_c9bc.html" title="User:Seattle Skier">Seattle Skier</a> <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESeattle_Skier_72b9.html" title="User talk:Seattle Skier">(talk)</a> 06:05, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, as pointed out, this is <i>the next</i> election for 2006-elected or re-elected Senators. The intervening Senatorial elections in 2008 and 2010 will be for different Senators. I'm a bit unhappy with all the suggested redlinks, because most of those articles don't need to exist yet, but if these links are used to create them at least they will have a consistent format. The retirement speculation is pretty rampant for any older, multi-term Senator, so it will <b>not</b> be difficult to source this speculation, even though it really shouldn't be there without sourcing. Tag for references, and rein in excessively specific speculation. -- <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 06:18, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per a lot of people above.

<li>Sorry, that last thing I wrote sounds kind of snarly... I'm actually curious though. Why doesn't paragraph 5 apply here? Is it because it is <i>possible</i> to develop this article to something more than a description of the website? That argument would make sense.

<li>No, we don't. You appear to be confused by thinking these are the <i>only</i> slang names that can be used. I suggest learning more about slang. A quick trip to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wikisaurus:chav" class="extiw" title="wikt:Wikisaurus:chav">wikt:Wikisaurus:chav</a> should prove to be an informative start. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:37, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Okay, I don't know what the heck you're talking about, so we must be on two totally different wavelengths.<br />
"<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chink.html" title="Chink">Chink</a>," "<a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a>," "<a href="../../../k/i/k/Kike.html" title="Kike">kike</a>" and "<a href="../../../s/p/i/Spic.html" title="Spic">spic</a>" are individual slang names for classes of people. You claimed that "we don't have separate articles for individual slang names for classes of people," but each of those terms has a separate article. What am I missing here? —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 20:45, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll elucidate. Look at the Wikisaurus entry that I pointed to. There are a <i>lot</i> of slang names for this class of people. We don't have individual articles about chavs under all of those separate titles. We have one article on the stereotype, and redirects from a few alternative names (including <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charva.html" title="Charva">charva</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chavette.html" title="Chavette">chavette</a>, for examples). Now look at <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wikisaurus:penis" class="extiw" title="wikt:Wikisaurus:penis">wikt:Wikisaurus:penis</a>. We don't have individual articles about penises under all of those slang names. We have one article about penises at <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a>, with (largely preventative) redirects at a few names such as <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schlong.html" title="Schlong">schlong</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/e/Weenie.html" title="Weenie">weenie</a>. The task of writing individual articles on individual slang words, documenting their multiple meanings and when they were in use, and collecting and cross-referencing lists of synonyms, is lexicography, that is the remit of the "lexical companion to Wikipedia" whose goal is to be a dictionary (of slang and otherwise, like other dictionaries) and thesaurus. As you can see from how far it has got with it <i>already</i>, it is a task that Wiktionary can do exceedingly well, far better than one could <i>ever</i> hope to do at Wikipedia (given, for starters, that Wikipedia's article titles are in English).
<p>Now an article title in Wikipedia denotes its subject. An article entitled beaner should be about beaners. But "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beaner" class="extiw" title="wikt:beaner">beaner</a>" (considerations of "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Beaner" class="extiw" title="wikt:Beaner">Beaner</a>" being a surname and our having a name disambiguation article here aside) is simply a slang name for a Mexican. We shouldn't have an article on Mexicans under <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaner.html" title="Beaner">beaner</a> any more than we should have an article on penises under <a href="../../../w/e/e/Weenie.html" title="Weenie">weenie</a>. Similarly, we could have an article on the <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semantic_change.html" title="Semantic change">amelioration</a> of slurs. But that, too, doesn't belong under <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaner.html" title="Beaner">beaner</a> because (a) the subject of the article would be amelioration of slurs not beaners, and (b) "beaner" isn't the only ethnic slur that people are attempting to ameliorate, by a long chalk, and such a scope is a ridiculously narrow one for the overall discussion. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:42, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>None of the above is relevant to fact that your claim was false. We <i><b>do</b></i> have separate articles for individual slang names for classes of people.<br />
Of course we wouldn't write an article about Mexicans under the title "Beaner." That's a straw man argument. The "<a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a>" article isn't about black people, nor is the "<a href="../../../k/i/k/Kike.html" title="Kike">kike</a>" article about Jews. These articles document the words themselves (and <i>can</i> extend far beyond the level of information appropriate for a dictionary). I'm not implying that we should have such an article for <i>every</i> ethnic slur (or for "beaner"), but it's patently incorrect to claim that we have articles for none. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 22:08, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Rubbish. It's entirely relevant, because it's what I have asserted right from the start. <b>No, we do not have separate articles for all of these slang names.</b> I've given you several examples of where we have just one article, for things that have lots of slang names. Your straw man argument, saying that I asserted that we don't have articles about these stereotypes at all simply in order to rebut it as "patently incorrect", is no more than that: a straw man. "We have articles on parts of the human body, and on classes of people, by their proper titles." was in what I wrote right at the start, too. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:13, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, what the hell are you talking about? It certainly isn't the same thing that <i>I'm</i> talking about.<br />
1. When did I say that we have separate articles for every slang name? On the contrary, I explicitly noted that "I'm not implying that we should have such an article for every ethnic slur." In fact, I don't even believe that we should have an article for "<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaner.html" title="Beaner">beaner</a>."<br />
2. I did <i><b>not</b></i> claim that you asserted that "we don't have articles about these stereotypes at all." In fact, I made no reference to articles about stereotypes, and I don't know why you keep referencing such a concept. The articles that I cited are about the words themselves (just as the "<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaner.html" title="Beaner">beaner</a>" article is), <i>not</i> the people that the words offensively describe.<br />
Again, you claimed that "we don't have separate articles for individual slang names for classes of people." <b>WE DO.</b> We don't have one for <i>every</i> ethnic slur, but some have had enough cultural impact to warrant such write-ups. Is "beaner" one of them? I don't believe so, but that's beside the point. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 01:42, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've explained what I'm talking about at length. When you said it was just above in this very discussion. (Your very words were "Yes, we do.".) You most certainly did create that straw man which you then proceeded to knock down. (Your very words were "claim that we have articles for none".) And we do not have separate articles for the individual slang names. You can see this for yourself, and your continued assertions to the contrary are flying directly in the face of evidence that we can all actually <i>see</i>. Just look at the things that I said to look at above. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:03, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Once again: Look at the lists of slang names that I've already pointed to; and note that we don't have individual articles for each individual name on those lists. You can actually see for yourself that we don't have separate articles for each of the individual slang names for these classes of people/parts of the body. I've even pointed out some of the redirects. Just look at the things that I said to look at above. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:28, 31 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Once again: Look at the list of slang names that I've already pointed to (<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chink.html" title="Chink">chink</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/k/Kike.html" title="Kike">kike</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spic.html" title="Spic">spic</a>) and note that we have individual articles for each individual name on that list. You can actually see for yourself that we have separate articles for each of these individual slang names for classes of people. Just look at the things that I said to look at above.<br />
You've listed words for which no articles exist and cited them as evidence that "we don't have separate articles for individual slang names for classes of people." That claim is false, as are your claims that "an article entitled beaner should be about beaners" and that a hypothetical <a href="../../../w/e/e/Weenie.html" title="Weenie">weenie</a> article would be about penises. Again, the articles that I have cited are about the slurs themselves, <i><b>not</b></i> the ethnic groups to which they offensively refer. The fact that many slang terms lack the societal impact to warrant the existence of standalone articles does <i>not</i> mean that we shouldn't have articles about <i>any</i> slang terms. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 16:50, 31 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>You've listed words for which no articles exist and cited them as evidence that "we don't have separate articles for individual slang names for classes of people."</i> — That's because the non-existence of articles <i>is</i> evidence that we do not have articles. I'm not sure how much plainer that fact could be. And if you don't think that an article entitled "beaner" should be about beaners, then you clearly need to read our <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a> and other help pages. Article titles denote what articles are about. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:38, 1 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>1. You've provided evidence of the fact that we lack articles about many slang terms (which is not in dispute). <b>This does not establish that we don't have articles about <i>any</i> slang terms.</b> (I've provided evidence that we <i>do</i> have articles about some.) What you're doing is comparable to naming people for whom we have no articles and citing this as evidence that we don't have articles about people.<br />
2. Again, the article's subject is the word "beaner." Hence, the title is "<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaner.html" title="Beaner">beaner</a>." Similarly, our "<a href="../../../k/i/k/Kike.html" title="Kike">kike</a>" article is not about kikes (an offensive term for Jews). It's about the word "kike."<br />
But again, I'm not arguing that we should have a standalone "beaner" article. I'm pointing out that your rationale is 100% incorrect. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 03:51, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Uncle G: I'm guessing by your style of English that you're hailing from outside of North America; I think in your hastiness to condemn this article as being unworthy of an encyclopedic article, and being merely a slightly expanded dictionary entry, that you're failing to realize that his term does indeed carry quite a bit of cultural significance in the southwesten United States, particularly in southern California. Yes, as the article stands now it is only a stub, but given the nature of this specific term there is unquestionably the capability for it to be expanded substantially.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is a mere dictionary definition. The content remains a discussion of the meaning, origins and usage of the word. I see no possibility of expansion past that. I have no objection to a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:transwiki">transwiki</a> to Wiktionary. I don't think that a redirect to a list article really solves anything, though a <a href="../../../w/i/_/Template%7EWi_3d1c.html" title="Template:Wi">soft redirect</a> to the Wiktionary page might. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 00:06, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>So you advocate removing the merged content from the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html" title="List of ethnic slurs">List of ethnic slurs</a> article then? —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 00:19, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>In the short term, I don't really care. In the long term, that page should also be moved into Wiktionary. The growing consensus across both projects is that <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Appendices" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Appendices">Wiktionary appendices</a> are better suited for list of slang (or list of pretty much any other set of words) pages. We can easily create cross-wiki links wherever that is appropriate but, in general, the editors who frequent Wiktionary have better skills and tools to write, source and verify lexical content than we do. Since the content of Beaner has already been transwiki'd, there would be no remaining GFDL issues once the slang list is also moved over. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 23:24, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and expand.</b> The article for "nigger" contains substantial information on the word's changing usage (especially in public discourse), its representation in literature, and so on. I found that article useful. If someone wants to expand the "beaner" article with information of that quality and scope, I'm all for it. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoorsAjar_0ce0.html" title="User:DoorsAjar">DoorsAjar</a> 03:43, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> <i>Deletion simply doesn't make sense</i>. Even if this is determined to be a dicdef (which I'm not certain it is) it still should be merged with Wiktionary, since no one's arguing the content isn't suited to Wiktionary. If this is to be redirected, again, simply merge the content.</li>
<li>As for whether this is dictionary or encyclopedic content, the main issue seems to be what constitutes usage notes. According to the standard presented in <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICDEF_eedd.html" title="WP:DICDEF">"Wikipedia is not a usage guide"</a>, "Wikipedia is not in the business of saying how words should be used." Which is basically the standard, prescriptivist usage writing philosophy, as enunciated by Geoffrey Nunberg<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/7.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61/7.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. There is also the descriptivist view, which simply "records the facts of how a word is used and presents it in a neutral way". Which is the only way I can see this article being construed as a dictionary article. The problem with this definition of a dictionary article is that there isn't a very clear line between encyclopedic and dictionary content, since both try to "record the facts and present them in a neutral way". If you hold that <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> is talking about descriptivist usage notes, even though <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> is clearly talking about usage notes under the prescriptivist model, then the logical consequence is that all articles about words ought to be deleted, since there isn't anything to write about a word other than how it has been used historically and how it is perceived, all of which can be parts of a descriptivist usage note. However, since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> doesn't forbid articles about words, and even explicitly states that articles about slang terms are acceptable, and since <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> describes usage notes as "describing how a word should be used", we shouldn't impose outside conceptions of what usage notes are on Wikipedia and just follow policy. I would say this should be merged into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html" title="List of ethnic slurs">List of ethnic slurs</a>, but the size of this is getting to the point where it should be in a separate article. --<a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotJackhorkheimer_b41b.html" title="User:NotJackhorkheimer">notJackhorkheimer</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/User_talk%7ENotJackhorkheimer_17fc.html" title="User talk:NotJackhorkheimer">talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NotJackhorkheimer_ed1a.html" title="Special:Contributions/NotJackhorkheimer">contribs</a>)</sup> 18:28, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>For one, "Senior G8 leader" is a neologism. No google or google book hits for this term. The article would have to be moved to List of past G8 heads of government by time spent in office or something similar, which would be nothing more than a really trivial statistical list.

<li>Having looked at those sources, I'll withdraw my nomination. But the title you suggested also is not really correct. The article does not list the longest serving heads of state/government by the length of time they served, but the heads of state/government who were the longest serving in powere at the time they were in power, which is really confusing.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarabinieri_1a8f.html" title="User:Carabinieri">Carabinieri</a> 20:12, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Weak Keep</b></s>. A play written in 1636 that's still being put on today, and which (inaccurately, as it turns out) created the term <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platonic_love.html" title="Platonic love">Platonic love</a>, may very well be notable. I'm going to see what I can find about this play and see if I can expand this. Note: Changed vote to <b>Strong Keep</b> - play is on syllabi of courses of at least one major British university (the University of Bristol) and (possibly) Manchester University, and has over a dozen Google Scholar hits.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think it's quite remarkable; it's just not known to modern audiences. One interesting thing I've just found is that it's being taught at a major university, and is often referred to in books when discussing the pre-Civil War court of Charles I's wife. Apparently it has both historical and cultural significance. I'm going to have to take a trudge to the university library to pick up one of the 5 books directly about this play or the 74 others that refer to it extensively. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 11:46, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

It should be noted that many of the&#160;!votes to keep the article in the second AFD were based solely on the article having survived the first AFD. This ignores the actual arguments offered in the AFD and also ignores the fact that <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">consensus can change</a>. The arguments against the article as presented in the second AFD, especially the arguments offered by Serpent's Choice, continue IMHO to be much stronger than those offered in favor of keeping. With re-releases, director's cuts, newly-released deleted scenes and the like the running time of a number of these projects is open to debate. Much was made in the last AFD of a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5390372.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5390372.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC article</a> about the running time of Doctor Who, however, that reflects a misreading of the article. The BBC was talking about what show had been on the air longest with the most number of episodes, not what series, if all the material was run one after the other, would take the longest to get through. Note that two similar articles, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lengths_of_fantasy_film_and_television_series_bd53.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lengths of fantasy film and television series">Lengths of fantasy film series</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lengths_of_superhero_film_and_television_series_%282nd_nomination%29_84b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lengths of superhero film and television series (2nd nomination)">Lengths of superhero film and television series</a>, have been deleted for just these sorts of concerns. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 12:58, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - For the same reason as the last two times: it is a list that people are finding useful. All the information in it can be found in other sources, such as imdb.

<li>Your argument is that "the running time of a number of these projects is open to debate". Well that came up on the talk page and the community came to a consensus of how to list both originals, directors cuts, remakes, and whatnot. The list has largely stabilized on those issues.

<li>First off, "consensus can change" has nothing to do with "I don't like it" and your suggesting that I'm arguing IDLI by pointing out that people can change their minds borders on an accusation of bad faith. Secondly, what's changed is that of the three similar "lengths of" articles, consensus on two of them has changed against such articles and "consensus" on this article changed from "keep" to "no consensus." It is not at all unreasonable, in the face of two of three articles of a kind being deleted and the third closed with no consensus, for discussion to continue on the third. Finally, if I were trying to ignore prior results it's pretty unlikely that I would've talked about the previous results extensively in this nomination, don't you think?

Other similar evidence would be good to add: in other words, I'd like to see just a little more text, supported by citations where possible, talking about the significance of the list in the eyes of fans (and the networks too, presumably). With that, "keep" seems the right answer: deleting the article would lose information that's clearly encyclopaedic (in the sense that it's the sort of thing one would go to an encyclopaedia to find out) and which is notable in that it's been the subject of at least one media report, and more are likely to be found. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 11:58, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<b>Reply</b> Memory Alpha has a policy unless the information is 101% form the show or a licensed publication they do not list it on there site. Since most of the items listed on this page are fan produced (and not sanctioned by the show) this page will not work on there site. So this is the death of this information.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I'd like to make a few points about what you just said. First, even if we accept your basic premise, the thing is, the article isn't about all that stuff. It's not about the tenets of universal acceptance or the Utopian future of Star Trek or the paradigm of the future, it's a list of blueprints of the ships. Not even the blueprints themselves, just a list of blueprints that were made. Some fine information for sure but whether it should be here is another question entirely. Second, that last sentence is pure BS. It equates to "If this is deleted, then Wikipedia must be anti-intellectual." This with reference to an article that's nothing but a list of obscure art pieces done in connection with the show - and not even as part of the show's production, just as fan candy. More than a bit of a stretch, and an almost comically exaggerated "all or nothing" kind of argument. I think the list should find a new home. There's plenty of free web hosting out there in the world. <a href="../../../z/a/k/User%7EZaku_kai_3334.html" title="User:Zaku kai">Zaku kai</a> 05:45, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Would a image of each cover (thumbnail) be enough to show that the object do exist. If you are not allowing self published items (which often don't have a publisher) then you are not allowing non-canon, since most non-canon do not have an official publisher. If needed I can provide a link to a pages or ebay listing for 80% of the items on the list. I did not list this since I did not want this to be a shopping list and I did not use this as my basis for the existance of an blueprint. The purpose of this page is to allow the collectors to know what has been published. If you want me to I will provide a list of the lookup sites for people to look at if it will help, I would prefer not to have it on the wiki page since I feel that this would be a <a href="../../../c/o/i/COI_4bd0.html" title="COI">COI</a> since I am one of the self-publishers on this list.Jackillsfrm 18:39, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again these are not unpublished documents they are self-published documents that many do not list a publisher, it does not mean that it does not have a publisher, and many of these items can be looked up on the web, I will provide a list for many of them I just don't want it posted on the page in question since it would turn that page into a shopping list, which I think is bad. When you say reliable sources who defines what is a reliable source, the fact that many of these things are referenced on the web and also for sell on the web shows that they exist what is not reliable about that. I have never tried to coment on the content of each item just the fact that they exist. I would think that the fact that a number of them are for sell on ebay would prove the fact that they exist. If I was to quote something out of them I could understand the importance of what they say are factual, the fact that they exist is all the list states which can be proven for at least 80% of the list.Jackillsfrm 19:44, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"<i>When you say reliable sources who defines what is a reliable source</i>"? Good question. <b>Can someone else please help me answer this question?</b> Obvious examples of a good source would be like the Washington Post, or CNN.com, or something like that. However, there's a huge grey area and policy is clear when it comes to allowing questionable sources for claims that are not exceptional.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Your implied all-or-nothing argument is flawed. Let's supposed that article X does, in fact, dilute and/or damage this site in a way that goes against the site's true mission. Now, this list of blueprints doesn't damage or dilute the site more than article X. Is the proper decision then, to A: keep the list, because it's no worse than article A exists? B: delete both articles? If you chose A, then what happens when someone AfD's article X, and then the same argument is used, citing this article as an example of why it shouldn't be deleted?

<p><b>Comment:</b> Zaku kai, Stop attempting to label everyone you don't agree with as making "implied all or nothing arguments." You cannot argue with the person's points, so you attempt to label them and turn what they are saying into some convoluted straw-man argument that only you are making.</p>
<p>Respond to specific points - don't waste everyone's time in the transparent exercise of trying to turn someone's argument into something it is not and then explaining why your own contrived arguments are wrong.</p>
<p>Desist from putting words into people's mouths and "explaining" what they are "really saying" in their "implied arguments." Stop telling us why "what they really mean to argue" is wrong. Stop twisting their words and then trying to prove why your own twisted arguments are wrong.</p>
<p>You cannot argue with the person's points, so you attempt to label them and turn what they are saying into some convoluted straw-man argument that only you are making.</p>

<b>Comment:</b> I did provide a list of sites that showed that these blueprints did exist, they were not listed as reference since they were not used in creating the list. Also part of my concern was that if I posted this list on the page it would make the page a shopping list which is not the intent. I can prove that the majority of the objects exist but putting that on the page dilutes the fact that the page is for reference and not shopping.<br />
This is what I originally provided on the Discussion page of the List of Star Trek Blueprints<br />
<i>Here is a few web pages that I found using "Star Trek" blueprints on google in about 15 minutes that I thought might help, I did not list these in the reference section since I did not use them to create the database. After that all I can think to do is send you a set of pictures that show the large pile of blueprints that I have. I eventually want to scan the covers of all of the blueprints and add them to the list, but this will take a little</i> time<br />

The problem with putting this information on the List of Star Trek Blueprints page is that it would turn it into a shopping list. So as you can see with just this quick search that the blueprints do exist at multiple sites.

<p><b>Lets look at the original reason listed for deletion:</b><br />
"Violates No Original research; plus violates Wikipedia is not for indiscriminate lists of stuff;"<br />
<br /></p>
<dl>
<dt>Indiscriminate List Rebuttal - List of Star Trek Blueprints</dt>
</dl>
<p>Lets look at "Wikipedia is not for indiscriminate lists of stuff" since this is the easiest to disprove.<br />
First if you look at the Term <b>Indiscriminate</b> here is the defintion from www.dictionary.com:<br />
in·dis·crim·i·nate<br />
1. not discriminating; lacking in care, judgment, selectivity, etc.: indiscriminate in one's friendships.<br />
2. not discriminate; haphazard; thoughtless: indiscriminate slaughter.<br />
3. not kept apart or divided; thrown together; jumbled: an indiscriminate combination of colors and styles.<br />
<b>So this argument does not work for this list since it is not lacking in care, or just thrown together or jumbled.</b><br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Now lets look at the page that "Wikipedia is not for indiscriminate lists of stuff" here is the exerpt from the page:</b><br />

<p>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not automatically mean it is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia. While there is a continuing debate about the encyclopedic merits of several <i>classes</i> of entries, current consensus is that Wikipedia articles are not simply:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Lists of <a href="../../../f/a/q/FAQ_1fe9.html" title="FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</b> Wikipedia articles should not list FAQs. Instead, format the information provided as neutral prose within the appropriate article(s).<br />
<b>------Its not a list of FAQ</b></li>
<li><b>Travel guides.</b> An article on <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> should mention landmarks such as the <a href="../../../e/i/f/Eiffel_Tower_5c34.html" title="Eiffel Tower">Eiffel Tower</a> and the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louvre.html" title="Louvre">Louvre</a>, but not the telephone number or street address of your favorite hotel or the price of a <i>café au lait</i> on the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es_373d.html" title="Champs-Élysées">Champs-Élysées</a>. Such details are, however, very welcome at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitravel.html" title="Wikitravel">Wikitravel</a>, but note that due to license incompatibility you cannot copy content wholesale unless you are the copyright holder.<br />
<b>------Its not a travel guide</b></li>
<li><b>Memorials.</b> Wikipedia is not the place to honor departed friends and relatives. Subjects of encyclopedia articles must be <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">notable</a> besides being fondly remembered.<br />
<b>----Its not to honour a friend</b></li>
<li><b>Instruction manuals.</b> While Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instructions or advice (<a href="../../../l/e/g/Wikipedia%7ELegal_disclaimer_595c.html" title="Wikipedia:Legal disclaimer">legal</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMedical_disclaimer_7dd2.html" title="Wikipedia:Medical disclaimer">medical</a>, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes. Note that this does not apply to the Wikipedia: namespace, where "how-to"s relevant to editing Wikipedia itself are appropriate, such as <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_draw_a_diagram_with_Dia_4471.html" title="Wikipedia:How to draw a diagram with Dia">Wikipedia:How to draw a diagram with Dia</a>. If you're interested in a how-to style manual, you may want to look at our sister project <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikibooks.html" title="Wikibooks">Wikibooks</a>.<br />
<b>----Its not an instruction manual</b></li>
<li><b>Internet guides.</b> Wikipedia articles should not exist <b>only</b> to describe the nature, appearance or services a website offers, but should describe the site in an <i>encyclopedic manner</i>, offering detail on a website's achievements, impact or historical significance, which can be significantly more up-to-date than most reference sources since we can incorporate new developments and facts as they are made known. See <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">current events</a> for examples.<br />
<b>----Its not an Internet Guide</b></li>
<li><b>Textbooks and annotated texts.</b> Wikipedia is an encyclopedic reference, not a textbook. The purpose of Wikipedia is to present facts, not to teach a subject matter. It is not appropriate to create or edit articles which read as textbooks, with leading questions and step-by-step problem solutions as examples. These belong on our sister projects <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikibooks.html" title="Wikibooks">Wikibooks</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikisource.html" title="Wikisource">Wikisource</a><br />
<b>----Its not a text book</b></li>
<li><b>Plot summaries.</b> Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger topic.<br />
<b>----Its not a plot summary</b></li>
<li><b>Lyrics databases.</b> Most song lyrics are protected by copyright. Exceptions include traditional songs whose lyrics are in the public domain. However, even in this case the article may not consist solely of the lyrics, but has to primarily contain information about authorship, date of publication, social impact, etc. Source text generally belongs on <a href="../../../w/i/k/WikiSource_a60a.html" title="WikiSource">WikiSource</a>.<br />
<b>----Its not a Lyrics database</b><br /></li>
</ol>
<p>From what I have seen for the claim of <b>Indiscriminate list</b> does not hold based on what is on this page and the definition of <b>Indiscriminate</b>.A list of the works of Shakespeare is not an Indiscriminate list, an indiscrinimate list would be a list of things, no order no relevance to each other each, chosen at random to be in the list<br />

<p>Wikipedia is not a place to publish <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">your own thoughts and analyses</a> or to publish new information not heretofore published. Please <b>do not use Wikipedia for any of the following</b>:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Primary (original) research</b> such as proposing theories and solutions, original ideas, defining terms, coining new words, etc. If you have done primary research on a topic, publish your results in other venues such as <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer-reviewed.html" title="Peer-reviewed">peer-reviewed</a> journals, other printed forms, or respected online sites, and Wikipedia will report about your work once it becomes part of accepted knowledge. Not all information added to Wikipedia has to be from peer-reviewed journals, but please strive to make sure that information is reliable and verifiable. For example, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">citing</a> book, print, or reliable web resources demonstrates that the material is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a> and is not merely the editor's <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">opinion</a>.<br /></li>
</ol>
<p><b>----This is not Proposing Theroies and solutions</b><br />
<b>----This is not an original idea</b><br />
<b>----This does not define terms</b><br />
<b>----This does not coin new words</b><br />
<b>----The only Semi-Valid part here is -</b> <i>Not all information added to Wikipedia has to be from peer-reviewed journals, but please strive to make sure that information is reliable and verifiable.</i> I have already added a Reference list and a number of links that prove that these exist. As the quote states "<i>please strive to make sure that information is reliable and verifiable</i>" which I have done by stating where the documents can be looked up at. It also states that "<i>Not all information added to Wikipedia has to be from peer-reviewed journals</i>" which allows reference from sites that show the objects exist. The main reason that I did not put it on the main page is I did not want this reference material to become a shopping list. I address Validity on the third section of this rebuttal<br /></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Original inventions.</b> If you invent the word <i><a href="../../../f/r/i/Frindle.html" title="Frindle">frindle</a></i> or a new type of dance move, it is not article material until a secondary source reports on it. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_for_things_made_up_in_school_one_day_29ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day">Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day</a>!<b><br />
----Its not an Invention</b><br /></li>
<li><b>Personal essays</b> that state your particular feelings about a topic (rather than the consensus of experts). Wikipedia is supposed to compile human knowledge. It is not a vehicle to make personal opinions become part of human knowledge. In the unusual situation where the opinions of a single individual are important enough to discuss, it is preferable to let other people write about them. Personal essays on topics relating to Wikipedia are welcome in your user namespace or on the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="meta:">Meta-wiki</a>. There is a Wikipedia <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fork_%28software%29.html" title="Fork (software)">fork</a> at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a> that encourages personal opinions in articles.<br />
<b>----Its not an personal essay</b></li>
<li><b>Opinions on <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">current affairs</a></b> is a particular case of the previous item. Although current affairs may stir passions and tempt people to "climb <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soapbox.html" title="Soapbox">soapboxes</a>" (i.e. passionately advocate their pet point of view), Wikipedia is not the medium for this. Articles must be balanced so as to put entries for <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">current affairs</a> in a reasonable perspective. Furthermore, Wikipedia authors should strive to write articles that will not quickly become obsolete.<br />
<b>----Its not an opinion</b></li>
<li><b>Discussion forums</b>. Please try to stay on the task of creating an encyclopedia. You can chat with folks about Wikipedia-related topics on their user talk pages, and should resolve problems with articles on the relevant <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_a6d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Talk page">talk pages</a>, but please do not take discussion into articles. There are a number of early-stage projects that attempt to use a wiki for discussion and debate.<br />
<b>----Its not a discussion forum</b></li>
<li><b>News reports.</b> Wikipedia should not offer first-hand news reports on breaking stories. Wikipedia is not a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a>. However, our sister project <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinews.html" title="Wikinews">Wikinews</a> does exactly that, and <i>is</i> intended to be a primary source. Wikipedia does have many <i>encyclopedia articles</i> on topics of historical significance that are currently in the news, and can be updated with recent <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> information.<br />
<b>----Its not a news report</b><br />
<br />
So this does not conflict with Original research statements except for the "Verifiability", but only to a point as discussed below.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>Actual Issue with this document is "Verifiability" - List of Star Trek Blueprints</dt>
</dl>
<p>The only thing that has anything to do with this document is the Verifiability which was not the original claim for deletion. I can add links that show the majority of these Item exist, the only problem is that it would make this a shopping list which is not a good Idea and would not match what Wiki is for. So the problem is having verifiability on the page itself, not that they can not be verified<br />

<dd><b>Comment</b> I agree that the article <i>looks</i> good and is fairly well written. However, my concern is because of the lack of third party sources and the very low G-hits for the company and the principle participants. It seemed to me that promotional materials often look good but lack depth or substantiating sources. If I had found enough info/sources to cut it back to a stub, I wouldn't have put it up for AfD.

<li><b>Delete</b>, well-written isn't a reason for inclusion by itself. There are no third party sources in the article, and with a casual googling there aren't even mentions of it outside of directory listings and wikipedia mirrors. It seems no one else besides the founders of this 'record label' has ever heard of it, which isn't that surprising, considering the only thing they claim to have done is released mixtapes on the Internet. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 07:03, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

This appears to be a spillover from that page, though I thought that the dispute was over. TedFrank has repeatedly added the "notoriety" and "citation" tag to the page, and I attempted to fix the problem (to his liking) to no avail. If there are problems which need to be addressed, please explain more clearly how I can do so (i.e. notoriety) instead of simply trying to get the article deleted. I have found the band's CDs for sale at various stores near my residence, so the band seems notable, though I don't know what I can cite or write on the page to accredit the band as notable. TedFrank has also attempted to remove an addition to the "Racism" article I made and described it as "vandalism." <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDean_Sayers_6f83.html" title="User:Dean Sayers">Dean Sayers</a> 15:39, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is clearly a personal attack, and that was all I was attempting to point out. in other words, the article is only being targetted because you dislike me, not because you actually have a concern for quality.

<li><b>Comment</b> The band meets the following criteria:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country</li>
<li>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable). (Thorp Records)</li>
<li>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.(Blood For Blood)</li>
<li>Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or of the local scene of a city; note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability.(Boston Hardcore scene)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> May as well delete it then. Since my mom just died yesterday, I've been fairly fucked in the head, and I doubt I'll even want to deal with the pressure and antagonism here. I tried making amends with TedFrank, and the fact that he has been cynical to the point of attempting to get rid of the one page I cared for (as seen on my userpage) actually really got to me.

Ramallah has next to no mention in the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_hardcore.html" title="Boston hardcore">Boston hardcore</a> article, except in a bulleted list of about 80 bands. The Ramallah article says they cancelled their international tour (and I question whether such a tour would satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>). Every one of Sayers' claims flunks scrutiny.

<li><b>Delete</b> Waaayyy too POV, and frankly mostly false: I've never seen any of those bands listed refer to themselves as "goth", or aspire to such a vaguely defined label.

<li><b>Comment</b> Note similar POV concerns at another article by the same editor: Pop goth. This contains way too much "some would say" and "may have influenced", and of course the opinion of the "elder goths" on younger adherents to the subculture.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I agree that a lack of English language references in itself is not an argument for deletion. However, if the lack is because there exist no English references, I feel it does say something about being notable. An English language Google search yields 101 hits, most of which turn out to be Dutch language after all, the rest from blogs and other all but primary sources. As far as internationalism is concerned, there is exactly one non-Belgian reference (from the Netherlands), which focuses on Mrs. Guidone's Dutch ancestry. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Mks_5bbf.html" title="User:Nick Mks">Nick Mks</a> 12:04, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Enwiki is an encyclopedia <i>in English</i>, not an encyclopedia of England, America, Canada, and Australia, and "Lack of English references" is not a sign of anything; I see multiple instances of non-trivial coverage (judging by the fact that the subject's name appears in the article in the lead paragraph) in reliable sources (judging by the fact that the source in question, <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Standaard_156e.html" title="De Standaard">De Standaard</a>, itself has a Wikipedia article) from multiple countries. <strike>Please do a bit of research before taking stuff straight to AfD --- why not ask a speaker of the language in question to read the articles???</strike> Never mind, I see you are a speaker of the language in question.

<dd>This magazine has been around for six years, and is the only magazine of its kind on this subject, attracting the best researchers and authors in the area of Templar history. That alone makes it notable. I strongly disagree with your request to delete it.<br /></dd>
<dd>The WP entry was not written by the publisher, although I have contributed articles to his magazines. If that disqualifies me from putting a listing up about them, so be it. But if that is so, trawling through the listings of Canadian and American Magazines reveals far less notable publications, if housecleaning is really all you're up to. I would argue that EVERY WP article about magazines are little more than advertising. However, an argument can be made that as WP grows as a reference source, such listings are indispensable for writers looking a home for their articles. The webpage this listing links to is a gateway site to more than 100 past articles from the magazine under history, speculation, modern Templars and book reviews. So what's the objection? And I do contend that the Templar History website providing its past articles is a great research resource for WP readers looking for research on the Knights Templar, and not just a mere shill for pimping the magazine subscription. If an offer to subscribe is the barometer of unsuitability for WP, same argument can be made for any magazine's website. So if you have a personal gripe about it, I call a foul.<br />

I would strongly suggest rewriting it as an article on the site, with a link to the magazine, but I want to see what else there is on the subject, since your claim to N is that it is the <i>only</i> magazine.

<dd>No, I only brought up the website for the magazine here because MS_Japan had expressed a complaint elsewhere that the mag's website only sold subscriptions, which is not true. Sure, it's got commerce on it, but so does every other magazine's website. No, I don't think the article should be about the website, I think it needs to remain about the magazine. I don't see a list of authors on the mag's site - might be buried elsewhere on the site. I'll look around.Frumious Bander 09:25, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is an article about a non-notable group that also violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an ad service. It is claimed as a think-tank with numerous papers published, but only one is known. The anon who removed the prod seems to think WP (rather than at the end of their "numerous papers") is where to tell readers about KOTN. As the same author created <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masonic_Magazine_0810.html" title="Masonic Magazine">Masonic Magazine</a> (also nn) where KOTN publishes, there is a likely COI here as well, as MM is a self-published magazine. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 18:16, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>KOTN has, in fact, published almost 30 papers, not one. As the author of the WP article, I am NOT the publisher of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masonic_Magazine_0810.html" title="Masonic Magazine">Masonic Magazine</a>, although I have contributed to it, and I have put these entries on WP without the permission, guidance or knowledge of Stephen Dafoe. Also, in spite of your comments above, masonic magazine is not a self-published magazine of the KOTN. Dafoe started it under a different title at least five years ago, long before the KOTN was formed. He had no association with the group until a year ago.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With the paper Laudable Pursuit rapidly circulating in Masonic circles and being used as Masonic education in lodges across the US and Canada, more Grand Lodges are looking to the paper for legislation (Iowa, Indiana, Minnesota, Nebraska and Wisconsin have all implemented concepts directly out of Laudable Pursuit in 2006-2007). The writings of this group individually and collectively certainly meet Wikipedia's notability requirements. Because the KOTN issue papers as a group, it is important that regular, recognized Masons know they are dealing with regular, recognized Masons. In addition, as a group of published authors in widely circulated Masonic magazines and books published by mainstream (non-Masonic) publishers, the KOTN collectively are notable for that reason alone for their membership and leadership. You might argue that they should not be categorized as a Masonic Organization on Wikipedia, but the listing should remain to inform readers of their papers just who and what they are (and are not).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The KOTN has actually done a lousy job of promoting themselves, but LP has done a pretty good job of making its way around the country on its own steam without their self-promotion. While the initial group was less than 10 members, there are at least 28 at this point, and the overarching group's name has always been used as a shorthand way of referring to them, and not as a way to hide. Members have readily identified themselves for years. Your comment on the KOTN discussion page that they are "unaware that their ideas don't work for everyone" screams to me that you have a personal bone to pick with them, not a reasonable reason for removing the article. You may not like or agree with their opinions, but that's no reason to remove this listing. Grand Lodges, Grand Encampments, the Cato Institute, Proctor and Gamble and the Democratic Party are "unaware that their ideas don't work for everyone" too. That's a specious contention.<br /></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I put up the article because there is a natural reaction on the part of people who come across the paper to want to know if they are dealing with regular, recognized Masons, or with some bogus bunch of "we'll make our own Grand Lodge" upstarts (i.e. the UGLA). I am well aware that Wikipedia is not a Masonic encyclopedia, but part of it's mission is to provide up to date, topical information. The KOTN has nothing it is "selling," but its articles and authors are influencing Grand Lodges and individual lodges in the US and Canada. Now, if you think the article is one sided, or that it needs to identify the known members to lend it credibility, that's fine, I'll go digging for them. I was avoiding that, partially, for privacy issues, and partially because it would look like ego stroking for them to mention them by name. In a report like "It's About Time" from the Masonic Service Association last year, the MSA was the author, and no one tried to make sure they listed the individuals on the committee every time it was discussed. They are listed if anyone wanted to really find out, but MSA issued it as an organization.<br /></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Again, one paper does not make the KOTN notable, but as a group they seem to be making a sudden splash in the Masonic world, and Masons who fret about their sources being regular and recognized get very concerned about knowing who they are and where they came from. I simply thought Wikipedia was a good place to inform them of that. The KOTN has nothing to sell, and is not open to solicited members. It is by invitation only, charges no fees, has no elections, and gives its papers away for free. I am unsure what tangible benefit this article brings to them, apart from clearing up questions that are asked by Masons about their origin and regularity. Frumious Bander 04:04, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If Masons fret about regularity, why do the KOTN <i>not</i> say who they are in their own works? Wikipedia is not appropriate for "clearing up questions"; it is for encyclopedic material <i>that can be found elsewhere</i>. I don't think it's an accident that Hodapp (a KOTN from Indiana) can get LP used as a basis for use in his own jurisdiction. I would think that many of the other KOTN mebers pushed their work in their own jurisdictions - that's false notability. It's used in those jurisdictions because members of those jurisdictions <i>wrote</i> it. I'm also not convinced this isn't self-marketing; when there's no names attributed, and someone goes "hey look at this" on an ML, how do wwe know they didn't write it? I also don't think 5 jurisdictions in the Mid-Atlantic qualify as "a big splash", out of 50. Lastly, considering you want this article to "clear up questions" that apparently aren't answered anywhere else, it violates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> as well. Did you even read the relevant WP policies before you made any of your articles? If you did, you might see why I nominated this for AfD, and it's not personal at all; WP has very specific guidelines for articles, and this one does not meet them. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 14:47, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>LOL! Indiana's the one place they really seem to dislike these guys! I dunno, having a measurable influence on 10% of US Grand Lodges in two years sounds pretty good to me, but I guess you're the judge. To my knowledge, they don't have members in those states listed above outside of Indiana, but I'll see. To my knowledge, apart from the original paper LP, they've been signing their work and identifying themselves ever since. Again, I'd be happy to put the names I know up on the WP article - I didn't before because I figured that was violating WP guidelines for notability. Yes, I've read the guidelines, but as I look across WP, they seem to be applied with great variation, and what I see doesn't always jibe with what the guidelines say. So I am confused. I'm not part of their group, but I put the article up because they seem to be notable by my reading of the rules around here. You seem to disagree. I'm not fighting you on it. You want to dump all of the articles, feel free. I have no real dog in this fight, apart from trying to be informative about some folks who seem to be having some positive influence in the Masonic world.Frumious Bander 18:58, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have to chime in as one who stumbled onto this article through a link. Frumious Bander above has made the points I would make, but might I add that there seems to be a considerable amount of disagreement within the Masonic world about where Masonry should be heading in the future. The KOTN are clear in where they think it should go, from a review of their material, and they are therefore attacked on spurious questions of notability by those who do seem to have a dog in the fight. Yesterday, several friends were speaking about the Algonquin Round Table, which is clearly notable. It is much like the KOTN in that there is a lot of talk and not a lot of structure, and would have been questioned as to notability in its day by those outside the circle, who looked on with dislike or, most likely, envy that they were not invited to join in. Wikipedia gives those disposessed medicrities an opportunity to spitefully make claims as to notability, and to push organizations such as the KOTN, which have nothing to sell and are gaining nothing from such a listing, out of the limelight in the small ways open to them. I would note also that MSJapan was a key in deleting an earlier article on the KOTN in September 2006, and "traditionalized" several other Masonic entries.68.148.178.158 05:43, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>KEEP</b> To coin a Reagan-ism, "Well, there you go again." The members <i>do</i> readily identify themselves, beyond the initial internet presentation of their first paper. Its continued circulation in its original form has taken on something of a life of its own, so the anonymous nature of it lingers. But in other venues, such as Masonic Dictionary articles, no one is hiding there. And in my experience, I seem to see their open identification throughout various online forums. As for notability, I have to point to their being invited to speak around the country outside of their jurisdictions on the topics their papers address. As I said before, if the anonymity thing is your big beef, I'll dig up the members' names that I can, but I figured there'd be a storm of criticism over that as some kind of improper notability violation or shameless pimping for speaking gigs. You tell me. These guys aren't selling anything - hell, they don't even seem to be promoting their papers. Instead of just dumping the listing, you don't see a compromise on this? And if not, I can't help calling foul again. I can understand shutting off irregular, unrecognized and clearly agenda-driven destroyers like the bogus UGLA or RGLE that are masquerading as massive movements when they are nothing but three angry guys in the back of an Atlanta Starbucks. By contrast, the KOTN guys seem to be operating within regular, recognized Masonry, and attracting notice through little (or no) self-promotion. If your gripe is simply over their message, then I really question your clearly biased qualification in making a judgement for WP. Frumious Bander 04:54, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I concur. I wasn't sure about it when the article was created, and tried to edit because the person who created the article seemed to have some information about it, which he wasn't properly sourcing. However, when I tried to tell him about a few of the problems with the article, which were all caused simply by him not knowing how to make a good Wikipedia article, he stopped editing it entirely. So I agree that it's probably a hoax.

<p><b>Delete</b> - I am not finding any reliable sources which back up the assertions of notability. Lots of picture galleries and blogs but not much else.

<li><b>Delete</b> "Latino Entertainment TV" is a made up source. If you google it, the only items that come up are the three that Ms. Reece has put on the internet talking about herself. Nothing on her page can be substantiated. How can she name herself the site's #1 latina? Has myspace announced that? She claims on her myspace page that her song has 2.8 million plays. If you go to her music page, you can see that is far from the truth. She has had less than 50,000 plays. The 2.8 million number somes from a file that she has embedded in all of her bulletins on myspace. Anytime anyone opens up the posting (including herself), the number increases. --- Jessie620 11:47, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just because you can't find it on Google doesn't mean it's made up.

It appears the claim for "#1 Latina" is made based on the number of MySpace friends; I made a few searches for Latinas with more than 100000 friends, and it appears to be correct, with Christina Aguilera coming in second. -- <a href="../../../j/h/u/User%7EJHunterJ_08ee.html" title="User:JHunterJ">JHunterJ</a> 13:41, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Even if that is true (isn't it a bit odd the website is offline now), Somaya has put "articles" up on her website claiming to be from other journalists. None of these publications could be found and none of the writers are notable enough to be taken seriously. It could have been her neighbor writing it. The bottom line is Somaya notoriously self-promotes. It's what she does. Unfortunately, she uses made up sources to back up her false claims. In all honesty, outside of myspace, the general population does not know who she is. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jessie620 (<a href="../../../j/e/s/User_talk%7EJessie620_ba37.html" title="User talk:Jessie620">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jessie620_ef72.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jessie620">contribs</a>) 15:28, 26 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

I've never gotten a single email from IMDB asking me a question about anything I've ever uploaded. No oversight. I trust my experience more than I trust yours, and you <i>still</i> haven't answered my question regarding why playing "Harlot (uncredited)" and "Music viceo girl" confer notability when playing "Baseball player" and "Janitor" do not.

<p>I'm nominating this particular entry although I'm not so sure how the community will see this case. Mrs Johnson is a doctor who's had a troubled history of malpractice accusations. The article itself has decent, multiple sources whose reliability cannot be questioned. What I do question, however, is whether this really has any encyclopedic value: the article exists primarily to disparage its subject (although, of course, it's not like there seems to be much positive to be said about this doctor) and is transforming Wikipedia into a sort of watchdog. I'm not comfortable with Wikipedia being used in this way although I'm not aware that any of our policies really discusses the issue in a meaningful way. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 19:17, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> (as I'm undecided): there don't seem to be many news articles about Johnson outside of four WaPo articles, part of a series on similar cases, where she is used as an egregious example. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A44899-2005Apr11.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A44899-2005Apr11.html" rel="nofollow">[48]</a><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A42456-2005Apr10.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A42456-2005Apr10.html" rel="nofollow">[49]</a><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A44902-2005Apr11.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A44902-2005Apr11.html" rel="nofollow">[50]</a><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/14/AR2005071401844.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/14/AR2005071401844.html" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> I think this does suffice per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, but there's a problem with so many primary references being used and some of the language isn't as careful as it should be per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>.

<dd>Interesting comment. Indeed, by the criteria of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> she probably does satisfy the requirement of sourcing.

<li><b>weak keep</b> The article seems also a good deal unspecific about important facts--education, etc.. current state of things in Texas, and so on. It does not violate BLP, as it reports official actions. As for POV, I wonder a little what could be said on the other side? <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:14, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b>The article is extremely POV. I consider the one Washington Post article a reliable source, but I question some of the others. The "The Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy" is self described as an advocacy group for licensing of physical therapists, and so I question their meeting <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> with respect to their criticisms of a medical doctor. They are the source for blatant POV phrases such as "she lied." There is "Texas Watch," self described as "a non-partisan, advocacy organization working to improve consumer and insurance protections for Texas families" which also might not satisfy <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. There are citations to state licensing boards, which are primary sources, where I would prefer secondary sources such as the one newspaper article to explain, interpret and evaluate the sometimes cryptic actions of the licensing board. The article originally had a section on the general problem of which she was just allegedly an exemplar, of hospitals avoiding creating bad publicity about problem doctors and shuffling them off to another unsuspecting hospital or another state. An article on that problem would serve the public interest better than this attack article about one doctor. Is Wikipedia the right forum to present complaint articles about doctors, plumbers, and car mechanics, even if there is a single newspaper article and state licensing actions as sources? I favor deletion if no additional newspaper or similar sources can be found. Likewise, we do not need dozens of similar articles on the dozens of other doctors listed in the Washington Post series sourced only to that article and the licensing board actions. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:34, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library_of_Congress_f2f1.html" title="Library of Congress">Library of Congress</a> has a detailed cataloguing system, which it has revealed in full on its website, <a href="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/" class="external text" title="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Some editors have undertaken to copy all this information to Wikipedia, and are in the process of doing so.</p>
<p>My concern is that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. I'm okay with having library classification categories for each letter, but once we get into the numbers it's too specific for my taste. (Of course, nobody said I had to go look at it in the first place.) I am nominating <b>the entire class of similar articles</b> for discussion; there's nothing special about this one, but I wanted to see what others thought about it.</p>
<p>The following suggestions seem reasonable to me:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete all</b> articles on this level of specific classification (my preference).</li>
<li><b>Transwiki</b> them to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikisource.html" title="Wikisource">Wikisource</a>, which is "the free library".</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b> articles on library classification because they are sourced, notable, and useful.</li>
<li><b>Move this discussion</b> to an appropriate talk page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know what you all think. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 19:37, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Support</b> actions suggested by nom. The sample article provided is just data entry... if there was any encyclopedic context this would be a different case. Also, this information is duplicated by the Library of Congress, whose facilities would do a <i>far</i> better job of maintaining and updating this information. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 21:12, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep all</b> This and other articles like it are useful as an organizational structure. We have the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dewey_Decimal_classes_9ea7.html" title="List of Dewey Decimal classes">Dewey Decimal Classification</a> as a organizational article, and I don't see anyone rushing to expunge that.

<li><b>Transwiki</b> because this information really should be available but a list of information on the number is a reference work, not something that it would be reasonable to find in an encyclopedia. It's better to keep it than to remove it entirely but moving it to somewhere more appropriate would be best. —<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Mako_Hill_1ad0.html" title="User:Benjamin Mako Hill">mako</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenjamin_Mako_Hill_4287.html" title="User talk:Benjamin Mako Hill">talk</a>•<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Benjamin_Mako_Hill_ff07.html" title="Special:Contributions/Benjamin Mako Hill">contribs</a>) 04:45, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ol>
<li>Actually both the table here and the tables on the LC site are summary tables. The actual ones are a great deal longer and more complicated and not available on the web for free (and ditto for Dewey--the ones in the articles referred to are an even more concise summary ). The tables at this level of specificity do not change very much, the way the more exact ones do.
<ol>
<li>The full LC tables are not copyright, but they are very large--I will check the size and license status of the electronic version.&#160;; the full Dewey tables are copyright, and that copyright is vigorously enforced.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>To see how a similar problem was dealt with , see <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicode.html" title="Unicode">unicode</a> and its dependent pages and links/.</li>
<li>Any way will do, as long as we do it consistently and don't fuss with it letter by letter and let whatever is decided be. Disk space is cheap. Time spent in argument is not.</li>
<li>Personally, I'd keep them in WP space as information important to the construction of articles.</li>
<li>Otherwise here, organized as a category.
<ol>
<li>Wikisource is a place to put text, not a place to put code--I do not see anything remotely like this there</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>other ideas??</li>
<li>Unless by some chance we all reach a agreement right now, the only practical thing is keep on this AfD, and discuss it elsewhere.</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b> This is just another sad exercise in taking something from some database and compulsively stuffing it into Wikipedia, creating a stale copy of what would be better looked up at the source database. There should be a master article on the LC classification system, and a link to where the curious could find current classification information.

<li><b>Delete</b> all articles at the subclass level, per <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a>. I'd also suggest merging the class level into a single article; there's no searchability benefit from the current construction, and in fact there's a loss of readability. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 03:05, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Another article about a non-notable student comedy group.

The original article seemed to imply that Howell had only played for Barnet when they were a non-league team, however obviously actually playing for Southend &amp; Birmingham makes him notable.

<li><b>Definite keep</b> - Per allfootballers.com he actually played 57 times for Barnet in the Football League in 1991-92 &amp; 1992-93, as well as making 6 league appearances for Southend United (1993-94) and 2 for Birmingham City (1994-95).

<li><b>Weak keep</b> But only if there are references. There should be references and reviews of their products in technical magazines, and possibly articles about the business. Those who wrote the article will know better than I where to find them. I wish we could get contributors to actually realize the importance, especially when there is apparent COI. If they did that convincingly in the first place they wouldn't have to be concerned about the likelihood of having to defend the article here.

Also, the more local a newspaper's coverage, the more sources are needed. One article about the marketplace in the NYT or WSJ would be sufficient, but once you get down to <i>The Tennessean</i>, I'd expect 2-3 articles, with more substantial coverage than three short sentences in a 1500-word story.

<li><b>Comment</b> It's just possible this war might have happened, improbable as it sounds (compare the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_Jenkins%27_Ear_8bd5.html" title="War of Jenkins' Ear">War of Jenkins' Ear</a>). There certainly is a mock-heroic poem on the theme by <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tassoni.html" title="Tassoni">Tassoni</a>, <i>La secchia rapita</i> (usually translated <i>The Rape of the Bucket</i> because it influenced <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Pope_8096.html" title="Alexander Pope">Alexander Pope</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rape_of_the_Lock_b78a.html" title="The Rape of the Lock">The Rape of the Lock</a></i>). The article seems to have taken some information from this site offering Tassoni's tongue-in-cheek epic<a href="http://web.tiscalinet.it/millenaria/data/la_secch.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.tiscalinet.it/millenaria/data/la_secch.htm" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>. But "La guerra della secchia" itself only yields 8 Google hits, one of them a forum user asking whether it really existed (sadly there is no reply). Needs more research. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 08:06, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Suggested solution</b> It's hard to tell if this was real or just a popular legend. I suggest we create an article on <i>La secchia rapita</i> and <b>merge</b> this page there. There is already some information about the poem in the article on <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tassoni.html" title="Tassoni">Tassoni</a> (unfortunately none of it is referenced) so we could use that too. Any unsourced material about the war could be moved to the talk page until references are found. In fact, I had just gone ahead and created a page for <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_secchia_rapita.html" title="La secchia rapita">La secchia rapita</a>. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 11:07, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Unsourced game guide content that is both listcruft and fancruft. While sources could be found I suppose: that doesn't change the fact that it's a game guide. Mini-games are basically the levels of the Mario Party games: Wikipedia isn't the place for level guides or mini-game guides. This is much better suited for a gaming wiki, or a wiki made by fans: known as a fan wiki.</p>

<dd>I mean a one-paragraph summary of a couple sentences in length, saying something along these lines: "There are four basic categories of minigames: shooting games (7), fighting games (13), racing games (5), and matching games (9). The sliding block games from the first Mario Party were originally also included in the sequel, but were discontinued after they tested poorly in focus groups." (Note: That's not intended to be an accurate summary of the game; it's just an example of the sort of thing I'm talking about.) We don't need to know the name and level of every minigame, but a few general statements to place them within the context of the other Mario Party games (and video games as a whole) would be useful. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 13:15, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>AGAIN - being directly relevant to a game does not make it notable. It's been determined that if a plot is present in a game, that it should be described in either a short summary or a long summary.

<p>The reviewers are not looking in the right place to see where Dr. Jaffor Ullah had published his peer-reviewed articles. These could be found in NIH's PubMed database. One has to search using the name Abul H. J. Ullah. Dr. Ullah had written news analysis on Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Islamic Fundamentalism. These could be searched using Google, Yahoo, and other search engine. [user:Jaffor Ullah]</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Advice</b>:It is the job of the eds who wrote or who are supporting the article to find those articles, pick the 5 most recent or most highly cited, and put them into the article. As PubMed is freely available, you can do it. You can also go the the sites you mention and select a few particularly long or important non-technical articles and put in links to them. I am, frankly, tired of finding references for article eds. who can do it themselves. When it's WebofScience, then I don't mind, and others will help for the ones they can access.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is also the job of the ed. who wrote or is supporting the article to make sure that the alternate forms of the name have been added to the article. The place to put them is immediately after the first sentence. Write the article on the article page, not here. It is the article that has to show the notability, and then it will never be nominated for AfD in the first place.</dd>
<dd>Once the information is in the article, then people here can judge if he seems important, using the appropriate WP criteria for authors for the non technical papers, and scientific authors for the technical work. Assuming they do show that, I can help explain to people why the publication of an appropriately high number of science journal articles in major publications that are cited by secondary services is notability. PubMed (and WebofScience, etc.) are authoritative edited non-indiscriminate secondary sources including only material that has been peer-reviewed by two or more experts in the subject.</dd>
