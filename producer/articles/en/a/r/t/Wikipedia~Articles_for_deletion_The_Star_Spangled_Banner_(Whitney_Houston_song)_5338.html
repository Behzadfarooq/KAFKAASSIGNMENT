<li>On second thought, there are a lot of problems with this article and this one of many recordings of the song.

<li>That isn't a bad idea. Call it Notable recordings of The Star Spangled Banner .There, dicussions of all major versions of the song could be covered. Writng an article about just the Whitney Houston version seperately looks disarmingly POV. Whitney Houston could not <i>possibly</i> be the only artist to perform a highly notable version of the song. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 04:01, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. This article is actually pretty long for a single recording, and (perhaps surprisingly) most all of it is even relevant. If the article was a little blurb I could see merging it, but this has the heft that it should stand on its own.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 04:23, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Then edit it. An article's legnth should not make it inherently notable. I could write a 50k article on what items are inside my car and how it got there, in full prose and with footnotes, but that doesn't inherently make that article notable. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 04:28, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. [1] Wrong title. "The Star Spangled Banner" is <i>not</i> a "Whitney Houston song". It's a Whitney Houston recording. [2] the article claims it was for fundraising, and provides no details of any funds raised. [3] "blew the crowd away" is a bit hyperbolic for Wikipedia, no? [4] "her version is the most recognized vocal version of the song in the modern generation" is unprovable piffle. And what of Rosanne Barr's ageless rendition? Why have we no article on it? [5] "Houston had performend [sic] the song in front of nearly 100 million spectators and TV viewers at the Super Bowl" (she had actually lip-synched rather than performed.). [6] "the golden girl of the industry"? [7] "even more shocking the song could reach that high". If there's actually any important information in this "article", put it in Whitney Houston's article. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 04:46, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, this version of the Star Spangled Banner is a classic that has has a large cultural impact as it has been released twice during critical periods and its profits have gone to help those in need. It is still viewed as one of the best recordings of the U.S. anthem and one of the best recordings of Whitney Houston's career, so it is very notable. It was even officially released as a single and received airplay and sold very well, charting on many Billboard charts and even topping the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart for 6 weeks. --<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusicpvm_88b6.html" title="User:Musicpvm">Musicpvm</a> 03:26, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, that is definitely not all there is to say about. There is an entire article-worth of information to say about it as is evident when looking at the article, and I find all that information to be encyclopedic! There is no reason to delete all that information and merge this into another article and say a few lines about it when there is much more to say about it. This is currently a good, informative article. You should spend more of your time trying to expand Wikipedia articles rather than trying to get random articles with useful and encyclopedic information deleted. --<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusicpvm_88b6.html" title="User:Musicpvm">Musicpvm</a> 05:23, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just thought I'd point out that I've heard a handful of recordings of the Star-Spangled Banner, and Houston's is insipid and just plain terrible. And I consider myself a mild Whitney Houston fan -- this is certainly not one of the best recordings of her career! Everything else you said is a debatably acceptable reason to keep, but the quality of the recording is irrelevant as far as keeping or deleting the article.
