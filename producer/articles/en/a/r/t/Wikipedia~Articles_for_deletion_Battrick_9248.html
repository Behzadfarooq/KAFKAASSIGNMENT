<li><b>Comment</b>:Clear intention of WP:WEB is to provide a barrier against websites which can be trivially created such as vanity pages? That's your spin.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Saying that I'm attacking <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is a straw man, since that not what I've done at all. I'm not attacking <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> itself, I'm merely questioning your application of it. Notability is a contentious issue at best, and care should be taken to apply these guidelines only in cases where they are truly relevant. In the absence of a definitively applicable guideline, editors should handle these on a case-by-case basis.</li>

<dd>Saying that I should assert notability "for once" is also a straw man (and possibly a little underhanded), since I have indeed asserted notability in some of your other AfDs. It is true that I have not asserted notability in this particular instance , and it's for that very reason that I haven't actually registered a "keep" vote.</dd>

<dd>1. A vendetta against a particular category of articles? I'm just cleaning up the wiki. There appear to be tons articles about non notable web games and wikis. Of all those I have had to afd only a couple were contested so apparantely a majority of wikipedians thinks it's right for them to be deleted.</dd>
<dd>2. A discussion on the talkpages? I always clearly state my reasons for deletion in the prod or afd.</dd>
<dd>3. Alexa ratings? Alexa ratings and google hits are used by many editors as an indication whether the subject has some notability. If I don't add them, usually an other editor does. By the way, I just add them as additional information. My main argument for deletion is always that the game isn't covered by any reliable sources.</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> 7,000 players is enough for borderline notability. Onlien games are not the same thing as web sites, so <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> doesn't apply. It needs to source this, though. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 00:01, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, it seems to meet similar criteria as another game <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hattrick.html" title="Hattrick">Hattrick</a> which was voted to be kept <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hattrick_aa07.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hattrick">here</a> albeit this has a smaller userbase, but a community of 7000 would appear to give it a degree of notability. <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html" title="WP:Point">WP:Point</a> was cited in the previous example. <a href="../../../x/o/b/User%7EXobxela_8a26.html" title="User:Xobxela">Xobxela</a> 15:24, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Definite keep</b>. Games such as <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hattrick.html" title="Hattrick">Hattrick</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battrick.html" title="Battrick">Battrick</a> are pastimes like <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crosswords.html" title="Crosswords">crosswords</a> or <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudoku.html" title="Sudoku">sudoku</a>. They are tests of skill that require a great deal of application for players to be consistently successful. The fact they are web-based shouldn't make them worthy than pastimes that live only in newspapers. As was stated on the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hattrick_aa07.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hattrick">Hattrick deletion vote</a>, it has a community of over 800,000 players in over 100 countries. One point that wasn't mentioned was that the winner of the Polish Hattrick championship a year or so ago rated a mention on Polish TV news. It may have been a quirky end-of bulletin item but it surely was an indication of notability. Battrick is smaller, partly because the sport it is based on (<a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a>) is not as large worldwide as <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">soccer</a> and partly because the game itself has only been going a couple of years, compared to Hattrick's ten years or so. Nevertheless, the people who run Hattrick were sufficiently impressed with Battrick to adopt it and allow it to run from their own servers. (And yes, if you're wondering, I am a player of both Hattrick and Battrick.) <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrico_abba.html" title="User:Crico">Crico</a> 08:50, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
