Was then deprodded by 71.141.135.76 claiming that it met notability because of awards listed at <a href="http://www.art.net/about/awards.html" class="external free" title="http://www.art.net/about/awards.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.art.net/about/awards.html</a>. However, all of these awards date back to 1996, a time when the internet was in a much more infantile stage, and awards had much less significance.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> . art.net's page is worth keeping for at least two reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>1) It's history as one of the earliest art sites, one of the earliest cooperative sites on the Internet, and a site that has encouraged people who are not artists to produce art, and post it on the WWW.</p>
<p>2) More importantly, it's courageous participation with the ACLU in defending freedom of speech on the Internet. These are acts of public citizenship of the highest order and should be cited in wikipedia. As acts within and from the Internet community, they are one of the earliest examples of a web site doing so. These acts are similar to those of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the League for Programming Freedom, the GNU Project, the Free Software Foundation, among others.</p>
<p>Wikipedia promotes itself on each of it's pages. And explicitly asks for donations in TWO places on most pages. How is this different then what little self-promotion there is in this art.net page?</p>
<p>I suggest wikipedia err on the side of inclusivity, and delete pages rarely.</p>
<p>Who I am: I've been involved with the Internet and it's predecessors for four decades. I remember what the ARPAnet was like when it was less then 255 sites (and the transitions to larger address spaces). And many of the disputes that have occurred along the way. What mailing lists should be allowed. What USENET newsgroups should be allowed. Working with rabbit, chuq, et al in defining what USENET netiquette should be. Etc. Reviewing and improving RFCs who numbers had only three digits in them, and the 100th (3 digits&#160;;-) web site, and seeing both efforts grow. Etc.</p>
<p>BTW, I helped rms write the GNU Free Documentation License (which wikipedia uses) as well as the GPL, GLPL, etc. as a Director of the Free Software Foundation from it's start for a decade plus <a href="http://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull7.html#SEC5" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull7.html#SEC5" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull23.html#SEC5" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull23.html#SEC5" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I've supported art.net since it's earliest days. And am one of the creative software shapers it encouraged to also be an artist. As an Internet activist, I encouraged it's work with the ACLU.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Art.net represents all the good things that the Internet aspires to be – freedom, community, mutual support and most of all social entrepreneurship. Art.net is a NOT-for-profit entity, which helps artists show their work. As such, it is essential that Wikipedia, a new source of knowledge and cultural history, recognize the value of art communities like Art.net...Lile Elam, the founder of Art.net, is a recognized leader in the realm of civil rights, cyberspace and a social entrepreneurship. She has donated her time and energy to supporting ACLU struggles to protect freedom. She has turned her technical and creative acumen into an online gallery for artists around the world. Her story and the story of Art.net deserve to be documented. --Tamara Colby 00:42, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
