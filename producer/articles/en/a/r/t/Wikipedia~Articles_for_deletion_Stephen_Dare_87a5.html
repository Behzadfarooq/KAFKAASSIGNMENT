<p>Non-notable coffeehouse owner. The biography is trying to make the owner sound more important and have more impact than he really does. Also see articles Jimmy Nil Fishhawk, Ian Meares, and G. M. Palmer, which fail notability and should be deleted, in my opinion, along with the Stephen Dare page.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> It does rather <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Walter_Reuther" class="extiw" title="wikiquote:Walter_Reuther">quack</a> like vanity, but it also seems that Mr Dare <i>might</i> have some claim to notability. He has off-wiki news articles mentioning his role in the regeneration of Jacksonville and the theatre company he founded has a wiki article. I'd like to see the article cleaned up, wikified and with cited sources to establish the notability of Mr Dare - then I'd probably be happy to keep. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitepunk_094c.html" title="User:Politepunk">Politepunk</a> 09:45, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I currently live in Jacksonville and no one has ever claimed that he regenerated a city. I lived in Atlanta as well, but i wouldn't be able to comment authoritatively about anyone there either....point is the Jacksonville newspapers seems to think otherwise about the importance of his contribution. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.193.67.231 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.193.67.231_a892.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.193.67.231">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li>That would be true, but Jacksonville has five daily newspapers. The largest (the Times Union) lists 29 articles on Stephen Dare alone. None of those hits are included on the hundred or so google search hits. Also, the Times Union only includes articles written after '97, 10 years after his first article in that publication. (I looked it up) The second largest (The Jacksonville Business Journal) has 18 hits over the past three years, also not included in the gooogle search. The third largest, The Financial Daily Record has listed 10 articles either about or mentioning Dare over the past year. The Jacksonville Star, an African American daily newspaper has four articles about Mr. Dare.....the list goes on. I notice that the new links at the bottom of the page list Cincinatti as well. An assistant director at the theatre mentioned articles in the scrap book from Seattle, San Francisco, Atlanta and Indiana.---- which is even more widespread than the <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;client=pub-7607024300867888&amp;cof=FORID%3A1%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.pensacolanewsjournal.com%2Fgraphics%2Ffrontpage%2Fmasthead2.gif%3BLH%3A45%3BLW%3A339%3BGL%3A1%3BBGC%3AFFFFFF%3BT%3A%23000000%3BLC%3A%230000ff%3BVLC%3A%23663399%3BALC%3A%230000ff%3BGALT%3A%23008000%3BGFNT%3A%230000ff%3BGIMP%3A%230000ff%3BDIV%3A%23336699%3BLBGC%3AFFFFFF%3BAH%3Acenter%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.pensacolanewsjournal.com%3B&amp;domains=pensacolanewsjournal.com&amp;q=Mike+Halterman&amp;btnG=Search&amp;sitesearch=pensacolanewsjournal.com" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/custom?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;client=pub-7607024300867888&amp;cof=FORID%3A1%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.pensacolanewsjournal.com%2Fgraphics%2Ffrontpage%2Fmasthead2.gif%3BLH%3A45%3BLW%3A339%3BGL%3A1%3BBGC%3AFFFFFF%3BT%3A%23000000%3BLC%3A%230000ff%3BVLC%3A%23663399%3BALC%3A%230000ff%3BGALT%3A%23008000%3BGFNT%3A%230000ff%3BGIMP%3A%230000ff%3BDIV%3A%23336699%3BLBGC%3AFFFFFF%3BAH%3Acenter%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.pensacolanewsjournal.com%3B&amp;domains=pensacolanewsjournal.com&amp;q=Mike+Halterman&amp;btnG=Search&amp;sitesearch=pensacolanewsjournal.com" rel="nofollow">Pensacola News Journal</a>.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Stephen Dare has multiple pages of reference when doing a simple google search. He doesn't own a coffeehouse, nor is he a restaurantuer by trade, although he owns and directs a dinner theatre. When I called him to inquire about the other individuals, he was unsure what the entry was about, and had never heard of 'syncretism'. Mr. Dare's page has been serially vandalized by a group of individuals who have bragged about their vandalism on their myspace pages. reference: <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=887943" class="external free" title="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=887943" rel="nofollow">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=887943</a>. (scroll about midway down) When I asked about the individual, it turns out he was a disgruntled band promoter. I last updated his wiki article to flesh out his accomplishments, of which there are a number.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.193.67.231 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.193.67.231_a892.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.193.67.231">contribs</a>).</small></li>

FWIW, Dare did not create a page for himself. The current page is probably 90% pure cowpies and you have to go back to very early edits to find a version that even comes close to looking like a verifiable article. The alternatives are to stub the article back to an early edit, verify it, then babysit it; or delete it.

<dd>"Technically invalid AfD"? Oh dear god, the process wonks have won over again. You want a stupid little tag on each page? Fine, I'll go do that now. Of course, instead of moping about it, you could have done it yourself. We don't close AfDs for improper "filing" of a clerical nature, so don't be so picky. Don't bother opening whole new slanging matches for the things, just tag it and let this one run its course. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobchurch_99c1.html" title="User talk:Robchurch">Rob Church</a> 21:15, 15 March 2006 (UTC)
