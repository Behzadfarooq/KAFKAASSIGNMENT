<p>There appears to be a problem with updating the nomination page. Very often previous week's winner is still listed as the current project more than 24 hours after a new article should have been selected. Same problem also occurs with removing nominations with insufficient number of votes. Can anyone make these changes, or is it a job for the administrators? If anyone can make the updates, it could be a good idea to include a check list for things to be done somewhere. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChino_6b6b.html" title="User:Chino">Chino</a> 06:13, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>WP:AID split off months ago from WP:COTW, as WP:COTW was focused only on filling in major gaps in Wikipedia. Being that the English project has very few major topic stub/missing articles, it appears that WP:COTW has fulfilled its mission and made itself unneeded. Case in point - the dwindling of nominations and participants of WP:COTW. Finally, I have stepped up and volunteered to maintain WP:COTW for the past few months, but am heading-into a forced Wikibreak due to law School starting back up. It seems the time has come to congratulate COTW for a job well done and and send it off into the WP Archives, allowing the participants of COTW and AID join together in a single project once again. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavodd_2d13.html" title="User:Davodd">Davodd</a> 18:30, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I support that. I initially proposed that what ultimately became the AID be simply a modification of the COTW - that it would simply be a change in scope. But now, yes, I think a merger is in order. We could call it: <b>ARCAID</b> -the <b>Ar</b>ticle <b>C</b>reation <b>a</b>nd <b>I</b>mprovement <b>D</b>rive. How does that sound? We could just overhaul <i>everything</i>. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 18:43, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ammendment: if we want to keep both projects from collapsing, we need to do this <i>now</i>. COTW is very nearly dead, and the AID is in the middle of slow times... I think it's now or never. ARCAID (stop me if you think of a better name) can reuse most of the infrastructure (templates and userbase) from the AID... is there anything else we're missing? -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 19:02, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The merger between AID and COTW is largely complete. It's a sad testiment to the complexity of all this that the chief trouble comes not from meshing the ideologies of the two projects, but their templates.</p>
<p>I've reset most of the AID (and the even older IDRIVE) templates for the ARCAID. I haven't had time to tinker with the COTW stuff yet. Most of the old redirects need to be reset, and the page subpages from the Talk: pages need to be inlinked from here. I'll be back on this tomorrow. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 01:57, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Oh, and one more thing: there will be two articles this week - the endgame winners from the AID and the COTW. This is a quick fix; starting next week there will be only one article per week again. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 01:58, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Some of the templates still need to be brought in line. We're now working from three legacy sets of templates - the IDRIVE, AID and COTW versions - which need to be integrated or replaced.

<p>I had a thought (as shown in my nom for the DuMont Television Network): If applicable, why not add a small, unobtrusive picture next to each nomination, just as a little eye-catcher. My only thoughts contrary are 1) would this make things too cluttered, and, 2) is this a violation of Fair Use? -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 00:33, 18 August 2006 (UTC)h</p>

<p>Can an article that has been removed be renominated? Is there a set amount of time that it has to sit out? I feel like some issues get more exposure at certain times then others (Such as FLCL being the co-article this week, when it might not have made it 6 months from now), but that just because some issues don't get enough exposure to avoid the removal list, doesn't mean they shouldn't be reconsidered at a later date. -<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransNique_37aa.html" title="User:TransNique">TransNique</a> 01:52, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, in an attempt to help collaborate across COTW projects, I've made a template that displays the current picks of each.

He is a very new editor and clearly meant no harm, but this is a potentially disruptive precedent to set. My questions are as follows: first, is there a precedent for how to handle this nomination, and second, if not, then should we consider disqualification of the article? – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 01:16, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of all, I would hate to call it spamming. I think, as you said, he clearly means no harm, and the use of the word <i>spamming</i> could be considered uncivil. Second, I don't really have a problem with it, as long as the receiving editors don't have a problem with it. I think this situation occurred previously, and no action was taken then. Any votes resulting from his action should therefore be counted as normal votes, and the article certainly should not be disqualified. <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrabee_3545.html" title="User:Errabee">Errabee</a> 07:48, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's it I am sick and tired of dealing with these people on Wikipedia! I am withdrawing the nomination, so I hope your happy. Do you people have anything else to do?! I though Wikipedia was supposed to be a forum to further people's knowledge around the world. A free encyclopedia if you will. In my short time here on Wikipedia all I have run into is falsification on articles, false articles, biased information, righteous admins. clinging to this online bureaucracy. So why don't you guys stop messing around on this site and maybe make a valuable contribution to the world, like volunteer or something. Anyway I never am again going to contribute to this site.

<p>In May 2006, some uproar was caused by a mass solicitation for votes. A vote followed (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticle_Creation_and_Improvement_Drive_archive5_09b2.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Article Creation and Improvement Drive/archive5">here</a>), with the following proposal: <i>To disallow individuals from soliciting votes from other users interested in a page.</i> This proposal was rejected 7-9, not exactly a clear majority.</p>
<p>Recently, another mass solicitation led to another uproar with even suggestions of disqualifying the nomination. I hope nobody will object to this new vote so soon after the previous vote, but I feel this proposal is a consensus between the support votes and the oppose votes of May 2006, and has a better chance of reaching a decision supported by a large majority. <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrabee_3545.html" title="User:Errabee">Errabee</a> 10:03, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dt>Considerations</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The main goal of WP:ARCAID is to get editors interested in improving an article, preferably to FA status.</li>
<li>Mass solicitation for one article could lead to mass solicitation of other articles; this disruptive situation is to be prevented at all costs.</li>
<li>Mass solicitation could lead to irritation of the targeted editors.</li>
<li>Most articles are part of the terrain of one or more project and/or portals.</li>
<li>Solicitation via relevant portals and/or projects is an effective way of targeting potentially interested editors. It is probably more effective than random mass solicitation.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>New proposal</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Solicitation on individual user talk pages is not allowed</li>
<li>It is allowed to post an announcement on a relevant portal or project (in the appropriate place, like talk pages or announcements).</li>

<li>Well, we could try the slick little plan that got me in trouble. In order to raise support for <i><a href="../../../f/l/c/FLCL_1502.html" title="FLCL">FLCL</a></i>, I had to find all the <i>FLCL</i> fans.

<p>I think it would be a good idea to have two collaborations in the same week. This would be helpful because of the AID/COTW merge, and because we are now having 30 or more candidates at a time. Any objections? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_caterpillar_5cd0.html" title="User:Green caterpillar">Green caterpillar</a> 22:46, 31 August 2006 (UTC) I'm all for it.

<ul>
<li>This is a bad idea. You don't have to take my word for it - just look at the /History page. The AID was originally conceived under a very different rule system than the one it operates under now (I believe I may be the last active founding member here) and it was conceived under a two-a-week policy. This was later revoked. I championed its return, which lasted two weeks, and was frankly glad to see it leave after that. I repeat: <b>This is a bad idea.</b> It just splits the available number of people. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 16:44, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If you put it that way, it does make better sense to have one project. I withdraw my support for the idea.--<b><a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmaas120_f981.html" title="User:Amaas120"><font color="DodgerBlue">andrew</font></a></b> 17:00, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, back then, you would have two AID collabs and one COTW collaboration, therefore having 3 collaborations total in this area, and I agree that was too much. Later, there was only one AID collab and one COTW collab, making two, a good amount. However, because AID and COTW were merged, we only have one in this area. And I think that's too little. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_caterpillar_5cd0.html" title="User:Green caterpillar">Green caterpillar</a> 14:39, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason the two projects merged was because the AID was hobbling and the COTW was probably a week away from dead. The ideology of the COTW carried over, but by then they didn't have much of a work force to contribute. If you put two pies in two ovens, they'll cook. But when the element in one of the ovens burns out, you can't just throw that pie into the second oven and have enough heat to go around. And that's what you're proposing. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 15:29, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello there, in the voting instructions, it says to update the vote count in the subheader, and then to change some items in the "Nominated" line, including the deadline date and the number of votes needed by that deadline.</p>
<p>Is my understanding correct, or is there some missing text? If everyone who votes changes the paramaters of the deadline, won't that make it so that none of the articles are ever successfully voted on? It seems to me as if only the first person voting within a week should be changing the deadline parameters.</p>

<dd>Everyone should update the header of the section, so that this reflects the current amount of votes cast for that nomination.

<p>I'm very busy with university work at the moment and don't have much time to edit Wikipedia. I want the time I do have to be used well which means contributing to articles which the community have flagged up for improvement. I was just taking a look at the current article in the Article Creation and Improvement Drive (coffee) and am stuck for what to do without spending more time than I have planning the article out and comparing it to similar articles which have featured article status. Could I suggest we either encourage those who nominate an article to propose a plan for what needs to be done to take the article from its current state to featured articlehood, or get volunteers to collaborate on such a plan? If a specific road map were available telling me which pictures/diagrams need to be found/created, which sections need to be written and which improved, I could quickly and effectively get to work. I would bet that such roadmaps would, by giving the Drive aims and endpoints, allow us to produce many more FAs than we currently do. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">Oldak</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/User_talk%7EOldakQuill_6507.html" title="User talk:OldakQuill">Quill</a> 13:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I had a similar thought but from a different angle. I know that I personally have a hard time contributing to many articles when I don't have any references (the general articles are particularly difficult). But many of the articles that get chosen her really just need some really healthy peer review to create a To Do list with specific tasks which could be done to improve the article (e.g., move refs to the right side of all periods, reword the opening sentence, alphabetize See Also, get ISBNs, etc). A really great way to contribute to ACID would be to just read the article and list the improvements that COULD be made. Other ACID members can fix those tasks, or add to the list. When the collaboration moves on, at least the article's regular editors are left with some direction on where to go, and it splits the time suck that all of us have by needing to read through an entire article, put together a coherent plan of action, and then fix those problems. Could we get an ACID To Do list that gets placed on the Talk page of the chosen article which people can add to or cross off as we go?--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill.i.am_6529.html" title="User:Will.i.am">Will.i.am</a> 10:04, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, all. It was initially my hope to try to have this done as part of <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza">Esperanza's</a> proposal for an appreciation week to end on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_Day_df16.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Day">Wikipedia Day</a>, January 15. However, several people have once again proposed the entirety of Esperanza for deletion, so that might not work. It was the intention of the Appreciation Week proposal to set aside a given time when the various individuals who have made significant, valuable contributions to the encyclopedia would be recognized and honored. I believe that, with some effort, this could still be done. My proposal is to, with luck, try to organize the various WikiProjects and other entities of wikipedia to take part in a larger celebrartion of its contributors to take place in January, probably beginning January 15, 2007. I have created yet another new subpage for myself (a weakness of mine, I'm afraid) at <a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadbilltucker_Appreciation_Week_a49f.html" title="User talk:Badbilltucker/Appreciation Week">User talk:Badbilltucker/Appreciation Week</a> where I would greatly appreciate any indications from the members of this project as to whether and how they might be willing and/or able to assist in recognizing the contributions of our editors.

<dd>I beg your pardon? If you look at the history more closely, you'll see that I first updated the vote count to 36 (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Article_Creation_and_Improvement_Drive&amp;diff=101213375&amp;oldid=101212176" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Article_Creation_and_Improvement_Drive&amp;diff=101213375&amp;oldid=101212176" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). Then I saw the anonymous vote which had to be subtracted. Due to this invalid vote, it became overdue again, so I immediately removed it (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Article_Creation_and_Improvement_Drive&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=101213375" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Article_Creation_and_Improvement_Drive&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=101213375" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> with edit summary <i>-/- anonymous vote; overdue; removed</i>. What would you have me do? First remove the anonymous vote and update the vote count, then hit save, then edit again to remove the nomination? We have a guideline known as <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>, maybe you've heard of it? Now I don't care that the nomination is restored (although I don't think you had any right to do so), but you should definitely be more careful in your analysis, before you start accusing someone of undue process. <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrabee_3545.html" title="User:Errabee">Er</a><a href="../../../e/r/r/User_talk%7EErrabee_f6be.html" title="User talk:Errabee"><font color="orange">rab</font></a><a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrabee_3545.html" title="User:Errabee">ee</a> 14:52, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>BTW, further analysis showed that one vote was made by someone who didn't have any other edit than this vote; after removal of this vote, the vote count was back at 35, so I've removed it again as being overdue. <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrabee_3545.html" title="User:Errabee">Er</a><a href="../../../e/r/r/User_talk%7EErrabee_f6be.html" title="User talk:Errabee"><font color="orange">rab</font></a><a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrabee_3545.html" title="User:Errabee">ee</a> 15:24, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>A thought, this needs to be explained better. As I first found this section, I thought a number of people good at editing were seeking which sites to concentrate on. I promoted this on my user page to vote for what should be done. Any-one at generally any time can make changes, so it did not seem a requirement to be the actual person (or one of several making changes) At the level I have done this I contributed some comments on the voting page, and if I knew of such later on added at the page was voting on suggested changes, and even commented someplace one time that it is not said anywhere to be a requirement to be voted page of the week to make changes. I know a few people have been very good at editing a page to be more readable, I don't claim to be one of them, I make changes I find references for, don't work on any timetable other than spare time or when I think of something I saw and find it again while at the computer. *One problem on many pages is references, which tend to be hard to find something seen on TV or newspaper reading in the past when needed. Older pages are formated with only general references for the page, and how many reference links should there be, at times a whole section or reference could be cited for much of the subject across a whole subject.<a href="../../../k/i/d/User%7EKidsheaven_907f.html" title="User:Kidsheaven">Kidsheaven</a> 17:40, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Have update the script I'm using to grab the people who have voted, it will also find and report duplicates. Sadly it can't find non-linked votes (people only having their nick without a link to user page or user talk page):</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use File::Slurp;

my $data = read_file( 'spam_data' );

$data =~ s/^[^#].*//mg;
my ( @user_data ) = ( $data =~ /(?:^\s*#.*?)\[\[([Uu]ser(?:\stalk)?:.*?)(?:\||\]\])/mg ) ;

<p>Example output:</p>

We should improve articles that are viewed by many. The popularity of some of these articles is temporary, e.g. <a href="../../../z/o/d/Zodiac_Killer_9376.html" title="Zodiac Killer">Zodiac Killer</a> is #8 right now for obvious reasons - the recently released film <i><a href="../../../z/o/d/Zodiac_%28film%29.html" title="Zodiac (film)">Zodiac (film)</a></i>. So in this sense the toplist useful as a sign of the times, like Google Zeitgeist. Others are likely permanently important articles. For example, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">Wiki</a> is the #1 most-viewed article and isn't even a good article.
