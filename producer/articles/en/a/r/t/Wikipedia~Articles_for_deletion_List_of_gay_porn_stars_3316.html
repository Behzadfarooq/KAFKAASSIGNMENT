<p>According to "What Wikipedia is not," Wikipedia is not "lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as quotations, aphorisms, or persons," unless the entries are famous because they are associated with or significantly contributed to a topic. This list is just an indiscriminate listing of gay porn actors. The vast majority of them did very few films and do not meet this criteria, and better and more relevant lists are found elsewhere. Many of these stage names are not associated with gay porn and wouldn't be readily recognized, and most did not contribute anything significant to the industry. They do not meet the standard for fame set by Wikipedia, and most industry experts would agree.</p>
<p>Lastly, much of the information in the listing is incorrect and incomplete, specifically that information regarding the actors' real names. Having reported on that industry, I can tell you that many of the "real names" listed have no factual link to the actor and the information is obviously not verified. I will submit this article for verifyability, but considering that there are people in the world who coincidentally possess these incorrect real names, I thought I should mention it here as well. This article should be deleted, and if not, the information verified. 24.11.99.60 20:29, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Keep</b>, we certainly have more absurd lists, this is perfectly legitimate. Remove any ones that are non-notable. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> 20:35, July 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Note. Sorry about not logging in. I thought I was. The nomination for deletion above is mine. Poiboi25 20:39, 23 July 2005 (UTC) Poiboi25.</p>
<p>I looked at the history for this article. It looks as if it was started by just grabbing names off the internet. Some of the information apparently is only verified through Google. I started editing for non-notable names but there are just so many. There aren't nearly as many porn stars who had a real impact on the industry or are associated with it as are listed here. For comparison, Jenna Jameson would obviously have a place on a straight porn star list, but Random Porn Actress #5 does not. Many of these people are just random gay porn actors in that same vein. And again, from what I understand, Wikipedia isn't supposed to be lists of random people, but those who are notable. I think the article should be deleted. It's just a random list and it isn't a legitimate list of any thing but names. Poiboi25 22:10, 23 July 2005 (UTC) Poiboi25</p>

<dd>So let's blank the current article and start it over with notable gay porn stars. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> 23:59, July 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Alternatively, <b>Delete And Replace With Category</b> and let the category be named something that appropriately conveys the information "Gay Porn Star". Thus there's still a way people who want it can get a list of gay porn stars, but it's limited to ones important enough to get articles. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 06:41, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both ideas sound fair to me. Whether its blanking or deleting, I don't think the current list can be saved, though. Someone would have to cut it down, and there are just so many names thrown on. It would probably be easier to start over with new guidelines. I think its important that whatever replaces it stresses notability. I like the guideline that Wikipedia sets up: the name is strongly associated with the field itself, or the person contributed significantly to the field. With that guideline, it keeps the information relevant, I believe. Poiboi25 09:28, 24 July 2005 (UTC) PoiBoi25</p>

<p>In my opinion, this is a useful list. It can probably be amended, as time goes on. Rather than delete actors, I would add them as new films are produced.</p>

<p>Why is this not a section in 'List of porn stars'. I don't see a good reason that gay porn stars should be sequestered into their own separate place. There are good reasons to treat porn stars in a single, connected article/list, with daughter articles/lists of subcategories. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 12:08, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> "gay porn stars" - like it or not gay porn (and straight and bi-, etc.) is an important part of our ('Western'/US in particular) culture and has probably helped save many a life at the height of the AIDS crisis and has also been a way for men (and women) to explore their sexuality safely, especially in a society that amazingly still considers loving and/or being intimate with a member of the same sex as taboo.[User:RichM]</li>
