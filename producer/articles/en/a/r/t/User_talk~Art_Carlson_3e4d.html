Thanks for the honest perspective. I cannot make you (or any one else) "believe" in geo-centrism, but it clearly is as feasible as heliocentrism, discounting the notion of natural simplicity (i.e., God would likely have to have willed it for it to turn out this way). Does understanding that fact make you wonder sometimes? Truth_Seeker.</p>

I was wondering if you had any knowledge in Langmuir himself. I am currently working on reworking his page (my grandmother was his secretary and i have some of his journals and notes in my possession). 01:33, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I don't think I can help. I believe that there is considerable biographical information in "The Complete Works of ... ", but you must know that already. I am a plasma physicist specialized in Langmuir probes, so if there are entries in the journals and notes that you would like me to analyze or comment on from the technical side, I would be eager to do that. I live in Muinch but make occasional trips to the States.

<p>I am currently rewriting the article and i just wondered if you would like to help, (I am rewriting the article in word and either tonight or tomorrow night i will upload it to wikipedia), i was wondering if you would be willing to look through it for spelling or grammar errors after i upload to wikipedia thanks.

<p>I think Wikipedia could use a page on emmisive probes. I found the page on Langmuir probes very helpful. I don't know if you have the knowledge to start such an article, but perhaps you might know someone who could. Just an idea.</p>

<dd>Looking through [Talk:Homeopathy]], the only specific objections I can find from you are POV disputes.

<p>Off the top of my head:</p>
<ul>
<li>That homeopathy is best known for its use of chemically inactive ingredients</li>
<li>That Hahnemann's texts are the final word on homeopathy</li>
<li>That homeopaths explain potency of extremely diluted remedies as a "vital force"</li>
<li>That there is a scientific establishment that rejects the "theoretical foundations" for homeopathy</li>
<li>That the guy on quackwatch has any credibility</li>
<li>etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>I realize you and Geni have decided your grasp on science exceeds that of anybody who disagrees with you, but I have caught a) Geni making so many wrong assertions about statistics, rhetorical fallacies, and clinical trials that he has lost all credibility, and b) being polemic about the topic, that it's clear that this article is worthless for anyone who is interested in learning about the topic (as opposed to being indoctrinated on one perspective). --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 15:50, May 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The infobox removed had two versions - one added manually into the article, and the other, containing the same information and formatting, that could be added through use of a template. The template version was deleted, which means that manual versions of it are bad for comparable reasons (In this case, because of a consensus that it was not really an infobox at all). In this case, if you wanted to preserve the information, I'd suggest categories, or simply adding the relevent facts into the text of the article. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 13:48, Mar 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi again, Art. User:Occultations has just queried your addition of the "Configuration without a return path" section to the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Faraday_Paradox_9dc6.html" title="Faraday Paradox">Faraday Paradox</a> article, and I have to say I agree with him, although I'm an engineer and not a physicist. Could you give a reference to back up your information, please? (And it would be nice to know whether anybody has verified it experimentally.) You seem to be saying that either (1) the field is not uniform, so its rotation can have an effect on the disc, or (2) somehow the disc knows that the source of the field is rotating, even though the field itself is uniform. Which of these statements is true, or are they both wrong? --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a> 22:45, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Art, sorry for bothering you, but I wonder if you could help with a problem.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>There's currently a controversy at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_fusion.html" title="Cold fusion">Cold fusion</a> that I would appreciate it if you could look at. The article is about to fail a Featrued Article Removal Candidate <a href="../../../v/o/t/Vote.html" title="Vote">vote</a>. There are at least 3 fairly different versions in play: one based on the original Featured Article dating back to 2004-08-20 and tossing out all edits between now and then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cold_fusion&amp;oldid=33905552" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cold_fusion&amp;oldid=33905552" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> ("FA version"), one which was the current version up until that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cold_fusion&amp;oldid=33645188" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cold_fusion&amp;oldid=33645188" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> ("current version"), and a proposed new draft written originally by Edmund Storms (a retired Los Alamos scientist) and edited by me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cold_fusion/tmp&amp;oldid=33876153" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cold_fusion/tmp&amp;oldid=33876153" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> ("Storms version"). At the moment the article is being rather agressively edited by a few people who support the version from a year ago, and if this stands, a lot of good material will be lost. Frankly, I can't entirely support any of the versions; the article just needs more work and more different perspectives. Hence this invitation. I hope you can help.</p>
<p>I'm posting this to you because I've seen you on various physics-related pages, and/or because you've worked on the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_fusion.html" title="Cold fusion">Cold fusion</a> page before. Thank you for your time.</p>

<dd>Dear Joke, dear ObsidianOrder (hope you're both listening),</dd>

<dd>I looked through the three versions of the cold fusion article. I have criticims, but none are as bad as I feared. The problems can probably all be cleaned up. Examples of phasing that I consider POV:
<dl>
<dd>From 33645188 - current version:
<dl>
<dd>The autoradiograph shown here is a good example of what the skeptics demand: conclusive evidence other than excess heat. Only a nuclear reaction could produce the copious x-rays shown here.</dd>
<dd>We know that cold fusion is a nuclear effect because …</dd>
<dd>It is more likely that the current understand of physics is incomplete, because highly loaded metal deuterides have not been studied in detail before.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>From 33876153 - Storms version:
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, reactions initiated by the "cold fusion" process occur in a unique solid structure without significant energy being applied.</dd>
<dd>This is not the result of biased, true believers continuing to be deceived, but of trained scientists who trusted what they saw with their instruments after much skeptical evaluation. This approach is identical to how all new discoveries are treated by science.</dd>
<dd>Most disagreement over the validity of the results, that continue to the present day, ignores the fact that all of the demands by skeptics have been met.</dd>
<dd>At this time, it is safe to conclude that anomalous energy is produced regardless of its source.</dd>
<dd>Clearly, unusual nuclear processes are occurring in material where none should occur.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Although the order of my preference is FA, current, Storms, I don't see the problems as so massive that I need to cast a vote. If I had the time - which I unfortunately don't - I would enter the fray and comment and edit in more detail. I'll try to drop by from time to time anyway. Good luck. --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_Carlson_64f0.html" title="User:Art Carlson">Art Carlson</a> 16:55, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I found it quite high up Google earlier- but it seems to not be in pole position now (odd, but not unknown). Tend to agree it probably shouldn't be in Intro.

<dd>Okay, now that we have all agreed to do it on the Wiki, I have intiated the next step which is an intial statement to see where we all stand. Just state your point of view on the issues at hand without making references to others or the conduct of them. Just to let you know, I have been reading over the talk page and will address the concern of needing a person who understands plasma comology. I feel after reading it, I have a pretty good grasp of it as I am pretty good in science. However, the issues seem to extend beyond just simple right and wrong on the issue but rather into what should be included and where we should draw the line. I hope, as mediator, to rectify these differences and to reach a consensus. As a last note, I suggest you put the mediation page on your watchlist as I will not always give messages like this.

<dl>
<dd>That's not the parameter range where I have direct experience, but .... The voltage drop at 1000 A will depend both on the area involved and the distance between the electrodes. Unless you have a very large area, when you try to put 1000 A through a gas, you will generally get an <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_arc.html" title="Electric arc">electric arc</a> rather than a <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glow_discharge.html" title="Glow discharge">glow discharge</a>. --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_Carlson_64f0.html" title="User:Art Carlson">Art Carlson</a> 15:00, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Art. First, I'd like to say that I really respect what you've done so far. It's very impressive (especially your help in the fusion FAQ and the glossary), and your pages have lead me onto an entirely different path of inquiry.</p>
<p>I have a question and concern regarding your repeated citation of Rider's thesis and paper, however. Unfortunately, I can't access the thesis (the links that I could find were all down), nor could I read your review of the paper. Perhaps you still have some copies. In any case, certain statements seemed spurious, and they appeared to be highlighted in the <a href="http://fusion.ps.uci.edu/artan/Posters/aps_poster_2.pdf" class="external text" title="http://fusion.ps.uci.edu/artan/Posters/aps_poster_2.pdf" rel="nofollow">following</a> poster at the APS meeting. I haven't looked at Rider's calculation directly, but the poster notices that Rider assumes that the velocity space is always isotropic, and then proves that the redistribution power required for at least one example is smaller than the ideal fusion power. I see that you cite many of Rider's original paper's without taking this vulnerablity into account. Could you look into this? Is the jury still out on this issue? Articles referencing fundamental limitations and claiming 'impossibility' should really at -least- mention that there is some controversy. From my, admittedly green, standpoint, it looks like there really is a problem with some of the impossibility claims. We should look into this quickly, and revert if necessary.

<dd>Backatcha, Daniel. You've left your mark for me all over Wikipedia. I'll try to speak to the content where it comes up. Here, I'd first like to welcome you to Wiki's fusion pages. I have the impression you will be able to contribute a lot. Second, I'd like you to remember me to Sam Cohen. I spent a few weeks with him at Princeton longer ago than either of us would like to be reminded of. At the time I was just starting to consider leaving fusion - or at least the <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max-Planck-Institut_f%C3%BCr_Plasmaphysik_7cbc.html" title="Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik">IPP</a> in <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garching_bei_M%C3%BCnchen_9e7f.html" title="Garching bei München">Garching</a>. After a long story that is best told with the help of a bottle of red wine, I am currently back in Garching but at a different Max Planck Institute working on grid computing for the German astronomy community. On your <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielfong_8f1c.html" title="User:Danielfong">list of likes and dislikes</a> I notice you did not include dancing on roller skates one way of the other. (Ask Sam.)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for pointing out the poster. I had been wondering what Rostoker and friends had been up to since our <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/281/5375/307a" class="external text" title="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/281/5375/307a" rel="nofollow">encounter</a> eight years ago. I'll need some time to look at their argument in detail. I am <i>very</i> surprized that they think they can get around the problem by considering a non-isotopic distribution. Generally speaking, the time scale to reach isotropy is <i>much</i> faster than that to reach a Maxwellian energy distribution, so I would expect the recirculating power required to be even worse. I admit that "impossibility" can never be absolute. A German professor came up with a system several years ago to which Rider's argument did not obviously apply. For whatever reason, he has sunk back into oblivion. I don't say there is no way around Rider's arguments (except when I get polemic), but I do insist that anyone claiming that a proton-boron system is feasible has to specifically address them.</dd>

<dd>The electrons within their own frame of reference are isotropic, so my concern above does not hold. I'm not sure whether Rider's argument depends on the relative average speed of the electrons and ions or not. In any case, I read their poster and reread <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/281/5375/307a" class="external text" title="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/281/5375/307a" rel="nofollow">my critique</a> of the concept.

<dd>The red flags were expressions like "extremely complicated", "extremely unsatisfactory", and "awkward". I also find the comparison to <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epicycle.html" title="Epicycle">epicycles</a> to be inapt and designed to ridicule geocentrism more than to objectively characterize or criticize it. The big problem with epicycles was not that they were inherently more complicated than Keplerian orbits, but that they did not fit the data without an indefinite number of additional parameters. Furthermore, we don't have to "devise a geocentric reformulation of the laws of physics". Einstein has already done that for us. In general relativity, the symmetries are broken not by the laws of physics, but by the distribution of matter. I also find the example of a perfectly spherical Earth to be artificial. (konstruiert, gewollt - I can't find a good English equivalent.) The comment line in the history is so short that it is hard not to sound gruff. I hope this explains my reversion to your satisfaction. --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_Carlson_64f0.html" title="User:Art Carlson">Art Carlson</a> 08:21, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the explanation. Perhaps you could have a look at this quote from <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geocentric_model.html" title="Geocentric model">Geocentric model</a>, which then would seem to be POV and also incorrect:</dd>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Geocentrism has been fully disproven by modern science. Science has now shown that the Sun is at the center of the solar system, not the Earth. Further, the Sun is not the center of the universe; it is merely the center of one local solar system, and itself orbits around the center of our galaxy. Space probes which have visited the other planets in our solar system have followed paths which were calculated using Heliocentrism; if the geocentric model were true, then none of these spaceships could ever have arrived at their target planets or moons.</i></p>

<p>Hi Art, you seem to be (one of) the resident experts on fusion, can I ask your opinion of Eric Lerner's attempts to get proton-boron fusion to produce net energy? From what I have read on your talk page, it seems that you agree with Tod Rider's thesis that dismisses p-11B as a viable fuel mix for a future fusion power reactor. Would I be correct in assuming that in your opinion Lerner has not addressed Rider's criticisms either in whole or in part? --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJaganath_93db.html" title="User:Jaganath">User:Jaganath</a> 13:27, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>He seems to have addressed the issue at least in part. The Bremsstrahlung argument depends on a chain of energy transfer from the fusion products to the fuel ions, from there to the electrons, and finally loss by the electrons through Bremsstrahlung. For the sake of argument, perfectly optimistic assumptions are made for the first and last steps. Lerner cuts the chain at the second step by proposing a reduction in the classical energy transfer rate from ions to electrons. I haven't read his paper yet, so I can't say whether his theory and the experimental evidence for it is any good. I also suspect, but can't at present show, that achieving the necessary conditions will have its own set of fundamental problems. I'll report back after I have read <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0401/0401126.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0401/0401126.pdf" rel="nofollow">his paper</a>. --[[User:Art Carlson|Art Carlson] 09:54, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After reading Lerner's paper, I've made some changes to <a href="../../../a/n/e/Aneutronic_fusion.html" title="Aneutronic fusion">Aneutronic fusion</a>. There are many interesting points in the paper, but also several that I find suspect. If we accept his calculation, the effect is only a factor of 2. This is enough to change the ratio of bremsstrahlung to fusion power from just over one to just under one. But since the calculation of the ratio is based on very simple and optimistic assumptions, there is still no way in hell to make a reactor work. I think the most serious problem in this particular case is the neglect of <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyclotron_radiation.html" title="Cyclotron radiation">cyclotron radiation</a>. This loss mechanism is hard to get exactly right, but since it scales with B^2, it's going to be a mother at a megatesla. --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_Carlson_64f0.html" title="User:Art Carlson">Art Carlson</a> 09:12, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Cyclotron radiation <i>could</i> be a problem, but it's not the killer I thought it would be because, if the plasma beta is high enough, the frequency will be below the cut-off and not propagate. Then I realized that these kinds of fields will have so much magnetic pressure that they cannot be contained. --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_Carlson_64f0.html" title="User:Art Carlson">Art Carlson</a> 08:54, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks Art for replying so quickly and taking the time to craft a comprehensible and detailed reply. Seems like p-11B fusion still faces huge, if not insurmountable problems before it can become a future energy source; in light of this, can I ask if you think <a href="../../../i/t/e/ITER_648d.html" title="ITER">ITER</a>, and (spherical) tokamaks in general are the right direction to be going in if we are to harness fusion to produce useful power within your or my lifetimes? --<a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJaganath_93db.html" title="User:Jaganath">User: Jaganath</a> 18:42, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For what it's worth, I believe (1) fusion will work with D-T or not at all, (2) the best bet is an ITER-like tokamak, although similar machines like the stellarator or the spherical tokamak might turn out to be a bit better, (3) despite formidable problems, there is no fundamental reason that fusion cannot become an attractive source of energy, and (4) we will probably never get there, because trying things out is so expensive and time-consuming, and because there are alternatives that are constantly improving.

<dd>Thanks for your interest. I already said on the Talk page that an article, even a stubby one, might be a good idea, but the current REDIRECT already leads the reader to the essential information. I didn't mean to impute the good faith of 62. I maybe should have chosen softer words. But the content really is bad: "Quasineutrality of a plasma requires that plasma currents close on themselves in electric circuits." Quasineutrality has nothing to do with currents, only with charge densities. The only precise meaning I can assign to currents that close on themselves is that the divergence of the current vanishes, which is required in any steady state, whether it is quasineutral or not. The emphasis on certain concepts like Birkeland currents and double-layers is also a particular point of view (see <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">Plasma cosmology</a>) that is not widely held and thus, even where it is not wrong, not the best choice for an encyclopedic article. --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_Carlson_64f0.html" title="User:Art Carlson">Art Carlson</a> 14:57, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Art, your criterion for notability and Wiki-entries seemed to me very dubious, however I respect your view on the problem. Since Wikipedia is free-encyclopedia and its biographic database is expanding, I have myself been editing several entries on famous bulgarian scientists, yet I have created this entry on <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabish_Qureshi_f222.html" title="Tabish Qureshi">Tabish Qureshi</a>, who is known for his analysis of Popper's experiment, and the so-called entangled biphoton wavefunction. Well, this is all based on my old readings done several years ago [when I was not Wikipedian], when I have not even met prof. Qureshi personally. The fact that I have met him in Wikipedia changes nothing, I have opened the entry solely on scientific grounds. You can check the bibliographic list of his publications in the main article.

<dd>Concerning the NAFL author - definition of complementarity <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0504115" class="external text" title="http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0504115" rel="nofollow">page 6</a> - <i>"The particle and wave nature of the photon cannot be simultaneously demonstrated to hold ..."</i> and then the author says <i>"Note carefully the location of the word "simultaneously" in this definition; if we were to change BCP to ". . . cannot be demonstrated to hold simultaneously..." then such a definition would arguably fail even in NAFL."</i>. COMMENT by me - I see NO DIFFERENCE in the meaning even IF the word order is changed. I don't think that my English is so poor to fail to recognize a change of the sense due to word order. As this author is obviously with English language problem, I am not sure why it is included on equal footing with Qureshi, and Unruh. Not to mention that he works for commercial IBM corporation and possibly is not involved in academic research seriously, i.e. looks like hobby-scientist. I judge this on the content of his paper, and the discussed passage, NOT on extra-scientific criteria. I am to conclude that this author can NOT even formulate the complementarity principle correctly, as he sees not existent meaning in the word order given above. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 11:41, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I didn't take much time to try to figure it out, but I didn't understand what Srinivasan was trying to say about the word order either. I only added him and O'Hara because they were cited by Qureshi. After reading the papers, I'm starting to think it was a mistake. As to your paper, I finally found the time to read it. I'm not sure I understand everything you are saying, but I think I agree with you on almost all points. I still read Unruh differently than you (We'll have to get back to this point.), and at the end (but not before) you seem to agree with Qureshi that which-way information is somehow erased when the beams pass through each other. That I cannot accept at all. Assuming I have understood him properly, I think Qureshi's view would be rejected by most physicists, so I am wondering whether the reference to his work should also be removed from the article. --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_Carlson_64f0.html" title="User:Art Carlson">Art Carlson</a> 15:10, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Art, as the passion has calmed down, yes <b>I am happy that Unruh personally posted in Wikipedia</b>! (I never expected such a fast solution). Now concerning your comment - Qureshi is completely right, but my work compared to Qureshi's work is more general because I have provided EXPLANATION WHY the information is erased. Yes, in 2004 I said exactly as Qureshi that overlap erases the which way, and physicists didnot believe a word, as I had no math proof. Well, I suspect you did not understand the introduction which is <b>compressed information</b> and one must "decompress" it only by having some acquaintance with decoherence theory of Zeh. But I believe you understand perfectly well the equations [3] and [4] in my paper as they apply only Beam-splitter transformations and mirror reflection.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So let us calculate the evolution of the quantum state in Unruh's setup directly [look my figure 2]:</p>

It is obvious as <span class="texhtml"><i>D</i><sub>2</sub></span> gets half the intensity of light coming at |8&gt; that is <span class="texhtml"><i>D</i><sub>2</sub></span> gets light from both paths |1&gt; and |2&gt;. The <b>present momentum</b> of photons coming along path 8, with <b>past history</b> of either path 1 or path 2, is the SAME.

<p>p.s. contrary to Unruh, I have said that putting the obstacle or NOT does not matter. It is the presence of destructive interference at path 5 itself that "erases" the which way. Look at the expression <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/b/a/dbaeca97bb8e8df2740c5271662a230c.png" alt="\Psi \rightarrow -1 |6&gt; + 0 |5&gt;" />. You can drop the zero term [comment: multiplied by zero vector |5&gt; cannot be regained without dividing to zero! - impossible math operation]. Indeed the existent negative interference mathematically is formulated like that: <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/1/e/d1e2bb9193d9e622654c4d0b388784c9.png" alt="\Psi \rightarrow -1 |6&gt;" />. The measurement of the negative interference by obstacle physically mathematically is written like that <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/1/e/d1e2bb9193d9e622654c4d0b388784c9.png" alt="\Psi \rightarrow -1 |6&gt;" />. So my conclusion is that it is IMPOSSIBLE to have difference in the which way claim for interference + obstacle vs. interference + no obstacle. The mathematical expression is always the SAME <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/1/e/d1e2bb9193d9e622654c4d0b388784c9.png" alt="\Psi \rightarrow -1 |6&gt;" />. <i>I am excited</i> because it seems Unruh will publish his original 1 page letter-to-editor in PP (full of errors), and as his letter explicitly claims the inconsistency decribed in my sec. 3.3, I will have the beautiful opportunity to publicly solve the Georgiev-Unruh issue in the pages of reputable peer-review journal. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 09:08, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Danko, one thing still has me puzzled. When you and Qureshi talk about the interference "erasing" the which-way information, I have this picture:
<dl>
<dd><i>Two laser pulses approach each other.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Before they cross, a measurement will yield which-way information.</i></dd>
<dd><i>As they cross, there is an interference pattern.</i></dd>
<dd><i>After they have crossed, there is no longer any which-way information.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Is that what Queshi and you are trying to say?</dd>
<dd>And a related question. Kastner seems to believe there is never any which-way information when both slits are open, whether or not the interference pattern is measured, and whether one talks about the situation just after the slits or just before the detector. I believe you disagree. What do you see as the flaw in her argument?</dd>

<dd>Dear Art, yes before the overlap there is which way, but after the overlap there is no which way. The critical is the idea of <a href="../../../b/i/j/Bijection.html" title="Bijection">bijection</a> of input state and observables. As one can take the realist interpretation of q-superposition, which in my case is direct ontological interpretation of the AND-gate, one will notice two types of superposition - one of orthogonal states, and one of non-orthogonal states. The states before the overlap [imagine |1&gt; and |2&gt; of Mach-Zehnder] are really orthogonal, so measuring the state at |1&gt; simply gives you information that the state is NOT |2&gt;. This state <img class='tex' src="../../../math/b/b/6/bb6dc1251b532206e1dc1e434efeac90.png" alt="\Psi = \imath |1&gt; + |2&gt;" /> (not normalized) is superposition in TIME, but in space the wavefunctions |1&gt; and |2&gt; are separated - do not overlap - hence they are orthogonal states - interference is zero. Now consider after overlap the state at the arm |6&gt;. Here you have superposition of non-orthogonal states. States |1&gt; and |2&gt; are vectors that are time dependent. Under time evolution, both wavefunctions overlap, so they are no more orthogonal. Detecting at |6&gt; a photon does not give you information that the photon has passed through only path 1, or alternatively only path 2. You know indeed that the photon passed both paths, interfered and came to arm 6. So in certain sense my work shows another "inconsistency" of the popular presentation of QM, and in OLD Copenhagen anti-realist view. As I use direct math argumentation I show that quantum waves pass through both paths at ones. And this is NOT equivalent to "lack of knowledge of the photon path". Yes, I have knowledge which is quite substantial - "I know that the photon passed both paths at once". The proof is suggested in the introduction of my PP paper. Imagine a double slit - close slit 1 - see Gaussian like distribution1 , close slit 2 - see Gauusian like distribution 2. What knowledge you have? You know that slit 1 XOR slit 2 is open, which means the slits are NOT simultaneously open. Now open both slits - you see nice interference pattern. What you know? Is it "lask of knowledge of slit 1 or slit 2"? NO! You know mathematically rigorously that the setup is NOT XOR. Simple logical gate application of NOT-gate to XOR-gate gives you the XNOR gate. After elimination the "false" "false" outcome which is mathematically trivial, but physically meaningless, then you come to the AND gate. Yes, in coherent double-slit setup with open both slits the photon passed through BOTH slits at once! This is the ONLY mathematically valid way to get the interference. Concerning Kastner, as I said she is in my view incompetent on the topic, so I neither understand her analogy, nor I think she understands the orthogonality of vectors criterion, nor she understands what strictly <a href="../../../b/i/j/Bijection.html" title="Bijection">bijection</a> means in math terms. Sorry, for my mathematically oritented thinking. I love mathematics, and as Drezet joked on Afshar's talk "Mathematics is the queen of all natural science ... and Danko is its prophet" [the meaning was similar]. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 11:20, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Addendum: as you may see in my paper I say I have defended the MWI of QM. Yes, I mention the Copenhagen interpretation - CI - purely formally, where I envison CI anti-realism based directly on QM formalism. Yet, I think that popular wording of CI as "lack of which way" as MISLEADING and semantically wrong. "You don't know whether photon passed through slit 1 or slit 2" for me is equivalent to "you don't know the density matrix of setup" i.e. you don't know whether two slit wavefunctions 1 and 2 are coherent or they are incoherent. In contrast knowing that the two wavefunctions are coherent, is NOT lack of knowledge, but substantial information. You know the photon has passed both slits at once. In a certain sense you also know the which way bijection is NOT valid, but also the knowledge - "ww bijection is false" - for me is NOT "lack of knowledge of the bijection truth-value". i.e. lack of knowledge suggests it might be true, which is not the case <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 11:32, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
