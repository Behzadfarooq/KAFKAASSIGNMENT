<dd><b>Comment</b>The sources are notable but the texts are irrelevant. I narrate some of what you've recognized as good sources for this article.:
<ul>
<li>Lead of Daily time's article:<i>Iran’s schools are nurturing a siege mentality in children with textbooks showing preparations for war and depicting Israel and the West as the enemy, an Israeli think tank said on Tuesday.</i></li>
<li>Title of Japan today's article:<i>Sudan, Iran vow to defeat "enemies of Islam"</i>(The text isn't available)</li>
<li>Relevant part of BBC's article: <i>Arab countries are trying to forget the existence of a cancerous tumour in the heart of the World of Islam and are closing their eyes to this real enemy of Muslims... The Islamic Republic of Iran and any other country that enjoys sovereignty should do their best to launch an Islamic anti-Zionist movement against Israel.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I can gather numerous of such sources which hasn't used <b>Enemy of Islam</b> as an expression or technical word.--<font face="monospace"><a href="../../../s/a/2E/User%7ESa.vakilian_5dc3.html" title="User:Sa.vakilian">Sa.vakilian</a>(<a href="../../../s/a/2E/User_talk%7ESa.vakilian_dfc7.html" title="User talk:Sa.vakilian">t</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sa.vakilian_be41.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sa.vakilian">c</a>)</font> 02:52, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually the entire Pakistan link is relevant. The BBC link is partially relevant.

<li><b>Delete</b> Stubby article about self-explanatory phrase. This is just an all-purpose term of abuse used by the Iranian government for people it doesn't like. Had it been a specific category in law it might be worth a page here, but that doesn't seem to be the case. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 09:24, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - this term is potentially so broad as to be virtually meaningless for encyclopedic purposes. As Folantin points out, perhaps if the Iranian Government starts locking people up for the crime of being Enemies of Islam, then maybe an article about the legal use, but at the moment there is no such use. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_recordings_a333.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested recordings">Request a recording?</a></sup> 09:34, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Not a 'special' term deserving of its own article. Someone can be an enemy of America, enemy of Christianity, enemy of whatever... enemy of Islam is just a basic term for an enemy of Islam. It appears to be a Patchouli relic anyway, so its bias and very existence is not surprising. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 15:22, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - While I am more of a mergist, thinking that stuff can always be salvaged from junk, there is simply too much POV nonsense to go through to get to it.
