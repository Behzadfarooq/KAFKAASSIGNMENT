<li><b>Additional comments:</b>This article is a neologism of the neologism <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a>. Therianthropy is a made up word by an internet group as stated in the body of the article: <i>In the early days of the Usenet group alt.horror.werewolves (around 1992), the members discussed fictional shapeshifters. Some users began to publicly claim that they considered themselves to be partially non-human animal. A number were only joking, but enough people were serious about it, and claimed this was their personal understanding and experience of themselves, that it became the subject of ongoing discussion Initially such people called themselves lycanthropes, but as that word more accurately describes wolf-people, therianthropes was chosen as a more general term.</i> At first glance the article seems very legit (the authors have done an excellent job of presentation) and the author even goes so far as to try and apply his neologism in a "Scholarly" context but once you begin to read it the fact that it is a vanity article created by a "community" of people attempting to create a scientific or legit sounding name to their...belief system is rather obvious. There are no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> claims of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, it is written in a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> tone, and serves as nothing more than a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">soapbox</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> It should be noted that the terms are, while related, not in fact derived from eachother in any way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> It was my understanding that the word was not made up by the Usenet furries, but rather just adopted by them. The beginning of the article seems to say that it is a more general term for animal people, encompassing werewolves and such. <s>I'm refraining from voting either keep or delete;</s> The term, subcultural use, and variations thereof are pretty popular on the internet, but I'm not sure how much of the subject would be reported on in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable sources</a>, even moreso considering Wikipedia's bias against things having to do with the internet. I agree that the article is in gross need of work and NPOVifying. (<b>edit: additional comment—</b> note that the hugely disproportionate amount of furries on Wikipedia are going to flock to this AfD.) <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVoretus_d72f.html" title="User:Voretus"><font color="green">Voretus</font></a><a href="../../../v/o/r/User_talk%7EVoretus_e700.html" title="User talk:Voretus"><font color="purple"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 10:11, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, therianthropy is a combination of the greek words for beast and man. I can't find any academic use of the term and wikpedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" title="WP:NOT">not a dictionary</a>. There is already a article on <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shapeshifting.html" title="Shapeshifting">shapeshifting</a>. Yes, it is popular on the internet as a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a>. I also have no doubt that this AfD will soon be kneedeep in furrie meatpuppetry but AfDs are not a vote, you have to have a reason besides "fursecution!" or "I like this article". We'll see I suppose. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 10:27, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hey, assume good faith please. It's disingenuous to declare in advance that if lots of people vote keep it's just because they're meatpuppets; the same sort of claim could just as easily be made about swarms of deletionists who hate interestingcruft to "explain away" large numbers of delete votes should they happen. Or, for that matter, dismissing a section of the article because "The section on "Scholarly use of the term" can only be there to try and help justify or help legitimize the "modern usage" section." (from your comment on the article's talk page) Well, if it does, what of it? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 17:22, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are of course correct, I should assume more good faith and I aplogize if I've offended you. As I'm sure you know if you spend enough time in AfD and you can get a little jaded and cynical about the process' abuse by conflicts of interest. In addition to my personal opinion of the author's motivations I have also justified all my actions through proper process per the guildlines and policy of an AfD nom. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 01:27, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, you were a bit quick on the trigger with this AfD IMO - you left a comment on talk: just two days prior and hadn't recieved a response. But considering I have on occasion let problems I considered "critical" sit for six months to a year while awaiting a solution we could just be operating on very different perceptual timescales.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 05:45, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm neutral on this article, but I am reasonably certain that I can scrape up an academic use of the term (at least in the derived form "therianthropic") referring to the animal-headed human depictions of Egyptian mythological deities. That aside, there look to be a couple of actual legitimately published books cited as reference (including a Penguin-published work cited regarding development of the term). Is there something I'm overlooking? ... 14 years is plenty of time for a term to stop being a neologism, especially if its seen print via Penguin. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 11:21, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Penguin book is about werewolves and has nothing to do with the neologism labeled in the article. The only "reference" citing the article's POV is a fansite. Like I said the term Therianthrophy is a combo of the Greek words for beast and man so if you looked hard enough you can no doubt find it used <i>somewhere</i> outside the furry community but not in the way as defined by the article as a demographic or recognized academic term. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 11:29, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Amazon seems to list at least <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fang-Fur-Blood-Bone-Primal/dp/1905713010" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Fang-Fur-Blood-Bone-Primal/dp/1905713010" rel="nofollow">one book</a> that directly deals with the topic under this name. An absolutely cursory look at the publisher looks like it might be one step above self-publication, but I'm unsure if this is sufficient to give <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> weight to the topic. I've got two articles I'm sandboxing at the moment to try to bring through DRV, so I really don't think I've got the time to see if this one's recoverable right now, but there's a start should someone be so inclined.... <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 12:59, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> of the sources that are cited, I've looked up two. <i>The Magic of Shapeshifting</i> by Rosalyn Greene is quite obviously describing the same subculture that is described for seven pages in "Werewolves" by Daniel Cohen. However, using the Amazon.com "search inside the book" feature yields only two uses of "therianthropy" and one use of "therianthrope" in <i>The Magic of Shapeshifting</i> (it mostly uses "shifter subculture" or "shifters" instead) and the Cohen book doesn't use "therianthropy" or "therianthrope" at all. Some further digging seems to indicate that the terms used by the subculture are wildly various: therian, shifter, were, polywere, therianthrope, theriomorph and so on. I think one difficulty is that "therianthrope" is not now the standard term used by the subculture, and never has been. That's one reason why I put a split template on <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therianthropy.html" title="Therianthropy">Therianthropy</a>. Separate the mythology from the subculture, and then let the rest sort itself out. Probably the subculture article will need to have a lot of material deleted if it can't be cited properly, but there's enough published material citing the subculture under some name or other that an article about the subculture could easily be supported, just perhaps not under the name "therianthropy."<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 21:10, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was thinking that the subculture is best termed "therian" and the main article on them might best be named that. But that begs the question of where they got that term at all? Likely derived from therianthropy (mythology) and now they are trying to reclaim the original term for their own. If they have succeeded in that aim then their article can be therianthropy; otherwise it should be therian with mention that the term therianthropy has acheived some limited usage in that sense. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 21:21, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll admit as to being completely stumped as to which different name, if any, the article about the subculture should be under. All choices seem to have a problem, and I've yet to see a print reference for "therian," the current winner in terms of popularity. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 21:45, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The "neologism" is not <i>our</i> neologism, but rather a term that the therianthropes came up with for themselves. There's plenty of sources out there that use it. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 17:09, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree, it's a made up neologism. While not used only by those that identify them selves as furries that doesn't really have any bearing on wether or not this article meets wikipedia policy. If you really want to keep this article could you please provide these sources and do you have any way of rectifying the other fundemental violations of policy? <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 17:14, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You can't just list every policy under the sun and declare that it fails all of them without any further explanation. The only objections you've given any detail to are that the article's a "neologism" (which is only against policy if <i>we</i> invented the term, not if we're reporting on a neologism that <i>other people</i> recently came up with) and that there aren't reliable sources (the article already lists six published books as sources). Could you explain what the other supposed fundamental violations of policy are? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 17:22, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Have I not? I assumed most of the violations would be obvious. When I say it has no reliable sources that is because none of the citation's source material meets <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> per self-published sources. The few books sources don't really support the position maintained by the article or do so only through original research. All of the POVs that the article puts forth either fail under the aformentioned problems with sources or they have no sources at all, making them <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. The article puts forth a hypothesis about "therianthropy" based on the authors attempts to apply his understanding of the neologism in a "scholarly" context. Note that the actual term is not used, just the meaning of the neologism as he understands applied to that context. More violations of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. None of the sources in that section apply to the neologism or its use, just the concept as the author understands it: a violation of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as well. This pattern repeats itself throughout the rest of the article except now the author is applying it to the "modern subculture". The author even contrasts his pet term to medically diagnoseable medical conditions such as clinical lycanthropy, multiple or split personality disorder and body dysmorphic disorder without citing any medical work or making any claim of having any expertise. Of course all this is written in a POV and very pro-therianthrophic stance. Zero sources and and violations of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. The author also makes unsourced and POV claims about "therian" groupings, belief structure, degrees of identification, variety of involved species and social struture all with little or, more often, no sources at all. See where I'm going with this? It's all original research to support a particular POV that is not sourced or verifiable. Also note that the def of a neologism per <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> is <i>words and terms that have recently been coined, generally do not appear in any dictionary, but may be used widely or within certain communities</i>. It doesn;t matter who came up with said neologism. Of course there is no verifiable <i>notability</i> put forth either and the entire thing is wrapped in a hard candy shell of <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLLOCKS_9aa6.html" title="WP:BOLLOCKS">WP:BOLLOCKS</a>.

<li>I would resolve a lot of these issues simply by trimming of the existing article, though. And I think you're being rather extreme in dismissing some of the sources; one of them's published by <i>Penguin</i>, that's rather far from a vanity press. The quality of much of the article is debatable but taking the position that there are absolutely <i>no</i> good sources in here is a bit over the top. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 05:45, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not arguing that the Penguin <i>werewolf</i> book is legit. I'm saying it is misused as the author of the essay is using to justify his POV and apply his term to it. It inclusion does not support the articles POV without <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Even is that were not the case that doesn't make the article salvagable and the author doesn't specificly justify its inclusion as a ref. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 10:52, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article cites the book in reference to a discussion on the origins of the term at AHWW. <i>If</i> the book actually cites the term, then we've got no problem; inclusion in a Penguin-published work is pretty much in gold standard category for "not just being a neologism". I'll try to find a copy in the next day or so, work permitting ... a page reference, or the lack of one, ought to put most of this discussion to rest. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 11:10, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>While it would help it is by no means going to do anything to alleviate the rest of the issues with this article. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 11:14, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Penguin book is not misused (since the information in the footnote is in the book and it does discuss the subculture for seven whole pages) but it does not support "therianthropy" as a term used by the subculture - in fact, it doesn't list any of the terms used by the subculture (which is probably just as well, since it is a book for children). So, it is a legimitate source for the article, but not a legitimate reason why the article should continue with the title "Therianthropy." <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 21:51, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Do not merge with Otherkin! Therianthropy and otherkin are entirely separate beliefs although there are people who share both (hence the 'overlap'). Otherkin hold beliefs (past lives, the existence of mythological creatures on an astral plane, et cetera) that most therianthropes do not have. In addition most therianthropes disparage or take offense to the term Otherkin, which they feel implies a rejection or denial of one's humanity. As for this article being a 'vanity' article, therianthropy is a belief, not a community. Therianthropy has no leaders, no central creed, and there is no main community. In describing a belief and not a community, the article stands as legitimate, since therianthopes are not a singular community and many do not even participate in online 'therian' websites. This article simply names and describes a belief held by people who may have little else in common. The term 'therianthropy' is also used by a significant number (in the thousands) of people worldwide. <small>— 24.230.61.31 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.230.61.31_739e.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.230.61.31">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> Neologism, but moderately popular in its niche and (in parts at least) well-written/referenced article. I'd hate to see the content lost so merge it with a more popular or general term for the subject (<a href="../../../s/h/a/Shapeshifting.html" title="Shapeshifting">shapeshifting</a> already opens with a big list of synonyms, and could really do with the references) and redirect. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Sockatume</a> 05:13, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I see this as a reasonable article in its own right, but if enough people disagree then a compromise I'd be comfortable with is merging it into Otherkin and turning "therianthropy" into a disambig pointing to there and to lycanthropy.

<li>Hope I'm doing this right, never edited wikipedia stuff before. In August 2003, The Learning Channel aired a program called 'Animal Imitators'. One of the people interviewed was Coyote Osborn, long-time administrator of the 'werelist' website linked to in the article. I don't know if this lends any weight, though. On one hand, the term wasn't actually used; on the other, Coyote is a prominent member of the community but doesn't otherwise put himself out in the public eye very much, yet he was found and sought out for interview by TLC. The video is available for download on various sites; his interview begins almost exactly 37min into the program if you are viewing it with commercials left in.</li>

<li>For what its worth, I'm willing to do the heavy lifting needed for the cleanup and rewrite, but it would be another day or two until I'm done with my current article projects, and I've already been informed that some of the material I cited will require interlibrary loans. So, if someone has at least <i>some</i> sourcing they can put in place earlier than 1-2 weeks, I'd be appreciative.

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> A useful term with, as has been shown, applications in academia as well as the popular usage. The popular usage alone, which is different from that of 'otherkin', would render it a good topic. -<a href="../../../g/e/w/User%7EGEWilker_49bf.html" title="User:GEWilker">G.E.

<li><b>Pretty strong keep</b> per Serpent's Choice's sources. These folks have been referenced in a few books, and the online community is big enough to balance out the not-ideal amount of book sources. Original research is certainly a problem, but with these and other sources, the article is worth keeping. Needs rewrite immensely, but <i>POV-ness is not inherent to the subject</i>; I'm convinced that it can be covered with impartiality suitable for Wikipedia. And being POV is not a criteria for deletion, only significant revision. I don't feel that merge is appropriate, either, although my opinion on that is less strong. Otherkin and therianthropes often move in very different social and subcultural circles, as shown by the sources, which don't share a significant overlap with the <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a> article. The history of how the subcultures of otherkin and therianthropy came to be is also quite different, as can be seen in their respective articles. (Incidentally, I'm pretty much Wikibreaking at the moment, so I won't be able to answer much query about my comments, but I did want to put in my word on this one.&#160;:P) <font face="trebuchet ms"><b><a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwitchercat_3998.html" title="User:Switchercat"><font color="darkblue">Switcher</font><font color="#000">cat</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/i/User_talk%7ESwitchercat_a36d.html" title="User talk:Switchercat">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Switchercat_81dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Switchercat">cont</a></sub></font> 01:10, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

So the term is at least 91 years old.</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete.</b> The article itself does not seem to advance the base of knowledge too much, coming chiefly from sources which are suspect, not quoted in the text, or seemingly biased in their scope and application. A merge to Otherkin would add citeable sources, but the two don't seem sufficiently linked, to me, to warrant this. I vote for deletion if simply due to the fact that the article concerns what IS a neologism (if not in its original formation, then in the scope and application it has met within its usage in this article), and additionally... no one can deny that this article reads like a POV essay. References frequently aren't cited, it contains comments such as:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Stereotypically, it is said that furries view therianthropy as "taking it too far" or "too seriously", while therianthropes assert that furries are frivolous, juvenile, and/or don't respect or understand the true nature of animals."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>At least one key difference seems to be that most therians see this as being part of their own nature, rather than a dysfunction or psychological defence mechanism, thus it is often valued rather than hoped to be "cured".</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>These, and many others, are pretty broad statements to be made... has the article writer talked to most of those who identify with this group? Can they quote studies? How do they show this stereotypical history of the opinion of Furries, are they sure these are commonly and majorly held views by Furries? Can they prove it? MY digging through the sources (and I will immediately apologize for my assumptions if direct sources for some of the therefore seemingly POV statements are provided), has turned up nothing. Anyway. Even if the article cannot be entirely deleted, it should be cleaned up in a very huge way to remove some POV or utterly unverifiable/opinionated statements. Merging into Otherkin does not seem to me to be accurate, because it would necessitate defining one article as a subset of the other in some ways. Since the two things seem distinct, and only hazy evidence can really be found about either, I would say that this article should be deleted. As has previously been said, many things are interesting or noteworthy, yet not well enough documented to meet encyclopedic standards.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I was considering weakening my keep based on a <s>poor Google performance of therianthopy. Therianthropic does much better but also gets more into the existing unrelated scholarly usage.

<li><b>Comment</b> - There seems to be a large amount of confusion between therianthropy as psychological/spiritual phenomenon and therianthropy as subculture. 'Therianthropy as subculture' is not what I feel the article should be about, although I think a section on subcultures associated to the phenomenon is of some relevance. Arguments that 'Otherkin and therians are different subcultures' misunderstand the purpose of an encyclopedia (although the obsessive detail on some fan topics might lead people to think otherwise). Therianthropy, the belief that one has an animal soul, is a long-established phenomenon that plays an important role in understanding tribal cultures. The fact that this belief crops up even without cultural supports and in the face of societal sanctions (such as the 'clinical lycanthropy' diagnosis) is noteworthy. On the other hand, statements that "Otherkin think therians are far too serious" are pointless, and should be excised in favour of encyclopedic content. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickArgall_92e1.html" title="User:NickArgall">NickArgall</a> 05:42, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

(Note: there is also a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therianthropy_%28fiction%29.html" title="Therianthropy (fiction)">Therianthropy (fiction)</a> floating around, which should probably be merged with <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shapeshifting.html" title="Shapeshifting">Shapeshifting</a> or deleted). <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 18:45, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>At the risk of being premature (this AfD being still in progress); I added an item for the split discuss and noted my support. Also, modern use in fiction can go into the main article if we take the main article as being somewhat generic. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 19:12, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't want to be premature either, so I'm waiting to see how this Afd goes before transferring content from <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therianthropy.html" title="Therianthropy">Therianthropy</a> to the two articles in the proposed split. However, I've created a temporary archive at <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_Therianthropy_0a81.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea/Therianthropy">User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea/Therianthropy</a> just in case. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 20:23, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
