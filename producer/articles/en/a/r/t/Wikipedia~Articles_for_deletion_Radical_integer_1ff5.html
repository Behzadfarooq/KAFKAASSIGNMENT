<p>The only given reference is to Weisstein at MathWorld; his only reference, in turn, is to a "math-fun@cs.arizona.edu posting, May 11, 1997", whatever that means, by one R. Schroeppel. The definition itself seems like a reasonable one to make, but people who want to make up words should publish them in journals like the rest of us. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 15:30, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I looked for it on Google and it is mentioned on a few educational sites, especially in China, but none of them work. Some of the stuff on Weisstein's is crap, at least the science encyclopedia, but I don't know enough math to make a decision on this. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 16:17, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraic_integer.html" title="Algebraic integer">algebraic integer</a>. As the article notes, the "radical integers" are a subring of the algebraic integers, and the algebraic integer article already mentions them in passing. Anyway, I'm not sure this is quite a neologism: for example, <a href="../../../m/a/p/Maple_computer_algebra_system.html" title="Maple computer algebra system">Maple</a>'s help system defines a "radical number" as the following:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A radical number is defined as either a rational number or <i>i</i> , or a combination of roots of rational numbers specified in terms of radicals. A sum, product, or quotient of these is also a radical number.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>and I can find other mentions of "radical number" on the web. So a "radical integer" by the definition in this page is exactly what one would expect it to be, namely a radical number that's also an algebraic integer. But it doesn't seem to be used enough to merit its own article. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 17:38, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not all that persuaded that it's obvious a "radical integer" should be a "radical number" that's at the same time an algebraic integer, and anyway I don't recall hearing "radical number" before (may be internal terminology to Maple). Unless the term can be better attested, I don't think WP should claim that this is what "radical integer" means, even inside the <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraic_integer.html" title="Algebraic integer">algebraic integer</a> article. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 17:52, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>After searching the web for a little while, it seems that this R Schroeppel character is a bona fide researcher in the area of theoretical cryptography. You can find lots of published papers by him on some fairly mathematical topics. But I found no reference for radical integers. It seems like a very noncontroversial definition, but I suppose we can't allow even noncontroversial definitions that are in violation of NOR, right? If this is a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, merging is not appropriate, we have to delete.

<li>I was refering to Schröppel as credible, not Weisstein. Even given that I think that the book has inaccuracies that does not proclude us from reporting what it reports and not asserting anything (which is what we should be doing).

<li>Verifiability doesn't mean we don't make distinctions among sources. We don't have to blindly accept everything that gets an ISBN. We don't really know what Schröppel said, and anyway he doesn't seem to be a number theorist either. For that matter even if he were a number theorist, his use of a term in one posting on a mailing list wouldn't constitute much evidence that it's an accepted term in the number theory community.</li>
<li>However I have left a message on <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">User:Henrygb</a>'s talk page; he was the one who added the link on the <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraic_integer.html" title="Algebraic integer">algebraic integer</a> page. Could be he knows something more specific about it. But if that traces back to Weisstein too, I think we have to delete.

<li>Oh, and by the way, if the New York Times screws up and we find out about it, we <i>don't</i> report what they said as fact. In the rare case that their mere reporting of the alleged facts is notable, as opposed to the facts themselves, then certainly we can say that's what they said. That's clearly not the case here; the fact that MathWorld uses a term is not in itself worthy of encyclopedic notice. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 05:35, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There just does not seem to be enough to establish this as even a somewhat marginally used number theoretic term. We definitely should not create Wikipedia articles based on basically one Internet posting by even a respected researcher; it's not even clear whether he is using it as standard terminology or it's just a temporary term he made up.

<li><b>Comment</b> wow, good catch, I hadn't noticed that at all. Maybe the article meant "quintic"? Anyway now I'm sort of curious; <i>is</i> the golden ratio a "radical integer"? You'd think this result (the general one, not just for the case of the golden ratio) might be the sort of thing RS might have gotten around to publishing if the proof had held up, which makes me wonder if he found a mistake later. This has gotten mildly more serious; the issue now is not just whether MathWorld is pushing a non-accepted terminology, but whether they've made an actual mathematical error here. But it's definitely an interesting result if true. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 22:01, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

Furthermore, per kotepho, the fact that this is contained in a book makes it verifiable, regardless of the original source OF the book; when a book is published we can trust that the author and publisher vet their sources, and if it's good enough for them, it should be good enough for us, as long as there's no reason to suspect bias. Frankly, I'm surprised this concept originated as late as 1997!

<li><b>Comment</b> Schroeppel claims to have proved it himself. He probably did, and it's a nice result that would be nice to have. Unfortunately it hasn't been published in a reliable source. (People, we <i>can't</i> rely on Weisstein!!! Talented as he obviously is, his quality control standards just aren't good enough in this sort of area. What's good enough for Weisstein should not be automatically good enough for us.) --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 17:14, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree here with Trovatore. <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> does not say that we just include anything that we can verify, it's necessary that the sources be reliable also. Here we have an article whose contents are backed up by <i>one</i> source (it's unfortunate that Schroeppel's email, posting, etc., can't be used, but that's how it is); this one source is an encyclopedia, a source whose authority and reliability is supposed to rest on the sources it cites. In this case, it's clear that this source's standard are not as stringent as Wikipedia's. Not only that, but no, we don't just trust the author and publisher. In particularly contentious cases (as in this one), what is usually done is that we look into whether the author is reliable. This reminds me of the time Weisstein claimed (and still does) that geometers don't use 2-sphere to refer to a <a href="../../../2/-/s/2-sphere.html" title="2-sphere">2-sphere</a>. He apparently got this idea somehow (from looking at outdated books, I imagine) and then goes on a whole long spiel about how topologists and geometers differ on what to call the 2-sphere. In my experience also, his error ratio is quite high, and his goofs can be quite bad. What's funny is that he goofed on the entry under discussion, but I suppose that's not really going to change your mind as to reliability. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 17:48, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: It seems like something someone would have thought about before, and maybe there is another source out there. But this is just speculation. All we got so far is that Schroeppel made up this term "radical integer" in a discussion on a mailing list, with the help of others he proved some results in the list discussion, Weisstein mentions this in his encyclopedia. That's not enough. Now, I've often thought Wikipedia is too stringent at times, but what about in this case? I feel it's wise. I mean, who are we supposed to credit the theorem? Schroeppel says it wasn't just him. What about the proof of the stated result? Are we just supposed to state the result and then not say anything more? If Schroeppel put it up on his webpage, it would be different (for me and some others I'm sure), but he says he can't find the preprint! It seems that maybe he could find it, but he says that it assumes too much knowledge of the list discussion, so it's possible editors trying to use the preprint to create the article would have to violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> in a substantial way. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 18:36, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Trovatore. If some evidence could be provided that the term is more widespread than is suggested by what's been written so far during this discussion, then I might be persuaded to change my mind. Certainly if Weisstein and an offhand definition in a mailing list discussion are the only sources, then this is not enough. <a href="../../../d/m/h/User%7EDmharvey_69fb.html" title="User:Dmharvey">Dmharvey</a> 22:45, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Don't see the relevance of the concept. One could as well define "square root radical integers" where taking roots is restricted to square roots. Relevance matters. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 02:01, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> so the relevance would be to the claimed result (namely that if a number expressible by radicals starting with rationals is an algebraic integer, then it can be expressed by radicals starting with ordinary integers). As I say, that's a nice result, but I don't think that from the sources we have, we have enough to claim in WP that it's true. If we could verify the result, then there might still be a question whether "radical integer" is genuinely accepted nomenclature for the concept. But if we <i>can't</i> verify the result, then as you say, keeping the term (even as a redirect, I think) would be kind of silly. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 02:45, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am not sure about that; Schroeppel clearly claims to have proved it, and if we source it to him, we are doing our job (and it's the sort of thing which <i>ought</i> to be true. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 14:14, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I doubt it's encyclopedic if stated as "Schroeppel claims to have proved...", which would clearly have to be in the <i>text</i> under these circumstances, rather than simply inferred by the reader by looking at the references, given that the proof hasn't had formal peer review. I might feel differently if we had the proof available to us to check; "legalistically" I suppose that's not supposed to make any difference, but I'd call this an instance of <a href="../../../s/e/n/WP%7ESENSE_4fdd.html" title="WP:SENSE">WP:SENSE</a>; if the result has a proof that we can follow, and we check that it's right, then it's verified. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 17:33, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
