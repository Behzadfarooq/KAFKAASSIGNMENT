<p><b>Delete</b>, I suppose this qualifies as original research, or at least is highly interpretive. I'll admit in advance to possible ignorance: maybe these characters have been fictionally diagnosed with ADHD, but I'm sceptical. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 01:06, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Fictional diagnoses are pretty common especially in situation comedies involving children. Some of the claims, although not currently sourced, are at least plausible. I have added the character Justin Cobb, from the movie Thumbsucker, which is verifiable and sourced. If that doesn't convince, I'll add more until you holler "Uncle". --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:19, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> After removing two entries which I'm pretty sure don't qualify, I'm suspicious of the other characters listed. Wouldn't this be better if moved to "List of fictional characters <b>diagnosed</b> with ADHD"? Leaving it this vague seems like an invitation for extensive POV. As <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> pointed out diagnoses are pretty common, but more importantly, they're verifiable. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMidnighters_8ade.html" title="User:TheMidnighters">TheMidnighters</a> 15:23, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - How do we know these guys have ADHD, it's all going to be unverifiable POV guesswork - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 15:33, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. There are very few (possibly zero?) fictional characters appearing in notable fiction that are explicitly diagnosed as ADHD. What will happen with a list like this, of course, is that armchair psychologists will diagnose fictional characters on their own. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 15:58, 20 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. OK, Tony has convinced me. BUT, I strongly strongly suggest that boilerplate be added in the article to explain that only "in world" diagnoses count (i.e., the character has to be identified within the book as ADHD. By a (in the book) authority.) <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 02:31, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Whil it may be useful article the name "List of ..." and its current format just invites jokers to insert any crap into it. Such result would be misleading. Article as "ADHD in fiction" with details on every character may be useful, current "list" not. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 18:18, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Okay, I warned you. I've added two children's books with main characters diagnosed (fictionally, of course! but within the book) with ADHD. This could be a useful list for people interested in the portrayal of psychiatric illnesses and conditions in fiction. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 18:47, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>And another two.

<li>I've added four more which are all documented on Wikipedia and externally. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 20:48, August 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Which part of the article do you consider original research? Every character in this list is identified as having ADHD by the respective authors or writers. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 23:37, August 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes. Name an item on that article about which it can be said that the diagnosis of ADHD is original research, and I personally will removed it with great delight--better yet, remove it yourself! And then change your vote to keep, if only because without breaking a sweat I've added nine indisputable characters who within the context of the fictional works were diagnosed as having ADHD. Well some of them were ADHD-diagnosed Jumpy Elephants and whatnot, but that's in the nature of psychiatric literature for children. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 23:46, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's not original research unless inclusion requires some element of interpretation, and as such I'd support <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMidnighters_8ade.html" title="User:TheMidnighters">TheMidnighters</a>' suggesgted name change. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowerparty_4b7e.html" title="User:Flowerparty"><font color="#CCDDDD">Flowerparty</font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFlowerparty_6764.html" title="User talk:Flowerparty"><sup>talk</sup></a> 23:49, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> the list as it stands now is considerably different than the original list nominated, all but one of the items listed have been removed because they were unverified, and the remaining one has been verified.
