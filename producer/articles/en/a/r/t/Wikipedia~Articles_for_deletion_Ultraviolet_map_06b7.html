<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> Interesting article, but if we add a new article everytime the writers add a new bit of mythology to Lost, it will get unwieldly before they hit 4 seasons. I've merged this article <a href="../../../d/h/a/DHARMA_Initiative_53a3.html" title="DHARMA Initiative">DHARMA Initiative</a> which is the most logical place for it.

<li>Merge. I am for Merging it. There is a lot of fan speculation in the lost articles. We can't delete it all but we can merge it to articles on pure facts about the series.

<li><b>Keep</b>, to want to remove this because parts of it are of a speculative nature is a bad reason. The show is in progress and the information becomes more solid over time; if this kind of thing was not allowed on wikipedia, there wouldnt be an in-progress tvshow template. Also, Jtrost, you have no right to talk down to and discredit people that havent been here long, how would you like it if no one listened to your thoughts and opinions during your first week or two here? Everyone's opinion matters as long as it is presented logically and should not be disregarded merely because one side wants to win the argument. Back to the main point, based on the massive amount of information surrounding this map, I dont believe it is a good idea to shove it into DHARMA, it will grow too fast too quickly. If you're worried that every little thing in lost will have it's own article, then why not just give it a few weeks to see if the map is of actual importance (kind of like Drive Shaft is relevant enough to have an article), if it ends up being just another plot device thrown in by the writers, then we'll merge. <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentiumOutlaw_e661.html" title="User:ArgentiumOutlaw">ArgentiumOutlaw</a> 11:24, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Since you thought it was appropriate for your argument to put words in my mouth, I'll go ahead and explain. I did NOT say that if we have the template we are allowed to make the article speculative, what I DID say was that the show is in progress, and a few parts of the article will end up being of a speculative nature. If you actually spent the time to read the article, you'd see that most of it is a description of the map, if you're sole argument is that there are some lines that say things like "has been speculated that", then you have no real argument. It is easy to clean it up and make it contain only facts.<a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentiumOutlaw_e661.html" title="User:ArgentiumOutlaw">ArgentiumOutlaw</a> 01:16, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have updated the article myself and have removed or changed almost all of the lines that could be considered speculative. Now I'd like anyone still arguing that the article is too speculative to tell me what 'theories' are being presented in the article, or what opinions of the writer are causing this article to be too speculative. <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentiumOutlaw_e661.html" title="User:ArgentiumOutlaw">ArgentiumOutlaw</a> 01:38, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> While there are many reasons why this page should be merged with the <a href="../../../d/h/a/DHARMA_Initiative_53a3.html" title="DHARMA Initiative">DHARMA Initiative</a>, it seems that for now, from the perspective of a fan of the show, that this entry should be its own entity.

<li><b>Comment to your comment</b> I agree with you that it is speculative that it <i>might</i> be important. However, I would also like to point out the the creators of <i>Lost</i> tend to put in things that come back later on as something important. For example, early on in the series they saw random polar bears...and then there was the incident with the comic book (I am being vague in case someone does not want to read a spoiler)...and the mention of polar bears on the map. These <i>small</i> details do come back... <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremys779_11a4.html" title="User:Jeremys779">Jeremys779</a> 00:15, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As I said in an earlier post, it probably <i>will</i> eventually fit into the DHARMA article...but we do not know yet. For all we know, this might have nothing to do with DHARMA but would fit in better with a different article. While I do agree with the general consensus that we should not and <i>cannot</i> include <i>everything</i>, it stands to reason that certain things that will prove to be important (and for anyone who watches LOST, you know what they are) can be left in place temporarily, until their proper "home" is found. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremys779_11a4.html" title="User:Jeremys779">Jeremys779</a> 15:55, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> "of what we do know, the map is 100% about DHARMA dealings", isn't that speculative in itself? You're assuming it is 100% DHARMA, but we don't know enough about the map to determine even that for sure. Just because it's in The Swan, doesn't mean it belongs in the DHARMA category. As a note to everyone who says info from the map is too speculative, you wont acknowledge even the existence of The Swan as a hatch on the map (because you keep removing those lines from our edits), so you logically shouldnt claim that it belongs in the Dharma category for any other reason than it being on the blast door (and I say that's not enough of a reason to merge with Dharma). Things are so vague at this point, that the map might even end up better fitting a merge with a character or The Hanso Foundation (if it doesn't get merged/deleted by then). <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentiumOutlaw_e661.html" title="User:ArgentiumOutlaw">ArgentiumOutlaw</a> 22:44, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So, for now the map is an artifact located in the Swan station just like the computer or the counter. Like PKtm says below, everything else in this article is based on the "best try" of the EW staff. Just about everything is vague in Lost, that's its main feature. As stated previously, an entire article about the map is no more warranted than an article about the hatch speaker, or about Locke's legs. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArru_dab3.html" title="User:Arru">Arru</a> 10:36, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This article's discussion of all the supposed data "on the map" is actually not based <i>on</i> what's visible in the show itself. Instead, it's completely dependent on the more detailed versions of the map provided by EW, etc., which is not verifiable information <i>from the show</i>. When I look at the map that is actually visible in freeze frames from the show itself, I can't see 98% of what is in this article, and I don't believe anyone else can either. -- <a href="../../../p/k/t/User%7EPKtm_9f50.html" title="User:PKtm">PKtm</a> 04:58, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I wrote the original article based on only what was visible in the original image (first link in external links),which is from the show. The extra stuff like the formalae and the time line were written after the other image was found online, so look at the original image and compare with what I wrote originally, you'll see that there is at least a decent amount of info on it. A lot of it also has to do with where the map is, and how it was found in the episode. <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentiumOutlaw_e661.html" title="User:ArgentiumOutlaw">ArgentiumOutlaw</a> 13:04, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The reason that the article is up for deletion is because people say it has a lot of speculation. Either way, I think that this diagram is far more important than any other visual we've seen in the show yet (yes, its more important than the records), this map basically changes everything for the survivors, it offers the beginning of some explanation as to why they are where they are, and possibly where they are (much more so than the mysterious and rather vague dharma orientation video). <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentiumOutlaw_e661.html" title="User:ArgentiumOutlaw">ArgentiumOutlaw</a> 22:04, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

The image appeared for a brief split-second in one episode, was seen by only one character and has had no impact on the story (yet.) A section about the "map" already exists at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dharma_Initiative_283c.html" title="The Dharma Initiative">The Dharma Initiative</a>, and a very limited amount of this material may be included there, minus the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Original Research</a> "analysis"-- unless such analysis can be cited to an external published source (not <a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_Not_a_Fansite_9ee8.html" title="User talk:Leflyman/Not a Fansite">merely a fan site</a>!) I'm to understand that <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> magazine ran an article on the map, which can serve as one, limited source. HOWEVER: the map is clearly intended by the writing staff to provide water-cooler speculation, thus extreme care should be taken when including it, as much of its scribblings may merely be fan-entertainment, and not appropriate to Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Rename</b> - Although the article admittedly started out as much fancruft (which is when it'd been listed AfD), it has since grown significantly past that. The information contained in it now is from the show or from the citable source of the EW article (which analysed and translated much of the map). Also from previews, the map will figure prominantly in next week's episode so much of the information here will likely be verified by that, and it would be a pain to then recreate all of it after a deletion. However, the article should certainly be renamed as the current name is both non-distinct (what does "ultraviolet map" even mean?) and incorrect (it's blacklight, not ultraviolet). <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 13:08, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
