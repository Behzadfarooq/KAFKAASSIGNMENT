<ul>
<li><font color="#7FFFD4">Yes. It lacks anything that would make it suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia. An encyclopedia, as is noted in the link above, is not an indiscriminate collection of information, and when people search for a topic within one, they are searching for encyclopedic things that fall within that topic. Someone who searches the Wikipedia database for beaches is looking for <i>encyclopedic</i> beaches, not a list of every beach that exists. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 03:16, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</font>
<ul>
<li><font color="#7FFFD4">So before I look for a beach or a village in wikipedia, I have to first decide if it's encyclopedic or not? But how would I know? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 10:47, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</font>
<ul>
<li><font color="#7FFFD4">If it was possible to have easy rules that could be applied without interpretation, we wouldn't need AFD; but a simple rule of thumb is that if you can't think of any reason why a given thing would be in an enyclopedia beyond the fact that it's real, then it probably <i>doesn't</i> belong in an encyclopedia. Indeed, as noted above, policy specifically bars the use of realness, on its own, as a justification for inclusion. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 14:43, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</font>

<ul>
<li><font color="#7FFFD4">No, Wikipedia takes money to provide people with <i>encyclopedic</i> knowledge. That's an important distinction. A website that collects any and all random trivia or geographical data, no matter how minor, is <i>not an encyclopedia</i>. I understand your urge to try and collect all human knowledge in a single place, and you're certainly free to start a website yourself (or, if you prefer, start an atlas) to collect all unencyclopedic knowledge and fill in the gaps. That is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">not</a>, however, Wikipedia's goal. We are making an encyclopedia, not a factbook. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 23:55, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</font>

<ul>
<li><font color="#7FFFD4">It does not. It takes money to provide people with an <i>encyclopedia</i>. Talk of the "sum of human knowledge" is purple prose, not policy. Our policy, in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, states that Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, and that simple truth is not enough to warrent inclusion; there are true facts that do not belong here, and articles about real things that require deletion. If you want to challenge that fundimental policy and argue that all true facts belong in an encyclopedia, then you should do so on the approprate talk pages, not here. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 21:18, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</font>

<ul>
<li><font color="#7FFFD4">Correct. Our goal is to create an encyclopedia. That goal is written on every page, and is the message at the heart of every one of our fundraisers; the fact that our founder may occasionally wax poetic at such events does not change our central nature. Everything that has gone into Wikipedia up until this point been devoted to the creation of an encyclopedia, and our most sacred trust is therefore to maintain encyclopedic standards. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 05:10, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</font>
<ul>
<li><font color="#7FFFD4">I see, the end justifies the means. But wikipedia relies on the assumption of good faith, if it doesn't act in good faith, how can it expect it from others? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 05:18, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</font>
<ul>
<li><font color="#7FFFD4">I don't understand your point. Wikipedia's first and foremost promise to everyone who contributes to it--both to regular editors and to donors--is that creating an encyclopedia. This promise is repeated on every page and outlined in careful detail on policy pages such as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>; it is the central guideline that unites everyone involved in the project. If you're asking whether that commitment to encyclopedic standards takes precidence, policywise, over our fundraising slogans, then the answer is can only be <i>yes.</i> It would be a poor repayment to our supporters if we abandoned our central goal at this late date. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 06:39, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</font>
<ul>
<li><font color="#7FFFD4">You'll implying to donors you'll give them a comprehensive encyclopedia, and at the same time throwing out information they would expect to find in it. That seems like a pretty poor repayment. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 15:00, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</font>
<ul>
<li><font color="#7FFFD4"><i><b>There!</b></i> You admit, then, that that maintaining encyclopedic standards is an essential part of building an encyclopedia, and that we are duty-bound to keep content to what people would expect to find within such a work? In that case, we're almost done. All your earlier arguments are moot; they come down to the question you just begged over what our encyclopedia is and what we have decided people can expect from it. Luckily, we don't need to try and scry this from obscure statements by Jimbo or random fundraising slogans; we have a well-known, authorative, and near-universally accepted policy at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. This policy states, quite clearly and without room for interpretation, that the fact that something is 100% true does not automatically make it encyclopedic. I understand your concerns that this conflicts with some of our fundraising slogans, but at the moment it is policy, and governs all of our decisions on encyclopedic worth. If you want to take issue with it, or with our fundraising, then the approprate place is on its talk page or the village pump, not here. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 20:40, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</font>
<ul>
<li><font color="#7FFFD4">It remains fact that you are denying people information they would hope to find in this encyclopedia, so your interpretation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> conflicts with the morality of taking their money. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 21:14, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</font>
<ul>
<li><font color="#7FFFD4">When Wikipedia takes money from people, it does not promise to fufill their every hope. Indeed, if their hopes are absurd or unreasonable, then they are doomed to be disappointed; and as Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, the only things that people can reasonably hope to find in it are encyclopedic things. Fufilling unreasonable hopes at the cost of disappointing the far larger number of people who have contributed to Wikipedia with the hope of creating an encyclopedic work is plainly not the right or moral thing to do. Therefore, if you want to argue that this page or that page belongs in Wikipedia, you can only do so on grounds of encyclopedic merit. If you wish, you could argue that all true things have encyclopedic merit, but since policy plainly states otherwise, you would have to start that debate by attempting to change policy. All of your other arguments are bunk; in the end, they come down to what belongs/should be/is expected in an encyclopedia, which is the one issue, in your endless circling, that you still have not addressed. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 02:09, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</font>

<li><font color="#7FFFD4">OK I'm confused, it seems like this would fit fine in an encyclopedia of West Seattle. I can reasonably expect to information on random colleges, cricket matches, Bible verses, Simpons episodes, pokemon characters, <i><a href="../../../s/l/a/Slate_magazine.html" title="Slate magazine">Slate</a></i> journalists, and uninhabited villages in an encyclopedia, but not a beach used for diving. Please explain why the beach is absurd while these other things are not. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 04:33, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</font>
<ul>
<li><font color="#7FFFD4">We know, both from policy and from the definition of an enyclopedia, that encyclopedic worth exists, and that it is ultimately the sole criteria for inclusion in an encyclopedia. We also know, from policy, that simple truth is not enough to establish it here. Therefore, each article must assert, in some form or another, the encyclopedic worth of its topic. Of course, for many topics it is beyond queston; almost everything you listed, for instance, affects people on a vast scale, one clear sign of encyclopedic worth by anyone's estimation. Bible verses, Simpson episodes, and yes, even Pokemon characters and Slate journalists each play a role in the lives of millions of people daily. I'm not so sure that <i>every</i> cricket match or uninhabited village is encyclopedic; but widely-broadcast or otherwise major matches affect people on a similarly wide scale, while uninhabited villages were once inhabited, and may have left a mark on many people while they existed. Of course, this is only one scale of encyclopedic worth, not the only scale; but presuming that they don't get it simply for existing, I can't think of any argument that would extend encyclopedic worth to beaches as a general class. Some beaches might be encyclopedic, to be sure, and some people below have argued that this specific one is among them; but the argument I think I am hearing from <i>you</i> simply claims that all true things are enyclopedic. That argument, if you mean it, should be directed towards changing Wikipedia policy as a whole, not towards individual AfDs. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 08:29, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</font>
<ul>
<li><font color="#7FFFD4">You're telling me that the encylopedic worth of a random Slate journalist or village is beyond question, but to even claim it for a notable geographic feature like a beach is absurd and unreasonable. Seems rather arbitrary and <i>ad hoc</i> to me, but obviously I am an absurd an unreasonable person like anyone else who would hope to be able to look up this up, I wonder how many we are. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 04:28, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</font>
<ul>
<li><font color="#7FFFD4">No, I'm telling you that claiming categorical encyclopedic worth for <i>all</i> beaches is unreasonable. Your typical river can have, along its length, hundreds or thousands of indistinguishable coves; a few miles of coastline can have countless more, with overlapping local names that come and go. Indeed, there are vast sections of coastline consisting of virtually nothing but such coves. Your average seaside tourist town will have dozens of major beaches and innumerable smaller ones, many known only to locals; any expensive beachfront home will naturally have its own private beach, often with its own name and a little wooden sign to distinguish it and keep out the neighbors. If you have an argument to make as to the encyclopedic worth of this individual beach, go ahead and make it; but comparing beaches such as the above to Slate journalists or once-inhabited villages is an insult to reputable journalists and departed villagers, respectively. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 10:34, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</font></li>

Thus, we are left with a choice between an article that does not discriminate between its subject and any other cove in the Seattle area, or an article built on original research. Neither is what Wikipedia is. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatusRoma_5ad4.html" title="User:NatusRoma">NatusRoma</a> 19:32, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</font></li>
