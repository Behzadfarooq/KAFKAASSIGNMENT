<li><b>Keep</b>, but I'm new and don't know how to express that in the proper way. It's not really a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory.html" title="Theory">theory</a>, but a fanciful concept to help in thinking about a controversial and scientifically difficult subject. Notable as a challenge to orthodoxy from an increasingly important author. Notable because quotable -- thousands will read or hear about the giant raccoon and not know what it means. (It's defined only once in the book, but referred to several times.) Better for them to find it here than to try to find it in a 301-page book that they have to own or borrow to read. At least as notable as many of the wonderful but obscure CD titles in the encyclopedia, or much of the way cool fantasy game stuff (which is also "fanciful," of course).

<li>Yes, good idea. I think we need to keep some sort of reference to the phrase, but I agree that it doesn't deserve its own article. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 15:09, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Once this has had its full time for comment, and assuming the trend to delete continues, the Raccoon should go to the article on the book, and I'll be glad to move it. Once there, it will be subject to twisting and distortion by those who see a commercial for whacko "creation science" in every Coulter word. While it's in its own article, it's hard for them to do that, since there aren't any "creation science" quotes to illegitimately tie it to. It's a fanciful/critical/controversial analogy of Darwinism, not a commercial for "creation science." Not a "political theory," either. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 17:27, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Possibly it could be merged with <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster_3e86.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monster">Flying Spaghetti Monster</a>, since it seems to be a broadly similar theory with some weird POV crap attached. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtw_80b7.html" title="User:Artw">Artw</a> 20:33, 3 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have a <b>serious question</b> about the above comment. The Raccoon quote is parsed and its meaning is carefully explained. It illustrates the position of an important author about the origins of life on earth. Yet people call it "POV." And dismiss it on that account. I'm new to Wikipedia, and I see quite a lot of "I don't agree with it, so it's POV." Isn't the notion of "POV" that the <b>editors</b> should keep their points of view out of the articles? And isn't the point of <i>that</i> that the points of view of the <b>people covered by the articles</b> get a fair and unbiased hearing? <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 23:37, 3 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Seriously, it's not her position about the origins of life on earth. It's a catchphrase she made up to ridicule others' opinions. There's a big difference. The main point, though, is that it doesn't seem to be a particular method of ridicule that's caught on, even with the creationist movement in general. It's worth a mention as part of the article on her book, but doesn't seem to have achieved any notoriety separate from it. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 00:42, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Seriously, stipulating all that you've said, what about <b>point of view</b>? <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 15:13, 4 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Personally, IMNSHO, I don't see POV as being relevant here. Clearly, POV is a problem with anything about this person, but on this particular issue, I think the only relevant argument is that it's a phrase that nobody's picked up on, that hasn't spread, and doesn't deserve an article. (I don't think any analogy to FSM holds up either.) <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 15:54, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> (even merging and redirecting would be too much).

That's pretty poor for an internet meme, which this "theory" is apparently designed to become.

<li><b>KEEP, for God's sake, KEEP!</b> The raccoon is a poor, dumb animal, whose usual claim to fame is being run over on the highways of America. Now that a giant one has a notable "theory," even if it's couched in terms of a fanciful free-verse epigram, and now that he has been credited by a noted author with being the source of the flatulence that is in turn the source of <b>all life on earth</b>, the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speciesism.html" title="Speciesism">speciesists</a> want to banish it from a free forum of ideas.
