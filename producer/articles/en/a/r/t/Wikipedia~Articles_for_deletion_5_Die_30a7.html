<li>The game sounds similar to <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahtzee.html" title="Yahtzee">Yahtzee</a>, but with heavy drinking involved. But delete, along with most of the other Dartmouth rubbish (possibly bring some of these articles together in one - culture of dartmouth college or something)

<li>We do have one. Case sensitivity. The article on <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liar%27s_dice.html" title="Liar's dice">Liar's dice</a> uses a small "d", as it should. I've corrected other links here.

<li>Keep. I routinely argue against deleting obscure topics because you never know when they'll be useful. Just because I don't know about the game or have a way to verify that it exists, doesn't mean that I won't be interested in the future. You never know what data might become useful. Imagine, for instance, that a future president comes out of Dartmouth and a debate breaks out about a game of 5 die, well, we'll have a place to turn for a reference.<a href="../../../p/c/w/User%7EPcw_09dd.html" title="User:Pcw">Pcw</a> 03:46, 21 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<li>Comment: I didn't reply to the same argument above, but we have to work with the world as it is, and not the world as it might be. We must cover what is notable now. This includes history, but not presumptions against the future. The task of an encyclopedia is not to record the world or capture reality in its pages. It is analytic in nature, and not journalistic. If something cannot be said <i>about it</i> as it functions in the wider web of knowledge, then nothing should be said about it at all. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:23, 21 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think people are missing an important point, which is that it seems to me that <i>the article on 5 Die is better written and clearer than the one on <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liar%27s_dice.html" title="Liar's dice">Liar's dice</a>.</i> Also, I think that the statement that it is played in "the bar room of Phi Delta Alpha fraternity in Hanover, New Hampshire" needs clarification. Is it really played in only <i>one fraternity?</i> Or is it widely popular in Dartmouth fraternity barrooms, or (perhaps) popular in some region and played in this fraternity because of influential members who are from that region? I'm thinking that this might be like saying that "<a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheepshead.html" title="Sheepshead">Sheepshead</a> was played in the common room of the University of Wisconsin Department of Zoology during the 1970s."

<li>Merge and redirect, in the following complicated way.It does not deserve an article of its own, just a brief description within <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liar%27s_dice.html" title="Liar's dice">Liar's dice</a> identifying it as a variant, popular at Dartmouth. But the article is better written than the current article on <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liar%27s_dice.html" title="Liar's dice">Liar's dice</a>. So. I won't do this myself, as I'm suffering mild Wikistress at the moment, but in the ideal world of my dreams the author of <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liar%27s_dice.html" title="Liar's dice">Liar's dice</a> or someone else would do this:</li>

<li>Add a section called "Variations" and include one or two paragraphs describing how 5 Die differs from <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liar%27s_dice.html" title="Liar's dice">Liar's dice</a> and noting whatever is known about where the variant is played.</li>
<li>Make 5 Die, 5 die and Five die redirects to <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liar%27s_dice.html" title="Liar's dice">Liar's dice</a>.</li>
<li>And add a one-sentence mention of the game and link to the 5 Die section of <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liar%27s_dice.html" title="Liar's dice">Liar's dice</a> from the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_College_efeb.html" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a> article, perhaps in a not-yet-existing section on Dartmouth's traditions, customs and culture.</li>
