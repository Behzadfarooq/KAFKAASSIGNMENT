<p>I submit that this person's middling past success as a political candidate and current aspirations do not rise to the level of encyclopedic, no matter who her father was.</p>
<p><s>Also, the link to her campagin page suggests to me that this is being set up for promotional purposes, and my first attempt to put this up there was removed, strongly suggesting someone knows I'm right</s>.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 04:28, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Checking the page's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barbara_Warner&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barbara_Warner&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a> it's evident that your statement that your "first attempt to put this up there was removed" is false. More likely there was a problem with your cache. Perhaps, in future, you should actually make sure that your accusations are correct before you make them?</p>
<p>I suggest you address the article on its own merits or lack thereof rather than attack editors and impugn their motives. My motivation for adding the article is that I read on a discussion board that she was running for the NDP nomination in Toronto Danforth (an important nomination as the riding is currently held by the NDP). Therefore, this makes her notable, at least for the moment (particularly as there are no other candidates for the nomination, at least none that I know of. Therefore: <b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b> -- There's nothing notable here.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is some disagreement on Wikipedia about how to handle politicians — some take the view that a person isn't notable unless and until they win, while others believe that balance requires permitting articles for every individual who stood as a candidate. In this case, however, the facts as we have them are:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Inasmuch as it's looking like the federal election is imminent, it hasn't actually been called yet, and by extension the byelection to replace <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Churley_71af.html" title="Marilyn Churley">Marilyn Churley</a> hasn't been called yet since it's conditional on the date of Churley's resignation.</li>
<li>Warner is the only declared candidate for the NDP nomination <i>to date</i>; this doesn't necessarily imply that she's guaranteed to be the NDP candidate on the byelection ballot, as the actual nomination meeting isn't going to happen until after the byelection is called, which also leaves time for other candidates to throw their hats in the ring.</li>
<li>Any number of things could happen between now and the election. Churley could change her mind; the whole thing could be postponed by some last-minute deal; etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Accordingly, I really don't see how this could be kept at the present time. <b>Delete</b>, albeit <b>without prejudice</b> against recreation if future events warrant. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 20:07, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Possible compromise: once she wins the nomination (as she almost certainly will), create a "candidates in by-elections" section on the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Democratic_Party_candidates%2C_2003_Ontario_provincial_election_6649.html" title="New Democratic Party candidates, 2003 Ontario provincial election">New Democratic Party candidates, 2003 Ontario provincial election</a> page, and move her bio there. If she wins the seat, return the bio to a separate page. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 22:39, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, also strong object to "unless wins" criteria. While there are certainly non notable candidates, there are also candidates who are notable even if they do not win. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStirling_Newberry_897e.html" title="User:Stirling Newberry">Stirling Newberry</a> 03:19, 19 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that there are nomination candidates who are notable prior to the nomination vote. But what is it about Barbara Warner that makes you think that she is notable? I'm not trying to be sarcastic, I am genuinely interested, especially in light of <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a>'s comments on the disagreement on Wikipedia about how to handle politicians. Most of the article as it stands now is about Marilyn Churley's federal candidacy and how she would have to resign her provincial seat once the federal writ was dropped. If Barbara Warner merits an article, then if I declared that I was seeking a major party nomination in my riding, would I also merit an article? <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 14:27, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

One editor on the talk page claims the subject is a top Cambridge entomologist, but the google search test <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%2B%22charles+morgan%22+%2Bentomologist+%2Bcambridge" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%2B%22charles+morgan%22+%2Bentomologist+%2Bcambridge" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> finds no such person; indeed searching for <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%2B%22charlie+morgan%22+%2Bentomologist" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%2B%22charlie+morgan%22+%2Bentomologist" rel="nofollow">Charlie Morgan entomologist</a> on Google only returns Wikipedia articles. The article's history shows that it was down for speedy deletion at one point. In any case, the article does not currently appear to be about the entomologist, even if he exists. I suspect a hoax, which will get propogated if it is not nipped in the bud.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. I do not think the basis for deletion given in the nomination and "per nom" vote is correct: it is emphatically not original research, on the assumption that the article isn't completely fabricated. Tregoweth gives no reason for deletion at all: either he is agreeing with the (incorrect) nomination or it is impossible to weigh this one remaining vote (for such it is) against the single keep, who actually gives good reasons for keeping it. There is the reference to non-encyclopedic in the nomination, but this is not given any backing either by the nominator or by the other deleters. Perhaps a better nomination and more persausive deletion arguments in a renomination are required. (Note that during the time I wrote this closure, some irrelevant comments were removed from the bottom of the debate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FClosing_logos_of_Hanna-Barbera&amp;diff=29419557&amp;oldid=29418952" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FClosing_logos_of_Hanna-Barbera&amp;diff=29419557&amp;oldid=29418952" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>.) -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 22:35, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not enclopedic. The article is too vague; there's no specific dish by this name. Should be broken up, with a stub or dab for the Diane Mott Davidson book, and then separate articles for specific dishes or types (e.g., flourless chocolate cake, <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molten_chocolate_cake.html" title="Molten chocolate cake">molten chocolate cake</a>).

<p>More evidence: I just pulled out two great cookbooks, <i>Joy of Cooking</i> and <i>Baking Illustrated</i>. The former is something of an encyclopedia of cooking, while the latter is a more recent but very thorough catalog of baking recipes. Neither has a listing for "Death by Chocolate." Both have listings for "flourless chocolate cake." <i>Joy</i> has a listing for "molten chocolate cake," while <i>BI</i> has a listing for "fallen chocolate cake." | Keithlaw 15:35, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I wrote the stub, so obviously I'm in favor of keeping it.

<li>My issue here is not that it's not a specific recipe - it's not even a specific type of dish. It's just a marketing term, and not a standardized or trademarked one at that. It can refer to a traditional cake, a layered cake, a flourless cake, a molten chocolate cake (which is more of a soufflé), ice cream, etc. Not to repeat myself, but I think this page should be deprecated to a dab that points to the book, the chain of stores, and to pages on specific dishes that might be called Death By Chocolate. (And incidentally, I couldn't agree less with your contention that you can't make a DBC dish at home. But that's not why I AfD'd it.) | Keithlaw 03:10, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I can see how you would come to that conclusion, but I don't feel it's the case. I don't have a dog in this fight: I'm just trying to insure the integrity of Wikipedia. This article came to my attention while I was following RfPP after the Freemasonry edit war, and I was quickly convinced that if the editorial board (all of whom post from IPs, not named accounts) was going to insist on having the article exactly the way they wanted, then it qualified as Vanity. You can do the same external research I did: a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22democracy+%26+nature%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22democracy+%26+nature%22" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> on the title shows that most of the top references appear to be just references to the journal's existance, or reprints of articles.

<li><b>Comment</b> First, it is the Editorial Board itself which formally requested the deletion of the page when it became clear that Wikipedia could not protect our page from vandalism. But to characterise the page of the journal as a ‘vanity page, not obviously notable’ is only revealing –to say the least--of the philistinism of the author of this comment. D&amp;N was an antisystemic Left journal and citations from other journals are bound to be few and sparse, as it is clear that the mainstream journals (as well as those of the reformist Left) which dominate the field do not bother to deal with anticapitalist journals, particularly today. Had he checked citations made with respect to other serious antisystemic theoretical journals like Anarchist Studies, for example, he would have found even fewer of them! Second, serious research on the significance of a journal obviously cannot be carried out through a Google search, which refers exclusively to electronic citations. Had your ‘researcher’ checked with the authentic Alternative Press Index (only in print form!) he would have seen dozens of citations of abstract reprints from Democracy &amp; Nature. Third, it is an obvious lie that the members of the Editorial Board insisted “on having the article exactly the way they wanted”. In fact, even though it was apparent that we faced a systematic attack by a single disgruntled ex-member of the journal we took on board several of the suggested changes, but clearly we could not accept a blatant distortion of historical facts that he insisted on imposing upon us for his own personal reasons, as a reading of the exchanges in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Democracy_%26_Nature" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Democracy_%26_Nature" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Democracy_%26_Nature</a> makes abundantly clear.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I dispute that journals of <i>any</i> type are <i>inherently</i> notable - many of them have pitifully small circulation, no academic credibility and they are often short-lived; many of them are vehicles for vanity, either of the editor or the contributors. Whether that is the case with this one I have yet to determine. It certainly looks as if this one may well be notable. Also, while the nomination might be in good faith there's plenty of evidence of bad faith in the edit history, so it might be hard to get to the objective truth. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 13:28, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I believe that the page should be kept as it is at the moment (with no separate sections for two members of the IAB) because information about a journal of such a scope is of an obvious encyclopaedic value. We should not permit a "disagreement" of a whole group of people with a single person (who hardly used arguments), to influence our judgement. D&amp;N was (and is, in its newest digital form and name) one of the last independent anti-systemic journals. We cannot base our opinion about it in google search, or even on the number of subscribers for that matter, but on the quantity and quality of the condributions and the significance of the contributors themselves!!! And since when an encyclopedia must select its entries on the basis of popularity? <s><a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimitri_f139.html" title="User:Dimitri">User:Dimitri</a> 18:57, 18 November 2005</s><small>This comment and vote were added by anonymous User:212.205.76.134</small></p>

If members of the editorial staff really did request deletion because they couldn't control the article content, that's idiotic on their part; but it doesn't make the journal less notable. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 18:13, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, seems notable enough. I don't think the total number of subscribers is significant with journals like this; it says more that a number of respectable academic libraries use their limited funds to buy it.

<li><b>weak keep</b> I don't buy that this journal is NN. Other reasons to delete include that it's the easy way to end an edit war between one or more apparent kooks, whereas keeping will consume admin time and effort for the forseeable future. Deletion for this reason doesn't sit well with me, nor do the hints of editorial board expectations of maintaining control over the content of article.

<li>Half a dozen or so? Are you interested in quantity over quality? It is obvious that the journal is important because of the quality its anti-systemic analysis. Whereas the reformist quantitative Left takes the existing SYSTEM of the internationalzed market economy for granted and would like to improve its functioning by putting a smiley or green face on it. The argument here is whether to keep the D&amp;N page as the EB has written. It is obvious that the comments to keep are emphatically and decisively in favor of the EB.

<li>See, it's like this. The world is full of small literay (and other) journals. Some are significant, others are not. Thus far, the proof of this journal's notability has been, to my reading, confined to arm-waving and argument by assertion, so I asked for some externally verifiable evidence in the form of discussions in recognised authorities which themselves recognise the merit of this journal. So, to be absolutely clear, I am quite happy to believe that this might have been a noteworthy journal, but as yet no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable evidence</a> has been cited to prove it.

<li><b>Comment</b>*It is clear that Just zis Guy, you know? has never seen in his life an antisystemic Left theoretical journal, otherwise he would not have asked for some “externally verifiable evidence in the form of discussions in recognised authorities”! Can he describe for our benefit which are these “recognised authrorities”, as fas as journals of the antisystemic Left is concerned? We referred him to the authoritative Index of Aleternative Press but did not pay any attention to it. Similarly, the fact that some of the most significant university libraries in the world are subsuscribers to the journal is of non importance to him. Furthermore, had he gone through the dozens of references in Google (which of course give only a glimpse of the real significance of the journal as they mention only electronic references) he would have discovered that it is a distortion of the truth what was mentioned above by SarekOfVulcan that “most of the top references appear to be just references to the journal's existance”. In fact, many refer to specific articles used by other scholars et al. This is why the journal has received and published so many contributions by important theorists in the Left, who would never have submitted an article to an obscure journal. I am also sure that most other journals hosted by Wikipedia do not satisfy any of the above criteria, not to mention his own criteria. If this is not a biased attitude, I wonder what the definition of bias is…(Member of the Editorial Board)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> If the administrators have done their homework they would conclude that D&amp;N is notable. Sherlock Hemlock of Vulcan, your claim above that because one address has a very similar DNS address as some other address allows you to doubt the existence of Tommy and by inference the two addresses are one and the same, is illogical. Sherlock Hemlock of Vulcan your ruminations are irrational and since, according to your presupposition that Vulcans can only be rational, your identity is placed into question. Your claim that similarity is identical is senseless.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should know that “identical” twins are not truly identical, even though they are cloned from the same fertilized egg. Next, since there are no things as aliens (Vulcans) you must be something other. So to identify your self with something that does not exist is a real misunderstanding of your self. Your ego ideal (Sarek) is unreal—-one of wholeness and total rationality. Your image is based on a misunderstanding and therefore, you cannot fit into an ever changing (rational-irrational) world. Identity exists only in the ideal world of mathematics, everything else is difference. Your fallacy consists of, if A is identical with B, then every property that A has B has and vice versa, but you state that A and B are very similar, and similarities are not identical, so you make a false assertion: I doubt Tommy is Tommy, or the person who signed Tommy is not Tommy. The seeming identity of the two addresses has frozen your mind. Loosen up so that you can become more genuine. <s>user:john5:32 (thankstaking day in america) 24 November 2005</s><small>This comment and vote left by anonymous User:67.84.97.153</small></p>

<dd>Comment. My claim that you may have never seen an antisystemic theoretical journal before was corroborated by the fact that you asked for “externally verifiable evidence in the form of discussions in recognised authorities”. THis was not therefore a personal attack but a very reasonable assumption and as such was read by any unbiased user. Everyone who has read a similar antisystemic journal in the past is aware of the fact that there are no independently recognised authorities for this type of journal and the only verification could come from the sources I mentioned, which once again, you ignored!(Member of the Editorial Board)

<li><b>Comment</b> This distortion of facts is really shameful. First, the reason that we objected the vandalism of a disgruntled ex member of the journal had nothing to do with the reference to Bookchin’s letter of resignation. As it was repeatedly stressed by members of the Editorial Board and the founder of D&amp;N himself (see D&amp;N discussion page), the reason we objected to this vandalism was that it added separate sections just for two members of the Advisory Board (Bookchin and Castoriadis) on the basis of the blatantly false assertion that “the main theoretical influences of the journal" were the work of these two writers. This, despite the fact that their articles and those of their supporters constituted only 12 percent of the total contributions published and that the programmatic aims of the journal, published in each issue, were clearly differentiated from their work! Second, Bookchin’s attitude was condemned by the entire Editorial Board <a href="http://www.democracynature.org/dn/vol3/editorial_response.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.democracynature.org/dn/vol3/editorial_response.htm" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, although it was not particularly surprising to us given that, in the past, he had repeatedly expressed his discontent to the Editorial Board for the fact that the Advisory Board included the names of other people (e.g. Chomsky) with whom he had political disagreements . It is clear that SarekOfVulcan uses here the well known old trick of relying on the fact that very few pople will bother to read the relevant exchanges before they draw their conclusions!(Member of the Editorial Board)</li>

Despite the fact that the proposal for deletion was made on November 18, 2005 (today is the 26th of November) no decision has yet been made. I wonder whether this is due to the fact that two administrators, who are obviously determined (for reasons known only to them) to have the page deleted have not yet managed to get a simple majority in favor of deletion. In fact, the consensus as expressed by the vast majority of users and administrators who took part in the discussion, voted in favor of keeping the page and only one other administrator supported the above mentioned administrators. This, even when all the "anonymous users" voted to "keep" were arbitrarily deleted with the insulting description used by one of the administrators as "dodgy sigs"--just because of their concern that new users did not read the Wikipedia guidelines about registration and/or get a user name!

Still, despite the fact that the proposal for the deletion of Democracy and Nature was made on 18 November, 10 days later the administrators have not yet decided anything on that, although the guidelines clearly state, "AfD is where Wikipedians decide whether problematic articles be deleted or kept. Items sent here usually wait five days or so while debates take place on whether the article should be deleted or not...the page is then kept, deleted etc." By the way, in the Parecon case the AfD was made by an anonymous user, whereas an administrator made the AfD in the Democracy and Nature case.

<li><b>Keep</b> Since "Just zis Guy" has personally attacked me, john, below (footnotes), as "anonymous" and again above as a "forger" of wikisigs, I take exception to his irresponsibility as I'm sure others do who have been labelled the same! Furthermore, as Kim points out below, just because we are new to Wikipedia does not mean we can be both attacked vituperatively and votes discounted as "Just zis Guy" would have it. The D&amp;N article is verifiable and presents an analysis that is sorely needed in today's neo-liberal propaganda. I vote to KEEP D&amp;N! User:john 15:20, 28 November 2005</li>

<li><strike><b>Comment</b>. If you check the history you'll find this article was created back in June and was originally about a musician for a band called "Point of No Return".

<dd>Yes, we only have notable people on lists like that but that's implicit because they are lists of people with entries in the encyclopedia and we only have notable people in the encyclopedia to begin with.

<dd>Yeah. See what you started? (giving Arniep a good, swift kick) It's stupid crap like this that makes being black on this website a real pain in the azz. I would suggest, however, that the list be categorized by field of achievement. (As it stands now, in this particular format, it's not terribly useful.) Then, if/when a particular category becomes clogged with names/overly long, it can be separated out into a stand-alone article/list, with only a category name and link to the list itself appearing in this rather catch-all list. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 11:49, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wrong, I don't particularly care about these lists, I care about fair play. Ciao Arniep 01:52, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I merely find it strangely coincidental that 3 people from the same ISP are all voting the same way on the same AfDs and doing nothing else. No one is taking it personally, we're just suspicious of such actions. I'd like to point out that generally I am opposed to lists like this on Wikipedia, but due to the questionable circumstances at which these arrived on AfD, I feel I must vote to keep. Keep it civil. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 01:54, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Btw, Antidote, I agree with most of the delete votes you have cast recently. I don't like overbroad lists or categories. So <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_African_Americans_735d.html" title="List of African Americans">List of African Americans</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Roman_Catholics_4309.html" title="List of Roman Catholics">List of Roman Catholics</a> are definitely no good. Well, neither is <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jews_2000.html" title="List of Jews">List of Jews</a> worth keeping. Actually, modify that: the catholics one is just a list of lists, no names are directly at the top, so I don't mind it. However, I find that a ethicity, religion or nationality followed by an occupation is sufficiently specific. So "List of &lt;Nation&gt;ish &lt;Foo&gt;ers" seems fine to me. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 23:18, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In the same way that you and I dislike broad lists, I dislike overly specific and redundant lists that could EASILY be made into categories. I just don't understand what is all the fuss with these Jewish lists; people are literally making new usernames to keep them on here. The deletion of these lists doesn't change much of anything in terms of listings, as there are literally dozens of others with the same people. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 00:13, 19 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is something weird about some of the reaction to the Jewish lists/categories. Sometimes you see "hysterical keep" reactions, with unfounded accusations of anti-semitism bandied about (for either keep or delete votes actually, oddly enough). So deleting List of Jewish basket-weavers might be "another Shoah", while the anon voter 65.9.143.76 above seems to insinuate that it's a racial slander to note that some Jews are bankers or lawyers.</dd>
<dd>That said, I <i>do</i> think that sometimes lists are better than categories, or at least slightly different. When I created <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_African_American_jurists_528f.html" title="List of African American jurists">List of African American jurists</a> today, I was careful to annotate each name with a helpful one-line description of the main accomplishments of each individual. Of course you can find out much more by reading their full article, but you can't get the one-line bios by looking at a category. Of course, my AA jurists are <i>very</i> partial right now—I just added a very minimal set of scholars and judges who came to mind. But if it is extended with similar annotations, I think it would be worth browsing through. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 02:08, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s>*<b>Keep</b> - law is a profession to which Jews have long made a particularly noteworthy contribution. Much of the legal system in many countries is strongly influenced by canon law, which in turn is strongly influenced by Jewish law. I'm not sure if the name is right, though - a jurist is "an expert in law, a legal writer" - not necessarily a practising lawyer, which I think is what this list was originally meant to cover. - <a href="../../../p/o/e/User%7EPoetlister_675f.html" title="User:Poetlister">Poetlister</a> 09:38, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</s></p>

<p>I'm afraid you are wrong. If there was a list of Jewish Hall of Famers or members of Congress then people would click for curiosity's sake. It also provides a resource into how one of America's religions are represented in sports and politics. Thus, it is also interesting to see what citites have large black populations. This is not a racist list and a list of mostly Jewish towns would not be an Anti-Semetic one. IT would be informative. theremight, however, be people who used these lists for the wrong purposes. But the point of Wikipedia is to inform not to try to prevent people from reacting one way or another. <b>Keep</b>12.77.28.183 02:12, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, the point is that these votes for deletion are not a fair measured way to delete things.

<li>That was not my intention. I am just saying people have are being very quick to delete Jewish people lists because they fear anti-semitism was the motivation for the their creation when it was not, so people are actually discriminating against Jewish people by deleting them not protecting them.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Call me Mr Picky, but this article is not actually a list of cars in The Simpsons, it is more like <i>The Simpsons (vehicles)</i>. Obviously I would like to see the massive over-coverage of fictional characters and artefacts substantially curtailed - I would suggest that an <i>encyclopaedia</i> has little reason to cover these things (though it would undoubtedly mention The Simpsons as a cultural influence), I am on record as advocating a separate space for fiction (which would also clean up AfD a lot).

<li><b>Keep or merge in relevant character or family article</b>. <b>Don't rename</b>. Both suggested alternatives break naming conventions. If it's a list it should be called "list of" and qualifiers should be used to disambiguate stuff with the same name, not to name subpages of some sort. That said. The Simpsons is an extremely popular show and the vehicles should be covered. A list is better than loads of vehicle stubs. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:21, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In addition to being a bunch of unimportant trivia, there is the question of whether such information is actually true.

<p>There is a separate article: List of vehicles in The Simpsons, so there is no need for that section. Besides, the information there is not true. None of the Yugos that were sold in the US were sedans or station wagons. I suggest that the main article be locked from editing by anonymous users.</p>

<p>This article is currently undergoing a POV dispute and I don't see any prospect of the issue ever being one which doesn't contain POV.

<li>With all due respect to the contributors of the list, this sort of thing is unmaintainable and of dubious value.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The criteria for the list, for "historical and legendary" virgins, is quite valid, and can be verified, especially for deities and those who have claimed to be virgins til their deathbed. This list should NOT have any living people however per <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> but define and enforce limits. I basically agree with Uncle G's comment just above Hateless's vote, but don't see why these would have to be separate lists rather than separate sections within one list. It might benefit from a move to something like "List of people notable for remaining virgins", but either way it needs a very clearly worded explanation at the top of what is and is not to be included, and editors willing to strictly enforce it. The talk page can be used to discuss any controversial ones before they're re-added. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 19:38, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I would absolutely support a Category:Fictional virgins, Category:Mythological virgins (though I can see some arguing over where to put <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> in <b>that</b> one!), and Category:People who were virgins until death under Category:Virgins, but I think the list is a bad idea for reasons stated earlier. I'll help transfer these to categories, though, if these do get deleted. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 20:09, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> In general, I agree that categories are better than lists. The specific categories might work (and for controversial ones like Jesus and Mary, there could be a special category for religious figures). My one concern here, however, would be the over-arching Category:Virgin. It would be harder to keep a close eye on, however. It would be easy for people to not see the standards of inclusion and start listing, for example, the articles for every child actor or otherwise famous child they can think of. With a list, people can't just add a person to it without going to the list itself and seeing any criteria for inclusion listed at the top. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup>
<ul>
<li>Yes, but anyone adding a category has to do it where people <b>who have the most knowledge about that person</b> are likely to be concentrated: their article! You're right, though, that Category:Religious virgins would be better than mythological, as it covers both cases. Good catch. Caetgory:Virgin should probably include folks who were notable for being virgin <i>at some point</i> (Elizabeth, Donna Edmondson, etc), and most spurious additions will be removed in their article. I think it's an inherently more maintainable system, and any <i>truly</i> spectacular cases can be mentioned in <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginity.html" title="Virginity">virginity</a> (as they already are, in fact). -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 02:39, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> a list of people real or mythical, reputed for being virgins, or widely known for being virgins would be good. They don't actually have to be virgins until death. For instance, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Elizabeth_I_d23c.html" title="Queen Elizabeth I">Queen Elizabeth I</a>, is called the <i>Virgin Queen</i> but she was not a "virgin". And <i>the Virgin Mary</i> is only known to be a Virgin through the birth of Jesus. After the birth, there is no attestation she remained virginal until death. Mythology is replete with <i>virgin births</i>, so those virgin mothers should be on such a list. Several big-name scientists are famous for being virgins. (and some for debauchery as well). There's also the <i>Virgin Playmate</i> <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donna_Edmondson_2ed7.html" title="Donna Edmondson">Donna Edmondson</a>, who is famous for being a virgin when she posed for Playboy. <a href="../../../1/3/2/User%7E132.205.45.148.html" title="User:132.205.45.148">132.205.45.148</a> 00:01, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - it's hopelessly POV and unverifiable. Without independent medical evidence, then it's <i>claims</i> of virginity (and, of course, there's the social pressure to claim virginity). In addition, it isn't clear what definition of virginity is used. And, looking at the talk page, the <i>inclusion</i> of Mary mother of Jesus will amount to endorsing a Catholic POV, while leaving her out will amount to endorsing an anti-Catholic POV. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 21:01, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The name could be changed to "List of people believed to be virgins" or "List of people claimed to have been virgins" or something similar. As for Mary, the easiest solution would be to list her, but put a note right after her name stating that some denominations believe this, and some don't. That covers all bases without supporting any one in particular. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 21:45, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>What's the point of a list of people who are "probably" virgins? Again, looking at the page history, there's some discussion of Britney Spears. She originally claimed to be "waiting for marriage" (despite the Fred Durst allegations, etc.) and then eventually said she wasn't. So when do you remove someone - when they stop talking about it, when they stop proclaiming their virginity? Is it really any of our business? We shouldn't be a gossip rag. As for "List of people claimed to have been virgins" - wasn't <i>everyone</i> a virgin at some point in time? <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 04:31, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know if this would actually work, I just thought it should be put out as a suggestion. I, for one, would probably support a proposal to not list contemporary figures like Britney Spears because their status can change so quickly. I'd support keeping it for historical (or at lease deceased) figures whose virginity was deemed notable enough to be included in some sort of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable source</a>, such as a biography. (And, as for everyone having been one, the list would be for people who died as virgins or were otherwise <i>notable</i> for having been virgins.)
<ul>
<li>Nae'blis is right to point out the risk of weasel words. In individual entries, it would therefore be important to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite sources</a> as the bullet points at the beginning of <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">WP:WEASEL</a> encourage. For the proposed change in the name of the article, I think that this would be a case where it's not weasely, just honest to acknowledge that we can't really <i>know</i> who has or hasn't lost their virginity. Like I said, there may be no good way to fix the problems with this list, but I think it best to at least try. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 10:17, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why not just have this as a list of people famous for reputedly being virginal? Mythological instances are easy, since the claim is in the myth (This would include Mary, mother of Jesus - as this is <i>Christian mythology</i>). While Queen Elizabeth I, is attested to not be a virgin, but is famous for being the <i>Virgin Queen</i>. This would also cover <i>Donna Edmondson</i> as she's famous for being the <i>Virgin Playmate</i>, though she is now a mother and thusly no longer a virgin. The reputation for being virginal is a better and more verifiable fact than the actuality of it. Though I would not consider that any young person be placed on the list (ie. Britney Spears) as most young people are virgins for a large portion of their youth. <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Dhalia_6de1.html" title="Black Dhalia">Black Dhalia</a> is a famous virgin because she was medically incapable of having sex... so there is the question about what to do with those medically incapable of sex... (and the definition of sex to use for virgin). 132.205.93.88 23:15, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because "famous" is a tricky criterion; because "reputedly" lowers the bar to anyone, living or dead, who has ever had a rumour published about them that xe is a virgin; and because this doesn't address the problem of living people. The three lists that I gave, in contrast, do not rely upon fame and rumour; and exclude living people. A list of virgins in religious mythology is verifiable by citing analyses of the mythology; and such virgins are not living people. A list of virgins in works of fiction is verifiable by citing analyses of the literature; and by definition such virgins are not living people. A list of historical figures who were virgins at the times of their deaths is verifiable by citing historical analyses; and again by definition such virgins are not living people. In all three cases, if there's a reliable source that is cited, the person is on the list. In no case do we worry about Hillary Duff or Britney Spears, and in no case do we have to argue about who is "famous" and what "reputedly" means. If you want to list <i>non-virgins</i> such as <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I of England</a>, then you are into the territory that should be covered by list of historical figures nicknamed "virgin", <i>not</i> by any sort of "list of virgins" at all. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:56, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

The statement "has traveled all over Lexington, Massachusetts" is a giveaway that this is a hoax/avnity articel. I might add that the subject's name is speeled differently in the title and in the lead sentence, which should not be the case. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:38, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Oh dear, now I'm going to sound like all those whiners trying to keep their favourite band/website/comic/evangelist. I'm not going to vote (bad form voting on your own page: of course you want it kept!).</p>
<p><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is not a problem (check the Google Groups Usenet archive going back as long as you want).</p>
<p>And I'm not claiming he's not notable for being mad, either. What I'm saying is that the particular form his mania has taken - which has involved making public complaints against public figures (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyn_Lewis_8e6f.html" title="Martyn Lewis">Martyn Lewis</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Snow_c163.html" title="Jon Snow">Jon Snow</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Major_5fd6.html" title="John Major">John Major</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Clarke_ab31.html" title="Kenneth Clarke">Kenneth Clarke</a>, the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> in general), the fact that he has issued at least one plaint against the British Government (how many poeple actually do that?), and especially the way in which he has documented all his alleged persecution on the website (<a href="http://www.five.org.uk/evidence/evidence.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.five.org.uk/evidence/evidence.htm" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>) is quite singular, and has also resulted in him getting much wider notice than your average nutter. Now, that level of notice may not be enough - so be it - but much of it is a matter of public record via the Usenet archives and even court records. So, notability problems, yes, I'll accept that, but if it was unverifiable I would not have put the page up in the first place (and the editors of h2g2 would not have passed <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A694523" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A694523" rel="nofollow">this</a> - yes, the same Just zis Guy, you know?).</p>
<p>Also, just Googling for Mike Corley will miss a lot of references. Most of the threads he starts use munged addresses (and titles) to avoid the <i>many</i> spam filters people use to try to get rid of him. A google on <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=MI5+%2Bpersecution" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=MI5+%2Bpersecution" rel="nofollow">MI5 +persecution</a> yields 36,500 hits and <i>all the top ones are Corley</i>, the archive shows plenty more as well. He has sued the British Government (plaint struck out), complained to the Broadcasting Standards Council and so on. His profile is considerably higher than you'd expect, due in part to a relentless 15-year campaign of spamming by email, fax and Usenet.</p>

<dd>I'll agree with a <b>redirect,</b> at first i thought maybe someone has vandalised the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonnet.html" title="Sonnet">sonnet</a> page, then realized that I had found the article under <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">new</a> pages, so it had to have been newly created and not just a total page blank/rewrite. In any case, both <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonet.html" title="Sonet">sonet</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonett.html" title="Sonett">sonett</a> already have pages... the former is a disambig, so i just added a line about a misspelled version of "sonnet," and the latter redirects to <a href="../../../s/a/a/Saab_Sonett_d9c8.html" title="Saab Sonett">Saab Sonett</a>. Should someone place a disambig type heading like <small><i>This is an article on an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">automobile</a>. For the poetic form "sonnet," click <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonnet.html" title="Sonnet">here</a></i></small>? I think it'd be helpful, following the same logic that double letter mixups are easy.

<p>I have proposed this for deletion because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The english is worthless</li>
<li>It tends to be advertising</li>
<li>It does not make a point, i.e. It is trying to say something without doing so</li>
<li>It does not link to anything</li>

<li>Googel shows only 5 hits on "Taylor Harris" + "Thunder Bay". Those hits suggest that there is at least one person by that name who lives in that area, but do not support any of the specific statements in the article. At the very least, one or more sources that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> the existance of this person must be cited. But beyoned that, the facts stated in the current version do not really seem to describe a notable person.

<p>There are several Taylor Harris in Thunder bay, you may not have found any information on him because his work goes largely unnoticed.</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> The content is very limited, and no sources are curetnly cited except for the stamp. I do not see any reason in the content presented for this to need a separate article.

<li><b>Keep</b>, no self-respecting encyclopedia would destroy its information about the founding of this fire brigade, and if merged it would lose the interwiki link to the Polish wikipedia.

<li>Complex vote elaborated below - currently <b>delete</b>. I'm in agreement with DES. I'm not convinced by the presence of the interwiki link; en.wikipedia is not compelled to arrange information the same way pl.wikipedia does, just as I don't expect pl.wikipedia to arrange their info the same way we do.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I believe the topic is quite interesting and the Polish wiki article (though also tagged for cleanup) explains it a tad better. Anyway, the Brigade seems both notable and encyclopedic, so I don't think we should delete it. Expanding it would be a better option and after the weekend I could do it myself (or at least translate the Polish wiki page).
