<li><b>DO NOT delete</b>. Dr. Sekhon is an Army Veteran running for Congress in California's District 2. This election is very important because Dr. Sekhon was the underdog in the Democratic primaries against Falzett, and now in the general election against Wally Herger. Also, as stated by the previous posting, he is the ONLY Sikh running for Congress in this upcoming election.

<li><b>DO NOT delete.</b> Dr. Sekhon is a Colonel in the United States Army Reserves. He is also the democratic candidate in the 2nd Congressional District of California. He is mentioned on the wikepedia page for Wally Herger and since Wikepedia serves as a site for people seeking information it only seems logical to include his information here so that voters can look him up and find information on him. I do not think that it is a controversial issue to include his bio and website info in this database. --User:Aks1015

<li>I am not campaigning. If your main argument in deleting this article is because it lacks media sources, then I was going to include additional cites and information.

<li>Well, I'm not the one who nominated it for deletion and I'm not the one who removed your external links, but both of those editors were correct in doing so. We have standards of quality and reliability for external links (you can see a general guideline <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">here</a>) and yours did not meet them. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 19:43, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, I am glad that you are not the editor that deleted the posting. I will say, however, that I am not the person that wrote that original bio on Arjinderpal. I know that your site's information is modifiable and I was interested in adding more information in order to make it meet the site's guidelines and standards.

<li><b>Delete</b>, for same rationale provided in my prior <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">prod</a> deletion. Users favoring keep don't appear familiar with precedents such as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a>. "Currently running for Congress" equates to me as "not in Congress." There are thousands of people running for Congressional seats, and most of them don't stand a significant chance of passing <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> until such time as they attain a seat. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information, after all. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 19:49, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I just tried to edit the article to conform to the guidelines by inserting more outside, third-party verifiable sources to lend credence to Mr. Sekhon's notability and expand upon the scope of his contributions and work outside of this election, but the page cannot be edited. What do those editors who are advocating deletion recommend to make the article more valuable and to save it from deletion? The discussion on candidates and elections, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Candidates_and_elections" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Candidates_and_elections" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] clearly indicates that the fact that a candidate has not yet been elected is not, in and of itself, grounds for deletion.--Khalil78 20:02, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with this last posting. I have several articles that talk about Mr. Sekhon's campaign as well as him being a community advocate, which would make his article safe from deletion. --Gtorresjr 20:05, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Khalil78, that is a <i>proposed</i> guideline. It has no particular relevance yet except as it applies to the established guidelines. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">This</a> is the currently accepted guideline for notability, and although it provides a link to the discussion it does not support the proposal. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 20:11, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Kafziel, according to the Notability Criteria as set forth in [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BIO" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BIO" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>], there are some alternative test that Dr. Sekhon's current article will meet. According to the Google Test layed out in [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Google_Test" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Google_Test" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>], Dr. Sekhon does appear on numerous "distinguishable hits." I can already predict your counter-argument in stating that such test is a <i>proposed</i> test and that there is no consensus on whether this google test is fully supported, I am working with the guidelines spelled out by Wikipedia. Thanks. --Gtorresjr 20:32, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, it's not even a <i>proposed</i> test. It's just an alternative way to check for your own information, and holds no weight in actual deletion discussions. Essentially, the reasoning is that you can buy your way into Google, but you can't buy your way into Wikipedia. See <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOGLE_1973.html" title="WP:GOOGLE">this page</a> for more information about search engine tests. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 20:38, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ok, I just went and checked. Only 541 Ghits, and it the top 40, not a single independent news source providing any article covering this candidtate. In my book, that causes this article to fail the ghit test, as well. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 20:38, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I just find it humorous that all five of you are placing so much emphasis on deleting this one particular article as if it contained false information. I am sure there are plenty of people now posting delete-worthy articles, however your attention is all invested in this one community leader. It is quite disturbing! --Gtorresjr 21:15, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Don't worry - I have plenty of attention to go around. It's just that for some reason when whitebread candidates get nominated for deletion (like Sekhon's former opponent Bill Falzett, who was nominated for deletion today as well), it doesn't take quite so much argument. For some reason, a million <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html#Meatpuppets" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">meatpuppets</a> don't come out of the woodwork for them. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 21:21, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Those that know and understand American Politics (which I am sure is discussed to some extent on this site), should know that once a person loses in his or her party's primary, that such person is no longer in the race and is not part of the General Election. Since Mr. Falzett is no longer in the race, this could be why people are not responding to Kafziel and Vectro's desire to delete Falzett's article. --Gtorresjr 21:53, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Gtorresjr, I would like to point out it takes very little effort to delete an article that is not notable. Even when people create multiple accounts so they can vote more than once, this is easily ignored due to the website's record keeping system. Do not think we are terribly inconvenienced by this article's passing. We still have time to weed out other innapropriate articles. Wikipedia has literally thousands of people watching it, so don't worry too much. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 21:38, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Are you implying that I voted more than once under different names? Just curious. I am sure you have the ability to run an IP check. --Gtorresjr 21:52, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>QUESTION</b> I found some articles that talk about Dr. Sekhon's campaign, and another one about his previous engagement in protecting religious rights. The article is no longer modifiable in order to include additional sources. What can be done?--Gtorresjr 21:54, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The article is quite editable. If you have <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to add, then please do so. <a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVectro_bf83.html" title="User:Vectro">Vectro</a> 22:04, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I definitely agree, there -- if you've got reliable sources or any other ways to fix up the article, now's the time. If you make dramatic changes, it may be worth taking a moment to note them here, in this discussion, so that other editors (myself included) can review the changes and see if their opinions are impacted.

<li><b>Keep</b> all articles about major-party candidates for Congress or other offices of that significance.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Jersey Devil; C&amp;E is not policy or even a guideline and it's not a good <i>proposed</i> guideline either, in my opinion. He's notable. Our only fear should be that candidates would use Wikipedia to promote their campaigns. However, major party Congressional candidates are not garage bands, and that's not why these articles get created. It's of historical interest to see who the major candidates were, regardless of who wins. That yields insight into the policital climate and dynamics of the day. We're not paper, and we can spare 1K for this. I am confident that some people in that region will still find this article of interest in a 100 years, as a small window into the local political past. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishboy_b83c.html" title="User:Fishboy">Fishboy</a> 10:25, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. We have many articles on candidates who do not currently hold political office.
