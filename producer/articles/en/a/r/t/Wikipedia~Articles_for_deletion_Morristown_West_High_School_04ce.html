<li><b>Delete</b> There is no claim of notability. The school has no notable alumni, no notable students, no athletic teams or clubs that have performed at a national level, no old age or anything else that might arguably confer notability. Nothing here distinguishes this school from 1000s of others. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 19:58, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sure, it may be just any other school but there are still 1500 kids that I'm sure don't want to think about their school being 'non-notable.'
<ul>
<li><i>"You are a unique individual, just like everyone else."</i> Everyone's school is special to them, that doesn't make it special to others.</li>
</ul>

<li>And many websites don't like being described as non-notable, nor do little garage bands, nor do many companies (and yes some companies with 1500 employees would fail <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>).
