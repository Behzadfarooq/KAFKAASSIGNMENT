<li><b>Rebuttal</b>: Everything above was posted to skew the voting and make people turn against me and bias their viewpoint of the nomination and the entry. It's a pretty sick tactic. It shows they care little about the actual strength of the entry; which should be the only thing considered. Since the "warnings" have been posted, some people have even said that they've voted <i>only</i> because of the alleged misconduct. Consequently, they and the people who are engaging in this witchhunt should be ashamed of themselves. They've done irreparable damage to their integrity and to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 01:27, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Editor's number of deletion nominations is not an indicator of bad faith simply because it bothers another editor.

<dd>You're right...I was a tad hasty in writing the comment and left off some stuff. Assuming that the information in the article is correct, I think that it's possible that Weaver is trying to turn LBU into a more reputable institution. His policies probably had a hand in student growth. Mind you, personally, I still think it's a diploma mill, but less because they sell diplomas and more because they don't really <i>educate</i> anyone. If he had as much to do with the rewriting of the minimum educational standards for Ohio Christian schools, that might qualify, along with his presiding over a pretty significant growth of the Gospel Music Network. All of those things together might be reasonably notable, <i>if true</i>. It's just occurred to me, however, that if someone wrote those kinds of things about someone Gastrich didn't like, he'd demand a "citation." We've seen that enough times. If Gastrich doesn't like or doesn't agree with the comments or information, he demands citations, yet posts most of his claims about his personal heroes without providing much in the way of proof. There are no citations for any of the claims about Weaver. I'm convinced. Dump it. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 02:14, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> per nom... because being the President of, what seems to be a notable non-accredited (fringe) school, I think would qualify one as notable. Although it looks as though it will be deleted, I may appeal this. So what if LOC doesn't have him as an author? I think it important to have articles on key officials of schools/school wannabes/scams alike. Either way, he seems notable enough. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 03:45, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If it is kept for that reason it should be merged with LBU. Afterall other than LBU's link at the bottom there are no sources. As for the place where he got 3 out of 4 of his non-LBU related degrees (Baptist Christian University is LBU), do a search for that school, "Eastern Baptist Institute." That will tell you something about this person. As for the Korean awards, ect. there are no sources. The claims about his church are uncited. Outside of the figures <i>LBU gives</i> we don't know how many people this guy is notable to. More importantly if LBU barely escaped its own deletion, why should its "President" who has 5 unaccredited degrees, unknown books/readers and uncited awards get his own. Yes, it is important to have some facts about the "President," but if this article is only to be a selling point for LBU/LBU related, relevant facts should be merged the rest <b>deleted.</b> ---Filler <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.200.116.5.html" title="User:207.200.116.5">207.200.116.5</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.200.116.5.html" title="User talk:207.200.116.5">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.200.116.5_8379.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.200.116.5">contribs</a>) 06:52, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</small>

This should strictly be business as usual, even though it does seem strange an editor would nominate so many christian articles. Maybe a hidden agenda? If an article's crap, then it should be deleted. Being an inclusionist, I will probably keep the most mundane article. However, the list of notable people list is like many others, &amp; should not be here. To do so would be obvious bias.
