<li><b>Comment</b> - as AaronS points out, this allusion is an attemp to promote a small set of bands as a revolutionary movement on par with the NWOBHM. Besides their questionable claim to notoriety, another issue is that the term "New Wave of American Heavy Metal" has been used before, many times, to refer to many different things. <a href="http://www.zondabooks.com/titles/nwoahm/" class="external text" title="http://www.zondabooks.com/titles/nwoahm/" rel="nofollow">Here</a>, for example, is a book by that title that seems to be about a much larger set of american bands. My point is, I would not consider this a neologism. Despite the nonexclusivity of these bands' claim to the label, if they are _now well-defined and well-known by this term (and I don't know if they are), the page should be kept. I would prefer an article stating that it is an allusion to the NWOBHM and that these(...) are some movements that have claimed the title. Maybe that's what we'll end up with eventually if we keep it. -<a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 06:22, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> - Thanks for your comment. That book seems to have been published last month, with a sales rank of 165,000 on Amazon.com. Such a recent press and such a small market (and arguably poor sales) suggest that it should not have much, if any, on the influence of such an article on Wikipedia. Furthermore, many of the bands that it lists are bands from other genres, namely <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrash_metal.html" title="Thrash metal">thrash metal</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speed_metal.html" title="Speed metal">speed metal</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore.html" title="Hardcore">hardcore</a>, <a href="../../../n/u/_/Nu_metal.html" title="Nu metal">nu metal</a>, and others. Hardcore and nu metal are arguable not subgenres of heavy metal. Some of the bands, like <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantera.html" title="Pantera">Pantera</a>, are hardly "new". In my experience as an avid metal fan (and resident of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, which is apparently the birthplace of the NWOAHM), I can say that, in my experience, this term is nonexistent. I first encountered it on Wikipedia. To me, that seems like a neologism.
<ul>
<li>Coincidentally, I'm also a sometimes-MA resident and a NWOBHM fan. I suspect you're right about the lack of cohesion and notability of this group of bands. I brought up the book only as an example, there are many other diverse uses on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22New+Wave+of+American+Heavy+Metal%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22New+Wave+of+American+Heavy+Metal%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google</a>, though I'm not saying that any of them warrent inclusion either. If the term is neogolism, it is one that has been frequently, and probably independently, rediscovered many times. <i>NWOBHM</i> is pretty easy to lampoon. -<a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 07:22, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To add my two cents to this. NWOAHM is a neoglism term used by verying fans of verying bands that originate from America. I have personally heard it used, most notably in my experience, by people from America, to promote any american band from any genre pertaining to metal in the media's eyes. It has only ever been used in my experience, with bands that the person using it likes. I can find no information from the world wide metal community about it being an actuall movement, at all. Most all the bands on that page are metalcore, and half of them arent even that new. The whole term is neoglism in my view, and the article easily warrents deletion. P.S. Nu Metal is a genre of Metal, with Metalcore's origination being elsewhere. Metalcore can be debated, and if such debates are going to be made on where genres belong, they should be made on the dicussion page of the article for that genre. ~~Leyasu</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I strongly oppose either redirecting or Transwikying this article. The point is that Wikipedia is strictly an encyclopedia, so there's no need for listing dictionary articles here (that's why we have Wiktionary) and then bothering with redirecting them. If we keep this practice, sooner or later all of Wiktionary would have to be contained in Wikipedia. Also, I doubt Transwikying this article is even possible since there's already [a more complete] article in Wiktionary. So I strongly recommend deleting this article. <a href="../../../a/u/c/User%7EAucaman_0f93.html" title="User:Aucaman">'''Aucaman'''</a> 05:29, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - their main claim of notoriety that I picked up on was this, <i>"their song “Everything and Nothing” placed 3rd in the Rock/Alternative Category of the Billboard World Song Writing Competition. A second song, “Saturnine” was a runner up."</i>. Now, I have just spent the last 20 minutes scouring google and billboard.com to try to find evidence to back this up. Whilst the World Songwriting Competition does exist, it gets a mere 3 relevant hits in google, none of which mentioned this band. So, what my suggestion is, is that they are telling the truth that they won this award, but that its a rather meaningless award.

<p>I'm creating the AfD page for User:130.240.217.169, who insists on speedy deletion, but that is not appropriate. His/her reasoning follows. I abstain from voting. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">Enochlau</a> 01:36, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Quoted from 130.240.217.169:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The given reason is: 1) Delete because this band does NOT conform to the Wikipedia guidelines on music groups. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:MUSIC" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:MUSIC" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:MUSIC</a>. This is a small demo band that does not fulfill any of the listed requirements for inclusion, and thus should not have any place here. 2) Delete because the pictures (excepting the album cover which is a complete fake) are used without permission, violating my copyrights. All the info here is wrong; this can be verified by going to the official website linked -- www.nasheim.se. This is a silly personal "Internet war" type thing, and Wikipedia should not serve as a playground. This should not be "wikified", this should not be "verified", this should be DELETED. It is 100% disinformation and does not even belong on Wikipedia in the first place. There is NOTHING to discuss here. DELETE.</dd>

<li>'<i>Comment</i> - I'd just like to clarify this bit. Most dictionary definitions can be expanded to make them in to encyclopaedic entries. If a term has <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22Amidships%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;start=820&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22Amidships%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;start=820&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">298,000 google hits</a>, 825 of them unique, then surely it can be expanded, right? I mean there's no dispute that it is a valid term in regular use, is there? I'd like to see the policy on this kind of thing. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 04:39, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The thing is that encyclopedias and dictionaries serve radically different purposes. An article on what a word means, its etymology, how it's used, and so forth, belongs in a dictionary and not an encyclopedia, regardless of length and quality. It becomes an encyclopedic topic when there's more to say about it than that: when it's gained cultural significance in some way, as the name of some notable entity, or as a concept that requires a detailed explanation, or whatever. Thinking about it, the only way I can see "amidships" becoming an encyclopedic topic would be as part of an article on nautical terminology - such as, for example, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glossary_of_nautical_terms.html" title="Glossary of nautical terms">Glossary of nautical terms</a>, which already has this term. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 14:34, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. I don't understand why it's up for AFD again seeing as it's been kept the previous times. Wikipedia has to include the bad with the good and while I disagree with Agamemnon2's statement about "eventual undoing" I think it's articles like this that make Wikipedia worthwhile. I don't recall seeing an article in Britannica devoted to people who don't like it. Just as long as this article retains NPOV, I'm all for it, even if I don't always agree with it. In fact, deleting this article would play into the hands of some of the critics who accuse Wikipedia of censoring any criticism about it. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 16:16, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

With critics like that, we're actually in a pretty good position (they just look - and they are! - unreasonable).

<li>Um. Are you suggesting that our <i>only</i> real reason for wanting to keep the article as-is is to stave off being criticized by criticizing ourselves first, and that it's only by being (at least to some extent) illogical and irrational, only by treating this article preferentially and being biased enough to deal differently with this article than we would with any other article, that we can possibly argue for this article's existence? That's nonsense, I'd argue the same for any Criticism article about a major subject that has had a large number of significant criticisms. We already <i>have</i> a page called <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriticisms_f20b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criticisms">Wikipedia:Criticisms</a>, which is a page for the purpose of Wikipedia editors to read over, discuss, and try to address relevant critiques of Wikipedia. The purpose of <i>this</i> article, on the other hand, is for our <i>readers</i>. Many people will no doubt be interested and fascinated to see some of the main criticisms of Wikipedia (and the significant responses)—all the more so, yes, because the page happens to be <i>on</i> Wikipedia, but even if it wasn't, the topic's significant enough that we shouldn't attack such a well-written article. We should do the same thing we do with any other article: try to improve it, fix its biases, bring it up to shape. Endless VfDs don't improve the article, they just lead to us spending more time arguing back and forth, back and forth, then actually working on the article itself (which is, in fact, the case with this article, from what I can see). -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:58, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm sick of seeing this thing, frankly. I disagree with this and all other pages titled <b>Criticism of X</b>; I would much rather like to see <b>Evaluations of X</b> or perhaps <b>Critical evaluations of X</b>. Doesn't anybody wonder why we don't have <b>Praise of X</b> or <b>Positive opinions on X</b> articles? Articles like these are ways to exile negative POVs to places where they can do less damage. That has some value, but it's still a poor compromise of our NPOV policy. Opposing viewpoints should be integrated, not separated. These articles attract huge amounts of unverifiable statements and irrelevant fluff as a result of their unquestioning titles.<br />
That said, I suppose this is just an issue of practicality that is not going to resolve any time soon. Until and if I can finally find the strength to rewrite this thing into <b>Evaluations of Wikipedia</b> and hope it's so great that nobody wants to undo it, I'll leave it alone. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 12:58, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

"Criticism" is a strongly negative term, regardless of what it can mean or ought to mean in a scholarly context. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 17:26, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The distinction doesn't run exactly like that, please stuff the scholarly context back in the <a href="../../../i/v/o/Ivory_tower.html" title="Ivory tower">closet</a>. "Criticism" and "critic" can be quite neutral, and with words like "bible", "literary", "movie", "theatre", or such in front of them, they are. "Literary criticism" is book reviewing, and "biblical criticism" is about analyzing the bible, not about pointing out weaknesses in it. But "Criticism <b>of</b> X" is negative regardless of context. "Criticism of the bible" <i>would</i> mean pointing out perceived weaknesses in the bible. Therefore, assuming nobody would want to coin a horror like "Wikipedian criticism", a neutral article would indeed need to be called something like "Critical evaluations of Wikipedia". <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 23:00, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>AFD is not the place for solving the problem with this article, since doing so doesn't involve <i>deletion</i> at all.

<p><a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> is exactly right. "Criticism of X" pages are inherently non-neutral, since they only present one side of a debate, contrary to our policy. They are a short route to perennial and unresolvable neutrality disputes. <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Christianity_2059.html" title="Criticism of Christianity">Criticism of Christianity</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Islam_00d9.html" title="Criticism of Islam">Criticism of Islam</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Mormonism_77f4.html" title="Criticism of Mormonism">Criticism of Mormonism</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_communism.html" title="Criticisms of communism">Criticisms of communism</a>, and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Hinduism_fedc.html" title="Criticism of Hinduism">Criticism of Hinduism</a> <i>all</i> sport neutrality disputes, <i>all</i> because either the scope of the article implies that the only discussion of the subject that exists is negative or the scope of the article inherently advocates the negative point of view. As I wrote at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Arguments_for_the_existence_of_Bigfoot_dce6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Arguments for the existence of Bigfoot">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Arguments for the existence of Bigfoot</a>, the way to resolve this problem is to have a single article that encompasses the <i>entire</i> debate, but this is not a matter for AFD, since <i>deletion</i> is not required in order to achieve this.

<dd>I agree with that last remark. Which is why I in fact have done this once already. Neither the talk page nor an RFC had any effect, and I strongly suspect nothing short of actually <i>going ahead with the rewrite</i> will. But that's only going to stick if you produce a brilliant article from the start, since otherwise people are going to say you're "acting unilaterally" and "against consensus", which in this case just means you're violating the status quo, and people don't like that. It's pretty hopeless, really. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 17:34, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree that "criticism of..." pages are inherently non-neutral. The way to make them neutral, obviously, is to list all the noteworthy criticisms (citing them all), and then to list noteworthy <i>rebuttals</i> to all of those criticisms where they exist (citing them all), and counter-rebuttals if <i>those</i> are noteworthy, etc. "Criticism of..." articles aren't just a place <i>for</i> criticism, they're a place <i>about</i> criticism—the history of criticism of communism, for example, or Christianity, would belong in those articles, not <i>just</i> the criticism itself. The fact that an article is too POVed currently does not mean that the topic is <i>inherently</i> POVed. In this case, all it means is that it's unusually <i>difficult</i> to get the article NPOV—though far from impossible, since many of the "Criticism of..." articles (including this one) <i>don't</i> have NPOV stickers on them. Separating Criticism into its own article is only a "POV fork" if (1) no criticism is mentioned as well on the article's main page, even where appropriate, and (2) no responses to criticism are allowed on the criticism page. Those two requirements may not be satisfied quite yet for some of the pages, but they certainly can be in the future. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 19:15, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That's a nice idea in theory (and I do not believe in "inherently non-neutral" articles either), but the point-counterpoint style is not a very good instance of NPOV either. I am not convinced that criticism of any topic (as opposed to critical evaluations, which is not quite the same thing) should be separated, when endorsement, encouragement or neutral reactions never get split off. In most cases the criticism of a topic is not interesting <i>in and of itself</i>, but in context of the topic. The present structure encourages articles of the form "<b>Topic</b>. X, Y and Z. Oh, but <b>Criticism of Topic</b>." "<b>Criticism of Topic</b>. X is bogus, Y is bogus, Z is bogus." It should be "<b>Topic</b>. X, but maybe X is bogus. Y, but maybe Y is bogus. Z, but maybe Z is bogus." The individual parts can get separate articles again, but it should be <i>unusual</i> and <i>undesirable</i> for (unqualified) criticism to be a topic in and of itself. It makes things unnecessarily hard and obscures the broad picture. It's an easy way to split up an article, but I'd argue it's a suboptimal one. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 19:42, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A number of the articles caught up in previous edit wars -- especially religious articles -- seemed to settle down after a "Criticism of..." section was created. (Examples: <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat_e41b.html" title="Criticism of Prem Rawat">Criticism of Prem Rawat</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology_controversy.html" title="Scientology controversy">Scientology controversy</a>.) The reasoning here seemed to satisfy both the proponents and opponents of the "critics" of these groups. Those who wanted to place negative information about the groups were generally content that they were able to keep their information and links in the spotlight, with prominent links to their article on the main page; meanwhile, supporters of the groups in question were largely free to add their own information to the main page while letting the critics have their say in the "criticism" article. --<a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModemac_38eb.html" title="User:Modemac">Modemac</a> 13:08, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't dispute that this will help stop edit wars for controversial topics. It is a compromise, a truce of sorts, a way to prevent you from having to face the harsh and complex demands of NPOV. Splitting up an article in an unbiased/pro part and a contra part is <i>not</i> neutral. Our job is <i>not</i> to keep editors con\tent, but to provide an integral story to our readers. Basically, NPOV is hard, tough noogies. Why not <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_George_W._Bush_9d5e.html" title="Criticism of George W. Bush">Criticism of George W. Bush</a>? Sure would cool some edit wars. No. That's <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a>'s modus operandi, not ours. By doing this we give up, saying "maybe NPOV is just impossible/not worth it".</dd>
<dd>And besides—we're talking <i>Wikipedia</i> here, not religion. Do we really think Wikipedia editors will be unable to exercise restraint when faced with criticism of "their" encyclopedia? I value us a little higher than that, really. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 01:32, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>And we have plenty of Bush supporters too, I wager. My comment was not directed at particular groups or individuals.

<li>Comment: That's a very good point. My understanding is that in order for a MU* community to have its own article it is required to influence society beyond its core group of users.

<li><b>Reply</b> And who exactly determines what's notable or has an influence on society? That's almost entirely a matter of opinion.

<li><s>Published books</s> (Okay, apparently I was mistaken about this - <i>Authors</i> are notable if they have published a book, books that are not well known should be included under the author's entry) and video games are generally notable as long as they are not self-published per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. The Schrödinger equation is notable because it is an important part of quantum mechanics. So notability is not wholly based on opinion, even if it cannot be precisely measured. And while notability can be contested in many cases, a site with just 4 Google hits and no mentions on third-party sources is simply too far below the radar to qualify. And since the discussion doesn't seem to be going anywhere, I guess that's all I have to say for now. -- Saikiri<a href="../../../s/a/i/User_talk%7ESaikiri_eb5a.html" title="User talk:Saikiri">~</a> 03:31, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>When since did Google become the arbiter for whether something is noteworthy or not? It's a search engine, not a device of divine definition on what's important or isn't. I think you just have too much time on your hands and some kind of issue with mucks or fandom. -<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERannXXV_d332.html" title="User:RannXXV">RannXXV</a> 04:37, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I promised to quit, but you have a good point there, so there is still room for further discussion. What other verifiable, third-party sources can you recommend to establish importance? Any mentions in gaming magazines? Reputable publications? Newspapers? Journals? (Right now the hard data that I have is 4 Google hits and 12 members on your LiveJournal, which isn't really much to go by...) Anyway, I don't have anything against MU* in general, only against articles (on <i>any</i> subject) which are of no importance except to their creator and a close circle of associates - non-notable. -- Saikiri<a href="../../../s/a/i/User_talk%7ESaikiri_eb5a.html" title="User talk:Saikiri">~</a> 05:30, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Alright, let's take a look at your latest definition of what is and isn't notable. By that, about half of the webcomics on the list of webcomics should be deleted, since they haven't appeared in any publications, have no livejournal communities at all, and you have no knowledge of their readership, and it could thus be assumed to be only a "close circle of associates" reading it. In fact, any game, book, or publication without a large web presence and vocal userbase could by these criterias be assumed to be "non-notable" by assuming it is only produced for and enjoyed by a small number of people. You have absolutely no idea of the number of players we have, how many have been invited, and so on. Your only contention that it is for a small number, IE, "a close circle of associates", is purely your assumption. Whether it is so or not is not the point... we could have several hundred users and only a dozen who care to use the LJ, or we could have thirteen, but for you to assume the latter because it suits your ends shows that your take on this does have some manner of bias. -<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERannXXV_d332.html" title="User:RannXXV">RannXXV</a> 05:37, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I made no such statement. I stated that we could. Information about players is private, including the number of them.

<li>What do you recommend I do? Your MUCK has not been featured in <i>any</i> reputable media that I know of, all I have are the Google results and LiveJournal entries to go by. If I have made an assumption, then I think it was a reasonable one. You can prove me wrong at anytime, of course. This is the problem with non-notable subjects - they are so obscure and invisible to the public eye that there is no way of getting any verifiable, objective facts about them. -- Saikiri<a href="../../../s/a/i/User_talk%7ESaikiri_eb5a.html" title="User talk:Saikiri">~</a> 06:15, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Not Delete</b>, In the FAQs, the purpose of Wikipedia is described as “creating a new kind of Encyclopedia that is comprehensive and free for anyone to consult.” So if the underlying concept beneath this site is indeed freedom of information, it shouldn’t matter how accessible or obscure that information is -- it’s there for the having and enjoying even if you don’t use it. That’s what freedom of information –is-. As far as being notable goes, I say that's a matter of pure opinion. After all, your average person probably won’t think Schrodinger’s wave theory is notable, but the Encyclopedia Britannica has an entry on it anyway.CodexArcana 01:50, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. MU*'s may not be as notable as more well-known subjects, there's no inherent harm in allowing articles as long as they're well-written. It's certainly no worse than having individual pages for episodes of various series such as we already have, and it's certainly better than the dozens of Spongebob Squarepants episodes documented on the site. At worst you have a situation where only those who know about it will read the article, at best you have people run across it, find it interesting, and try and join. Neither end of the spectrum is world-shattering, so let things ride for now and see what happens. <a href="../../../n/e/z/User%7ENezu_Chiza_7976.html" title="User:Nezu Chiza">Nezu Chiza</a> 02:58, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The article you cite here seems to refer almost specifically to pages about individual people. It could also be interpreted to be about individual projects of people, it's true. However, since the MU* is a shared environment, and various members of it have already expressed a desire at some point to add to it, it is likely to become more and more rounded as players add on various things about it, rather than it being simply a puff-piece about one individual's works, which seems to be what the vanity page refers to. It also refers to advertising, which hardly applies here, since it's a private mu* and thus advertising would somewhat defeat the purpose. -<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERannXXV_d332.html" title="User:RannXXV">RannXXV</a> 05:43, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I would dearly love to vote keep on this one, just for encouragement value. These guys are working really hard to produce what will be some really cool games. I haven't played theirs, but I have played others produced by other people out there. This stuff is hard to find. A flash RPG? I actually have bookmarked a site called Game Garage that is full of wonderful little flash games. Beautiful stuff. All free. And I kick back and play the games every so often and its a wonderful way to spend an hour or two. These guys are great. Whilst they don't strictly meet the criteria for being kept on wikipedia, and hence I can't vote keep, it is a pity.

<li><b>Comment</b> - just as a comment here - In the <a href="../../../d/i/x/Dixie_%28song%29.html" title="Dixie (song)">Dixie (song)</a> article, I found it quite hard to find the "Whistling Dixie" comment. Considering its widespread use, suggest a separate header within the Dixie song article to state this. At present, a redirect would point to <a href="../../../d/i/x/Dixie_%28song%29.html#Popularity" title="Dixie (song)">Dixie_(song)#Popularity</a>, and its right at the bottom of that that there is a tiny reference to "Whistling Dixie". If we are going to redirect, then that tiny little reference needs to be expanded a bit more, and given its own heading. Otherwise people who search for "whistling dixie" and then are redirected to the song won't have a clue how to find out information on what it is they were looking for. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 07:52, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Guideline 6 states, <i>"Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise extremely notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such."</i>. This is what we are arguing over here essentially. Given that the band itself isn't notable, but one of its members are. It seems that guideline 6 can be taken either as a "keep" or as a "redirect", so I think that we will have to use our own interpretation on that one. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 01:34, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't know much about any of these comics, but looking that the wp pages for the characters, it seems that for some of them, their religion is well established in the comics. For such characters, the comics themselves is a sufficient source (the whole series, no specific citation required). I do agree that many others, maybe exactly those whose WP articles don't reference the character being jewish, require sourcing (though possibly in the character's own page instead of the list). Nevertheless, the article itself is a good idea - and the list will be small and maintainable. As Zordrac mentions, there are other procedures to deal with articles that require verification. The history of the page shows a lot of interest in the topic, and indicates to me that the page will likely be improved, not just expanded. -<a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 05:54, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure. Although I thought this was the one "List of Jewish people" that struck me as basically silly(unlike the ones that have actually been deleted which at worst were overly specific) if there are similar lists for other groups it should stay. There apparently is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_black_superheroes.html" title="List of black superheroes">List of black superheroes</a>. Plus people who come to Wikipedia I think tend to be disproportionately dorky. (I am on the dorky side myself, though not about comics) Knowing which superhero was Jewish, African-American, gay, etc seems important to many dorky people. Cutting this list out might be slighting a group, I mean "the dorkish" not Jewish people, who have contributed a great deal to Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dd>We don't 'give out' sympathy to low standards articles as a reward for contributing. Knowing whether a superhero is black or not requires determining what colour the ink on the paper is, without need for any sources probably. Determining any of the things you mention, including Jewishness, requires proof beyond a Geocities page. We should not compromise our standards of verifiabily sourced articles for fear of a peculiar kind of offence of upsetting cartoon characters or those who like them. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 05:39, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well my statement was not entirely serious as should have been in least somewhat clear. Although I was thinking that as this might be interesting enough to users who would come here deletion might become a waste of time as someone would try to recreate a list like this in short order. Although looking it up that interest is rather more minor then I may have thought.<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;q=%22Jewish+superhero%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;q=%22Jewish+superhero%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> So essentially I'd actually lean to delete. However there are a few comic characters I know of where they did have them say they were Jewish, or Christian or Armenian or whatever, explicitly. Possibly if limited to those cases, with the comic and page number cited, that'd be acceptable.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<li>This is just about the only list of Jews that I'm actually tempted to vote "keep" on, as it's actually likely that Jewish identity is likely to be a signficant aspect of a superhero's character in a way that it's unlikely to be significant that a given baker or dentist is Jewish. I'm dubious, however, because the list as it stands contains a lot of doubtful claims (how can Superman be Jewish when he's not even human?).
<p>Instead of keeping this as it stands, why not move to something like Judaism in comics and write an <i>encyclopedia article</i> on the subject, making reference to only those characters who are actually explicitly and significantly Jewish, and doing so in prose instead of as a list? <i>That</i> would be a strong keep.

<li>I read the article, though it made my brain bleed. Encyclopedia articles should make it clear at the top what their subject is. This one doesn't. It's a random collection of unsourced "facts" and an huge, inexplicable picture of <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blazin%27_Squad_87df.html" title="Blazin' Squad">some guys</a> around a jeep. I don't see that it even is about the word "Blazin'", nor that that word is in any way worth a dictionary entry, nor that this is any kind of serious treatment of "where it was first being used." This article is a chain-yank, full of juvenile jokes, malapropisms and falsehoods. One might suspect it's really some kind of fan-love for <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blazin%27_Squad_87df.html" title="Blazin' Squad">Blazin' Squad</a> (whose picture, by the way, is a probable copyvio). <b>Scammin'</b>. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 15:08, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'll tell you this much - it sure as hell wasn't anything to do with the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blazin%27_Squad_87df.html" title="Blazin' Squad">Blazin' Squad</a>. Trust me, if you click on the picture, the caption reads that it was the first image to come up in a google search of the word "Blazin'". Nothing more. Also notice the acronym of the word - "BS". And, even further, if your monitor is set to 1600x1200, try clicking on Black Sabbath in the index; the first thing you see at the top of your screen is "BS", which is the acronym for Black Sabbath. There are a few hidden treats in there for the readers, making this article worth its while. Oh yeah, and I just read a little about the Blazin' Squad. I'm sorry, but that band must suck like most Rappers tend to - I'm a jazz guy.

<li>Not necessarily. But if Google doesn't return <i>any</i> hits for a term, it's probably a good indication that the subject in question does not belong on Wikipedia, which is first and foremost an encyclopedia. Take it as a guideline, one that lends credibility to the side that uses it effectively. In this case, it would be Herostratus. Plus you're forgetting that the Google argument is just secondary to the article itself: its just a collection of patent nonsense as pointed out above.

<li>Note that what failed the test was not the subject of the article, but the <i>source that the author is citing</i> for this article. I've searched the Library of Congress, and it, too, indicates that there are no books whatsoever by the author named. It is therefore a reasonable deduction that the article's author is citing a fake source. Since it's the only source that the author has cited, and searches certainly turn up no <i>other</i> sources (which is what it means for an article's <i>subject</i> to fail the Google test, by the way), the article is thus unverifiable. Anything for which there are no (real) sources cited in the article itself and for which no sources at all can be located after the fact is unverifiable. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:31, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've already responded to the nominator's criticisms. I'm sure the article is not a dictionary definition. Several people obviously agree with the nominator's point about the title of the article being a neologism, but deleting an article on the basis of its title alone is not acceptable, and the contents of the article describe Orlowski's criticisms of Wikipedia editors. Apart from anything else, a very strong justification for the contents of the article is that Orlowski's criticisms are spot on. I'm pretty sure Orlowski has some experience editing Wikipedia, and maybe he has even been through "Articles for Deletion" a few times. So many people lining up to try to delete this article, when a similar neologism, <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googlewashing.html" title="Googlewashing">Googlewashing</a>, also by Orlowski, but never subjected to deletion votes, seems to me to show how on target Orlowski's criticisms are. This vote for deletion is like one of those puffs of smoke coming out of Saddam's bunkers after the cruise missile has just flown in through the chimney. What people inside the Wikipedia "group" don't realise is that, by showing how the criticisms have hit home, and deleting the article, it is a kind of victory for the critics. I don't expect to win friends here on Wikipedia by saying so, but taking the up-front policy, refusing to censor criticism, and keeping the article here on Wikipedia, is in practice the best antidote to Orlowski's criticisms. For myself I also feel that the current "shocking" title is the best one, but if others have a better suggestion, please respond on the talk page of the article itself. Thank you to all participants in this discussion for sharing their views. DannyWilde 05:05, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The only argument I've seen about why this isn't a dictionary definition isn't that you wouldn't find a dictionary that would choose to cover this word. That's not exactly the point of the rule against dicdefs. You state that deleting an article on the basis of its title alone is not acceptable, but you fail to address the more salient point, which is that if it was under the non-neologistic title Andrew Orlowski's criticisms of Wikipedia would anyone see any reason for such an article separate from <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a> to exist in the first place? You are correct that the article describes Orlowski's criticisms of Wikipedia editors, including that they are "spotty teenagers", but we have a <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a> article already, where we can decide whether allegations that Wikipedia editors have acne are <i>significant</i> instances of that subject. As for the fact that <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googlewashing.html" title="Googlewashing">Googlewashing</a> has not been nominated for deletion yet and that supposedly proves bias, BS. There's a lot of outright vandalistic articles that fly under the radar for a long time before they get spotted. You're trying to argue that the same editors who are voting to delete Orlowski's neologism Wikifiddler and its associated existential fallacy must have seen <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googlewashing.html" title="Googlewashing">Googlewashing</a> and said "Oh, that's okay then!" thus proving a bias; the problem with this assumption is that if you actually looked at <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googlewashing.html" title="Googlewashing">Googlewashing</a> you must have seen that the article was created in two edits by a single person and that no one has ever edited the talk page; in short, there is precious little evidence that the people you're accusing even <i>knew of the page's existence</i>, let alone applying a double standard to it. The rest of your arguments amount to "If we don't allow Wikipedia to become a platform for Orlowski's insulting personal attacks on Wikipedia and its editors, it'll prove that Wikipedia is biased." Again, I say that's BS, and all the flimsy analogies about "this is somehow like a puff of smoke; there, I've proved my point!" won't change the actual facts, which is that Wikipedia is not obligated to keep articles on <i>any</i> journalist's neologisms invented to encapsulate a personal attack, not when those neologisms have failed to meet vital standards such as actual notability. The fate of this article should be the same as Internet Shell Shock -- deletion. To claim that we must keep it, because we are the target of the attack? <b>That</b> is the double standard. <i>Oh. And one last thing. When you notice that there's a debate going on which will decide whether an article will be deleted or not, and whether its content will be deleted or merged elsewhere?

I also oppose merger to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a> since that article focuses on criticisms of Wikipedia and this is more like an <i>attack</i>. (The contents of this article are a lot more specific than a general criticism. The attack also focuses more on Wikipedians rather than Wikipedia in general.)

<li>Maybe Attacks on Wikipedia could be construed to sound slightly POV, but it would be a better title than Wikifiddler.

<li>It looks like an expansion of this article into a broader article documenting various attacks on Wikipedia could create some controversy (for one thing, it is not within Wikipedia's interest to be circulating [otherwise dead] attacks on itself).

<li><b>Keep</b>. The term seems to be gaining currency, I've found it used in several places other than here and The Register.

<li><b>Delete</b> "Nitpicker" is a real word/slang there are already plenty of variations of the word, but this one looks to be a real stretch. So again delete per the discussion between myself and Harro5.<a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledgeOfSelf_7104.html" title="User:KnowledgeOfSelf"><font color="#151B8D">Knowledge</font><font color="#C11B17">Of</font><font color="#C11B17">Self</font></a> | <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledgeOfSelf_36c0.html" title="User talk:KnowledgeOfSelf"><font color="#461B7E">talk</font></a>. 06:35, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - the figurative use is covered at the bottom of <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitpicking.html" title="Nitpicking">Nitpicking</a>. I actually have heard the term used several times, and might have even used it. It is funny, but it is not a word (the word would be <i>nitpicking</i>, I'd guess), and I doubt it is popular enough to be noteable slang. It's at best a definition, and i don't see any potential to grow into an encylopedia article that belongs on wp. <b>Redirect</b> and merge with <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitpicking.html" title="Nitpicking">Nitpicking</a> at most. -<a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 07:00, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>DO NOT Delete!!</b> The humor is in itself a reason to keep nipickery up there. Possibly linked from "nitpicker" or the like. I would argue that the very questioning of why "nitpickery" should not be defined somewhere is committing an act of nitpickery. And no one, I repeat no one, wants to be accused of that. I rest my case.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - the previous unsigned post convinced me that it doesn't deserve transwikiing; its being written in dictionary definition form precludes its entry in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 04:57, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>WEEI is the number one rated radio station among adults ages 25-54 in Boston. The Big Show on WEEI is the number one rated show in the afternoon drive time slot among adults 25-54. WEEI has 463,000 listeners per week. Source: <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/articles/2005/05/03/winter_puts_a_slight_chill_in_weei_ratings/?rss_id=Boston+Globe+--+Sports+News" class="external text" title="http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/articles/2005/05/03/winter_puts_a_slight_chill_in_weei_ratings/?rss_id=Boston+Globe+--+Sports+News" rel="nofollow">"Winter puts a slight chill in WEEI ratings"</a>. The Whiner line is a popular feature on The Big Show.

Perhaps you meant the notability of the Whiner Line, which is a segment on The Big Show. This i cannot verify the notability of, other than to say that it is a segment on a notable show, and to relate that I know it to be a popular segment on the show from personal experience.

<li>I would say that a segment of a show, really by definition, should be noted as a segment of the article on the show. The show is notable enough for an article (per Alhutch's research), the segment enough for a redirect.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I noticed that the author doesn't realise that they can vote.

Other influential websites such as Marapets.com were added to Wikipedia, nominating this for deletion because of a lack of knowledge of an area of the internet is absurd."</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The entry needs someone with more expertise, but there are parasites/fungi/pathogens that affect the brain activity and behaviors of their hosts in order to facilitate their own reproduction. Rabies is a well-known example (aggression being an excellent way to transfer saliva from one host to another). Perhaps it should be a list/category containing articles on the pathogens that have this property.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I've taken some time over this one. Per my own personal beliefs, I would unequivocably vote keep on this one, since it is a valid and very interesting <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, which I enjoyed reading. However, it was not presented in an encyclopaedic way, and hence at a very minimum would need to be reworked to suit that. Secondly, whilst I might personally feel that it should be kept, this is about interpretation of Wikipedia policy, not my own personal feelings. Wikipedia policy suggests that a blog with an alexa ranking of 4,601,014 and only 373 google hits, 95 relevant, with no independent reviews of the site is not suitably notable for an encyclopaedia. Its not just that his philosophy has not been in the news - it hasn't been reviewed anywhere. Oh and let's not forget that most of the google hits were actually not about www.mind-ink.com at all - they were about something having "mind" and "ink" next to each other.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Sorry, was not trying to spam. I am a little new to wikipedia and just made some links in areas that are relevant. Did not know that was not allowed. Sorry if I violated the wikipedia TOS. This 'not-notable' objection coming up for Its Yoga posting that I put up seems strange to me. They are one of the oldest yoga studios in the USA, and have many itsyoga branded/owned studios around the world, are listed in both DMOZ and yahoo, and have the largest yoga studio in San Francisco. Their guru Larry Schultz is one of the most renowned yoga guru's in the USA. What is the measure of 'notable' for wikipedia? There are many single location yoga studios listed in wikipedia and I even recognize some of them their teachers were certified by Guru Larry. I suggest someone drop by the studio in san francisco and 'verify' they are notable. Or they can look at the website that is full of photos, videos, etc. Note their website is ranked #1 in Google for "Ashtang Yoga Teacher Training" and in the top 5 for "San Francisco Yoga." jtbobwaysf 17:56, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. My vote is biased since I originally created the article. I fail to see how Williams is not “notable.” He was tried, convicted, and executed for murder. As recent news stories tell us, he is 1 of only 1000 people to fit this description since the reinstatement of capital punishment in the United States. Further as the subject of Sister Helen’s new book, I believe the claim has been made that the State of Louisiana executed an innocent man in his case. (I was hoping that someone who actually read Sister Helen’s book would eventually put more detail about this claim in the article eventually.) With the ongoing debate in this county about capital punishment, IMO every person executed in this country is “notable” enough to receive an article. I have also recently created articles for <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonio_James_7c1a.html" title="Antonio James">Antonio James</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_A._Brown%2C_Jr._d803.html" title="John A.

<p>Was tempted to put this on speedy delete, but the article is well developed. However, there is no evidence for this band having any notability. Their is no evidence that they have won the "many awards" that the article claims they have done. Even if this was a notable band, the article could well be removed for being just fan cruft anyway.

<li>Do delete it if you wish. I was going to do so anyway at some point (though I admit I didn't think it would take thing long for this article to be found). If you check out the History of the article you'll see its just a lot mucking around between myself and some of the band member, though I do appreciated your comments on my writing abilities. The article (as well at the Michael Handscombe article) along with all the images can be deleted as they're more or less a waste of server space - I had some time on my hands so I made an article for a band I manage. Yes they're a bunch of kids (they actually have won awards and are pretty well known locally - awards also meaning local awards, they're not Grammy winners). Then again it could always be left there, I don't see the harm if its cleaned up and made more "serious" and informative than it is currently. But I nor the band really care if it is deleted, but obviously I'd rather it stay there. Hacmid 09:11, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>An interesting experiment, then, perhaps, but the whole ethos of Wikipedia is to create a useful and reliable encyclopedia - see <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_8268.html#Hoaxes" title="Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">Hoaxes</a>.

<p>NN Biography on a "teen critic." Google search of the name turns out 845 hits, of the name + "independent on sunday" turns up 85, and the name + "critic" turns up 36.

<li><b>Comment</b> Just want to point out that someone had tagged it for speedy at first, the author removed the tag, i reverted the removal, he removed it once again, and then i placed it here.

<li><b>Comment</b> Please vote only once. You have voted "Keep" now three times, and if someone looks quickly over the debate, it seems like there are twice as many keep votes as there really are because of it. Secondly, you are partially right: that is what it says in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. However, bear in mind that many people are published daily / weekly in a letters to the editor section, so not <i>every single person</i> who is published really deserves an entry. My friend's mom has had a letter of hers published in <i>People.</i> That doesn't mean she deserves an article here. Secondly, this does not "settle this dispute;" <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> settles the discussion. Thirdly, please sign your comments. Fourthly, now that I've said all that, I really don't know whether or not he was featured as a real contributing editor or if he was featured in some kind of smaller, bit-writing roll. I'mm keeping my vote delete based on the google results, but if someone can provide me with a source that he was <i>really</i> contributing to these newspapers - and in a relatively meaningful way - I'd be sure to change my vote. <a href="../../../j/f/g/User%7EJfg284_447f.html" title="User:Jfg284">jfg284</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/f/g/User_talk%7EJfg284_403e.html" title="User talk:Jfg284">you were saying?</a></sup> 20:12, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>If it's advertisement, it's poorly done. And I don't think it is - for one, the article doesn't use the HBDI lingo. For example, they don't refer to the four thinking styles with specific words ("analytical", "sequential", "interpersonal", "imaginative" in the article) - one of the main differences between the HBDI and other tests like it is that the HBDI doesn't categorize you in a list of set types. Where the MBTI tells me I'm an ENFP, the HBDI merely rates rates me in its four thinking style categories. And there's no pre-defined sum of the four ratings. If you're questioning the validity of having an article on the HBDI at all, I think that should be a clear yes. It's used by some pretty serious people, and I don't think it's a fluke. I work for one of the largest corporations in my country and was HBDI-tested as part of a managerial training programme. I would improve the article and link it to other articles on personality psychology and test systems. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcajou_a852.html" title="User:Carcajou">Carcajou</a> 15:02, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I've reinserted some critiques of the system, to get it closer to NPOV and be less of advertisment. I think it is notable for two reasons, 1) many people have been tested using the instrument, 2) it is one approach to an ongoing investigation into personalities and learning styles so it has historical significance. I agree the article needs more work.

<li><b>Comment</b> As the author, you need the article to establish that the band is notable, and have sources to back it up. That is the minimum grade an article is required to be considered encyclopedic.

<dd>After 31 October 2005 I am going to delete all forum software that has no wiki article. This page is for """common""" internet forum software. That is the only criteria that has been applied to this page so far. Not having a wiki-page signals a forum software as """uncommon""" to me. So unless the following situation happen: (a)someone presents a new criteria on what software should be listed, (b) someone presents a resonable argument as to why a software is common, (c) someone creates wikipages for all of the software. You can expect a weeding to be done of this page. I feel the extra forums present no use besides clutter to the page.</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Speedy delete</b> as an attempt to mis-use Wikipedia as a vehicle for personal attack, and as vandalism. The article itself describes an appellation that one person used to describe a computer bought by another person. This is on the border of attack page territory, since it is an indirect attack. However, the subsequent actions of the author of this article (68.81.39.182 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.81.39.182.html" title="User talk:68.81.39.182">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.81.39.182_0774.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.81.39.182">contribs</a>) — 68.83.162.143 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.83.162.143.html" title="User talk:68.83.162.143">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.83.162.143_0616.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.83.162.143">contribs</a>) is possibly one and the same person), including repeated blanking of this very discussion (see this page's history) <i>after</i> having been twice warned not to vandalize Wikipedia, convince me that this article is <i>also</i> vandalism. That and the use of <a href="../../../d/r/i/Image%7EDrill.jpg_0e21.html" title="Image:Drill.jpg">Image:Drill.jpg</a> as a supposed image of the person being attacked provide enough additional reason for this to qualify for being speedily deletable as a combination of both.</p>
<p>The fact that the article tells us that the term was coined <i>the day before yesterday</i> leads me to believe that there is no scope for an encyclopaedia article here, in any event. The authors' arguments below that the article is "helping potential buyers steer clear of this machine" and that to delete this would be "taking away knowledge they otherwise would [not] have had", coupled with the fact that the article is <i>already</i> grossly non-neutral, making bald recommendations as to what the best computer to buy is as it does, convinces me that writing a verifiable encyclopaedia article from the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a> that <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">does not contain original research</a> (i.e. "knowledge they otherwise would [not] have had") was simply not the intention here at all.</p>
<p>Despite all that, I looked to see if such a verifiable concept existed, anyway. I could find no sources saying that it does.</p>

<p>This is not a valid music genre, as it is a label used by bands as a form of promotion n an attempt to garner sales, rather than as a descriptive of the band's style. The music style is no different from standard black/folk metal, with the lyrics being the sole difference.

<p><b>Merge</b></p>
<p>Personally, i agree with whoever nominated this for deletion. The article however doesnt warrent deletion. Viking Metal is actually recognised as a form of metal, but however, is also not well defined. Celtic Metal and Vedic Metal sound both more like someone splitting hairs over the differences in Folk Metal, and as such should be merged together. Oriental Metal should be merged with the Symphonic Metal article, as much oriental theme is actually used by Symphonic Metal bands from Symphonic Subgenres. As such, i have added these Merging templates to all the corresponding pages, it is a bit of a maze however. So the sooner articles are deleted or merged, the better for all concerned. ~~Leyasu</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'd like someone to explain the value of this before I vote either way. It seems to be little more than a variation of Wikipedia's search engine. I'm hesitant to cast a vote yet because deleting this would appear to require the deletion of hundreds of related list articles. The question to ask is would someone actually USE this page? <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 16:25, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Abstain</b>. Both sides make good points, but unfortunately they cancel each other out for me. As a result I cannot support keeping this, yet at the same time I cannot support deleting it either. I still think Wikipedia's search engine renders this useless, and I personally find it far more efficient (and I rarely get the "out of order" message others claim always occurs) than this list. But both sides have failed to convince me one way or the other as to which way to vote. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 16:45, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I also would like further explanation on this before I vote. I do think the title and introduction seem 'dumb' because they do not clearly announce that it's a list of <i>notable</i> people by name. Obviously, a list of people (in general) by name is a silly idea. If the list is to be kept, the title and intro should be changed. <a href="../../../p/j/m/User%7EPJM_3604.html" title="User:PJM">PJM</a> 16:56, 4 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>_ _ As that was a comment rather than a vote, i risk a gratuitous remark in noting that while occasionally a rename is part of the best followup to a failed AfD nom, an AfD process is neither needed to justify a rename, nor empowered to mandate one name to the exclusion of the current name or others: renames are routine editing operations limited (i would guess) by the three rv rule and protection procedures, but not in general by any voting measure.</li>
<li>_ _ That being said, the LoPbN tree and Dabs may be the only cases in the main namespace where a single approach to so many pages is anywhere near necessary. And (in contrast to their contents, which deserve a common fmt) dab pages have a naming scheme so simple that there is almost no point in discussing it. IMO, changing one or more names in the tree rather than the nearly 700 would irresponsibly make a mess, and changing them all would in practice be irreversible except with a bot -- which would cripple our ordinary "checks and balances". I would therefore argue that a name change without a vote (but not a vote on AfD!) would be unreasonably aggressive editing.</li>
<li>_ _ <i>That</i> being said, i think brevity rather than explicit precision is the most important improvement that could be made, and e.g. that "by name" does a very poor job of capturing the difference between "... people by religion" and "... people by name"; "alphabetical" might be better. "Notable" has been discussed previously somewhere -- probably on the "Whole Tree" LoPbN talk subpage, in an immediately obviously named section. My recollection is that i found presuasive an arguement that "notable" would be redundant bcz other factors make it implicitly obvious; i would cite the statement that it's a list of bio <i>articles</i> as implying notability, since bio articles require notability. (It is less formal in the general case but IMO clear that notability of the topic is always a requirement, so BTW i don't consider LoPbN different from non-bio lists in that regard.)<br />

<dd>In recent months, I've witnessed a number of lists being questioned and called for deletion, usually on the basis that such lists serve no real purpose, and that the subject matter is so open-endedly broad that the list could (and will) stretch on forever, endlessy growing into a ridiculously lengthy and unwieldy article if left to follow its stated mission. (One good example is the recent brouhaha over "List of Sexual Slang" and "List of Sexual Slang terms", an article which has been deleted and locked up despite passing an AfD vote with the overwhelming vote being <i>"keep"</i>.) So, in keeping with what is apparently the generally accepted standard here, I nominate this "list of people" as being especially unencyclopedic, and collation of which constitutes original research. Who would come to Wikipedia specifically to consult such a list, and for what purpose? The subject is, again, so broad that it almost seems as if someone started it as a joke, to see how much of Wikipedia's bandwidth could be wasted. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 22:02, 3 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>_ _ You are utterly mistaken if you believe this list does not serve any purpose. Each and every encyclopaedia lists people who have entries in alphabetical order. Wikipedia has to do so by means of a separate list, as the articles are entitled <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Brown_5d07.html" title="James Brown">James Brown</a> rather than <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown%2C_James_5178.html" title="Brown, James">Brown, James</a>. Hundreds of new biographies and biographical stubs are added every week (maybe every day), so what we'd need is people who add all those new entries to this alphabetical list so that it completely reflects Wikipedia's scope.</dd>
<dd>_ _ Also, a list can <i>per definitionem</i> never be "original research". Compiling things is not research, and a list is a compilation, nothing more. You are free to question the usability of any list of course, but deleting <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_by_name.html" title="List of people by name">List of people by name</a> would be the same as ripping out from a book the pages that contain the Table of Contents or the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Index_%28publishing%29.html" title="Index (publishing)">Index</a>.<br />

<dl>
<dd>Needless to say, I disagree. Unlike, say, "Wisconsin", "Hilary Duff", or "Sodium Bicarbonate", this list is not something that exists independently outside of the person(s) who put it together. Deleting this list would NOT be analogous to ripping out an index or a table of contents from an encyclopedia, because there are more articles in this encyclopedia than just "People". The analogy would be more apt if this article was "List of Articles on Wikipedia".<br />

<dd>I've yet to see any argument that indicates how this is any different from the Search engine which IMO is much quicker if one wanted to find a name. Unless you're trying to say there are people who actually get up and decide they want to see whose names start with M. I'm not yet ready to vote delete yet because unlike some of the other lists, there has obviously been s*itloads of work put into this. But at the same time I still fail to see the point. Search engines have rendered traditional indexes obsolete, at least online.<br />

<dd>_ _ This sounds as if deletion were the default setting here at Wikipedia and one had to make a special effort (at justification) to <i>keep</i> something. What else could "I've yet to see any argument" and "I'm not yet ready [sic!] to vote delete" mean?</dd>
<dd>_ _ Yes, there are people (lots, I'd say) spending hours browsing through encyclopaedias without any particular thing which they want to look up. And yes of course, there are people who are interested in names in general, similar-sounding names, names with similar spellings etc. etc.</dd>
<dd>_ _ What search engine? Wikipedia's very own? The one which is out of order every other day "for performance reasons"? The one which gives you all kinds of results, but never complete ones and never in alphabetical order? The one whose results you cannot edit if you find a mistake? That one?</dd>

<dd>More than anything else, I'm trying to determine what the standards are for Lists around this place, and so far I've found that there are none. I've seen useful lists deleted while this one, king of the useless lists, remains intact and growing exponentially. I find it SO useless, in fact, that as a subject, this does not and cannot pass any of Wikipedia's most basic yardsticks for inclusion. How many times have we seen articles deleted because the band/company/whatever in question was deemed "not notable" because they didn't perform well in a Google search? Well, I guaran-damn-tee you that "List of People by name on Wikipedia" doesn't Google well, either, aside from pages generated by Wikipedia itself.<br />

<li><b>Addendum</b>. This appears to be nothing more than an overly-complicated <i>list of notable people</i>. Moreover, it looks like a working example of bureaucracy—that is, taking a fairly simple concept and making it as complex as possible.

<li>It is easy to point at complexity (which in this case actually is probably substantially greater than you realize, since you don't seek the credibility that would go with mentioning the fact that each parent page other than the root is one in a suite of at least three (and by now in most cases four) pages<i>, the rest being</i> outside the main namespace. What is much more difficult is to identify the <i>over</i>-complication that you imagine here. What makes that difficult is that to the difference between complexity and over-complexity is demonstrating the possibility of an <i>adequate</i> simpler approach. Complexities have been added in response to real problems that are not obvious to the casual user. One fine feature was jettisoned for over a year bcz it was a complication that got in the way until MediaWiki features caught up with LoPbN maintainers' designs. There are significant problems<b>,</b> not yet addressed by the nearly 700 main-space pages and 250-ish infrastructure pages<b>,</b> which are the reason for the first detailed proposal re LoPbN infrastructure in a long time, and by far the most, uh, complex one. I have it in preparation for consisderation via <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_people_by_name_c0e5.html" title="Talk:List of people by name">LoPbN talk</a>; if i'm mistaken about the armchair-quarterback nature of your criticism, watchlist that page &amp; give feedback.<br />

</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_4ca7.html" title="Category:People">Category:People</a> duplicates a few aspects of LoPbN, but it cannot presently substitute for LoPbN -- even tho the differences may become less important with enhancements to Cats, &amp; may then justify supplanting LoPbN. Important current differences:
<ol>
<li>LoPbN simply &amp; easily provides for multiple entries like "Twain, Mark" and "Clemens, Samuel"; AFAIK, Cats make them impossible. (Twain has a clearer need than many pseudonyms and alternate spellings: he is known under both names bcz he wrote different genres under one or the other.)</li>
<li>You can know the <i>article</i> title accurately enough to find it on LoPbN quickly, without being able to find it at all on Cats: if you don't know that lawyers are a species of jurist, or that "athlete" in Britain refers to a small species of what is called an "athlete" in the US. If you don't know both the nationality and occupation of the person you seek, you have to exhaustively search the People Cat-tree for all nationalities &amp;/or all occupations, which is impractiable.</li>
<li>_ _ From the top of the LoPbN root page, a new user can follow 2 no-brainer lks (via outline index) or (presently) at most three (via square index) to the page with the name, and one more to the screen-size section of the page.</li>
<li>_ _ From <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_4ca7.html" title="Category:People">Category:People</a>, i was surprised to find it was now a portal page, and waded down to the "Categories" box on the right halfway down, almost chose "By nationality" instead of "Category:People by nationality", and equally stupidly clicked U, bcz i'm so used to using the US-bio-stub tag. Don't count that click and the return one. 1 click. Read most of 18 sub-cats, starting with the Ws, then forward from the As, and on to the Os. 2 clicks. No authors or novelists, on to Ws. 3. Novelists, passing up humorists. 4. Hmm. Only 6 authors, i should back up &amp; try humorists. No, wait, those are sub-cats &amp; there are articles. List ends at F, backup? No, that's too wierd, there's got to be a way to find the rest of the alphabet; if not the bottom, maybe the top ... 5. (Ah, neat, there's been good work done on Cats-support.) That's just up to... R...back to top. 6. Bingo, Mark Twain, a Cat unto himself. 7. Bullet at the top with no letter; "Mark Twain" sounds good as a bio. 8. I like a man in a full beard.</li>
<li>_ _ Using Cats for another case, i tried <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georg_Ohm_c977.html" title="Georg Ohm">Georg Ohm</a>, being sure he was a physicist, and guessing probably German, maybe Austrian or Swiss, maybe Scandinavian. 6 clicks.
<ul>
<li>From Cat:People to bio:
<ul>
<li>Twain: (Nat'ty &amp; occ. known) 8 clicks (and a lot of scrolling &amp; scanning)</li>
<li>Ohm: (Occ. known; nat'ty vague) 6 clicks, the minimum, bcz i my first guess was right; otherwise add two for each wrong guess before succeeding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>From LoPbN to bio:
<ul>
<li>Twain (as good a break as LoPbn can get): 2 clicks via square, 3 via outline.</li>
<li>Constantine (a hand-picked worst case): 5 via square, 4 via outline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can add a name to LoPbN and go on about your business, leaving it to someone else to start the article. You have to create the bio page before you can add a Cat tag to it, and if you don't happen to take time to assert notability (or even tho you think you did, the first admin to look at it may disagree) its eligible for speedy. (I review a substantial fraction of the new LoPbN entries; if i or the originator comes up with 1 date and a word each of nationality and occupation notability, retention is likely, unless the data suggests vanity or unfounded promotion; this should be so, bcz a bad entry is not as bad as a bad article, and waiting for the bad article means having a better basis for recognizing non-notability.)</li>
<li>Even if the bio article already exists, a new user wanting to help make it accessible needs to learn that LoPbN or<a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_4ca7.html" title="Category:People">Category:People</a> exists. A Google search is not likely to take you to LoPbN (except if you search for a rd-lk'd name, with the name inverted and in quotes), bcz few pages lk to LoPbN and WP's article probably ranks higher), but it will never, AFAIK, take you to a Cat page. I doubt newcomers notice Cats -- unless they do so while editing the bottom of a page -- bcz the Cats are boxed off at the end. The first time you look at what-lks-here for a bio (that isn't swamped with inward lks), you'll spot LoPbN.</li>
<li>A new editor will easily find the right place to put a name on LoPbN. They probably will enter it wrong, especially since they don't grasp what the piping on the adjacent entries is for, and they don't preview, or give up without figuring out the pipe trick. But any editor with an hour's experience can fix the problem the new editor leaves behind. A new editor who knows that Cats exist still has to navigate the People tree to the depth of the appropriate Cat, to get the name of the Cat; fortunately second and subsequent Cats (not that rare) are likely to come at a discount, tho the new editor may not realize they should work back up via the "nationality" "ancestral line". They may not fail to pipe, despite the fact that there are no adjacent examples there to take the hint from: if they haven't seen Cats before in <i>other</i> bios, they almost surely won't get so far as to manage to add the Cat.</li>
<li>Oh, right one more: the expectation when Cats were introduced was that every descendant of Cat Person was either a person or a sub-Cat all of whose descendants....etc. That was expected to eventually obviated LoPbN, bcz you could search by eye for approximate names by just collecting all the articles in People and its descendants. As it is presently being used, such an automatically generated list of people would include articles about books by Twain &amp; apparent Dick and plenty of others. So your resulting list includes the fictional characters Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, and surely plenty of others.</li>

Would all of you who propose deletion or who "can see the point" or who are at least "sympathetic" also want to delete <i>all</i> lists of people or just this one root page?

<dl>
<dd>_ _ As to "Original Research,..." it should be clear that "original research" in our context means something entirely inapplicable to this list: OR is about information proposed for inclusion in spite of not yet having established itself any place in the marketplace of ideas; OR is less appropriate to an encyclopedia than is the controversial, bcz it is so far from being part of the body of human knowledge that almost no one knows of its controversial claim to become part of that body.<br />

<dd>_ _ As to "... Not Suitable, ...", that is to non-specific to make a focused response to. But as LoPbN's charter (at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Biography_9928.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography">Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography</a>, IIRC) implies in calling for it to be a list of bio articles, it is a navigation tool; by its alphabetical nature it is one tailored for use by those who have a rough idea of the name of the person but either lack the exact spelling of the title or an existing rdr, or the patience to keep trying wider and wider variations on that rough idea until they strike it lucky or decide we don't cover the person. Formal nav tools (lists, dabs, rdrs, &amp; Cats) are inherantly suitable to an encyclopedia, despite the unique value of our hyperlinks as often informal and even sheerly serendiptous ones.<br />

<dd>_ _ As to "...Redundant.", now there's some meat. I do anticipate a time when we really do have to weigh whether the LoPbN tree has a further purpose, but i consider it clear that it will be carrying its weight until such time as new users can go to <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_4ca7.html" title="Category:People">Category:People</a> and find not just a list of its sub-Cats and a few not yet sorted bios. To make LoPbN redundant, the Cat sub-system needs to be able to provide an alpha list of all the tens or hundreds of thousands of bios that are in Cats <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transitive_closure.html" title="Transitive closure"><i>descended</i></a> from <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_4ca7.html" title="Category:People">Category:People</a>. In theory that's a <a href="../../../s/m/o/SMOP_3e2d.html" title="SMOP">SMOP</a>, but in practice it's a big matter of scalability (just as this list is, despite casual assumptions to the contrary and the snide remarks based on them), and perhaps a big matter of server acquisition, and a matter of architecture in the sense that it is potentially best implemented with an eye to the whole worthwhile feature set of a more powerful Cat system. (E.g., i'd like to be able to get a list of people of a any of several given nationalities whose descent from <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_4ca7.html" title="Category:People">Category:People</a> is not solely via, say, entertainer and/or athlete Cats. Again, one thing delaying even plain descendant displays may be the challenge of guaranteeing that the Cat system remains (uh, i probably mean <i>becomes</i>) a <a href="../../../d/i/r/Directed_acyclic_graph.html" title="Directed acyclic graph">directed acyclic graph</a>.)<br />

<li>_ _ Jerzy, I appreciate you not only taking the time to write a lengthy and well-thought-out response, but also for not making the basis of your response simple outrage that someone would even nominate the article for deletion. I'm not sure that the Db-Dd precedent is much of a precedent, but it was interesting to read that I'm not the only person that would like to see the entire list of people jettisoned. I agree that this list is better served as a Category, but I guess I differ, in principle, that we should hold off on deleting this list until the Category system improves.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>_ _ If the precedent set by Db-Dd is really weighty enough to justify keeping this list, then the corollary would be that the precedent set by keeping this list would justify a multitude of other equally vague and sweeping lists, such as the ones I mentioned earlier. (Can List of Things be far behind?) My heresy is even greater than suspected, because I actually oppose Lists in general on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_by_name.html" title="List of people by name">List of people by name</a> sets a precedent that makes seemingly any list seem worthy, no matter how vast a topic and no matter how open-ended. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_recipes.html" title="List of recipes">List of recipes</a> has nothing preventing it from growing to ridiculous proportions, practically becoming a website unto itself. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>.

<dd>_ _ Your comments about the List being a helpful tool for people who sort-of know the name they seek but aren't sure of the spelling comes closest to changing my mind about the matter, but I must say it's certainly an elaborate means for helping the spelling-impaired. Perhaps Wikipedia will one day develop a Google-like 'smart search' that can query back with things like "did you mean Rudolph Valentino?"<br />

<li>first, to draw attention to the relevant previous discussion, and</li>
<li>second, to suggest there is danger of a dilemma between, on one hand, indecent burdens on voters of coming back over and over into the same arguement, and on the other, miscarriage (not of justice, i guess, but) of our process's intent when previous voters with pretty clearly predictable positions don't return to the fray. And in any case, i don't think keeping this list would be much of a precedent for keeping those you mention; i'll try to return to that idea in a addendum to this post if i fail to address it in response to points higher on the page.<br /></li>

<li>Regarding yr attention to LoPbN <i>as</i> a precedent (rather than precedents relevant <i>to</i> LoPbN): You suggest that if LoPbN is acceptable, so is a list for every trivium that exists or is proposed. I'm not sure why you think that, but i would argue that triviality is indeed a dimension, and that LoPbN (being about people) has the <i>least</i> trivial topic that can be imagined, since "man is the measure of all things" and our hallmark of "notability" means "eligibility to be noted <i>by people</i>". If that sounds extreme (and it <i>has</i> been argued on VfD that "[all] people are inherantly notable"!), plz bear in mind that this is not a list of all people, but of people notable enuf for a WP bio. (If there were WikiPeople and WikiIdentities and i guess WikiCorpses sister projects (or even IPDb, IIDb, &amp; ICDb), i would want our bios to interWiki-lk to those respective entries, but i see no sign of WP itself undertaking attention to n-n people other than statistically.)<br />

<li>_ _ It's well established that there are groups we can never fully enumerate, and it's true that this is an important criterion favoring use of a (somewhat self-maintaining) Cat instead of a list. However, this is not a list that exists for the sake of being a complete reference, as with e.g. lists of the rulers of a country. This is explicitly a navigation tool, and to the extent that it improves access to bios <i>at all</i>, it is succeeding in its primary task.<br /></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>_ _ It's also the case that it is regretably far behind the ideal of keeping up with the full complement of bios that we have. IMO reasons for this include the extent of ignorance and underappreciation of its role, and i hasten to add, the exquisite principle of many freely roaming eyes, which practically guarantee that many resources will be undervalued by most of the editors. My current focus is on usability e.g., for those adding names, making the process as self-explanatory as feasible, and for users of all kinds, making navigation within the list as intuitive and even unconscious as feasible -- the reason for the experimental format used on the pilot pages (<a href="../../../c/a/a/List_of_people_by_name%7E_Caa-Cal_2539.html" title="List of people by name: Caa-Cal">List of people by name: Caa-Cal</a> is probably the one pilot to view, if you're viewing only one) listed at <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_Argus_for_LoPbN_Templates_54bb.html#Pilot_pages" title="User:Jerzy/Argus for LoPbN Templates">User:Jerzy/Argus for LoPbN Templates#Pilot pages</a>. There may emerge a bot-master with a mission to, e.g., detect admissions and expulsions from the descendants of <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_4ca7.html" title="Category:People">Category:People</a>, which would be a giant-step toward "maintainability", and i might personally turn into that bot-master, tho not this month.<br /></dd>
<dd>_ _ Bottom line: poorly maintained, but far from unmaintanability.<br />

<li><i><b>Strong Merge, no delete</b></i> Although it might not be in Webster's, it does need to be somewhere so that when I tell someone to "google it", it should appear on the Boondocks(TV) page.

But more seriously, if Wikipedia has an article on "Wigger", the deletion of this article could possibly lead to a "Nigga Moment"! JJWoodyNYC 05:18, 9 December 2005 (UTC) P.S.

<li><i><b>Merge, no delete</b></i> This show addresses many social issues today.

<p><font size="0">This is not a valid music genre, as it is a label used by bands as a form of promotion (ie. we aren't black metal. We're PAGAN black metal) in an attempt to garner sales. The music style is no different from standard black metal or folk metal, with the lyrics being the sole difference. This, along with Battle metal (black metal with slightly different lyrics)and National Socialist Black Metal (black metal with yet another lyrical theme)should all be removed based on the aforementioned criteria. If, for some reason, someone truly believes this article is necessary, merge it and the others with the Black Metal page. 69.107.74.231 12:08, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</font></p>

<li>Why should an article be deleted about a true life musician. This is a way of portraying his life aswell as his company. Which, obviously doesn't have much exposure.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into school district or town if article is both below three sentances and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture when AFD is closed. This school, like all others, is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on it's own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use. This is the baseline consensus that I feel was reached at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 14:27, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Tough one. Is there any current article on "sexual subliminal messages in disney films?" If so, merge it. If not, maybe a clean up / move is in order. there are a TON of rumors regarding such stuff in disney films (snopes actually has a whole section of them <a href="http://snopes.com/disney/films/films.asp" class="external text" title="http://snopes.com/disney/films/films.asp" rel="nofollow">here</a>.) it's certainly a cultural phenomenon, from "S-E-X" in the Lion King to "Take off your clothes" in alladin to the "arroused priest" in the little mermaid to the "topless woman" in The Rescuers - that one was really <a href="http://snopes.com/disney/films/rescuers.htm" class="external text" title="http://snopes.com/disney/films/rescuers.htm" rel="nofollow">true</a> - this might deserve a place here.

<p>After improving the article to its present state (which isn't all that great, but a decided upgrade from the substub it was), I came to the conclusion that it should be deleted.

At the least, <b>rename and expand</b> the article to be about the local affiliate, otherwise <b>delete</b> the article and its redirect edy fink.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Characters who appeared in one episode of a TV show usually shouldn't have their own article on that basis alone. If that particular episode or character was especially notable, then yes, but there's no evidence of that here. If the character appeared in other media (also no evidence of that here) then add a section in the other article with perhaps a screenshot of that character's appearance in the episode. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirebug_c7d3.html" title="User:Firebug">Firebug</a> 04:41, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

After multiple readings, I still can't figure out what it is exactly; what I can know is that it's self-congratulatory and useless. <s><b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> 23:29, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</s>In light of revisions by 68.39.174.238, still <b>weak delete</b>, but not as strong as before. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> 23:17, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>KEEP---So what if it is only a "university football team?" For example, there is an entry on "Maine South High School." What makes that entry notable to anyone outside the city of Park Ridge? So, we've arbitrarily decided that a random suburb in the Chicago-land area is sufficient enough to garner interest, but what occurs at arguably the most known educational institution in the world isn't? Seems to me that perhaps some people's fire is fueled due to this being a "Harvard" team--and that isn't right. Sorry but it just isn't. As for non-verifiable? Well, let's go back to the same Maine South entry....its says that they have one of the top wrestling programs in the state. Now is that statement verifiable? I mean, what does one of the top in the state denote? B/c if that means being ranked, they aren't...and haven't been for a while. So perhaps it's a false statement. Or perhaps it's vanity---some measure of self promotion. But it's allowed. Well, so should this. Furthermore, there is no analogy to be drawn between an intramural team and a ping-pong table in someone's basement. Intramural teams in the past have garnered attention, obviously to different degrees, but still. Does anyone recall the attention given to the guys who named their team the "Fighting Whities"??? So, don't dismiss something just b/c its an intramural sport. This all being said, I think it's great that we are having a discussion.66.30.15.64 06:17, 5 December 2005 (UTC)AK</p>

<p>To an outside observer, law school intramural football may appear to be trivial if someone has never experienced the camaraderie of athletic competition in an intense and grueling academic setting. This misunderstanding on the parts of certain individuals is not the problem of the intramural participant nor the Wikipedia. Intramural football is it is, and has been for decades, an axis of student social scenes not just at Harvard Law but colleges, universities and graduate schools across America and the UK. Surely teams who embody the entire spirit of the great intramural tradition are notable, much like the 1985 Chicago Bears are notable for embodying a football attitude all its own. In addition, the fact that the a team has been around for only three years is not a sufficient condition for being non-notable. The Florida Marlins have two World Series titles, despite only being a team for 15 years. Are they less notable than the Houston Astros, who have no titles but have been a team for 40?

However, many things that are important parts of student life are not <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedic</a>, and in my opinion intramural football (why would you assume that I don't know anything about it and am not interested?) is one. There is a ping-pong table in the basement of one of the buildings in my academic department, and it is important to many of us, but it certainly does not merit an article in an encyclopedia. An article about an intramural league <i>might</i> be worth an entry, but one about a single team, however heartwarming, is not, except perhaps under rare circumstances.

A majority of people who have commented on this article favor keeping it.

Although many of the article's critics mock the subject of this entry because they have not personally heard of this group, nowhere does Wikipedia state that a topic must be famous in order to appear in the encyclopedia. What purpose would an encyclopedia serve if all of the articles in it only addressed widely known topics? A good encyclopedia should help its readers learn about obscure subjects as well as history�s headliners and legends.

<li><b>comment</b> Are you actually comparing a school which has existed for over 40 years and has thousands of pupils at any one time with this team?

<li>Just because EVERYONE hasn't heard of it, doesn't mean it's not notable. For example, there is an entry on wikipedia for Reggie Bush.

<li>It is generally extremely poor tactics to point to another article and say "they have an article, so we should too", since most of the other articles pointed to tend to be delete-able.

<li>The argument about Maine South is to point out that many of the arguments made by critics here concerning verifiability appear to be weak when an article like Maine South is approved. If the Maine South article is approved even though it is unverified as part of a general consensus then the general consensus is overbroad and compromises the Wikipedia requirement of veriability. As far as the high school being relevant to an intramural team, <b>you are confusing the subject matter with the type of article they both are and the two articles' verifiability</b>. The point is that there is <b>no meaningful distinction, under the Wikipedia rules, between the two articles in terms of verifiability and notability</b>. The argument that there is no similar subject matter as the D-Bag article on the Wikipedia is not a strong argument for deletion but rather a strong argument for its inclusion as an extention of knowledge previously ignored. And why are public schools notable in general? Are private ones notable as well? Baltodomer 01:42, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Observing what has gone on to this point, the concern appears to have shifted from verifiability to notability. In terms of notability, then, on first glance this appears to be a close call. However, several reasons lead me to believe that this article is noteworthy enough; that is, worth keeping as part of Wikipedia's encyclopedia. First, the topic of this article concerns a university, and a graduate school within the university, that is arguably the most famous university in the world. An article that provides insight into student life at such a university is likely noteworthy on some level. In regards to the law school, I can think off the top of my head of a famous book (One L) and movie (Paper Chase) dedicated to the topic of life at Harvard Law School. This is not to say that the students of Harvard Law are any more "special" or important tha anyone else; merely to say that the lives of these students are, objectively, more noteworthy to the general public vis a vis those of students at other universities/graduate schools. Secondly, the topic of intramural sports, obviously captured in this article, is one that is uniquely important in American society. An article on this topic (that I am assuming at this point is credible based on the corroboration, verification and strong defense from posters in the know) is likely noteworthy. To develop this point a bit further, intramural sports is a subject that is discussed and researched often in our society, and relevant to many of the debates that go on today, from encouraging a healthy lifestyle to issues of discrimination to the role of sports in the development of children. To expand on just one of these areas, the role of intramural sports in the context of gender discussions is undeniable: just think of Title IX- one of the oft-mentioned considerations in Title IX discussions is the participation in intramural sports among men and women and whether this should impact the allocation of resources. While this particular article does not delve into that particular subject with any depth, at a cursory glance, the fact that this is an all-boys team says something (on a side note, based on the picture, the diversity on this team is noteworthy based on what I know of how students associate at most academic institutions and elsewhere). Maybe I am stretching the point a bit, but i don't think it would be a stretch to say that an article that presents anecdotal evidence about one particular intramural team and its experiences may be useful (read: noteworthy) to someone's research on the subject of intramural athletics. The fact that this team is at Harvard, an institution that is world-reknowned, while also carrying a certain mystique, makes it all the more noteworthy. It is noteable, if nothing else, for what it does to stereotypes about what all Harvard Law School students are like. In light of Wikipedia's goals regarding breadth of subject matter, and providing something beyond what one could find in traditional dictionaries like the Enyclopedia Brittanica, I believe this article is noteworthy and should be <b>kept</b>. --24.61.4.185 01:48, 7 December 2005 (UTC) [SZA]</p>

<li><b>comment</b> re "the concern appears to have shifted from verifiability to notability" - As far as I am concerned, the issue of verifiability has not been dealt with. I have already commented on what the photo does for verifiability above, and beyond that photo, no other sources have been presented. I cannot find anything mentioning this team using google. If there are any external sources of information about this team, can someone please tell us where they are? I am also unconvinced as to why <i>this specific team</i> is notable (as oposed to the topic of intramural sport in general, or the value of describing a typical intramural team as part of covering that topic,) but if there were sources that would enable an article to be written about this team without using <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> or <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable information</a>, I would be far less concerned about the team's notability, in part because the fact that someone else had written something about them might imply some notability. -- <a href="../../../a/j/r/User%7EAJR_ccb2.html" title="User:AJR">AJR</a> | <a href="../../../a/j/r/User_talk%7EAJR_a5b7.html" title="User talk:AJR">Talk</a> 14:19, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Correct, it is not a vote. However, when the discussion is closed, the closing admin will count the number of commentors who have expressed an opinion on whether to keep or delete the article (and any other options, such as merging with another article,) and where there is a supermajority, the exact level depending on which admin happens to be doing the closure and on the strength of feeling expressed, it is taken as a rough consesus. See <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#Closure" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion#Closure</a>.

One thing I fail to understand -- and this may just show me for one of the unwashed -- is why anyone would be eager to delete an article like this. The best reason I can think of is scarcity, but I'm guessing that lack of storage space is not an acute problem for the Wikipedia. Another reason is that clutter offends the aesthetic sense of obsessive-compulsive types. I suppose, but as reasons go, that one leaves me underwhelmed. If the article contained false statements, that might render it objectionable, but as far as I can tell, the worst that can be said of this article is that it is frivolous (and I mean that in a good way!). <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles.Morse_4b60.html" title="User:Charles.Morse">User:Charles.Morse</a></li>

<p>Critics of this article assume there are inside jokes, making further conclusory statements about this article. <b>There is nothing in this article that is a "joke" insofar as it did not happen.</b> The standards for verifiability on the wikipedia seem to not be very strict. Much of what appears in mainstream articles have no citations as to specific assertions. See Main South High School. So don't get on your verifiability high horse just because you do not like the subject matter...be consistent. The critics of this article keep morphing their criticism, only to be batted down. First, it was vanity. Now nobody says its vanity. Then, the subject matter was accused of being overprivileged. That was shot down. Then it was both criticized and supported for being funny. Apparently to some, if its funny, it shouldn't be on the wikipedia. I can't find that rule either. Now its verifiability, and you are forced to apply a heavy handed standard to just this article.

<p>Now you're making different argument that the supporters of this article. <b>The comparison to Main South High School is meant to show the uneven nature of the Wikipedia's verifiability standard, not the notability argument.</b> Your argument also make the connection between how long an event/thing lasts and its notability. That's a logical fallacy. Consider the Kennedy assassination...very brief, but very notable. Both D-Bag Football and Maine South are notable, despite the difference in time elapsed. You're picturing a flag football team and a high school in your mind and you're saying they're different because they're different concepts.

<li>comment: I find it tragic that many of the posters who oppose this article use the tool of reason to assert their opinion -- yet these same posters immediatly react in such a immature, crass, and, frankly, unintelligent manner when their very arguments are taken to task. No one here is picking a fight: posters like Baltodomer are simply making direct and coherent arguments to defend this bit of on-line real estate and the ideas/knowledge therein. It is unfortunate that some who oppose this article must step to the line with such a colossal chip on their shoulder and such an overwhelming prejudice against the subject matter of the article: all because of the vacuous perceptions these posters have of the related institution and, apparently, those who attend. The errant post above epitomizes the key problem in this "discussion." Mareino should understand that there are many who can, with varying levels of accuracy, claim that their school is "even better" than HLS in any given rubric. Be it the weather, location, a specific program, a moot-court competition result, school size, etc., there are many ways that you can assert your legal education is/was inherently better than Harvard's. But here is the important part -- <b>THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS DISCUSSION</b>. The last post was simply levied to state that that Baltodomer's logically sound response to a criticism was a direct result of Baltodomer's "elite" education, an education that is not unique to Harvard or even so-called "elite" institutions. That is wonderful <b>Marenio</b>, but this page is about a Wikipedia article marked for deletion, not assaulting one who happens to use logic to swat down an argument. And it gets better... Mareino wants all to know that s/he and "many other Wikipedians" have the requisite knowledge to "understand the rule of law as it applies to privately-run organizations." That is, again, wonderful, but <i>this page is about a Wikipedia article marked for deletion</i>, not your knowledge of the law. I implore all future posters to adhere to the discussion at hand and refrain from the maligned reasoning that lead to the above invective. --140.247.205.92 01:34, 11 December 2005 (UTC)DGaston

<li>You're darn right this discussion has nothing to do about me or you. So stop dragging your prejudices into it. Would an article on an amateur sports team be in the Encyclopedia Britannica? No, so why should it be on Wiki? Explain that to me, stop talking about how you think that you're so much better than us. That's childish and irrelevant. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">Mareino</a> 02:10, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Poor form Mareino, poor form. Please carefully re-read my first reply to your initial comment, you may find cause to adjust your comments. For further enlightenment, read the bulk of this discussion ... there are several explicit reasons why your Britannica test fails terribly. And for the record, since YOU are the one who "went to an even better law school than [Harvard];" perhaps YOU should "stop talking about how you think that you're so much better than [students of that institution]" .... "That's childish and irrelevant"</li>

<p>Many references quoted in this article are nothing but hearsay and could be considered slanderous. The allegations are damaging the reputation of a successful chat room and its owner. The owner of the chatroom has personally denied the allegations, and since these "references" are nothing but rumors, speculations, allegations, and hearsay, this entry can hardly be considered as being wikipedia-worthy. 68.83.85.175 23:46, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> I don't really know how deletions work on wikipedia, not being a regular user but this article was pointed out to me by someone who used to know me on PoE as my sceen name is mentioned in the article. I do take exception to the allegations that involve me as they are untrue. <i>Xerya. one of the original founders, claimed to have seen logs on the talker listing people's names and addresses, in a similar way to Whisper's claims from 2 years earlier on Lo Riveiro.</i> In spite of the fact that I edited this in the main article to the truth that I have never claimed to have seen logs of the talker listing people's names and addresses, this allegation has returned. I never have and quite frankly, I wouldn't have been interested to. I definitely wasn't an original founder. One of the first users, yes. Founder, no. If there were allegations that I submitted the evidence that blackmail was happening, I must have done it in my sleep. I wasn't even aware of allegations of blackmail and I definitely did not submit any evidence. As for the questions of my loyalty - that is all mere speculation and as for the claim that Virus helped me with my suicide attempt - unless Virus is unbeknown to me, my mother, that is also untrue. I'm very disturbed that such lies can masquerade as fact and while I have invited the author of this article to actually find out truths on the discussion page instead of making up lies, no requests for truth have been forthcoming. I certainly do not enjoy being portrayed in this false light and I honestly did not know about any controversy over zoos, German police, blackmail, kiwi/virus etc. until I read the fiction on this page. If it happened, it happened without my participation. Also, the original AFD happened before I knew anything of this so I think it should be reconsidered as there are some blatant untruths in the article - not just about me but I only feel qualified to comment on the issues involving my name ~ Xerya</li>

<li>I second the deletion. How could anyone call a journal evidence of fact? The rumors and allegations do nothing but spread FUD. The original owners of the talkers involved were never aware of the article before the first AFD. Their voices were not heard until now, and the message is clear: stop slandering, stop spreading rumors, and stop using journals as "proof".66.101.11.58 00:34, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - I haven't looked into its merits myself, but the article was debated for deletion just two weeks ago: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2005_November_22_50b3.html#Planes_of_existence_.28chat_site.29" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2005 November 22">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2005_November_22#Planes_of_existence_.28chat_site.29</a> -<a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 00:49, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>delete - the article is full of inaccuracies that were not addressed in the first AFD. those who were targeted by the allegations had no idea of the article until after the first AFD had already been passed. in their defense, this should be given a fair second chance, and from what i've seen, it should be deleted because i agree that the references sited are simply hearsay and rumor.216.158.57.50 00:53, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Jesus</b>. Can we get an expert to come downstairs and sort this all out? Are there any <i>disinterested</i> persons who can understand what this is about? I'm not voting, but my thought is...

<li><b>Keep</b> - While this article has issues, if we are to keep the Crystal Palace page, this one needs to be kept as well.

<ul>
<li>I have been discussing this with a lot of people over the past few weeks, and especially with the objections/vandalism from the anon IPs, and have decided on some kind of a merge. I have nominated Mamnuts, Ncohafmuta, Lighthouse (chat site), Crossroads (chat site) and <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Palace_%28chat_site%29_1672.html" title="Crystal Palace (chat site)">Crystal Palace (chat site)</a> for deletion on the basis of being insufficiently notable, and the rest I am merging. Whilst I am not sure if its really good to keep them all in <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talker.html" title="Talker">talker</a>, I think that I could do it, and it might be easier to do that because then it puts things in to better perspective. As I am close to finishing writing all of the individual components of the articles (Foothills and Resort are the only 2 I haven't really finished), I think that a merge is quite plausible. I am happy to do that, as I have said all along. These talkers were notable within the talker community, and had some impact outside of the community. But since at the present moment in time, talkers themselves basically don't exist anymore, then having individual articles is probably a bit much. I apologise for this. However, the 5 main controversial elements, on each of Foothills, Surfers, lintilla, CP and PoE I am going to keep, because they are important issues that need to be included. Whilst I'd love to have independent sources for them, AFAIK they don't exist, so I will just try to present them as neutrally as possible. Its impossible to understand the history of talkers without referencing these issues. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 11:31, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As I created all of these articles other than <a href="../../../u/n/a/UNaXcess_984a.html" title="UNaXcess">UNaXcess</a> I have the ability to independently merge all of them in to one article, which I have done, in merging them all in to <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talker.html" title="Talker">talker</a>. Please have a look to see if you think that that looks okay. I have also speedy deleted Crossroads (chat site), Ncohafmuta and Lighthouse (chat site) on the basis of non-notoriety. I am unsure whether <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Palace_%28chat_site%29_1672.html" title="Crystal Palace (chat site)">Crystal Palace (chat site)</a> meets the criteria for speedy deletion. 4 days ago it would have, as I was the only editor, but since the recently created anon users/vandals have come, there may be a technicality preventing it. After consideration, I agree that having an article purely to talk about controversies is inappropriate. It clearly doesn't meet the criteria for inclusion (having 5,000 regular users) and hence can't be kept in its own right. As discussed, the only 3 that do meet that criteria are <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surfers_%28talker%29.html" title="Surfers (talker)">Surfers (talker)</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resort_%28talker%29.html" title="Resort (talker)">Resort (talker)</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foothills_%28talker%29.html" title="Foothills (talker)">Foothills (talker)</a>, no others. However, I have now merged them all in to talker anyway, just to make things easier. As I have included all relevant information in talker already, I am happy for this page to merely say REDIRECT <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talker.html" title="Talker">talker</a>. Again, there is a technicality that I may not have sole rights to do this, but since there has been 0 contributions from the other editors (only removing/disruption), I would suggest that it still counts, and that I can do a REDIRECT. I trust that this would remove any controversies. Please have a look at <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talker.html" title="Talker">talker</a> and tell me what you think of how it looks now. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 23:33, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
