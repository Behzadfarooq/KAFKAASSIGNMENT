<li>My personal opinion is that the article should be deleted (nn, minor ephemeral news story), but feel compelled to vote <b>keep</b> as a matter of policy, since there was an AfD about a month ago with a fully-realized discussion. I wouldn't mind revisiting this in a year or so, though. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 01:37, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> a few lines or so into <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> per others. Even though there was an AfD a month ago, the issue was still very new at that time, a current event which may have influenced the decision to keep. I think a month is a good amount of time for a reevaluation of this matter.--<a href="../../../k/e/w/User%7EKewp_9a75.html" title="User:Kewp">Kewp</a> <a href="../../../k/e/w/User_talk%7EKewp_884c.html" title="User talk:Kewp">(t)</a> 09:45, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>KEEP* - My vote is to keep this article. It is well written and documents an incident (the AP story about 'Snowball' and the subsequent media fuery -- that prompted a change in US government policy relating to evacuees being allowed to take their pets with them. This change in FEMA policy would likly not have occured without the story of Snowball's plight. (left by 68.99.130.81)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> does not deserve its own article and cannot really stand solo. Merge into Hurricane Katrina as a small paragraph. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.png_1d91.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/f/f1/Radioactive.png/18px-Radioactive.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.png_1d91.html" /></a> 11:21, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Why would anyone want to delete this? It's a great story, nicely written with references.

<li><b>Keep</b> for all the reasons it was <b>kept</b> last time. There is far too much of an article to justify merging it.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 12:49, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> and chop out 90% of it. Repeated block quotes from news stories doesn't qualify as good writing. Notability over-stated: "Snowball's plight became a vocal point for criticism..." Hm. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 14:29, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> When I heard about this story, I came to Wikipedia first to find out more about it. I'm sure I'm not the first and only person to do so. I agree with the anon poster above how there were changes made at the federal level so people could take their animals with them in the event of a disaster. I do think it is a notable story and while this may not be of interest to some, it is to others. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltmomma_9b1d.html" title="User:Maltmomma"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF0000">Maltmomma</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMaltmomma_d21a.html" title="User talk:Maltmomma"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#1F85FF">(chat)</font></a></sup> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Texas.svg_4de5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/f/f7/Flag_of_Texas.svg/18px-Flag_of_Texas.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="12" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Texas.svg_4de5.html" /></a> 17:19, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b>. In fifty years, is this going to be of any reasonable notability? For that matter, is it of any reasonable notability now? This is the sort of thing that belongs at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinews.html" title="Wikinews">Wikinews</a>, and not here. Encyclopedia articles are about topics of high importance, not stories about a boy's lost dog, no matter how sad they may be (although I'm certain this couldn't possibly be any more sad or involving than the stories involving thousands of children and babies seperated from their parents. Are we to write articles for all of them as well?) --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 19:46, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article has grown well enough that it's rather pointless to pare down the content in a merge, and it has references to coverage in national news media. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 03:44, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Widespread media coverage establishes notability, and the article is well-sourced. As to the 50 years question, I think Snowball will likely end up as one of the enduring images of one of the worst natural disasters in American history, sort of like <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Adams_%28photographer%29_daff.html" title="Eddie Adams (photographer)">Eddie Adams's</a> photo of the executed Vietcong soldier became a sort of historical shorthand for the events of the Vietnam War. Merge would be better than delete, but there's enough info here that like Trollderella, I worry about whether a merge could be unwieldy. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 03:51, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As before, <b>delete</b>. It was glurge the first time, it's putrefied glurge now. There is nothing <i>notable</i> in this article to merge anywhere; any merge that would be of encyclopedic merit would consist of nothing more than <i>During and after the hurricane, many people were separated from their pets. One of those pets, Snowball, was the subject of minor media attention that lasted about a week until the next human-interest story surfaced to claim column inches.</i> Come on. News is news; an encyclopedia is something different. Not every media circle-jerk is encyclopedic, and certainly not this one. -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 07:18, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable story - disk space is cheap. <a href="../../../u/n/b/User%7EUnbehagen_5de2.html" title="User:Unbehagen">Unbehagen</a> 20:26, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> because there is plenty of information, it is a notable story, and merging would be unwieldy. Speculating what will or won't be important 50 years into the future is not a good idea. <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F_6995.html" title="User:Yamaguchi先生">Yamaguchi先生</a> 03:21, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b>: This story does matter and a place for updates is important. Too many people miss the point of this story. It is not just about the little dog, it is about the little boy too. What an especially horrible experience for him! He will carry this burden with him for the rest of his life. Of course we still care about him. (<i>Unsigned comment by 204.42.16.169</i></li>
