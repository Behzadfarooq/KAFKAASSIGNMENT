<li><b>KEEP!!!</b> As a professional poker player from Las Vegas, I have often found that the 5 of spades is unlucky. Yesterday, for example, I lost both my cars and $24 thousand, all because of that evil card. Many of my fellow card players have had similar problems and they all blame it on the 5 of Spades. --pokerking 10:57, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep this entry.</b> I am a professer at Oxford University, England. I have an MSc in Applied Statistics and also do some work for RoSPA (The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents). My department has found that over 90% of household accidents and over 70% of all accidents are a direct cause of, or happen in the near vacinity of the 5 of spades playing card. I conclude therefore that you should not delete this entry as our findings backup the speculation of this entry. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by profanthony (<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProfanthony_309e.html" title="User talk:Profanthony">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_profanthony_277e.html" title="Special:Contributions/profanthony">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>.Seems like original research.Also note that User:pokerking and User:profanthony have no other edits. AfD discussions are not votes, and attempts to "stuff the ballot box" with new accounts aren't likely to help your cause. <a href="../../../f/b/b/User%7EFbb_fan_c791.html" title="User:Fbb fan">fbb_fan</a> 13:26, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Reading this page, it seems that the <i>superstition surrounding</i> this particular card is unique to my area of the world - I apologise that this is not internationally recognised. I have not so much as mentioned this entry to anyone I know and due to the tone of these two defending entries, I believe they are simply just jokes. I know that this claim, however, will be difficult to prove. --<a href="../../../k/r/y/User%7EKryters_7ef2.html" title="User:Kryters">Kryters</a> 14:35, 14 July 2006 (UTC) Also edited --<a href="../../../k/r/y/User%7EKryters_7ef2.html" title="User:Kryters">Kryters</a> 20:46, 14 July 2006 (UTC) (inclusion of the italicized text)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>In my opinion this entry should stay because it explains the folklore surrounding this playing card. The history of many seemingly odd things appear in the wiki. It is possible that this is a regional superstition but that should not rule out its credibility in the wiki. Perhaps however there should be a link in the superstitions entry to this an example of regional superstition?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Gorgia Guy: Yes, the Ace of Spades is notable, however, in Kryter's view, and in his area, the 5 of spades may be equally notable.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Porquin &amp; Chomes75: Although not backed up by reliable fact, the article is not based on the view of an individual that "the 5 of spades is unlucky". It is based on the sup[erstitions of a region and goes on to explain variations of card games; not necessarily related to the so-called bad luck of the card.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Recury: I'd not heard this either but I have played the mentioned versions of the card games involving the 5 of spades, perhaps there is a basis to the entry?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>There might be a basis to it, but we need to see at least one or two things published that mention the 5 of spades being unlucky. If you could just find a couple web pages that mention it being unlucky or at least as part of the rule variations that are mentioned in the article, that would go a long way towards convincing people to keep this, I think. Which part of the world are you from, if you don't mind my asking? <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 22:02, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A link to a tarot site has been added to the origins section, explaining that it is a card with very negative effects. [<a href="http://tarot.artofdivination.com/a40.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://tarot.artofdivination.com/a40.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]. I live in the Highlands of Scotland. Many people in this area are at least familliar with the idea that this card is apparently unlucky. --<a href="../../../k/r/y/User%7EKryters_7ef2.html" title="User:Kryters">Kryters</a> 11:50, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Authur Rubin: I hadn't heard that before. You should make an entry if there are theories about it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pokerking: Could be completely due to luck.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Profanthony: I'm afraid I question your credibility. I couldn't find the statistics you mentioned anywhere.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fbb: I agree that this is not a vote. However, just because the users have not edited before it should not damage their credibility.It is possible that they are just new and this is their first edit, as it is mine.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Kryters: It may be that this supersition is a local thing but I feel this should not hinder its credibility; nowhere is it stated that regional entries will be removed on the basis that they don't apply to everyone.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>My conclusion is that this entry should remain as there is no valid reason to remove- it if it is true that in the author's area this card is regarded as unlucky. If it is removed I would like to request that the section on variations of card games remain as there is no problem with that part.</li>

<p>Hope my contribution is helpful, The Flame Haired 1. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Theflamehaired1 (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheflamehaired1_387e.html" title="User talk:Theflamehaired1">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Theflamehaired1_5d45.html" title="Special:Contributions/Theflamehaired1">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom and sockpuppetry (also note that Theflamehaired1 has no other edits because of speedy deletes on articles he made, as warned on his user page). I doubt that the five of spades has any sort of notability as to being unlucky over any other cards. It appears to be orignal research, which Wikipedia shouldn't have. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 06:53, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Regardless of whether sockpuppetry was involved or not, it is the value of the arguments that theflamehaired1 put forward that is important - though I deny any association with this user. As it states above, this is certainly not a vote. --<a href="../../../k/r/y/User%7EKryters_7ef2.html" title="User:Kryters">Kryters</a> 13:39, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, in standard decks of cards (to my knowledge), the five of any suit only has 9 figures on it (the five suit symbols, 1 number in the northwest corner, 1 number in the southeast corner, and the suit symbols in each of those corners). <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 06:55, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I have noted above, the 5 of Spades is also highly unlikely (<i>unlucky</i>) in tarot [<a href="http://tarot.artofdivination.com/a40.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://tarot.artofdivination.com/a40.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>]. Also, [<a href="http://www.irishtarot.com/pages/how-to-read-playing-cards.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.irishtarot.com/pages/how-to-read-playing-cards.php" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] shows that the 5 of Spades corresponds to a jealous rival when enquiring about love. Many packs of cards go by a different design, with the number and symbol in every corner, as you can see by the entrys picture. This clearly shows 13 black figures in the design. --<a href="../../../k/r/y/User%7EKryters_7ef2.html" title="User:Kryters">Kryters</a> 11:50, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Unlikely</i> in tarot is right.Our article <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarot.html" title="Tarot">Tarot</a> doesn't even recognize "spades" as a possible suit. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> |<a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 14:50, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Spades corresponds to swords in tarot. <a href="http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art19531.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art19531.asp" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> --<a href="../../../k/r/y/User%7EKryters_7ef2.html" title="User:Kryters">Kryters</a> 15:33, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Still, in normal Playing Cards, ones that people play poker, euchre, cribbage, solitaire, etc. with, the five of any suit only has nine figures on it. The image on the article is taken from an outdated version of Microsoft's Solitaire. The version on my computer does not have numbers or suit symbols in the northeast and southwest corners, just in the other two. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 00:49, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is another point for dispute. According to <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/pjmadsen/cards4/" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/pjmadsen/cards4/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, original cards went by the design shown in 5_spades.PNG - with symbols in each corner. However, these designs have faded in favour of the version you have described. I noticed you described the design as "out of date" rather than "original"&#160;:). As far as I know, Microsoft Solitaire has always used the simplified version of cards - I made 5_spades.PNG myself based on the MS design. --<a href="../../../k/r/y/User%7EKryters_7ef2.html" title="User:Kryters">Kryters</a> 13:39, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
