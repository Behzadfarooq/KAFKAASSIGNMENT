<li>A number of articles about this product have appeared in the press, so the product would appear to be notable according to Wikipedia's definition for commercial products.

<li>Does anyone think this product has sufficient evidence of notability? Speak up, if so.

<li><b>Keep</b> per BTB's comment <i>"...please take a look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_liqueurs.html" title="List of liqueurs">List_of_liqueurs</a>. Should any of them also be deleted? Are you being fair here?"</i>. We have articles on many other brands of liqueurs, and this one should be no exception. This seems to be a unique product in being a tea-flavored liqueur, and is thus comparable to the Chinese <i>chajiu</i>. It's exactly the kind of thing Wikipedia is useful for documenting, which can be very difficult to find elsewhere. Either we want to document liqueurs in a complete way, or we want to ignore certain flavors of liqueur, only concentrating on the most popular ones such as Kahlua. The latter mode does not makes sense to me. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 07:12, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Does every real product get its own article? Does a guy who made a small Pokemon video game and sells it through his website get its own article? Clearly, that would be a "real product in the real world", yet Wikipedia consesus has found that such products do not necessarily merit encyclopedic articles. Basically, the loose requirements for products seem to be that it either garners press attention/reviews or that it must be an otherwise pervasive item. This product does not seem to meet either requirement. Existance is simply not enough to merit an article. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 16:36, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>strawman, this isn't some guy with a website, this is a commercial product. It is not unusual for hand-crafted artsian products like this to be sold in small batches, it is why certain wines cost so much - there are beers from Germany that are produced locally and by a single producer in relativly low numbers and they may have no audience outside 30-miles from where they are produced but they still notable. I'm not sure the people voting here know a lot about how specialized artisian food products work. As the website says: <i>Qi Tea Liqueur is distributed in Northern California by Artisan Wines &amp; Spirits</i> .. so I guess if it's not mass prodcued by Budweiser or Coors then it's not fit for Wikipedia, because this is a Mega-Corp only encyclopedia. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 16:53, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Heh, yeah... mega-corp only, thats Wikipedia alright... 0_o &lt;-(guy rolling eyes) Also, am I strawman? I always thought of myself more as a wickerman...

<dd>On the contrary. Non-notable products (small-run or otherwise) are not legit on Wikipedia, by policy or consensus.

<dd>Notability includes as one of its criteria being the most notable exponent of a style. This liqueur is the most notable commercially available liqueur with its primary flavor being tea. Following through with your threats to remove all mention of this liqueur from Wikipedia now prevents our readers (including those particularly interested in various types of liqueurs) from knowing about this tea-flavored liqueur. It's as if it didn't exist--and our readers will be led to believe that there is no commercially available liqueur with a tea flavor. Please think twice about this. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 00:42, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So every time someone throws a new ingredient into a bottle, the product becomes notable? And by the way, Wikipedia is not the only source of information. If someone is interested in liqueur, they will find this one – unless off course it is an obscure product with barely any distribution. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 11:42, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Here is a proposal. Keep the Qi_(spirit) page, but do not put a link to Qi_(spirit) on the <a href="../../../q/i/_/Qi_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Qi (disambiguation)">Qi_(disambiguation)</a> page (I already removed it). The rationale is that very few people who search on Qi want information about a liqueur. I think one could even argue that Qi-searchers generally tend, by nature, not to find the evidence of notability to be very compelling for liqueurs, and as a result they might reasonably keep nominating Qi_(spirit) as an article for deletion (if a link existed on the <a href="../../../q/i/_/Qi_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Qi (disambiguation)">Qi_(disambiguation)</a> page). However, a different group of Wikipedia users is interested in liqueurs, and for these people, the evidence of notability is much more compelling. To help these users find the page on Qi_(spirit), we would keep a link to it at<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_liqueurs.html" title="List of liqueurs">List_of_liqueurs</a>. Thoughts? Could this be a consensus position? --BTB 02:46, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't agree. If it's notable enough, then it should be linked from the disambiguation page. If it's not notable enough, it shouldn't have a page. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 03:40, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think it's ironic (and a little sad, too) that a Min Nan person would be actively working to suppress information on Wikipedia about a product containing as its main ingredient a tea produced in his/her geographical region. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 03:49, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, I don't see any reason to change. Limited-distribution, specialty product, available in a small area.
