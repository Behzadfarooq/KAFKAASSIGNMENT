This article has the same failings as the first time it was nominated for deletion. It looks more like a promotion for an individual plastic surgeon and academic than a legitimate Wikopedia article. If one looks at the cited awards, for example, there are dozens and dozens of doctors who have won those awards. The number of publications is not unusual for an academic at all. In fact, many academics have far more than these. It seems odd to highlight one doctor out of the hundreds and thousands that could be highlighted. If indeed this surgeon made an original independent contribution to the field, then I suggest that instead of a separate article, a footnote in the Plastic Surgery article would be more appropriate.

<li><b>Delete</b> - notability is based entirely on an unreferenced assertion that he is a recognized expert. Take that away, and he is a run-of-the-mill practicing physician who has only risen to the level of (non-tenured) assistant professorship. Actually, what may be most noteworthy about Dr. Maxwell is the fact that he seems to have egregiously violated laws requiring informed consent. Maybe every doctor who does this should be listed, but not in an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 02:14, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The discussion on the lawsuit has nothing to do with the reason for this Rfd. Please read the reason above. Maxwell's legal (and other) problems were discussed in the context of the existing Wiki article - NOT a reason for deleting the article itself. The reason for deleting the article is amply explained above. Wikopedia is an encyclopedia, not a forum for a loving student to burnish the credentials of his mentor.

In attempting to follow up on this, I clicked on the NY Times reference.

Linking to copyrighted works is usually not a problem, as long as you have made a reasonable effort to determine that the page in question is not violating someone else's copyright. If it is, please do not link to the page." The NY Times is referenced as "2005 cited in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> as one of the United States top plastic surgeons who do breast implants [<a href="http://www.smilesbydavis.com/the_list.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.smilesbydavis.com/the_list.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>]," but this is a PDF on another (non-Times) domain, which appears to violate NY Times copyright&#160;???

<li><b>Delete</b> It can be expected from <i>any</i> physician that he or she has had works published, and quite simply, this guy is no more notable than the next. Also, if writing an article about an insignificant person, it is imperrative that the article clearly states this, so the reader does not falsely believe him to be world-renowned or famous. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">Adambiswanger1</a> 16:49, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per InShaneee. If this is a notable physician, then Wiki's standards are too low, and every run-of-the-mill doctor can advertise on Wiki. Many doctors are published, and that doesn't always amount to a hill of beans. I also hope someone who knows more about it than I do will look into the possible copyright violations on the article entry.
