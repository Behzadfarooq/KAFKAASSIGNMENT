<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous. I count 7 "delete" votes (anon nomination discounted) and 4 "keep" votes. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C. Boyer">Daniel C. Boyer</a> appears to have abstained. While there is a majority to delete, there is not the supermajority necessary to indicate concensus. Failing to reach a clear concensus to delete, the decision defaults to <b>keep</b> for now. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 01:13, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>The article subject gets 600 plus hits on Google as Richard Genovese Surrealist and the first hit is this Wikipedia Vanity Article written for him by Anon as <b>promotion</b>. The listing of article subject in Who's Who (see both publications on article page) cannot verify facts on notablility since anyone can get listed in both publications (see past VfD discussion by other Wiki users trying to verify this article). The Museum of Modern Art publication that he is listed as being in, brings up no evidence of the article that he is supposed to be featured in upon doing SEARCH on the MOMA website from link on this page! Article is also in violation of <b>advertising and spam</b>, article subject publishes and sells his non-notable publication. Note: Article Subject is supposed to be active in Surrealism and the Arts for many years, and has very little reference history online that should easily be verified in order to warrant an article written for him to appear in this encyclopedia. Recommend a user page for this article subject.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 23:55, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>A stealth ad is an ad that is disguised as something else (such as an encyclopedia article). And even major papers are sometimes vulnerable to hoaxes. That doesn't mean they're "in on it". <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 13:54, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course even major papers are sometimes vulnerable to hoaxes. But does that mean that before we see evidence that the paper has been suckered we should <i>assume</i> that what's in it is a hoax. Wyss hasn't asserted any reason why he thinks that the existence of Richard Genovese is a hoax, yet he still asserts it. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

<li>I sincerely disagree, Infrogmation. Not really legit, due to the fact that the article in question was in a magazine supplement, <b>Long Island Weekly</b> section of New York Times. This reference listing is really misleading in regards to notability, though the NY Times does list practically everything in their archives. This "article", though it appeared in the NY Times archives online, it did appear in the attached magazine supplement, it did not appear in the significant ARTS section of NY Times (or am I wrong?, I read the NY Times since the late 70's), plus that was a local Long Island Gallery, where any local artist (not at all notable in the NY Art Scene) can get exhibited and mentioned in the supplement attachment. This can be debated, but you need to know the fact that Richard Genovese is a friend of Daniel Boyer and is getting free promotion on Wikipedia, courtesy of Boyer, see <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealist_techniques.html" title="Surrealist techniques">surrealist techniques</a> and look at the artworks on display at that Wikipedia page.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 05:47, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The NYT article says he was guest curator for an 80 artist exhibition. This is verification from a well regarded print source of visibility in the arts beyond the "garage band" or small personal clique scale. This, added to the over 900 non-Wikipedia hits for his name, are enough notability for me; others may have other standards. I can see no harm in keeping the article. As to your Boyer argument: If he is or isn't a friend of Boyer may or may not have something to do with why the article was started (I don't know if the anon who started the article was Boyer or not), it isn't directly relevent to determining the subject's notability. (To illustrate with a hypothetical example, even if a Wikipedia user who was nothing but a vandal was shown to be friends with an Oscar winning director or a national president, that wouldn't be a good reason to say we shouldn't have articles on the otherwise notable person.) -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 06:20, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 7 clear "delete" votes, 5 "keep" votes and 1 "redirect". Several factual claims and counter-claims were made during this discussion but were never resolved. In particular, is this the musical equivalent of a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_press.html" title="Vanity press">vanity press</a> which is merely sold through Amazon? They were also never evaluated against the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Failing to reach a clear concensus to delete, the decision defaults to <b>keep</b> for now.

<p>Appears to be another non notable band. When you have a name like "Sullivan" you get a hell of alot of google hits to wade through, no matter how you try to limit the search. I cannot find anything indicating they have even released an album, so I'm thinking this is sort of band vanity (though they are not very vain if this is all they can say about themselves).

<dd>So, let me get this straight. Author of a book listed on Amazon outside the top 100,000, out. Artist of an album listed on Amazon outside the top 100,000, in.

<li><b>Comment</b>: if it makes any difference to anyone, it should be noted that their album is actually an EP, so it probably has only a few songs on it.

<p>I recommend this Australian psychedelic trance project's article should be removed if the following can be established: That playing "to countless festivals &amp; parties around the globe including Japan, Portugal, Sweden, New Zealand, Switzerland, Holland, France &amp; Belgium" since 1997 does not count as an international concert tour. Because otherwise it meets none of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">Music notability criteria</a>. It has 536 unique google hits, but that is the approximate number of psychedelic trance junkies who log into blogs. The sole individual behind the artistic project, Paul McCosh, gets 39 unique google hits. The project released two albums on Boom! Records, a label which has released a total of 19 albums. It is not mentioned on All Music Guide. 216.119.136.157 02:45, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Meets the 2 album requirement (see <a href="http://www.users.bigpond.com/fractalglider/music2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.users.bigpond.com/fractalglider/music2.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> for complete discography).

<ul>
<li>The criterion's requirement is fulfilled not just by the artist releasing two albums. The label on which it is released must be major or an important independent label with other notable artists. As I already said, Boom! Records, Fractal Glider's label, has released a total of 19 albums including Fractal Glider's two, and not including, I should add, any other notable artists.
<ul>
<li>Of course, using circular logic you assume other artists who have released on this label are not notable as well. In fact, those artists include Rastaliens, Logic Bomb, Battle of the Future Buddhas, Chi Ad, Cosmoon, and Ubar Tmar. -<a href="../../../l/d/_/User%7ELd_4f39.html" title="User:Ld">Ld</a> | <a href="../../../l/d/_/User_talk%7ELd_dfe2.html" title="User talk:Ld">talk</a> 04:40, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How is that circular logic? Do any of those bands satisfy the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">notability guidelines for musicians</a>? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> 04:48, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Indeed. For instance, Logic Bomb has 2 albums released on <a href="../../../t/i/p/TIP_World_a237.html" title="TIP World">TIP World</a> and Spiral Trax (two of the bigger psytrance labels). Chi Ad has 3 albums released 2 of them on Nova Tekk (a well-known German label). Finally, Fractal Glider is fairly represantative of the psychedelic trance scene in Australia. -<a href="../../../l/d/_/User%7ELd_4f39.html" title="User:Ld">Ld</a> | <a href="../../../l/d/_/User_talk%7ELd_dfe2.html" title="User talk:Ld">talk</a> 04:59, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Neither Logic Bomb and Chi Ad have released <i>individual</i> albums on Boom! Records, they have only allowed some of their songs to be released on <i>compilation</i> albums, so Boom! Records is still <b>not an "important indie label"</b> according to the criterion. And being "fairly represantative" of the psychedelic trance scene in Australia is <b>not the same</b> as having "become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both)" <b>which is the text of that different criterion</b>. Wikipedia has to draw a line at creating new entire music articles somewhere. 216.119.144.33 08:09, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ld, you haven't established the notability of the bands you've listed as "notable" on Fractal Glider's label, you've only made articles for them. What's more to the point is the actual text of the criterion: <b>"Has released two or more albums</b> on a major label or <b>one of the more</b> <i><b>important</b></i> <b>indie labels (i.e.</b> an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a <b>roster of performers</b>, <i><b>many</b></i> of which are notable) [emphasis mine]. You list 6 bands. Only 4 of them have released actual albums for Boom! Records (FG's label). The other two have individual songs on <i>compilation</i> albums for that label. Of the 4 with actual albums, they all have fewer google hits than Fractal Glider does [run with the name of the band and the word "trance"]! Ubar Tmar, admittedly is in the All Music Guide and the only one there, but he no longer releases albums with Boom! Records and besides, he would be only <i>one</i> notable performer rather than the <i>many</i> that is required for meeting the criterion. 216.119.144.33 08:09, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, but thanks for asking - I still vote to Keep. I admit that from the newspaper research I have done, it seems that they are more of a regional group, notable for their influence in an underground genre of music (that I know little about), but that they are considered influential in that genre seems to weigh for keeping them in.

<p><s><b>Delete</b> This is a very not notable conference. When I put Barcelona Conference on a google search it came up with a conference on AIDS.

This site was almost certainly written by <a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbey_f99f.html" title="User:Cumbey">User:Cumbey</a>, a self-confessed Solana is the Beast believer. She also wrote <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barcelona_Process_0c59.html" title="Barcelona Process">Barcelona Process</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barcelona_Process&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barcelona_Process&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which was speedily deleted 2 weeks later. The only reason this piece exists is to offer evidences to Christians who think Solana may be the Beast. The fact that Google doesn't easily offer any information about it that is not from a Christian point of view indicates to me that it is not noteworthy except to Christians who think Solana may be the Beast. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 02:50, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)</s>. <b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Strangely, this article now reads as being a well-written account of something that may well be notable. I suspect that this is the result of SqueakBox's edits.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The Barcelona Process is certainly notable, and very real. I am a freelance translator, and as chance would have it, I've been translating documents related to this project for the EU this past week.

<li>Clearly KEEP. SqueakBox hatcheted the article and removed the external references. This is a ten year old process which Solana himself has so often said deserves celebration for this anniversary coming on November 28, 2005. <a href="http://www.eu-del.org.il/english/whatsnew.asp?id=363" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eu-del.org.il/english/whatsnew.asp?id=363" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> There is absolutely no rational reason to delete it other than for disinformation -- not information!

<li>I have a perfect right to bring Solana to the Beast article as there are people who think he is the Beast, including Herb Peters and Fulfilled Prophecy.com, amongst others. That is not unprofessional, that is doing good, irreproachable wiki work. What is unprofessional and in my mind unaccepatable is to try to offer proofs that Solana is the Beast.

<li><b>Delete</b>—I was just about to list this (thanks for doing so, Chris!). I could not verify any part of this article, about a supposedly "famous" family with a "dark past" involving genocide. There are several "Schmidt Barkery/Bakeries", but none of them appear to be the one mentioned in the article. Even if this isn't a hoax, I question its notability and its suitability in light of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. The "references" aren't exactly up to snuff and do nothing to help verify the article's contents.

<li><b>Keep</b> I vote to keep this page. This family's history was completely unknown until I publicized it. I believe it should be kept as the family needs to be recognized more widely. I do not disagree with the removal of the unpublished book, but the family is very notable as they have a fascinating history. I believe that the history of the family is important because so many people would be fascinated to hear the history behind their little eateries. Also, it is a notable business whose history deserves to be documented. The Schluegenkopfs are legendarily famous through much of their homeland region and much of Austria. The Schluegenkopf are also make for interesting bits of trivia about Oregon and especially Portland. I believe the page is notable, and by far notable enough to remain on Wikipedia. And to Hadal, I completely do not disagree with the removal of the links. The research had been done priorly, mainly in family history documents only distributed among the family itself, but I am the first to put it in anyway onto the internet.

<dd><b>Comment</b>Alright, I suppose it is considered original research. And for the SchluDenkopf thing, it was from a very botched oral tale that I heard and posted after discovering the site. It sparked my interest enough to thouroughly research the company and discover the truth. After contacting my original source, they admit the used some "imagination" in the retelling of the story. I do apologize for originally posting such an erroneous document, but it did lead me to the truth about the Schluegenkopfs. I thouroughly researched them before posting and continued to make minor edits as I talked to more of the family and came across more documents. After compiling significant research, I finally remembered to post it onto this site.

<li>So what does it take to be a notable troll? He caused Slashdot, a notable website, to change the way it handled comments. The GNAA wishes they could do the same. He even went beyond the internet, driving Tolkien fans to gibbering insanity with his obviously tounge-in-cheek Two Towers petition. Reguarding the memorial claims... I hope we VfD the entry of every person who just died and has his entry expanded. Quite often people are not properly recognized for their significance until after they're gone. I don't think klerck's entry as it currently is written seems like a memorial. To NOT mention the fact that he died would be unencyclopedic. Unfortunately, the circumstances surrounding his death, particularly the initially wide-spread perception that klerck's last entry was false, are a by-product of his notariety as a troll. This could cause a treatment of his past trolling activity to appear to be some sort of memorial, I suppose. <a href="../../../e/d/o/User%7EEdogy_ea37.html" title="User:Edogy">Edogy</a> 01:15, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I did not know Kevin, and do not belong to the troll community. I submit that his final LiveJournal entry by itself (and a tangential response by one of the people he addresses) is quite interesting. It provides insight to a specific online culture that exists (whether you agree with it or not) and also provokes thought about suicide itself. Also, there was teenager that overdosed on drugs and died while in an internet chatroom. I do not have the time to dig up the quite stale links right now as this happened a couple of years (at least) ago. I suspect that there may be other instances of internet witnessed death/suicide. As more people use the internet, this may happen increasingly. This can be attended to in a scholarly fashion without becoming "troll-centric" that can provide enlightenment about suicide/internet culture. Such treatment done right would be valuable. Is that not what wikipedia is trying to accomplish? eclectro

<li><b>No vote</b>. This seems awfully close to just a "memorial" page, although maybe borderline notable. I could imagine an article worth having, so I can't bring myself to vote "delete"; on the other hand, I just can't make myself say "keep", either.

<li>Based on some Google searching, I'd <b>delete</b>. Only 3 hits for diatribe+"wellington speaking union". Searching for diatribe+wellington or diatribe+"debating society" turned up lots of hits but seemingly almost nothing on the group. If the group can be established as noteworthy in a meaningful way, then I vote instead to move to Diatribe (debating society) and delete the redirect (or at least replace the redir with a disambig). <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 04:41, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've edited the entry to remove hints of hubris and promotion. I'd be happy for it to be moved to Diatribe (debating society) as suggested. This is a notable club in the recent context of Wellington (NZ) club debating - which is diminishing in popularity and not well represented on the web, but which has a long and, I think, note-worthy heritage. I'd be interested in embelishing this heritage with entries on WSU and other clubs, but I'll wait and see the verdict on this one.</p>
<p>How about if it's edited again? Or better yet, put up a disambiguation page? The definition of "diatribe" is: "a malicious written or verbal attack". Thomas Paine's <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Sense_8af3.html" title="Common Sense">Common Sense</a></i> could be an example of a diatribe against British rule.

<li>Note that name in the article title is misspelled; it should be <b>Mailloux</b> (double l). There are more Google hits for "Pierre Mailloux CKAC", although admittedly still not a <i>lot</i>; searching on the name alone brings up far too many hits for unrelated people. Over a thousand hits, however, if one uses the title of his show, <i>Doc Mailloux</i> (in much the same way as one would expect more Google hits for <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Phil_5086.html" title="Dr. Phil">Dr. Phil</a> than for <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_McGraw_e0f1.html" title="Phil McGraw">Phil McGraw</a>).

<li><b>Keep</b> Quebec is one of my areas of interest, and from past personal research I can vouch for the fact that this guy is a household name ("Doc Mailloux") in the Montreal area at least, and probably Quebec in general. Anybody that's a household name to a few million people is probably encyclopedic enough to qualify.

<p>Listed for speedy by Hedley, because "Only Google hits are on pages containing this Wikipedia content or entries into 'Ivan' or 'births' lists labelling him a child prodigy.

<li>I am plain citizen of Ukraine. My name will not tell you anything, but name of Ivan is known in all corners of out country. I hope you'll excuse me for my poor English. I with my friends was very glad and proud of our country when we saw this article. I was confused and ashamed when I encountere this VfD - this article shows facts, not "hoax" or some other fraud. Hedley, Grue and RidG are trying to make their guesses to be facts. But is there really any reason to delete Ivan Cherevko article? What the honorable criticists are negating? Fact, that Ivan finished the school at eleven years ( <a href="http://www.rronline.ws/cgi-bin/news.pl?MODE=GET_NEWS&amp;ID=209410" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rronline.ws/cgi-bin/news.pl?MODE=GET_NEWS&amp;ID=209410" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> - article in a "Russian advertising - Russian newspaper New York", <a href="http://edu.kiev.ua/press/rubez/sch_ext.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://edu.kiev.ua/press/rubez/sch_ext.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> - Kiev's education)? That he is studying in one of the elite Ukrainian universities in such a young age ( <a href="http://www.day.ua/127094/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.day.ua/127094/" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> - article in big Ukrainian newspaper "the Day")? That Ukrainian Academy of Sciences has published his book when he was ten years old (<a href="http://pleyady.kiev.ua/ukr/izdat/books.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://pleyady.kiev.ua/ukr/izdat/books.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> - "Pleyady" publishing house article)? Fact, that he is an author of his own published ecological theory (Seventh International University Conference in field of Applied Mathematics and Informatics, Lviv, Ukraine, 2004)? You accuse this article of hoax and vanity. Hoax is anything deliberately intended to deceive (<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Hoax" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Hoax" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>). There are links from independent sources listed above, that prove almost everything that Ivan Cherevko is about. I hope there is a lot of Wikipedians that speak Russian and Ukrainian. Vanity is an excessive pride in or admiration of one's own appearance or archievements (<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Vanity" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Vanity" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>). If there is only one such kid in Ukraine, country with 50-million population, where does "excessive" pride can came from? I stated before that everything in this brief article is correct and corresponds with my image of Ivan Cherevko, child prodigy from Ukraine. <b>Keep</b> - --<a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykola_Petrenko_4486.html" title="User:Mykola Petrenko">Mykola Petrenko</a> 18:12, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Look, there are NO Google hits for both Russian and Ukrainian spelling of his name, a few lines about him in newspaper isn't enough, a book written under a pseudonym could've easily been written by anyone else and a statement about IQ is completely unverifiable. Obviously he's not as notable as you want him to be, even in Ukraine. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 18:47, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Anyone so 'notable' nationwide would have a more vivid set of Google results. The first article mentions Ivan/Vanya Cherevko - Even if that is the same person, how does that justify inclusion? Another article I translated is about young scientists - Nothing to do with Cherevko. I assume you must be affliated or the article writer - I'll be voting delete until you can prove his notability. Furthermore, the article was originally written by 'Yanus' who only edited a few articles, the majority adding Cherevko's name. Possibly self-addition/vanity.<a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 19:03, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First of all - there is yandex.ru for russian spelling. Timofei, you have to know that Google does not support case endings so is very limited in russian/ukrainian search, and both russian and ukrainian version + Vanya Cherevko + Ivanko Cherevko and variation yield quite a linksome, and you also could help Mr. Hedley by adding that Ivan and Vanya are the same, and that second article clearly states in fourth paragrsph: "Close idea [to the one of Alexei Bondar] was submitted by the youngest participant of competition, Ivan Cherevko, 13-years-old sophomore student of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy..." (full text in Russian for you, Timofei: Близкой по идее оказалась и работа самого юного участника конкурса Ивана Черевко, 13-летнего студента второго курса Киево-Могилянской академии. Иван проблему утилизации бытовых отходов, в частности пищевых упаковок, предложил решать на уровне создания технологий их производства, где бы заранее закладывался экологически чистый способ их уничтожения. А так как в будущем Иван готовится стать экологом и очень переживает за «чистоту» пространства своего государства, он разработал серию игр для детей, которые бы с малых лет приучали молодое поколение не только быть экологически грамотными, но и придерживаться правил экологической культуры в своих разнообразных действиях.). If you were more attentive, you could read at link number [2], that Cherevko and Kowchuk is the same person: "Під псевдонімом Ковчук написав книгу "Мої десять". Це його перша книга , в якій відтворено бачення минулого, оцінка і характеристика теперішнього, а також погляд у майбутнє.", or 'Under pen name Kowchuk has weitten book "My ten". This is his first book, in which vision of past, analysis of present and view into future are united". And yes, from some point of view I am Ivan's affiliate, as I am one of Albert Einstein and Lewis Caroll. I am fascinated by his affairs, just like Einstein's and Caroll's, but I haven't met neither of them in reallife. Assuming such a serious accusement to the Ukrainian Academy of Science that have supported him in fraud you should have some serious proof to support it - not just "possibly". As was stated on one of the "Wikipedia:" pages, deletion is not an easy affair. You can't just say "delete-because-I-want-to". You proof is too light, I need to say? Need more links? Oh, I have handsome of them just near me, starting from homesite (<a href="http://ivcherevko.narod.ru" class="external autonumber" title="http://ivcherevko.narod.ru" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, I guess.... Yes, exactly), and right to the text of interview at BBC russian. I want to add, that I've done not so much work gathering those links, and plain unattentiveness should not be your guideline at voting.--<a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykola_Petrenko_4486.html" title="User:Mykola Petrenko">Mykola Petrenko</a> 20:52, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I happen to read Russian, and some Ukranian. This "он разработал серию игр для детей, которые бы с малых лет приучали молодое поколение не только быть экологически грамотными, но и придерживаться правил экологической культуры в своих разнообразных действиях" basically says that he created a series of games for children designed to promote knowledge of proper ecology, etc. - that hardly qualifies him as a child prodigy. I see absolutely nothing in the links you've posted that supports your contention that he has published his own ecological theory. I think that in this case, the burden of proof lies upon you to lend factual credibility to your assertions. I would be more than happy to review other links you post, whether in English, Russian, or Ukranian. <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidG_2ba7.html" title="User:RidG">RidG</a> <a href="../../../r/i/d/User_talk%7ERidG_5b69.html" title="User talk:RidG">(talk)</a> 21:12, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)

<li>That was not what I implied. What I was stating is that it is very easy to say a library in Ukraine contains information on him, but nobody can check that, thus it is like me saying information proving the existance of Fig Roll Monster of Doom (in example) exists, but that I can't show you it. In the case of a VfD, information in a Ukrainian library isn't available, and so Google has to be the authority as there is no other alternative. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 02:14, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

I believe that instead of a full article, a mention should be made in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_prodigy.html" title="Child prodigy">Child prodigy</a> article, like it was made for Jessica Constant or Alia Sabur. What I feel I must say is that there, in fact, are 2570 Google hits for the Russian spelling of his name (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD+%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%BE&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD+%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%BE&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> - Grue, if you didn't find any, thats probably because there's some weird sort of thing going on with codepages when cyrillic characters are used in the actual URL), and that Russian search engines do return a few results, yes.

<li>He shouldn't be in the child prodigy article. His article is a blatant ego trip, which should have been speedied in the first place. If Cherevko stays the entire membership of MidYis and organisations of 'geniuses', assuming Cherevko is one (after all, he needs to get people from a University to 'support' him on this VfD, note all the new users voting here), should also be added to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 15:50, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>First, you didn't put quotes around the name, so some of these are "Cherevko Petr, Aisuk Ivan, ...". Second, there is a saxophonist, a former worker of a factory, a diver and a lot of other people who share his name. All not notable. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 15:55, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, - I remember this kid - I think she was the second youngest kid in the USA to hold a patent. That in itself is noteworthy.

<li><b>Keep</b>, Most of the offending vanity material must have been elided from the entry. I don't see any of the references to the "genius" comment or the other topics. As for the topic of invention, this device did play a large role in American popular culture, especially in the late 90's as a mainstream consumer product.

<li><b>Delete</b>, it seems the patent exists, but no proof whatsoever that Black and Decker purchased it. Googling combinations of "Caitlyn schmidt" and light, black, decker, flashlight... gives back no hits. Just that a Caitlyn Schmidt is indeed studying CS at Brown.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I think many of you are quick to delete simply because something is not googleable. However, that's far from being a justifiable reason for deleting something. The patent exists, and particularly if you look at the law firm that represented Black and Decker during their patent infringement suits on the snake light in the late 90's, you'll see that they did not indeed own the patents on the device until almost a year after its release. <a href="http://www.niroscavone.com/news/story.php?id=16" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.niroscavone.com/news/story.php?id=16" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. Additionally, because this event occurred before the rise of web-zines and newspapers online, it would be difficult to read such online. However, given the actual patent information and the discussion of the product's history in that link, it is impossible not to infer that is one of the four purchased and acquired by Black and Decker.<a href="../../../e/t/a/User%7EEtamura_7f61.html" title="User:Etamura">Etamura</a> 16:36, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> As a avid reader if Popular Science of over the years, and a amateur tinker/inventor myself, I remember The kudo's that were given to this girl by the Editor-in-Chief of Popular Science Fred Abatemarco. In their "Best of what's New Edition"(December 1994) Fred commented that Caitly's invention was as notable as any of the 100 greatest achievements in science and technology for 1994.

<li><b>Cleanup</b> and <b>weak keep</b>. Poor titling conventions aren't a reason to delete since they can be solved quite easily with the "move" function. Likewise, a <i>possible</i> copyvio isn't justification for speedy deletion.

<p>This article is entirely made up of erroneous information. There are no sources given. This was first pointed out 18 months ago on the discussion page, but it has not been remedied. I think this is because the article has no real purpose, so no-one is interested in making something of it. See the discussion page for documentation of all this: <a href="../../../g/e/r/Talk%7EGermanic_words_of_Unknown_Origin_c4f0.html" title="Talk:Germanic words of Unknown Origin">Talk:Germanic words of Unknown Origin</a>; deletion was proposed there several times.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> There is some research going on in the early history of Germanic languages, and some of it does theorize about contact with pre-Indo-European inhabitants of Europe. But the article as it stands neither summarizes nor cites any of the research going on in that field. I think as a matter of policy when an article is discussing ideas which, while they might well merit a place in Wikipedia, are far removed from mainstream thinking, that it should be held to higher standard of citation and of clarification about who holds what ideas and what reasons they give for them. Unless those improvements can be brought to this article - unless it turns into a referenced discussion of a minority body of theory - I don't think it should be there. <a href="../../../d/i/d/User%7EDiderot_346d.html" title="User:Diderot">Diderot</a> 15:38, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. In addition to the arguments given above, original research is inevitable in this sort of thing. There is no fixed set of Germanic words which all scholars agree are of unknown origin. And even for the words where everyone agrees they're of unknown origin, what more is there to say about them? Speculation about where they <i>might</i> come from amounts to original research. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 21:27, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. There is information here that is wholly unsound. For instance, the word house, which is said, in this article, to have no known connections to other indo-euro. languages ouside of germanic ones, has a cognate in Spanish "Casa." The C to H change between Germanic and Latinate languages is well-known, and appears also in words like Horn in Germanic languages, which are related to Cornus in Latin. Jon</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Not notable. There are many interesting things that aren't encyclopedic. If she achieved fame in a field in which it was difficult to attain then she would be notable, but by the article's own admittance, she hasn't. Street artists (as a class) shouldn't be excluded because their field is one in which fame is rarely achieved, but they (as individuals) shouldn't be included unless they are famous. There are many people who are more notable "than the average person", but this alone isn't sufficient to have a biographical article in an encyclopedia. Treborbassett 17:19, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In what way could this be an advert? It's not even clear why it should be thought that it's vanity (the reasoning seems to be: this shouldn't be here, therefore the reason it was put here must be vanity, therefore it shouldn't be here, therefore...).</dd>
<dd>Where in the article does it mention that she's a mime? Given that there's an explicit reference to her reaching her audience though Hebrew, that rather suggests otherwise.</dd>

<dd>A TV company thought she was worth <i>five minutes</i> of coverage. There must be thousands of people who have had five minute slots on TV. Furthermore, there must be armies of actors and musicians who (rightly) don't have encyclopedia articles because they don't have the notoriety. Treborbassett 14:36, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm sure there are thousands of people who've had 5 minutes on national television stations as examples of their art form. Luckily wikipedia has no size limits, so all of them can be covered.

<li>Doubtlessly true, but I don't think appearing on TV for 5 minutes as an example of a particular artist type merits inclusion in an encyclopedia. Who would look them up? Treborbassett 17:13, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Good grief, does <i>nobody</i> read the discussion before voting? <b>She's not a mime.</b> The rest of the comment is just trying to be clever rather than thinking about the issue. But I really should be resigned to that after a number of these VfD farces. A gaggle of deleters pile in, having neither read the article nor the VfD discussion. Then they probably go off and churn out a dozen more articles on minor comuter-game or comic-book characters. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 18:44, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think you might be making a slightly unfair generalisation there. To draw a correlation between 'deleters' and propagators of computer game character articles seems a little unfounded to me! Treborbassett 20:43, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>True — it was a rhetorical flourish (I forget the technical name of the figure). Looking at five of the current <i>deleters</i>, though, all but one seem to spend an unhealthily large proportion of their time doing little more than voting in VfDs... <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:06, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I don't see how useful an example of a street artist is if he or she isn't notable - what purpose does a list of non-famous people serve, even if they do exemplify a particular profession? Although, it has to said she is gaining some notoriety, albeit indirectly! Treborbassett 20:43, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My point is that is she <i>is</i> notable in a verifiable way, the TV program wouldn't give 5 minutes to someone completely talentless. She doesn't meet any particularly *high* bar of notability, but that's inherent in her profession. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 02:31, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I hate to do this <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a>, but the article does actually say that 'Nitzan made a name for herself in impromptu mime...' - I think we can take this as meaning that <b>she is a mime</b> (or at least was). How's that for reading the article? Treborbassett 20:48, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But to call someone a mime is to imply that that's all they do (and the reference to Hebrew suggests that it isn't). That's particularly important given a fairly general aversion to mimes. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 20:57, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'll give you that, but to say <i>she's not a mime</i> makes it sound like she doesn't do any mime at all! And why should people refrain from saying she's a mime if she does do mime? I'm not aware of any bad connotations of that word. If she does mime, she's a mime artist, even if she does do other art as well. I fear there's a danger of digression from the issue at stake here at any rate. Treborbassett 21:03, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It might be a specific cultural phenomenon (though I'd thought that it was at least common to the U.K. and the U.S.); there was a time when mimes seemed to have become the acceptable targets of otherwise non-P.C. jokes. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:06, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I understand what you mean, but I don't see why this means that the word <i>mime</i> is unusable. The jokes might be politically incorrect, but I don't see that the word <i>mime</i> is. Again I'd like to emphasise the danger of digression here. I'm perfectly happy to discuss social attitudes to mime, but I think it's tangential to the subject of this page. Treborbassett 21:12, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's probably minor (many users simply vote 'delete' if they haven't heard of the person and get nothing on Google; lazy and un-Wikipedian, but depressingly common. <i>Some</i>, though, might be influenced by an aversion to mime artists (it's no sillier than most other reasons given). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:29, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>But she does <i>do</i>, or at least <i>did</i>, mime. I don't see why this fact should be concealed to protect the article against 'mime-haters'. Are you suggesting that we avoid using the word <i>mime</i> to deter those mime-haters who won't read the article but do read the discussion? Treborbassett 21:58, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't see why a street-performer who is widely recognized and known by name (even if only a performance-name) by a large swath of the population of a major city (such as Tel Aviv) wouldn't be as notable as other types of performers whose fame is based on television performances, appearances in more traditional venues, etc. However, at present the article doesn't really establish this. Describing her as a "fixture" in the Tel Aviv "beach scene" isn't quite convincing, suggesting that she is more in the vein of an eccentric beach character. I don't know how to assess the 5 minute TV segment since I don't know whether the channel is important -- an "alternative culture" channel doesn't sound very mainstream. There is also the problem of the source and verifiability of the information in the article.

<p>Here is another psychedelic trance project article created by <a href="../../../l/d/_/User%7ELd_4f39.html" title="User:Ld">user:Ld</a>, this time from Sweden. Ld maintained earlier that this group is notable, but I recommend that its article be removed because it meets none of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">Music notability criteria</a>. It has <s>366 unique google hits</s> 585 unique Lycos hits [google is fairly useless for hits with large numbers, as Bruce Springsteen gets 833 unique hits] 216.119.136.113 , but as I said before, that is the approximate number of psychedelic trance junkies who log into blogs. The individuals behind the artistic project, Magnus Blath, Johan Rosen and David Tingsgard searched with the word "trance" get about 13 unique google hits a piece. The project released two albums on Boom! Records, a label which has released a total of 19 albums. It has been established <s>fairly exhaustively</s> {<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.154.26.251.html" title="User:64.154.26.251">64.154.26.251</a> 03:23, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC) see comment} to a reasonable degree that this is not an important independent record company as per the notability criterion dealing with record labels (see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Fractal_Glider_e793.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Fractal Glider">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Fractal Glider</a>).

<li><b>Comment: The two cases are not comparable</b>. If there is a consensus to keep <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fractal_Glider_0887.html" title="Fractal Glider">Fractal Glider</a> it is only because you have finally provided evidence the project has been on some kind of international tour, which is one of the Music notability criteria. And <b>earlier votes to keep may have been based on misleading information</b> provided by you, Ld, about the importance of the label. 216.119.136.134
<ul>
<li>Please show evidence of where I am providing misleading information. I have been on Wikipedia for over a year, and my contributions have never been accused of providing incorrect or misleading information. You can review the contributions on my user page, if you wish. You, on the other hand, are posting from an annonymous IP (and not even signing your posts), and putting up many of my contributions for VfD. I recommend you create an account before doing any more VfD submissions. -<a href="../../../l/d/_/User%7ELd_4f39.html" title="User:Ld">Ld</a> | <a href="../../../l/d/_/User_talk%7ELd_dfe2.html" title="User talk:Ld">talk</a> 20:03, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The nature of the misleading information is covered rathered thoroughly at the Fractal Glider deletion entry. Why are you acting as if providing misleading information is necessarily some kind of bad act? I don't know what your intentions were. There is no need to recriminate by accusing me of "not signing my posts," when I forget to do so once. I haven't put <i>many</i> of your contributions for VfD, I've put only three (one of which the consensus so far has been 7-1 to delete). You, Ld, on the other hand, may have made about a hundred psychedelic trance stubs with no research into their notability, and then you definitely said "Please feel free to nominate any of them for VfD if necessary" here. And now it's as if you're getting angry at other people for doing the job you should be doing yourself. 216.119.136.134 20:45, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In fact, I have abstained on that vote because in that case the band is in fact of dubious notability. By saying "if necessary" I was implying inconsistent with the guidelines. I am not denying <i>a few</i> of my stubs may not meet the guidelines. If you nominate those, I will either abstain or vote to delete/merge. In all other cases I will argue strongly against deletion. -<a href="../../../l/d/_/User%7ELd_4f39.html" title="User:Ld">Ld</a> | <a href="../../../l/d/_/User_talk%7ELd_dfe2.html" title="User talk:Ld">talk</a> 20:57, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ld, on my side, I am not trying to delete <b>all</b> of the stubs, just those that don't come up as notable on the web searches. Since you admit there is a problem with some (ten? twenty? thirty?), I would prefer if you nominate the non-notable ones yourself. In this particular case, you may wish to appeal to the guidelines or show some other kind of widespread notability. I'm only going by educated guesses that they're not notable other than the guidelines, because of google hits and because what they put as their accomplishments on their own website is pretty thin. 216.119.143.43
<ul>
<li>I would say there is possibly a problem with perhaps 0-3 stubs. Even so, it depends on how you view the guidelines, i.e. do EPs count as releases? What makes a label notable? I tried to compile a list of artists that in my mind are notable, however since I am very familiar with the subject I might have went further than I intended in a few cases. -<a href="../../../l/d/_/User%7ELd_4f39.html" title="User:Ld">Ld</a> | <a href="../../../l/d/_/User_talk%7ELd_dfe2.html" title="User talk:Ld">talk</a> 23:24, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are making misleading remarks again, Ld, deliberate or not. The guideline clearly says "two albums" not "releases". The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">guidelines</a> clearly define that a label must be major or "important", it doesn't use the word notable, but it clearly defines the word "important" as I explained to you already in the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Fractal_Glider_e793.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Fractal Glider">Fractal Glider deletion section</a>, <b>"Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable)</b> (this is not to imply that the guidelines are the sole means of providing evidence of notability, but on the other hand I didn't see any mention of this group in the main "Trance" articles) 216.119.143.43 00:54, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> What I believe I established in the Fractal Glider article was that Boom! Records had too small a roster of notable performers to be considered important. Here are the facts: The label has released a grand total of 19 albums, 8 of which are compilation albums, 11 of which are actual albums. 2 of them were released by a probably notable performer [according to deletion consensus], Fractal Glider itself, and the only other performer ever on the roster that is included in All Music Guide released 1 album with Boom!, Ubar Tmar. Ubar Tmar may be notable, having released an album on a larger independent label afterwards, but he is no longer with the Boom! label. Also, all of the other performers, including Battle of the Future Buddhas, have fewer google hits than Fractal Glider. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.154.26.251.html" title="User:64.154.26.251">64.154.26.251</a> 03:23, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That springs from the fact that it seemed as if someone had put their record collection on the wiki without regard to quality, and then asked us to research and nominate the non-notables. See Lucy in Space with Diamonds with 60 Lycos hits. I'm fairly satisfied, now, that that is not the case. All Music Guide contains a great many foreign acts. David, can you suggest a better measure if you don't find that source reliable? 216.119.136.113 22:38, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

If not, it'll eventually get merged back into some larger list page. But having it here doesn't harm anything. It doesn't somehow lessen all of the other articles to have this one here.

<li>No, it's not a red herring - basically, a fictional character only has their appearence in the work of fiction - they do not exist outside of it, while real people exist in a wide range of ways.

<li>Interesting how you, similarly to a large number of anonymous IPs, repeatedly protest "facts" or "just facts" (in addition to a number of other commonalities of expression). But I digress.

<li><b>Delete</b>, part of a wider, sometimes stealthy spam attack on WP. Once they have these toeholds, the plan is to slip in links, bios, promos... at this point, these can probably be speedied as vandalism. I would add that one of the hallmarks of classic surrealist activity is self-promotion.

<li>I,agree with Wyss 100%. Starting off with a geocities website, then trying to establish notoriety and notability, (along with the benefits of unlimited and free exposure on here) upon having an article on Wikipedia is a shortcut to notability without having to produce the long term results that have a significant cutural impact. Anyone can get a geocities website and build their site and try to promote it on here.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 03:57, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>... although, given that (even before GRider changed it) <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html" title="Wikipedia:Google test">Wikipedia:Google test</a> clearly stated that the Google tests were biased and that their results should be scrutinised in the contexts of how Google works and what is published on the World Wide Web and on Usenet, I'm not too sure what that point actually was, other than perhaps "This article is valuable, <a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a>'s points on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EGoogle_test_62c6.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Google test">Wikipedia talk:Google test</a> are probably worth incorporating into it, and GRider's own use of Google in VFD illustrates quite nicely what this article warns about and thus contradicts xyr own nomination for it to be deleted.".<br />

<li><b>Keep.</b> Improve as needed. Google is a very good way to check for the existence of something. Despite occasionally expressed opinions to the contrary, so far <b>I</b> have not been able to find anything that I can verify as existing that doesn't at least <i>show up</i> in Google. You may not be able to find out anything <i>useful,</i> but someone, somewhere, will have <i>mentioned it.</i> 8 billion pages is a lot more than is indexed in any print encyclopedia, or the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature, or what have you. Google has obvious problems when used to evaluate the notability of unlike things (pop music stars versus classical composers). Google web searches have obvious problems because anyone can create a web page and Google will usually index it, and because there are well-known techniques for increasing Google ranking. This is much less of a problem with Google Groups. This is still subject to the problem that anyone can create content that Google will index, but relatively few people bother to do this. There is much less commercial push going on in Google Groups. Finally, Google News is only useful for <i>recent</i> material but it, too, casts a very wide net, and unlike other Google searches, the content that is indexed is <i>not</i> under the direct control of a would-be self-publicizers. <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html" title="Wikipedia:Google test">Wikipedia:Google test</a> useful in describing practices that Wikipedians use.

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> This seems like a totally valid article on a common Wikipedia phenomenon. There's obviously a lot of controversy surrounding the method, but that doesn't give its detractors the right to deny its existence. They should simply add a section on flaws, criticisms, etc. (and I believe such a section already exists). In any case, even if the google test method is totally discredited, this page should remain for historical purposes.

<li><b>Keep</b> Well, this encouraged me to finally get a Wikipedia account. I need to work on some of your arcade (full size arcade game) pages anyhow. About Digg, it isn't a large site, but I consider it a noteworthy one. It is the first worthwhile site that I am aware of it give editorial control back to the readers. (Not just to submit, but to promote stories to the front page.) This factor makes it an interesting data point in peer-to-peer journalism. Actually, I think this article should also be expanded to add in the benefits and flaws of this model. For example, really cool links from 1998 seem unavoidable in a peer edited story list. Also the changing of group desires over time and the influence of a vocal minority. FWIW, digg is referenced on the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a> entry.) <a href="../../../j/m/c/User%7EJmccorm_a6b0.html" title="User:Jmccorm">Jmccorm</a> 19:44, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC).

<li><b>Keep</b> It's nice to see that some people have the foresight to not only be a repository for news, but a built in reflection of public interest where peole choose what news they want. Ultimately this is a refreshing change from traditional media where specific groups of individuals determine what hits the airwaves, paper, or web. People choose! This is what my country (US) is supposed to be all about!
