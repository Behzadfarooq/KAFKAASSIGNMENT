<p>Marissa Anne Ball (October 19, 1983- ...) was born in Alexandria, Virginia. She traveled many places with her mother and father, Colonel and Mrs. George Lawson Ball, before moving to Augusta, Georgia. Marissa (nicknamed Missy) attended Augusta Preparatory Schools until the second grade, when a beautiful, bouncing baby girl named Catherine came into the Balls' life. With the miraculous arrival of Catherine, the family (Marissa, Colonel and Mrs. Ball, and David, Missy's little brother) moved to Lincoln County, a rural town north of Augusta. She started at Lincoln County Elementary, where she progressed onto Lincoln County Middle School and then Lincoln County High School, where she graduated in 2002 as valedictorian. Missy was also elected class president every year of her middle and high school careers. She founded the club Students Taking Action and Responsibility (STAR) her senior year, when she also served as yearbook co-editor with Dee Moss. Missy was a four-year varsity cheerleader and state-winner in extemporaneous speaking in spring literary at LCHS. She was also Central District 4H Senior Board President and State 4H Vice-President. After Marissa graduated, she spent the following three summers at Rock Eagle 4H Summer Camp, serving as a Muskogee Entomology teacher (summer 2002), a Shawnee Sports and Recreation councelor (summer 2003), and a tribal leadership councelor (summer 2004). During the school year, she attended University of Georgia. In the summer of 2005, Missy was an orientation leader for all uprising freshmen who were planning on attending UGA. She served as Sigma Delta Tau Eta Chapter's president. She will graduate from UGA with honors in May 2006. After graduation, she will travel to Mississippi for two years to teach in an underpriviledged school with the program 'Teach for America,' after which she will receive her teaching degree. Marissa then plans on going to law school.</p>

<p>Yesterday, 31st March 2006, Denise Lutgens wrote piano history. She is now 5 five time 1st prize winner and the <i>WC</i> for piano. She is still a very young girl, only 15 years old. But she is one of the most promissing pianist in the world. I think I can write in 5 or 10 years, that she is absolutely the best one there is. She is at the moment a student of Professor Vladimir Krainev. Also a very famous piano professor. Denise is born in the Netherlands on 19th July 1990 in Roermond. Her mother is half Russian, half Chinees, and her father is 3/4 Dutch, and 1/4 German. So she is really a mix. But yesterday she made everybody proud. She manely plays for Russia and almost never for the Netherlands, because they have always worked against her talent. She started playing the piano at age 6. Aged 8 she started studying with Russian people, because she loves the Russian school and Russia. In her early years, she lived in Moscow for a short time. She won already many internatonal piano competition on this young age, she played 7 big compettions and she won 6 times a 1st prize and once a 2nd prize. Who can say this? Not so many people. She once said in a interview. I would like to quot a faous figure skater, Evgeni Plushenko: I think I was born to be a pianist, and I thank God for letting it happen. She has a outstanding sound, a fantastic interpretation, and good tecnical skills. As she said: My technical skill aren't satisfiying me. I think they can be better. So I am still working on it. The moment I will play a perfect performence will be the one I quit. But I believe something as a perfect performence is impossible. There is always something that could be better. You should really listen to your own performance and than work on the moments that can be better. Even as good as she alraedy is, she will become even better. I think in the future we will hear a lot about her, and I think she can become as ig as a S. Richter, or a Horowitch. She has all the talent and the right people behind her to become one of the most famous pianist ever been in history!</p>

<p>"Space Is The Place" is a comic strip created by Tom Verheijen. It follows the adventures of Shnobb and Shnotzel who roam the space and sell comet impact insurance. Verheijen's style can be caustic dealing with the food chain, illegal science, and our planet through the use of a similar planet called "Urth" and inhabited by "umans". The strip consists of two separate runs, one that ended with 2005 and one that began with 2006.</p>

During the Trautmann Mediation, unfortunately, the <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape_of_Nanking_8f49.html" title="Rape of Nanking">Rape of Nanking</a> took place, putting the negotiations under considerable strain. Eventually, Konoe rather than Chiang broke off the negotiations, leaving <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiang_Kai-Shek_4a54.html" title="Chiang Kai-Shek">Chiang Kai-Shek</a> with a severe propaganda defeat, having asked for peace even after the <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape_of_Nanking_8f49.html" title="Rape of Nanking">Rape of Nanking</a>, presumably to prevent further Japanese violence and reprisals. Communist propaganda played upon Chiang's "submission" in the year following this, and the scale of Japanese atrocities in Nanking, with as many as 300,000 dead meant that this was a highly emotive issue - it is probable that the Trautmann Mediation had a major impact upon the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Civil_War_7f0d.html" title="Chinese Civil War">Chinese Civil War</a>, 1928-49.</p>

<p>Ann L. Stoler (1949-Present, The United States)</p>
<p>Ann Laura Stoler is a feminist anthropologist who showed there are different social statuses and power relationships within the category of women. Her article, Making Empire Respectable: The Politics of Race and Sexual Morality in Twentieth-Century Colonial Cultures, revealed a mechanism where privileged women can oppress poor women and men by simply following dominant social systems. Stoler examined European colonialism in Asia including the areas of contemporary India, Indonesia and Malaysia. Her examples of European colonialists included the Dutch, French and British. Stoler claimed that European women in colonies had two contrasting roles regarding their social status. They were oppressed by European men and also they oppressed indigenous people. The following description details this dynamic.</p>
<p>Stoler claimed that European colonialism was based on racial differences between whites and non-whites. The colonialists justified their prestige by defining themselves as a superior race compared to colonized people, who usually had darker skin. Although this racial distinction was useful for creating colonial authority, there was a pitfall in this system---the existence of mixed race children between European men and local women. Colonial administrations saw mixed-race children as a serious problem because their existence would blur the distinction between the superior and inferior races.</p>
<p>According to Stoler, European colonialism made profits from a particular economic system, where indigenous women lived in European men’s house doing domestic work. The use of local women kept wages low and also provided colonialists a way to control local economy and legal rights. Until the 20th century, colonial administrations were often hesitant to let European women live in colonies because the administrations believed that women would create a class of poor whites and would damage European prestige. Because of this political consideration, many European colonists were single men and they tended to generate mixed-race children with indigenous women living in their houses. Since these mixed-race children were illegitimate, they lived in poor circumstances outside of indigenous communities or became orphans. Colonial administrations considered these fair-skinned children as a danger that would undermine the basis of European colonialism.</p>
<p>In the early twentieth-century, European women were introduced to colonies in order to keep European men from generating mixed-race children. These women were controlled with strict rules that would benefit European colonialism. As wives of European men in colonies, they were responsible for watching their husbands to assure that they would not have contacts with indigenous women. European women fulfilled this responsibility by providing a happy family life for their husbands. In order to run a European household in the colonies, colonial European women were trained with detailed instructions about cleaning, cooking, childrearing and employer-servant relationships. They also made efforts to prevent their children from taking on customs and ideas of local culture. The ultimate purpose of these rules was to enforce racial and class distinctions between European colonists and native people. To achieve this goal, European women in colonies often created organizations to preserve European lifestyle and thought in colonies.</p>
<p>Stoler’s research reveals that European women in colonies had two contrasting roles: the oppressed and the oppressor. They were subject to strict rules that were aimed at providing a happy family life for men. In this sense, they were oppressed by this unbalanced gender relationship. At the same time, the same women contributed to European colonialism by actively enforcing racial segregation. In this sense, they oppressed indigenous people who otherwise would have had more freedom and self-determination.</p>
<p>Stoler's ideas about reading archives as field sites have also been well-recieved in the scholarly community.</p>

<p>Artist Arnold Friberg graduated from the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts in 1935. In 1953, Cecil B. DeMille, after searching worldwide for a powerful Biblical artist, was shown Friberg's religious series then in progress. In 1957-58, Friberg's monumental 15 paintings series for "The Ten Commandments" toured the world, and in 1970 was part of DeMille's exhibit honoring the 100th year of Hollywood, an exhibit seen by more than one million viewers.</p>
<p>In 1958, Arnold Friberg was made a lifetime member by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, of the Royal Society of Arts (RSA), London, in recognition of his contribution to mankind through his work.</p>
<p>Over a period of 42 years (1937-79), Friberg painted close to 300 repesentative "Mountie" images for the Northwest Paper Company. In 1978, the Friends of the Force, an affiliation of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, commissioned Arnold Friberg to paint a lifesize portrait of His Royal Highness Prince Charles with the splendid royal mount Centennial. The Friends of the Force were so pleased, they commissioned Mr. Friberg to paint a large royal equestrian portrait of Her Royal Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II mounted on Centennial, in the palace garden at Buckingham.</p>
<p>Other works of Arnold Friberg include: A series of 12 religious paintings commissioned by Mrs. Adele Cannon Howells; a 1969 series for General Motors depicting 100 years of American intercollegiate football; and a great number of highly prized historical paintings of the old American west. One favorite Friberg painting is the large, superb, "The Prayer at Valley Forge," commissioned for the 1976 Bicentennial celebration.</p>
<p>Arnold Friberg has been honored by his fellow artists and has been given tribute in western heritage art shows, most recently in 1991. Arnold Friberg has rightly earned his place as one of the enduring masters of our time.</p>
