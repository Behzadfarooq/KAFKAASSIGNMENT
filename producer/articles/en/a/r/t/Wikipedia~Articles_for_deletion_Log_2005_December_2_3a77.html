<li>Do Not Delete, One of the principle virtues of Wikipedia is its ability to catalogue the small-time or niche things that would never be covered in a conventional encyclopedia. For example, internet memes such as <a href="../../../o/_/r/O_RLY__dcc3.html" title="O RLY?">O RLY?</a>, which have a strong following in their own 'cult' communities would not and could not be featured in other encyclopedias because their format prevents them from listing niche notables. This readio show has a following in its particular community, it is one of the highest-rated shows on a St. Louis metropolitan radio station, <a href="../../../k/w/u/KWUR_53ed.html" title="KWUR">KWUR</a>. While the station's radio range itself does not boast broad accessability, their internet stream means that anyone with a connection the world over could potentially take advantage of their programming. Further, effort has clearly been exerted in the formation and maintenance of this article. This entry clearly conforms to the quality standards of Wikipedia. I think that this article and other niche notables do indeed have a place on Wikipedia and should therefore not be deleted. 21:00, 6 December 2005</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>, This show will last for two semesters and is broadcast via the airwaves, note <a href="../../../k/w/u/KWUR_53ed.html" title="KWUR">KWUR</a>. If you make a judgement on the size of the show as a criterium for deletion, then you would need to delete all pages on every radio show. I do think we would all agree Howard Stern does deserve a place on Wikipedia. This site is trying its best to conform to the standards of Wikipedia while chronicaling a niche part of history. Don't delete this article or a stub on the height of radio broadcast towers should also be deleted; they are just as irrelevent. At least here there is an interest and an valient effort to provide future generations information on a dying media form, freefrom radio broadcasting. ajpappal 05:00, 5 December 2005 (CST)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>, Wikipedia is a resource for free global knowledge and with the help of anyone with access to the internet, it has the obvious potential to become the world's most diverse and authoritative source for information. Why then would an article about a "small university radio program" be tagged for deletion? As users of Wikipedia we are suppose to record our knowledge into this database for the curious minds of the world. There are policies and criteria we must follow, but this article does not deviate from the standards any more than other articles which are revered for their presence. The answer to the question would seem to lie in the minds of those who want to regulate the information contained within wikipedia. Perhaps before one considers an article for deletion they must ask themselves if they have the global authority to remove human knowledge from this unprecedented resource. Although just a small radio program, it nonetheless exists and has full right to be recorded into history. Who are we to decide what cannot be recorded into history? We cannot even begin to comprehend the utility that these "small" entries will carry in the future. Instead of deleting information, these articles should be suggested for standardization to the accepted guidelines of wikipedia where they can exist side by side with other articles recording the activities and perceptions of humanity. --trhermes 03:11, 7 December 2005 (CST)</li>

<li>As you said, it's a verifiable fictional character, like many others in Wikipedia. Wikipedia should be the sum of parts of the GFDL Wikis that is generally encyclopedic according to the standards of Wikipedia. More importantly, deletion provokes some of the most violent arguments among people who would contribute to Wikipedia. People already complain of deletion vandalism. The last thing we need is to start deleting things that there is no policy against, just because someone thought it should be deleted. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 06:32, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Everything is possibly a copyvio. Look first, though. It's copied from a GFDL website, as mentioned above, so there should be no problem.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Perhaps I did overreact in nominating this.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>comment</b> As originator of this article, I will provide an explanation. (One is certainly warranted, and I agree that the case for a separate article isn't immediately apparent.) A Federal Reserve Note is, as most of you know, different from a Silver Certificate or a United States Note, however $1 notes (and other denominations) have been issued in all three of these forms, as well as others. Yes, it is certainly possible to smush them all together in one page about the $1 note, but there are several very distinct issues of that note, and considering the a) interest numismatists would have in the topic and b) ease and cheapness of including more info and detail on a separate page, I strongly think this page (and others like it) should be kept. I of course would have created articles for the other denominations and other series of notes. Having this would make Wikipedia a highly authoritative source on the history of U.S. currency (an area in which I am greatly interested, as you no doubt could tell) just as it is a respected source of information on other topics. Please, keep this article and let me work on improving it further. If the entire series draws the wrath of the WP public, then ditch it--redirecting it back to the old article is easy. Give it a chance, though.

<li><b>More comments</b> While I'm on the subject, I'll share a few other thoughts. Firstly, there are articles for each type of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_coin_edb7.html" title="United States dollar coin">United States dollar coin</a>, and the article for the note could easily be modeled after this one. Secondly, strictly speaking, there is no such thing as a "U.S. one dollar bill"-yes, that's what everyone calls it, but hairsplitting aside, our readers deserve a precisely titled article describing what the thing actually is (what it looks like, who issued it, and what its role in the history of the U.S. economy is--each note has a different story.) Continuing in that vein, the history of U.S. paper money is far too rich to be condensed into one article for each denomination - images of each issue could be presented on the article about it - and far more information could be presented (images of every one dollar note would clutter up a single article...put the first and most recent on the main article and the others in their own!) Anyway, please consider the usefulness of this article and the ones like it, and I look forward to working on them. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHanson_59b8.html" title="User:PaulHanson">Paul</a> 14:25, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>First: naming convention is that articles go under the <i>most common</i> name, not the most technically correct name. Second, everything should go into the single article on the one-dollar bill <i>until</i> it gets too big, for two reasons: this is an encyclopedia, not a <i>desk</i> encyclopedia or a Britannica 3 "Micropaedia" and articles should follow summary form, starting with the basics and getting deeper; second, splitting articles tends to result in much unnecessary repetitive material. For example, if you have one article you can describe the Treasury seal and in depth and then say "the Treasury seal on the United States note is similar but printed in red" without having to describe it all again... <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:08, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I see what you mean, although I believe the differences between the different notes are more subtle and more significant than just the color of the treasury seal. And yes, you are right that the most common name is better than the most technical one--99% of Americans wouldn't know a US note from an FRN, and therefore just calling the thing a one dollar note is useful in clarifying. However, if you look at the one dollar coin article, I think you will see information on that very large topic (in terms of how many different coins there actually are) structured in a clear and informative manner. That is how I strongly advocate we proceed with the articles on notes. As far as repetitive material, that would only be a problem if the superficial differences between the notes are described. If more useful information is included, than that will cease to be an issue. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHanson_59b8.html" title="User:PaulHanson">Paul</a> 15:45, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dpsmith hit it on the head: there should be a section in U.S. Currency that can describe the various types of currency (United States Note <i>vs.</i> Federal Reserve Note <i>vs.</i> Silver Certificate <i>vs.</i> Gold Certificate) that generally covers all the denominations (and can use different denominations in its pictures) instead of slicing and dicing it so thinly as to make it useless. Wikipedia would be better served concentrating on having these note types in one heading and the history of the design of the currency in each of the denominations' sections/articles instead. <a href="../../../1/4/7/User%7E147.70.242.21.html" title="User:147.70.242.21">147.70.242.21</a> 20:37, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Actually it doesn't open up a pandora's box. The pandora's box is already wide open, as each and every porn article on Wikipedia has their own official site as a reference. Indeed, all of the sites are required to have something in order to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. So unless Wikipedia makes a ruling to ban all porn sites, such a criticism can't work. But I am suggesting that a consensus be made on what to do with pornography related articles, so if you like you can contribute to that. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 06:25, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> His site is one of the most popular on the net. And since making <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_%28film%29.html" title="November (film)">November (film)</a> a featured article in time for the DVD isn't advertising, neither is this. <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangbus.html" title="Bangbus">Bangbus</a> has a page, and there are plenty of articles on wikipedia less "important" than Milf hunter (1000 alexa ranking is high).

<li><b>Question</b>. What is Wikipedia's policy regarding porn sites? It's been estimated that about two-thirds of the Internet traffic is visiting porn sites, and many of the most-visited sites are hardcore in nature. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 04:11, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors</a>. Objections to coverage of pornography topics simply based upon content are invalid, and are soundly rejected by most editors. However, that doesn't excuse pornography topics from the requirement of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a>, although sometimes some editors try to distract the argument away from verifiability by trying to make the argument about content. Many people in the pornography industry are unverifiable <i>by their own deliberate choice</i>, to protect their identities because of the nature of what they do, and thus make themselves too secret for Wikipedia. Much of the information published about pornography actors and actresses, including (in many cases) their names, is simply made up. Some editors apply the Google Test to pornography topics, but, as explained at <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_Test_6be3.html" title="Wikipedia:Google Test">Wikipedia:Google Test</a>, there is a whole sub-industry of the pornography industry that is devoted to gaming Google, and it is utterly useless as any sort of metric.

<li><b>Keep</b> - this is the most well known of all of the internet porn sites (other than ones like playboy etc that have their own magazines). They have their own feature films etc, and have something in the order of 100 other porn sites as spin offs or inspired by. Also remember that this was the first MILF porn site, something which became an actual category of porn sites, because it was so popular. When I was seeing some of the other porn sites in here, I was wondering if this one existed. But it should be renamed to MILF Hunter, to be accurate. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 21:10, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - just an addendum here. <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bang_bus.html" title="Bang bus">Bang bus</a>, which is an existing less notable article, seems to be a spin off from MILF hunter... Also, you should note that the Alexa rank for porn sites is unrealistic, as there are more than 1 site for the exact same place. There are I believe 15 different web sites that are mirrors of MILF hunter, all with (slightly) different content. Therefore, its true Alexa ranking would be around 300th. And we are thinking of deleting the 300th most popular web site in the world? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 22:23, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I expanded hugely on the article. Note that Shawn Rees is *NOT* Milf Hunter. Milf Hunter refers to the phenomenon. Shawn Rees *occasionally* refers to himself as "The hunter" but almost never as "Milf Hunter". Whilst he is in *almost* every video (there are a few with just 2 girls going at it), it does not necessarily revolve around him. However, it should be noted that most of the other MILF copies (all based on this site) have a variety of men as the focus, and hence MILF Hunter will too if and when Shawn Rees gives up/gets too old/etc. It is therefore not a biography. And indeed, describing it purely as a web site is misleading. They have had feature films and videos and DVDs and all sorts of things. It is better described as a phenomenon. I am astounded that something like this was even nominated for deletion. As I said elsewhere, it is in fact harder for a porn site to meet the alexa ranking test because they have so many mirrors and visitors do not all go to the same web site. For it to make it by 10 times in spite of that makes this nomination quite silly. Of all internet porn sites that you could consider, this is the most notable.

<li>This and Molecular economics (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Molecular_economics_94d0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Molecular economics">AfD discussion</a>) have all the hallmarks of a university student hoax. The mutually supporting articles and the inclusion of a purported reference are unusual.

The fact that Arthur W. Baron is a contributor to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dartmouth_Review_21bd.html" title="The Dartmouth Review">The Dartmouth Review</a></i>, which AaronS is citing here as evidence, is also telling. From all appearances, AaronS is in on the hoax, and this is a prank played <i>on</i> Mr Baron, by <i>Review</i> staffers, rather than <i>by</i> him. Where imagination has particularly failed the perpetrator(s) is in the litany of comments in the AFD discussions offering personal testimony, stating that the article should be kept because it is "interesting", and claiming the existence of sources but not actually supplying them. This is an age-old "keep our hoax" pattern. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 06:22, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b>, this list contains only two entries - the first (<i>computer science</i>) is merely a disambig link, and the second (<i>optics</i>) contains a link to a page that hasn't even been created.

<li><b>Note</b>. As of listing, the article has been in existence for roughly one half hour. This should be taken into account in the voting process.

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>: This is an impossible to maintain list in its perfect form. "Academic conferences" would not just be the annual APA conference, wherever it may be, and the BPA conference, wherever it may be; nor would it be "MLA" and "ASECS." In a perfect form, it would be "MLA, SAMLA, NEMLA, SCMLA, PCMLA, MTMLA" then "ASECS, NESECS, SESECS, SCSECS," etc., and then it would be "SAMLA Atlanta 2005" and "SAMLA Charleston 2006" etc. I.e. a list of <b>every academic conference</b> would eat up all our servers, and that's just the United States. Add in the UK. Add in France. Add in Belgium, Spain, Netherlands, all the Scandinavian nations, Germany, Russia, etc. Simply put, there is no conceivable way that a list could be fashioned, much less maintained. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:07, 2 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Interiot makes a very good argument. I still have to say <b>weak delete</b>: I almost think that a list of major academic conferences should go into <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_conference.html" title="Academic conference">academic conference</a> or some similar larger article and then the list be a {{prettytable}}. I know I'm getting into content advice and not dispensation deliberation, here, but I agree with the content, just not a list that can't be complete or maintained. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:56, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, we tackle a similar problem in <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_fair.html#List_of_trade_fairs" title="Trade fair">Trade fair#List of trade fairs</a>. It's good to promintently note in the article that there are huge number of them, to make it clear that every single one shouldn't be listed there, as some simply aren't notable enough. However, I think it's good to have a list like this because, IMHO, there are some that aren't notable enough to have their own page on Wikipedia, but are notable enough to be briefly mentioned on <i>some</i> page somewhere on wikipedia, and something like this is one potential home for those medium-notability items. In terms of categorization, that can be <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="meta:Eventualism">worked out in time</a>, organically, once the article starts growing. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 20:30, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as un-maintainable. At least trade fairs are held on a regular schedule for a number of years. While some academic conferences fit that description, there an awful lot of them, and an awful lot of ad-hoc one-off conferences.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> per Interiot. Let's see if this article goes anywhere - perhaps they will develop reasonable standards to deal with Geogre's concern, and it seems we have many other long lists around. <a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a> | <sup><a href="../../../e/s/k/User_talk%7EESkog_7643.html" title="User talk:ESkog">Talk</a></sup> 13:53, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Agree with Interiot. There is certainly a value in having a list of major <b>regular</b> confererences in all fields of academia. The fact that the list has just been created and does not have many entries for now should not be a reason to delete it for good. Instead, we should all work to enrich the list with what we know. In most academic fields, there are only a few truly prestigious conferences. For fields that have too many small conferences, sublists can be created to solve the problem.

<li><b>Delete</b> since it's here. While it might have been posted by somebody from the church, they might not have permission from the writer to use it. Even if they do, they often don't <i>really</i> want to give permission to post it, as they give up some of their rights as to how it can be used and it can be modified however Wikipedia wants. Also, sometimes they never come back to Wikipedia after posting the article, so we're never able to find out if they have permission.

Whilst it'd be interesting to find out about Accents and Dialects of the English language (particularly in England and United States, where they have the largest variation of accents of any country), suggesting that it has to do with race etc is just wrong. Maybe, just maybe, we could consider rewriting it as a whole other title, whole other way of doing it, about accents and dialects full stop. But nah, then we are starting over anyway. There is nothing of value in that article. Nothing to salvage. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 16:25, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: It's original research on a topic upon which there is massive scholarly research. British accents have long had class associations, and they still do. In Australia, the British accent (as opposed to "Ozzie" accent) had a class marker. In the United States, each region has a prestige dialect (e.g. Plantation Southern, Mid-Atlantic, Ivy, etc.). These class hierarchies are persistent. Furthermore, there have been new class dialects emerging, and some dialectology research suggests that regional accents themselves are becoming prestige markers (as there is an amalgamation of accents in the highly mobile middle class, leaving only the wealthy to grow up in one place and Black English as a universal "poor" accent). So, in fact, there is a great deal to say -- too much, in fact -- that could be and should be heavily cited. However, it isn't really encyclopedic so much as it would be scholarly. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:47, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Move to user page</b> for the time being. Right now, it's just a truism and an outline. I have every confidence that a valid, referenced, and encyclopedic article could indeed be written on the social status of various speech habits, and that there's enough here to warrant a separate article outside the broad overview of regional differences. As it stands now, the page is rather short on actual information. We should give the author every opportunity to finish it. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 17:51, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>move to user page</b> - Basically I agree with Geogre's observations but Smerdis of Tlön's conclusion. It's plainly a work in progress on a massive subject, so give the author a chance to develop the article, cite other sources, to avoid the "original research" problem. With so much trivia around, it seems wrong to get rid of something serious too hastily<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJameswilson_10c0.html" title="User:Jameswilson">Jameswilson</a> 02:08, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes. I'm a fan of the Predator series. There's been no real evidence they're going to do a Predator 3, especially considering Predator 2 was made <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100403/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100403/" rel="nofollow">15 years ago</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - even though this topic is of ZERO interest to me personally, in the interests of fairness I rewrote the article somewhat, with reference not only to the Predator 3 movie, but also the 4 other commonly used ways to describe Predator 3. The reality is that Predator 3 already exists, as both a novel, comic and video game. There already exists a script. It is just a matter of when, and what precisely the movie will contain. I gave details of what the movie will be about, and confirmation as to what stage it is at, to ensure that we make fair votes here. Apparently the recent hype (as evidenced by the 44,000 google hits) is because Arnold Schwarzenegger has recently agreed to be a part of the movie, and a director has been found, hence pre-production is underway. This, combined with the success of Aliens vs Predator has meant that this movie is now going to be made. If you delete this, then its silly, because it will just be re-created later on. I suppose that <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Immediatism" class="extiw" title="m:Immediatism">immediatists</a> don't see the value in this. Delete this, and you free up server space for oh 3 months, before its going to be back in force and then we'll have a whole big argument about whether or not it should be up now, or later, etc. Not to mention the fact that there are a range of products that have already been released. It's kind of like refusing to have an article on Star Wars 7 because it hasn't been produced yet. There's already a book and a script there. Star Wars 7 movie, fine, maybe there's an argument to prevent that. But Star Wars 7 full stop should exist. Its a similar kind of case here.

<li>Not sure. There's so many fan fic books and spin offs that its hard to tell the official from the fan fics. There were initially 9 books in the series, 3 trilogies.

<li>The first movie, called simply <i>Star Wars</i>, was issued in 1977. At the time, George Lucas said he planned to make a trilogy of trilogies, with <i>Star Wars</i> being the first film of the second trilogy. He intended to issue a new film in the series every three years, but waited 16 years after <i>Return of the Jedi</i> to make <i>The Phantom Menace</i>. All the books and ancillary products came later. Any books set in a time period after <i>Return of the Jedi</i> are the works of others, and not necessarily part of George Lucas' conception. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Dalbury</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b> 11:46, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Economic_fascism_ed0f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Economic fascism">deleted before</a>, only to be ressurected again. It is unencyclopedic and has no hope of ever being anything other than a stub or a description of the views held by some <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">libertarians</a> on the issue of state intervention in the economy. The definition of fascism is highly disputed; the existence of a separate economic system called "economic fascism" is not supported by the majority of economists and historians. The idea that state intervention in the economy is inherently fascist would be seen as utterly absurd by all but a handful of authors, all of which are economic libertarians. The term "economic fascism" does not appear in any encyclopedic sources. At this point, the article does not contain any information which is not already present in <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a>, and I believe that that article is the appropriate location for discussing fascist economic policies and the various interpretations given to them. A separate article for one particular such interpretation is not only unneeded, but positively harmful given the controversy and POV surrounding anything related to fascism. <b>Delete.</b> Mihnea Tudoreanu 07:21, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment to voters from author of article</b>: The statement above: "The idea that state intervention in the economy is inherently fascist would be seen as utter absurd..." is misleading. The article does not say that. It clearly says it's an overall economic system including a "<a href="../../../p/l/a/Planned_economy.html" title="Planned economy">planned economy</a>" and "<b>heavy</b> coordination of the means of production, among other characteristics. Mere economic intervention is <b>not</b> "inherently fascist." The article says no such thing nor gives any such impression (This message left 5 days after voting started, unfortunately). <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 15:57, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment to Administrators</b> I'd just like to note that Minhea Tudoreanu is going around spreading false information in campaigning to get this article deleted. He's writing to various editors' talk pages the following: "There is an ongoing attempt to define state intervention in the economy as inherently fascist through the creation of an article entitled economic fascism..." This is false. The article clearly says that economic fascism includes a "<a href="../../../p/l/a/Planned_economy.html" title="Planned economy">planned economy</a>" and says the means of production are "<b>heavily</b> coordinated"; it obviously does not say that economic fascism is mere intervention. Of course people are going to vote to delete if that's what it said. *I* would vote to delete in that case or edit the article to say otherwise. Tudoreanu placed this message in the Talk pages of users such as <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">user:El_C</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/s/User%7ESesel_cc8a.html" title="User:Sesel">user:Sesel</a>, and <a href="../../../r/u/y/User%7ERuy_Lopez_187d.html" title="User:Ruy Lopez">user:Ruy Lopez</a> who then voted to delete. <b>Administrators please take note of this in your analysis.</b> <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 05:42, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As one of the users receiving a notice from Minhea Tudoreanu, I reject the claim that he has sent me false information. Even if he were sending false information, the point would be moot. I respect Minhea Tudoreanu; but I do not vote based on how he tells me to vote. I am certain that the same is the case with the other editors receiving the notices... Since RJII has metioned Minhea, I will use this thread as a chance to offer him a belated thanks for the message. I would not have seen this AfD had it not been for his note on my talk page. I hope that he continues to send me similar notices so that I can better stay informed of important discussions on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 09:07, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So that explains your confusion over what the article is about. In order to give this some semblance of being fair. I'm going to have to leave a few notices on the Talk pages of others. But, unlike Tudoreanu, I'm not going to misrepresent the article. I'm just going to let them know a vote is going on. This won't fix the damage that has been done by Tudoreanu, because obviously he has misled several, but it may help alleviate the injustice. <b>Administrators</b>: Please give me time to do this. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 15:45, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> <i>Economic fascism</i> is a notable term that deserves its own article. It has over 11,000 hits on a Google search. Scholoarly papers are written about it, use the term, etc. Minhea Tudoreany, who put this article up for deleteion says "the idea that state intervention in the economy is inherently fascist would be seen as utterly absurd by all but a handful of authors, all of which are economic libertarians." Well, the article says nothing of the sort so I don't know where he's getting that. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 14:58, 2 December 2005 (UTC) (author of the article)
<ul>
<li>The number of google hits can tell you whether a term is widely used, but it cannot tell you whether it deserves its own article.

<li>What does the fact that "Almost all those google hits for "economic fascism" are from economic libertarians" have to do with anything? The fact is, the term is used and is notable.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> In and of itself the term "economic fascism" is a non-encyclopedic neologism. Yes, the term gets 11,000 hits on Google; but that tells us nothing more than the fact that the term gets 11,000 hits on Google. A Google search is a terrible indicator of anything, especially encyclopedic standards. Just about any non-encyclopedic neologism will get literally thousands of Google hits. For example, compare the number of hits generated by "economic fascism" to the number of hits generated by "American fascism," another unencyclopedic ahistorical term used in polemics. "American fascism" gets 78,000 hits. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22american+fascism%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22american+fascism%22" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> (BTW, if a misguided user were ever to start an article on "<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_fascism.html" title="American fascism">American fascism</a>," I suspect that some of the "keep" voters here would join me in supporting an AfD on such an entry.) Nevertheless, the term "economic fascism" has a place in a certain context on Wikipedia; a self-standing entry, though, is defiantly not the proper context. Most references to the term online are inspired by a fairly well-known essay among libertarian circles (and even some academic circles that have done some interesting comparative work on the notion of a 'welfare-warfare state' and its relation to the political economies of the European fascist regimes-- though academics never use the term themselves) by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_DiLorenzo_2abd.html" title="Thomas DiLorenzo">Thomas DiLorenzo</a> entitled "Economic Fascism." <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo85.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo85.html" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> RJII's work would thus have a proper place in the Thomas J. DiLorenzo article under a section summarizing his essay "Economic Fascism." Since the term "economic fascism" is so strongly associated with DiLorenzo, the Wikipedia page "economic fascism" can even be redirected to the DiLorenzo article. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 00:48, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree for you in the most part and although I haven't voted here my reason for not voting delete is that in an encyclopedia where we have an article for <i><a href="../../../s/l/a/Slanted_and_Enchanted_60df.html" title="Slanted and Enchanted">Slanted and Enchanted</a></i> (non-notable album) why not have an article for economic fascism which seems to be more notable than many of our album pages. I suppose the issue with this is that it skews all of the work on economics to a POV rant when every little epithet gets an article. So, because of those views I can only be neutral. Your reasoning was pretty sound, but, when our notability standards are so low is there reason not to create this page? I really don't know the answer. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 01:12, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You have a point in that there have been occasions with little political epithets creeping into Wikipedia and getting their own article. But I consider that trend on Wikipedia quite unfortunate and worrisome overall. If we can't spot all the problems, the best we can do is not allow the ones that do get listed on AfD to get by, and draw a line in the sand for encyclopedic standards whenever we get the chance. IMO this entry is somewhat more problematic than most epithets that get listed on AfD for a reason that is quite subtle. The term "Economic Fascism: is most notable as an essay by DiLorenzo. As an essay, "Economic Fascism" is a proper noun and thus capitalized and put in quotations. However, the article subject to the AfD at the moment is an article on "<a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_fascism.html" title="Economic fascism">economic fascism</a>" in the lowercase, which gives the impression that the term is not primarily notable as an essay (referred to in uppercases) but rather as an accepted historical term not in need of attribution. In this sense, giving the impression that a neologism is an established historical term is subtle, but can have a very powerful propaganda effect. IMO, AfD voters should be especially sensitive when it comes to spotting neologisms, as they may not be too noticeable at first glance, despite being as egregious a violation of NPOV as any. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 02:10, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Gren, it's not that it's a non-notable term, it's that it's not really a term at all. Economic fascism is more of a smear than a scholarly term with a defined and accepted meaning. The article as it exists is terribly vague. Nearly all sources that talk about economics under fascist governments talk about <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporatism.html" title="Corporatism">Corporatism</a>, which was the principal economic theory developed by Italian fascists and proto-fascists. This article should redirect straight to Corporatism. —thames 14:44, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No one is saying that the notion of "economic fascism" is intellectually unimportant. The term is neologism, and as such has its place in the <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_DiLorenzo_2abd.html" title="Thomas DiLorenzo">Thomas DiLorenzo</a> article, where his essay can be summarized, but not as a self-standing entry. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 02:51, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>DiLorenzo is not the only person that has talked about economic fascism. What are you talking about it's a "neologism"? It's not a neologism. What if the article was called "fascist economics"?; would that be a neologism? You'd probably say "no" unless DiLorenzo titled his article "fascist economics," in which case you would be claiming it was a neologism. There has to be some way to refer to the economics practiced in fascist nations. "Economic fascism" seems to be the most common way of referring to it. It's not a "neologism." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 02:56, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>DiLorenzo is the most notable. He is not the only one using the term in the sense that other libertarians have been influenced by his work and now use the term themselves. The term is a neologism in the sense that it is use of a new term based on historically established terms to describe the patters that DiLorenzo is attempting to sketch. There's nothing wrong with that. A neologism can be innovative while unencyclopedic at the same time. As for "fascist economics," the term "economics" refers to the study of the economy. For now there is no school of thought among economists describing itself as "fascist." For now the term "fascist economics" only seems to have meaning in the lexicon of the <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_LaRouche_df0c.html" title="Lyndon LaRouche">Lyndon LaRouche</a> cult, which published an article entitled "Arnie Rolls Out the Coming Fascist Economics in California." <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22fascist+economics%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22fascist+economics%22" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 03:18, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's still very strange what you're saying. As far back as the 1930's and 40's people were describing the economic system that was particular to fascist nations as being distinct from others systems. Whether you want to call an article "economic fascism," "fascist economics," "economic systems in fascist economies," it's all the same thing. "Economic fascism" is just the most common language used to refer to summation of the economic characteristics found in fascist nations. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:42, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If we clearly define our terms what I am saying will not be difficult to grasp. In the interwar era, "Fascism" referred to an ideological and political movement with often-changing and often-nebulous goals and tenants, particularly on economic policy. Today among historians, the argument that you just asserted-- that there was an economic system particular to fascist nations and distinct from other systems-- is subject to a considerable amount of debate. Circumscribing the topic of fascist economic thought is quite difficult because, depending on when at where you look, a different picture may emerge. Even more unclear to historians is the question concerning whether or not we can even speak of a 'fascist economic system,' a topic subject to a considerable amount of debate. DiLorenzo says 'yes' from a libertarian perspective, and popularized the term "economic fascism." The problem for Wikipedia is that turning his neologism "economic fascism" into an article implicitly means that Wikipedia is accepting his POV on a controversial debate, which, of course, goes against the Wikipedia principle of NPOV. BTW, there are many articles where you can work on the issues that interest you here. The libertarian perspective on "economic fascism" can be described in articles related to DiLorenzo. Details on the economies of Germany and Italy in the 1930 and 1940s can be found in the specialized entries dealing with the economic histories of those two countries. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 04:33, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>DiLorenzo is not the only person who talks about economic practices peculiar to fascist nations.

<li>Indeed he is not. But DiLorenzo is the main writer associated with the neologism "economic fascism" in the discourse on the question of economic practices particular to fascist nations from the perspective adoped in the article now up for AfD. Given the NPOV policy, the place for a discussion of the question of "economic practices particular to fascist nations" cannot be under a title that endorses DiLorenzo's POV, which is far from being universally accepted, but rather in more general entry on fascism or economic history. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 07:34, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

The article in question, however, makes "economic fascism" sound mor elike an epithet free-market purists sling at people they oppose. I don't think that warrants its own article. The article on the New Deal can discuss debates among Americans at the time as to whether Roosevelt was saving capitalism, or inventing his own form of communism or fascism, drawing on contemporary sources. Beyond that, the Fascism and Corporatism articles should provide full discussions of their economic dimensions. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 17:36, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>You're having the same confusion as a few others here. You're reading some external links and taking them as being part of the content of the article.

<li>No. First, the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> article should have a <i>section</i> on "Fascist economics" (not "economic fascism).

<li>So you have a problem with it being called "economic fascism" but not "fascist economics"? That's ludicrous! What the hell difference make what it's called? "Economic fascism" is just common terminology to refer to it. Someone above said "the term "fascist economics" only seems to have meaning in the lexicon of the <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_LaRouche_df0c.html" title="Lyndon LaRouche">Lyndon LaRouche</a> cult."

<ul>
<li>What "the hell difference [does it] make what it's called?" The difference has to do with what is the noun and what is the adjective. In English, meaning is produced largely through different parts of speech; the rules governing these parts of speech involve English sentence structure. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 19:10, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And the noun-adjective form behind "economic fascism" goes with the convention. There is <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_liberalism.html" title="Economic liberalism">economic liberalism</a>, <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_individualism.html" title="Economic individualism">economic individualism</a>, and <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_fascism.html" title="Economic fascism">economic fascism</a>. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:16, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, not with Wikipedia's conventions-- maybe with certain libertarian authors who propose such a taxonomy, but not Wikipedia's, given the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 06:20, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So if the term is used by laissez-faire types you want to censor it. Talk about POV! <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 07:18, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I am not advocating censorship but rather proper attribution of sources. In this sense we are respecting the rights of Thomas J. DiLorenzo's to his intellectual property (such as his essay "Economic Fascism"). The "laissez-faire types" like defending private property, right? Now, once the source of the ideas underlying the contents of the article on VfD is duly noted, the content does not have to be "censored" but rather moved to an entry related to DiLorenzo. There are places where his work can be summarized on Wikipedia. However, pretending that a neologism, which he popularized in his essays, is encyclopedic, somehow transcending the need to attribute his ideas, is not the proper way to go about detailing libertarian thought on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 08:01, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Intellectual property? No one owns the term "economic fascism." The term is is pretty widespread use. And, it's not a "neologism." DiLorenzo was using the term back in the early 90's. This is almost 2006, man. Economic fascism is the economic system that typically exists in fascist regimes. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 15:31, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>According to DiLorenzo, "economic fascism" was the system that you are describing in the article. He popularized the term, and indeed others in libertarian circles have been influenced by his work. Still, his work has not come anywhere close to reaching universal acceptance in academic literature on the economic history of the 1930s and 1940s. Actually, I'm not even aware that it has had any influence at all outside libertarian circles. Others find it much more difficult to speak of such a clear-cut relation. Thus, the term "fascist" in the strict NPOV sense refers to ideology/political affiliation and regime (under fascist rule). When using the term in a less restrictive sense, in this case using it to refer to an 'economic system,' there must be a reference to the research making the connection. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 01:53, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What are you talking about? DiLorenzo might have "popularized the term" but he didn't invent economic fascism and didn't invent the so-called "term." Get it through your head, man --the article is not about DiLorenzo or nor has anything to do with his personal philosophy. It has to do with the economic system present in fascist nations. Whether DiLorenzo popularized the term "economic fascism" to label this system is not materially important, as the term is a pretty common term today. Hence, it's the proper term to title on article on the economic system present in fascist nations. If this article is deleted, I'll create another article with same information but with a different title (unfortunately, and ironically, with a less notable title). The title is not as important as the content. You have a problem with the title of the article because DiLorenzo, who you apparently have a beef with, uses that term.

This economic theory was expounded by the Italian Fascists as an economic third way between capitalism and socialism, was implemented in Italy, and implemented in part (in parallel to a more general war economy) in Germany.

<li>If it has no academic credibility then why are academics using it? The guy who supposedly "popularized" the so-called "term" is a professor of economics at Loyola at Baltimore. Richard Ebeling uses it who is a professor of economics at Hillsdale. Jutta Schmitt uses it, who is a political science academic at University de Los Andes in Venezuela. And, so on. In other words, it has academic credibility. Morever, academic credibility is not even a prerequistite for an article.

<li><b>Delete</b>: Zordrac, you need to take a look at it, as no one is saying "no verification." Instead, the chief grounds for deletion is that it's advertising. Further, it looks like a copy and paste of a promotional brochure. Further, even if it weren't advertising, we would have the question of whether this is notable <i>among websites.</i> The online casinos are geniuses at getting links. It's what they do. In fact, some have had the habit of automatically downloading client software on people who click their banner ads.

<dd>So rewrite it. Simple. I have argued this point elsewhere. An article should be kept/deleted based on its topic, not on its contents as they stand right now. There are lots of reasons for this, which I have stated elsewhere. Fundamentally, look at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">M:Eventualism</a> for the rationale. IMO your argument suggests a keep vote. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 03:50, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't mean to get into a debate on wikiphilosophy here, but am compelled to justify my nomination in light of your comment: I think I would be less inclined to vote Delete if there was <i>some</i> content worth salvaging. If the article could be pared down to the bare information, sans all the advertising cruft, then by all means, let's do it. But I personally see no notable information in the current version worth keeping, and have insufficient knowledge of, or interest in the subject matter to perform a rewrite. So if choosing between leaving it for possibly weeks (months?) before a knowledgeable editor performs a rewrite, or deleting it now and letting a knowledgeable editor recreate it in weeks/months, I find I much prefer the latter. Cheers. --<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeruvianllama_baf8.html" title="User:Peruvianllama">PeruvianLlama</a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeruvianllama_bd23.html" title="User talk:Peruvianllama">spit</a>)</small></sup> 04:32, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I had a comment all written up that started almost identically, but I aborted it, since I was worried this wasn't the place for it. Following your lead, though, I'll point out that I think if an article like this is kept, it is unlikely to ever be rewritten. I doubt many people are willing to totally rewrite an article with over 10kB of text, and this article definitely needs to be totally rewritten. However, in the spirit of, well, putting my money where my mouth is, don't be <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">surprised</a> if I take an axe to the text if it's kept. <tt>;)</tt> <span class="user-sig user-horsepunchkid">—<a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorsePunchKid_a248.html" title="User:HorsePunchKid"><span style="font-family:monospace;font-variant:small-caps;cursor:crosshair;white-space:nowrap;">HorsePunchKid</span></a>→<a href="../../../h/o/r/User_talk%7EHorsePunchKid_fa6d.html" title="User talk:HorsePunchKid"><span style="color:#070;cursor:help;" title="Kame-san says: Talk to me!">龜</span></a> <span class="user-sig-date"><a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_3.html" title="December 3">12-03</a>&#160;04:58:49<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></span></span>

<dd>Yeah, I've done that a couple of times. I figure that if I believe enough that the topic is worth keeping then I should be willing to fix it.

<dd>By the way, in answer to the way above: It is advertising, and, to restate what was ignored, <i>if it were not advertising</i> (i.e. if all the rewriting took place), it would still be a website, and Wikipedia is not a web guide. The usual standards of assessing web pages include number of mentions on Google, but porn and gambling sites will screw that right up, as they aggressively (and illegally, betimes) elevate their hit counts. <b>Therefore delete</b> from all of the above (current status = ad; perfect status = web guide; web value unverifiable due to the business model).

<dd>Oy. Sorry about that; I got to the link from contributions from a user who has been spamming Wikipedia with <a href="../../../n/i/a/NIASOM_1fa2.html" title="NIASOM">NIASOM</a>-related info (note the reference to NIA in the article), and obviously I didn't read the article carefully enough. I'm trying to come up with another reason for deletion here, and not really finding one. It does appear to be a valid concept with a specific definition, but I'm not informed enough to say whether or not the article has any merit. <span class="user-sig user-horsepunchkid">—<a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorsePunchKid_a248.html" title="User:HorsePunchKid"><span style="font-family:monospace;font-variant:small-caps;cursor:crosshair;white-space:nowrap;">HorsePunchKid</span></a>→<a href="../../../h/o/r/User_talk%7EHorsePunchKid_fa6d.html" title="User talk:HorsePunchKid"><span style="color:#070;cursor:help;" title="Kame-san says: Talk to me!">龜</span></a> <span class="user-sig-date"><a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2.html" title="December 2">12-02</a>&#160;08:21:11<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></span></span>

<li>Yes, Wikipedia does not deserve to have an emerging concept like "Parametric Insurance". It deserves at more serious place. Those who say National Insurance Academy of India and its allied institutions are spam, have wikipedia given right to as well not know "Parametric Insurance". Quick deletion recommended. Sum

<li>While a concept might be notable and worth of inclusion in an encyclopedia, a company that implements it is not necessarily. Think of it like any other invention. The invention of a product (say, Rollerblades) is notable; and the product is notable.

<p>Instead of being databased i find such a noble venture like Wikipedia is becoming captive to the whims and subjective angularities of individuals. I find the authors of National Insurance Academy of india have provided <a href="http://www.niapune.com" class="external free" title="http://www.niapune.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.niapune.com</a> as the official website, which could have been browsed before condemning a valid Government of India organization with all facts and metalinks available so transparently. I am ashamed to have joined the bandwagon at some stage before verifying the high credentials of this worl reputed research outfit of Government of India. Clean Wikipedia of these psycho-punchers rather than valid notable concepts beyond casual understanding by non-serious readers out to kill ideas the way it often happens. <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESum_6fb7.html" title="User:Sum">User:Sum</a></p>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>: Wikipedia is not Freshmeat.org. This particular application does not appear to be specifically successful to the point where it is widely discussed. Inasmuch as it is an application confined to helping the San Fransisco Bay Area mass transit riders only, it is doubtful that the product <i>can</i> achieve more than local use. Furthermore, the article is advertising, complete with a "download here" link. I nowiki'd it while on VfD (which is what one is supposed to do), and there were no less than nine page links.

<li>Searching, I find nothing non-trivial published about this product that isn't sourced from its creator. Whilst there are reprinted press releases and self-submitted listings in software catalogues, there are no independent magazine reviews, no independently written "BARTWidget/BARTSmart FAQs", no independently written "guide to BARTWidget/BARTSmart", no independent press coverage, no books — nothing at all. This product does not satisfy the primary <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> criterion for products and services. And, having apparently only existed for a month or so, it certainly hasn't been around long enough to have become genericized, and so does not satisfy the second criterion, either. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:30, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> This was originally a German language article (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Durmus_Kumdereli_77f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Durmus Kumdereli">old discussion</a>) and probably headed for the German Wikipedia, until I translated it. It failed to attract any more votes and was closed with a 'no consensus' - to be exact, one delete (mine), and one rather weak keep. Sjakkale (who closed it) said he wouldn't have any problem with a renomination to get further votes.

<li><b>Sorry!</b> This was my first attempt at putting an article in Wikipedia. I did not intend for it to read like an advert. My thinking was that I had followed links on various CMS systems within wiki after doing a search for "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Content_Management_Systems_4ffa.html" title="Content Management Systems">Content Management Systems</a>" I then clicked "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_content_management_systems.html" title="List of content management systems">List of content management systems</a>" (including commercial ones - so I thought this was OK) and then noted near the bottom the rather oddly specific link to "Canadian CMS Products" which went nowhere. As I just happened to have used this company's products (I hasten to add I do NOT work for them, but have been a repeat customer) I thought I'd knock up a 1st draft with the hope that someone else would know about alternate Canadian CMS products and add those in ad-hoc. Sorry if I caused any offence, I will naturally understand your decision to remove the article. Regards, M-ray 13:13, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - That's a start. Of course, I don't find most of the web sites that report this to be credible (too many of them have "UFO" in their names), and I'm not registered for the <i>Guardian</i> or the <i>New Scientist</i>. The book would carry more weight, but I doubt I can find a copy to look at before this discussion is closed.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> I also watched the Program on BBC2 so in fact hunted for more details on Wikipedia - The strangest News Report relates to - Shani Warren, twenty-six years old. Personal assistant in a company called Micro Scope, which was taken over by GEC Marconi less than four weeks after her death. Found drowned in 45cm. (18in) of water, not far from the site of Greenhalgh’s death fall. Warren died exactly one week after the death of Gooding and serious injury to Greenhalgh on 10th April 1987. She was found gagged with a noose around her neck. Her feet were also bound and her hands tied behind her back. Coroner’s verdict: Open. (It was said that Warren had gagged herself, tied her feet with rope, then tied her hands behind her back and hobbled to the lake on stiletto heels to drown herself.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.9.20.25 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.9.20.25_28bd.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.9.20.25">contribs</a>).</small> <small>Only other edit from this IP address is in the Marconi Scientists article.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into school district or town if article is both below three sentances and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture when AFD is closed. This school, like all others, is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on it's own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use.

<li><b>Keep</b> I wrote the article (I don't know whether I'm allowed to even post this)and based on the feedback, I would like to create a redirect/merge, if the consensus is to delete. I am not doing anything yet because it seems that I shouldn't do that until this review period ends. But since the comments were made I have expanded the article beyond 1 line to provide more substance to it. To provide some context, this school is one of the oldest and most prestigious in India, and we should have some added tolerance for articles that deal with non-US things on the English site, and not rely entirely on the foreign languages to pick up that responsibility, especially in a big country like India where a lot of English is spoken, and Internet penetration is low right now. If we don't want to kick out the alumni organizations of Harvard, or the Philips Andover Academy, why St. Patrick's? Daxdarius 13:51, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Reason why the page should be deleted: this page is too short and too sectarian to do justice to the larger issue it awkwardly attempts to essay understanding: that of dual loyalty. <b>Is it possible to be loyal to Ireland and Scotland at the same time</b> (we all know the answer to that, anyway). The page should be deleted because it is provocative in a sectarian fashion, and was heavily sanitized when first produced for a vote on deletion.

<p>I only meant to call for deletion of the article, but I may have triggered of a call for deletion of the category as well, so be it. Some of these issues were discussed in the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Kennedy_3694.html" title="Charles Kennedy">Charles Kennedy</a> talk page. The crucial point is that the term "Irish-Scots" is NOT significantly used in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, if it was then it would be encyclopedic. Whether we like it or not (and there are some good reasons for not liking it) the main social division in Scotland is between Protestants and Roman Catholics. Who all does this term apply to? Lots of Scottish people (including many Protestants) have an Irish ancestor somewhere in their family tree. How predominant does your Irish ancestry have to be to come into this category? Most Scottish people would have no idea how to answer this. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 17:58, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Although I'm only a weak "keep" on this article, I have to point out that your "delete" vote appears to be based on a misunderstanding: this article clearly does <b>not</b> refer to the same community as <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster_Scots_626a.html" title="Ulster Scots">Ulster Scots</a>. Ulster Scots or Scots-Irish are people of Scottish descent in Ireland, while Irish-Scots are people of Irish descent in Scotland. So the question is not whether the community referred to is already covered by Ulster Scots, but whether it merits an article of its own. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyano_6ec4.html" title="User:Ryano">Ryano</a> 12:04, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Disagree with both comments above.</li>
<li>I don't know if you live in Scotland, PatGallacher, but I do, and I know plenty of people who call themselves Irish-Scots, famously of course Billy Connolly and James Connolly. If you know anything about Scottish history then you'll know that in many parts of Scotland there where NO Roman Catholics until the first wave of immigration in the 19th century, when many Irish people came to Scotland to take the jobs of striking workers - which caused a great deal of resentment at the time.</li>
<li>Without wanting to sound flippant, you only need to go to Celtic Park to see tons of Irish-Scots - why else do they wave all those tricolours? Indeed, Celtic F.C. (and Hibernian F.C) where specifically created to provide recreational facilities for the Irish-Scots.</li>
<li>Who do you suppose the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Order_of_Hibernians_4ced.html" title="Ancient Order of Hibernians">Ancient Order of Hibernians</a> consists of in Scotland?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Ulster Scots</i> does NOT address the same population at all. Ulster Scots are people who emigrated from Scotland to Ireland (mostly in the "plantations" of the 16th-17th century, while Irish-Scots are people who emigrated from Ireland to Scotland, mostly in the 19th and 20th centuries. Completely different and distinct.</li>
<li>You cite the <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster_Scots_626a.html" title="Ulster Scots">Ulster Scots</a>, Jt, but if you care to look at that page, you'll see the following:
<ul>
<li>"Ulster-Scots" is a term used to refer to the Presbyterians descended from people of Scotland who live in Ulster, Ireland. "Scotch-Irish" is the usual term in the United States; "Scots-Irish" is also used to refer to the same people, and is not to be confused with <i>Irish-Scots</i>, i.e. Irish immigrants to Scotland.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>So obviously the author of that page thinks there is such a thing as Irish-Scots.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Incidentally, I created the stub, and I recognise that it is rather poor, and needs improved, but not deleted.</li>
<li>I did not create the category, so there must be someone else who agrees with me.</li>

<li><b>Transwiki</b> to the Wiktionary. The term is real and has been in use for quite some time now. It usually refers to a break from work to have a drink (or buy one from a vendor prior to drinking it). While coffee breaks are usually social activities conducted while drinking coffee, the term "drink run" generally focuses on the activity of procuring the drink before consuming it (the social activities, if any, would concentrate around the drink source, like a water cooler). <a href="../../../1/4/7/User%7E147.70.242.21.html" title="User:147.70.242.21">147.70.242.21</a> 21:47, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The subjective designation of <i>NN publishing company</i> is incorrect. Komikwerks is one of the longest running web comics portals that also has a history of regular printed volumes. Further, it is home to "Stan Lee's Sunday Funnies", hosting the most significant name in the history of comics. Several of the comics properties have been optioned for film. The company is marshalling a major book launch for 2006. It was recently featured on the NBC prime time series "Las Vegas" (episode #56 - "Mothwoman" which aired November 21). The <i>copyvio</i> designation is also incorrect. The text was based on an article from author's (my) own website (<a href="http://www.comics2film.com/offtopic.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.comics2film.com/offtopic.shtml" rel="nofollow">Comics2Film.com article</a> -- which, admittedly, is drawn from a press release) and I give Wikipedia full permission to reprint and use as a basis for the Komikwerks entry.

<li><b>Abstain (just comment):</b> Neither original "research" (did you <i>read</i> the article, or just make broad assumptions based on the title?), soapboxing, <b>or</b> a dis against Ms. Rowling. What it IS meant to be is a general disclaimer - and an attempt to defuse the ongoing debates on the <i>existing</i> Wikipedia pages about the rigourousness of the language in the works of J.K.Rowling. I'm supposing that you probably havn't noticed that there's endless debates on talk pages about the "Harry Potter universe" about whether <i>this</i> term is from Latin, or <i>that</i> is supposed to be Aramaic, or whether the spelling on page 27 is canonical, or the spelling on page 62 is <b>the</b> final word.
<p>This is attempt to defuse these debates by pointing out that there <i>is</i> no final answer, so just have fun with - but there's no need for upteen jillion contesting re-writes of an article depending on the viewpoint of the last author to get their paws on the page.</p>
<p>If that's violation of the Wikipedia policy - and there seems to be a general policy against disclaimers in genreal - by all means, take it down - I don't have a lot of time or ego invested in writing it - but it was <i>not</i> created for the reasons listed in it's request for deletion.</p>

<li>OK, I'll go through this if you want to. This is emphatically not encyclopaedia writing. It belongs on a fan site or something. You are presenting your opinion in the article as a proven fact: it isn't. This is the definition of soapboxing. Yes, I did read the article, and found it mildly interesting. It is certainly well written. However, it is emphatically not a topic for an encyclopaedia. I have to say I haven't noticed these debates, but this is a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Special%7EStatistics_969e.html" title="Special:Statistics">big wiki</a>, so that isn't entirely surprising. And that's true, disclaimers are disencouraged. But what is it you are disclaiming against? If it is against the way articles are written and concepts presented in existing articles, then the existing articles must be changed to fit in with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">other policies</a>. By "original research", I mean to say that this is information that has never been published elsewhere and is your own point of view, undiluted. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">[[Sam Korn]]</a> 20:49, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>thank you for the compliment. I can't disagree with your comments - it's not a "factual" article - it's only a by-product of the nature of the "public contributions" of a wiki. You're right in that were this a <i>paper</i> encyclopedia the article would not exist, and as such, it probably shouldn't be here.</li>

It is a matter of opinion, and there's no attempt at neutrality here. One would render such an article neutral by attributing the opinion of "nasality" to its holders. However, since that would result in a hotch-potch of multiple opinions from different sources, there being no one single definition of "nasal", it seems daft to have a single list article on the subject. "List of singers considered to be 'nasal' according to various people's individual and differing definitions of 'nasal'" seems far too cumbersome to ever be useful to anyone. Attributed opinions about individual singers are far better reported in the articles on those singers. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 22:26, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete,</b> not inherently POV but the chances of it's being properly worked up are zilch. If not deleted, then the article should be rewritten to say that it is a list of names of singers together with source citations attesting to their nasal voice tone. Then every name that is not accompanied by such a citation, i.e. all of them, should be cut from the article, pasted into the talk page, and not reinserted until a citation can be provided. I think I'll do that much right now. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:42, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into school district or town if article is both below three sentances and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture when AFD is closed. This school, like all others, is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on it's own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use. This is the baseline consensus that I feel was reached at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 14:25, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep it. I wrote this article (Me, Michael Fogleman). Originally I put up this article as a massive about. My thoughts are, if someone is looking for the Teen Podcaster's Network, they will find what they want with no biased information. The Podcast Network gets the same thing, why shouldn't the Teen Podcaster's Network? It just says what it is, who made it, and where to find it, nothing else. 68.160.157.98 01:00, 4 December 2005 (UTC)Michael Fogleman

<li><b>Comment</b>Well why is the Teen Podcaster's Network getting picked on if the Podcast Network does not? It should not be deleted because if someone wants to know about the network, they will find out about it. It's not slanted in any way whatsoever and should not be deleted. Just because it is "obscure" doesn't mean that people won't look at it. Wikipedia is so messed up, and it has strayed from it's original purpose- the beauty of everyone being able to edit it if they have a contribution. Shame on you for picking on Adam Curry. He was just trying to help. I defended Wikipedia from my history teacher, who complained about it. I almost got in trouble for it. I don't see why I did if you cannot do what you are supposed to be able to- put your two cents in. You exclusive supposed elite who spend your days editing Wikipedia are the only people who have any rights. While it may be fun, why can't a leading expert make edits? That's what I ask. I'd be interesting in chatting with you folks about it. Email me at michael@teenpodcasters.com or skype me at commonercast. 68.160.180.33 19:53, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article could go one of two directions: (1) It could devolve into an unresolvable debate about what constitutes "National Circuit", or (2) it will become a list of nearly all high schools in the United States, which is another article. Either way it doesn't really have a place here. The creator appears to have intended "List of elite high school debate teams" which is equally problematic. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a> | <sup><a href="../../../e/s/k/User_talk%7EESkog_7643.html" title="User talk:ESkog">Talk</a></sup> 23:19, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
