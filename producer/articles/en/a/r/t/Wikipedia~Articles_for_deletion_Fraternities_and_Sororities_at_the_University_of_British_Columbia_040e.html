<dd>Well, there's now material that doesn't appear to be a copyvio, but it still reads like an advertisement. There could be about two paragraphs of potentially encyclopedic information, tops; they can go in the main UBC article. Having a separate article here is asking for trouble. I'll hold my delete vote. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 20:07, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Maybe</b> - I think the intention was to significantly cut down the information on the main UBC article and replace it with a link to this one. As it stands now it is far too self promotional, but I'm not convinced that it can't be turned into something relevent. As I said in the talk page, I think an article naming the fraternities on campus, saying where the frats are, what they do and giving a brief history would be an acceptably noteworthy page. I don't know much about the frats and sororities, but I'm under the impression they are a reasonably important presence at UBC. <a href="../../../t/a/s/User%7ETastyCakes_4007.html" title="User:TastyCakes">TastyCakes</a> 06:36, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - takes this info away from the main ubc article. Also, STOP shatering the interests of new contributors. They are adding TRUE KNOWLEDGE, that is not getting in the way of other articles, about places which are notable. UBC is a very large University, and donated content should not be deleted. This article does not offend Wikipedia by it's presense, therefor include it. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Dillinger_2c06.html" title="User:Nick Dillinger">Nick Dillinger</a> 07:11, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The reason that not all true knowledge is allowed is that WP does not want to become a joke by letting all manner of frivolty have an article.<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 07:20, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The Greek system is a big part of UBC. The information on this page is exactly that information. There is no bias on it anymore its simply stating the facts. I realize before that the info was just copied and pasted from other sites but now it is unique and doesn't have any copyvios. It doesn't promote the Greek system at UBC it simply states what it is and how it works. If it was promoting the Greek system and trying to recruit people through this page then it would be worthy of deletion but not as it is now. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 154.20.180.73 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_154.20.180.73_b4b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/154.20.180.73">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>The position espoused supra, recapitulated on Nick's userpage as "All factual information, as long as it doesn't get in the way of other factual information, should be included, open sourced, and allowed to be readily accessed through Wikipedia and its forks" is not altogether without merit; it is, though, wholly contrary to Wikipedia policy, which policy reflects a consensus of the considered and deliberate judgments of many Wikipedians. One may surely object to policy and even essay the changing of policy, but it is likely that his/her offering opinions on individual AfD discussions will not be as effective as his/her proposing broader or bolder changes to the sundry criteria of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, inasmuch as that policy, more than any deletion guidelines, which tend simply to incorporate by reference and interpret WP:NOT, is the policy most at odds with the sort of encyclopedia envisaged by Nick (I should say that I would likely disagree with the changes Nick would seek to make, but seek simply to suggest that, if a debate is to occur, it needs to occur at a different level).</li>

<li><b>comment</b> This has come up a million times before - students at various universities try to make pages specific to their university's, usually a frat/sorority page, and it always fails the AFD as non-notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> This page isn't describing each individual fraternity so the fact that most Fraternities and sororities have there own page is irrelevant. It is describing the particular Greek system at UBC which is different in some ways than say a fraternity or sorority at another school. It is information and not "cruft" as some people seem to be referring it to. The information is plain and simple and there’s nothing trying to promote it, its just once again stating the facts about the Greek system at a University. This is supposed to be the most comprehensive encyclopaedia on the planet. Removing this page would defeat Wikipedia’s purpose.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 216.232.27.184 (<a href="../../../2/1/6/User_talk%7E216.232.27.184.html" title="User talk:216.232.27.184">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.232.27.184_cbba.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.232.27.184">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>"Cruft" = extraneous, useless or pointless "information". Mere "information" alone doesn't make something Wikipedia-worthy; if so, my penis size or my cat's middle name (both, surely, "information") would merit Wikipedia articles. To merit inclusion, information must be <i>notable</i>. There's nothing notable here. Contrary to your assertion, the article describes nothing about the UBC frat system unusual to any other frat-bearing school; most frats have rooming houses, hold events and participate in inter-Greek councils. This boils down to a mere list meaningless to a non-UBC student and probably not meaningful to many of those. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:40, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

Also, STOP BEGGING THE QUESTION by declaring something unnotable just because you are a snob. You are wrong, as there is significant disagreement about the definition of notability.
