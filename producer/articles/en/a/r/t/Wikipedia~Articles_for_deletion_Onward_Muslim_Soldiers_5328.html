<p>Not notable enough to have a page. There are thousands of thousands books. A book must be very very notable to have a page(e.g. Bible, Quran, Dante's divine comedy etc etc). I don't expect to find this book while searching in Encyclopedia Britannica for example. Aside from this, the scholarship of the author is also believed to be fundamentally flawed by university professors like <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Ernst_52f3.html" title="Carl Ernst">Carl Ernst</a>, please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Spencer#Views_on_Spencer_and_his_works" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Spencer#Views_on_Spencer_and_his_works" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.Furthermore, if there is any controversy, it should be addressed in "Criticism of X" articles.--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 12:55, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">User:CltFn</a> created a page for each of Robert Spencer's books in order to further Spencer's anti-Islam views. His views are controversial and not taken seriously by scholars to the best of my knowledge; he also runs a website that contains material that's arguably Islamophobic, as well as legitimate material. Most importantly, he isn't notable enough to have so many pages devoted to his views; the descriptions of his books can be added to his biography. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 13:28, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: If we were to merge the details of the books into the article on the author, surely we would <i>merge and redirect</i> this article, both for navigation purposes and to preserve the edit history in terms of the GFDL.

<li><b>Keep</b> It has received more than enough media attention to be notable. This is what 30 seconds on Google provided me with: <a href="http://www.cruxnews.com/rose/onward.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cruxnews.com/rose/onward.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.afsi.org/OUTPOST/2004JAN/jan3.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.afsi.org/OUTPOST/2004JAN/jan3.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.levant.info/MER066.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.levant.info/MER066.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Another thing is that I am pretty disappointed to see that SlimVirgin seems to want to use this place to discuss her personal opinions about the writer, and to make bad faith accusations and what boarders personal attacks against CltFn.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> The reviews cited in the article lack full info as to what publication they appeared in, so they smack of courtesy back cover blurbs authors give one another. They need to be cited to reliable independent verifiable publications to count towards notability. The Amazon sales rank of #326,368 is yawn inducing. But I wish editors would stop telling us to delete it because they do not like the author's ideology. This is not "ILIKEITpedia." And the nominator should realize that Wikipedia is not Britannica, and we let in books thousands of times less notable than the few he cites as acceptable, as does Britannica. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:55, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a bad-faith nomination that does not cite policy in its deletion reasoning. There is no precedent "very very notable" in the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">Wikipedia:Notability (books)</a> proposed guideline or anywhere else (and by analogy, we should have almost no articles on television episodes or music albums if that were the case). The argument by analogy with Britannica is also outside of policy, as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a>. The argument against the author's "scholarship" is a content dispute and does not belong at AFD.

<li><b>Obvious keep</b>. Spencer has had several books high on the NYT bestseller list recently, and he doesn't write all that many books. A discussion of whether his scholarship is "fundamentally flawed" or not is utterly irrelevant to an AfD. - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 00:21, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> There are probably over ten thousand articles about books in WP. The guidelines do not say that only the most exceeding universally known go in. They just say notable. Furthermore, the comment that this book is controversial is not a reason to keep it out, it is a reason to keep it in. If there is such criticism, it would demonstrate notability. But I will continue to assume your good faith in making this nomination.DGG 02:06, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Book by bestselling author, whose bestsellers have also been nominated. Nomination and delete votes appear to be motivated purely by POV. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 05:41, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia policy on books is not that restricted. Being controversial (<a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler%27s_War_3d8b.html" title="Hitler's War">Hitler's War</a>), racist (<a href="../../../m/e/i/Mein_Kampf_b165.html" title="Mein Kampf">Mein Kampf</a>), or discredited (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Destruction_of_Dresden_b765.html" title="The Destruction of Dresden">The Destruction of Dresden</a>) are not grounds for deletion. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdward321_0e26.html" title="User:Edward321">Edward321</a> 05:47, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> But, for the sake of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, any notable criticism of the book should be listed, even if it comes from partisan scholars. It is important to have all significant viewpoints. One must distinguish between criticism of Spencer and criticism of the book, of course.
