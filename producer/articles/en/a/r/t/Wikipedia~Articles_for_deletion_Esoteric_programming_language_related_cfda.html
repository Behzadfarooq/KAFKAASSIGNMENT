<p>There seems to be a whole bunch of so called <a href="../../../e/s/o/Esoteric_programming_language.html" title="Esoteric programming language">Esoteric programming language</a> that found its way into wikipedia over time.

<dl>
<dd>Motivation: Computer languages are self selecting. If they don't work, they don't work and don't show up anywhere. Some esoteric computer langauges are more famous than others, but it doesn't hurt to have all of them on wikipedia. I'm somewhat strongly POV against vfd by now, and this kind of nomination doesn't do much to lower my blood pressure. I wish there was a speedy denomination procedure. (for obvioussly broken nominations such as this)&#160;:-( I'm going to stop doing vfd for a while now. Don't delete the entire wikipedia while I'm not watching?&#160;:-/ <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 15:32, 29 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<dd>If you don't think some of these articles should be deleted, why did you list them on VfD in the first place? That seems like an abuse of the VfD process to me, making speculative guesses about articles which someone else <i>might</i> think is worthy of deletion and then cluttering VfD up with polls to see if anyone does. If someone else thinks they're delete-worthy they can list them here themselves, and if you wanted to do random polling to prompt them you should probably have stuck to talk: pages. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:50, 29 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I would suggest that in most cases, we just want a redirect to List of esoteric programming languages; if the language has any actual significance, perhaps that page could include a link to the language's homepage. I don't see much point in including fictional languages at all, unless they have some cultural significance. BTW, having so many in the list is making it extremely difficult to submit a vote, due to edit conflicts. Please don't do that again. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecuriger_6d53.html" title="User:Securiger">Securiger</a> 16:17, 29 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I strongly object to deletion enthusiasts listing anything that they can't find on a Google search and then claiming it shouldn't be here.

<li><b>Merge and Redirect</b> all except ones listed by Chris73 to list of esoteric programming languages. I'm in partial agreement with Kim. VfD has some great uses and is definitely necessary, but this is a little overboard. 70+ VfD's all at once?

<li>[Comment] The fact is that most of these languages are in violation of Wikipedia's rules. Why? Because they are essentially <b>Original Research</b>, with no greater significance outside of the handful of l33t-wannabes who want to claim they invented a language. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrapin_076e.html" title="User:Terrapin">Terrapin</a> 18:36, 29 Sep 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To clarify: "<a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>" refers to work done for the specific purpose of including it in the Wikipedia. As far as I can tell, none of these articles qualify under that definition: they're all <i>reporting</i> the facts about pre-existing toy languages. If anything, these articles are candidates for deletion or merging because of their lack of notability. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenc_2795.html" title="User:Benc">•&#160;Benc</a><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenc_b8ae.html" title="User talk:Benc">&#160;•</a> 19:41, 29 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - These articles are of interest to me and to many others. There's no compelling reason to get rid of the information. Why is this even being brought up? <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 19:32, Sep 29, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I second Angela's vote: <b>keep or redirect all</b>. To decide which ones to keep and which ones to merge/redirect into List of esoteric programming languages, discuss it at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Programming_Languages_f10f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Programming Languages">WikiProject Programming Languages</a>, <i>not</i> here on VfD.
<p>Side note about the mass listing: please don't ever do this again. I know you were trying to speed up the process, but the logistics of juggling 70+ subnominations has actually slowed down the process. (Never sacrifice sanity for speed!) If you want to delete an entire class of articles, start by discussing it at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_policy_ab70.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy">Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy</a> and the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">village pump</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> in general: esoteric-ness is not grounds for deletion, so why should it be a valid criterion for merging listings on VfD? OTOH, I'm sure some of these <i>aren't</i> notable enough to have their own pages, or even their own mentions in a list - people's pet projects could be construed as vanity. I suggest making a new listing containing <i>only</i> those which are not notable; or a handful of listings, sorted by perceived notability; or <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenc_2795.html" title="User:Benc">Benc</a>'s suggestion of discussing it somewhere else first, and merging into the list. - <a href="../../../i/m/s/User%7EIMSoP_6779.html" title="User:IMSoP">IMSoP</a> 22:53, 29 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There very well may be some articles in this grouping that are worthy of deletion, but I'm not going to read through all of them picking and choosing; if the deletion-proposer wants to propose deleteing the whole lot of them one bundle then so be it, I vote to keep the whole lot of them.

<dd>Also, I just noticed that the VfD template on the articles I just spot-checked all point to non-existant VfD pages. Someone who stumbles across one of these articles will not be able to find where the voting is actually being held without hunting through VfD manually for it, which is a bit of a major undertaking under the circumstances. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:59, 29 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

And like others, I object to an entire category of topics being proposed for deletion: if there are individual entries that should be deleted, propose those on the merits of the case.

<li><i><b>Keep all</b></i>. This Vfd listing is just wrong, just like listing the GNAA three times. Google hits are NOT a valid reason to delete. Wikipedia is not paper, I have gone through every listing and each of the languages are real. This will hurt Wikipedia by creating holes in Wikipedias coverage.

<li><sup><i><b>Comment</b></i>: the google test mechanism employed to discredit the languages described in the articles seems fatally flawed. Almost invariably the test has been to search for "<i>name</i> programming language". I wonder if this is likely to discount perfectly good hits simply on the grounds that this exact phrase does not occur. I might support replacing the <i><b>List</b></i> with a longer article containing more detailed descriptions of each language, but I suspect that the product would be less helpful than what we have now. I'm definitely inclining towards <i>Keep</i> unless I can be convinced otherwise. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Boswell_c574.html" title="User:Phil Boswell">Phil</a> | <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhil_Boswell_f2d3.html" title="User talk:Phil Boswell">Talk</a> 12:05, Sep 30, 2004 (UTC)</sup></li>
<li><sup><b>Keep All</b> <i>esoteric</i> does not mean <i>unknown</i>. There is a great deal of interest in these languages among CS people. The Google results are flawed and so meaningless.

<li><sup><b>Keep All</b> The esoteric programming languages have relevance in terms of experimental computer science -- for one thing, most are simple Turing Machines. While they might not be generally useful, they do have their uses, and they're interesting to read about.

<li><sup>Comment: a lot of people are casting blanket "keep" votes despite the fact that some of these "languages" have, by their articles' own admission, never existed outside of one humorous USENET post. I suggest that, after the five-day voting period for this mass nomination ends, any articles that have received a simple majority of non-"keep" votes cast specifically for them be re-nominated, so that we can reach a genuine consensus on whether they deserve inclusion. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriskaideka_72fe.html" title="User:Triskaideka"></a>—<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriskaideka_72fe.html" title="User:Triskaideka">Triskaideka</a> 15:56, 30 Sep 2004 (UTC)</sup></li>

<li><sup>Comment: several voters are giving <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> a hard time for mass-nominating a large number of articles. In fact, he's one of a very few people who <i>did</i> evaluate all of the articles individually. He voted on every one and provided at least a short reason. This only <i>looks</i> like a blanket nomination because he nominated them all at the same time and allowed people to vote on them all as a group—which I think is turning out to have been a mistake, as some of these subjects are, IMO, clearly more notable than others. It might have been easier on the voters if he'd nominated them in batches over a longer period (although then I'm sure people would have cited the languages that hadn't yet been deleted as support for the languages up for consideration), but I think it's unfair to criticize him for being willing to do <i>more</i> work than anyone else. If articles deserve to be nominated, then they deserve to be nominated, and many of these clearly deserve at least nomination, even if we ultimately decide that they don't deserve deletion. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriskaideka_72fe.html" title="User:Triskaideka"></a>—<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriskaideka_72fe.html" title="User:Triskaideka">Triskaideka</a> 21:13, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</sup>
