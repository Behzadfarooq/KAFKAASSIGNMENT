<li><b>Weak Keep</b>/<b>Strong Merge into <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamental_physical_constants.html" title="Fundamental physical constants">fundamental physical constants</a></b> This is not made up by an Average Joe, it really was a term/concept coined by <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Pohl_416d.html" title="Frederick Pohl">Frederick Pohl</a> in his <a href="../../../h/e/e/Heechee.html" title="Heechee">Heechee</a>/<a href="../../../g/a/t/Gateway_%28novel%29.html" title="Gateway (novel)">Gateway</a> sci-fi saga (the original trilogy is terrific soft sci-fi, and was one of my teenage favourites). An example of the term's usage by Pohl can be found <a href="http://lib.ru/INOFANT/POL/beyond_eng.txt" class="external text" title="http://lib.ru/INOFANT/POL/beyond_eng.txt" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Here is some detail on the concept from a math forum<a href="http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=1184178&amp;tstart=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=1184178&amp;tstart=0" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> - there's an mention here that the term is known enough for it to be a title and subject of a math lecture.

The term seems to have some currency in math/physics circles.

<li><b>Comment</b>. For everyone saying this concept is important, what concept do you mean exactly? What reasonable title would you give such an article? As a physicist, I must insist this concept isn't common at all, because it's too vague to be useful to anyone. It basically amounts to "numbers that relate to physics in some way that are interesting" (by some undefined standard).

<li>I would give it the title physical coincidence, by parallel with <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_coincidence.html" title="Mathematical coincidence">Mathematical coincidence</a>. Pohl's example is the identical apparent sizes of our sun and moon; I have cited the near-equality of the gravitational constant and the age of the universe (in natural units). One of these is (probably) meaningless; the other has had a physical theory based on it. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 19:35, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Okay, I'm not a scientist or mathematician on any kind. But based on what I remember of the Pohl's books, Gosh numbers are not just physics/astrophysics coincidences but also values underlying basic laws of the universe which are apparently arbitrary yet also vital to the survival of life as it is. The key plot point in the Heechee saga is this <b>Spoilers ahead</b> - an advanced race of aliens called the Heechee have left their technology behind and have apparently vanished. In fact, they're hiding from an even more advanced race of aliens which have been around since before the Big Bang, and are trying to reverse the Big Bang, so that they can "re-roll the dice" for the gosh numbers which came into existence with the current universe (their lives were based on the old gosh numbers, and the new gosh numbers are apparently unbearable. For a scientific discussion of [gosh numbers in this way - one in a science magazine and not based on my memories, see this <a href="http://216.239.51.104/search?q=cache:HNX-O-alCBAJ:www.zinkle.com/p/articles/mi_m1430/is_n1_v15/ai_12699267/pg_2%3Fpi%3Dznk+%22gosh+numbers%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=10" class="external text" title="http://216.239.51.104/search?q=cache:HNX-O-alCBAJ:www.zinkle.com/p/articles/mi_m1430/is_n1_v15/ai_12699267/pg_2%3Fpi%3Dznk+%22gosh+numbers%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=10" rel="nofollow">cached article</a>.

<dd>Perhaps a merge into <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamental_physical_constants.html" title="Fundamental physical constants">Fundamental physical constants</a>? <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 02:11, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that's a GREAT idea, Septentrionalis. Changing vote to reflect this new idea <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 12:19, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Seems like it could be expanded into a good article. --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 21:49, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>do not merge</b> into either <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederik_Pohl_31b2.html" title="Frederik Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a> or <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamental_physical_constant.html" title="Fundamental physical constant">fundamental physical constant</a>. The use in the Pohl story gives as the main example that minus 40 degrees Celsius is the same as minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit. That has nothing to do with fundamental constants of the universe as claimed in the present article. There are no known examples of unexpected relationships among the fundamental constants, so it is not possible to expand the article with examples. Apart from the fact that the concept of the article is not the one described by Pohl, there is no good reason to single this out among all the ideas described by Pohl in his many novels. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:01, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
