<li><b>Keep</b>, this attempt to have all three articles deleted seems to be a <b>bad faith</b> campaign by rogue elements to censor views that are alternative from the mainstream and to silence anyone and anything that deviates from their deeply held gospel of their one and only brand of science religion. It is so transparent. As to the narrator, yes, it is James Earl Jones, I have the DVD and he narrates throughout. And it was shown on PBS stations in California, not sure about other parts of the country. Posted by IP 65.9.158.81, haven't registered yet.

<li><i>Hello, it is me, the big bad "anonymous editor". I'm sorry I have offended so many. I just haven't gotten around to registering an account yet. Though I doubt that will stop the insults from coming, or keep the vandals from vandalizing my work. Once again, for the record, I have nothing to do with this organization, I've never even so much as exchanged an e-mail with them or with Mr. Cruttenden. I just simply believe in the theory and would like to see it someday either proved or disproved. That's all. I first read about it more than 10 years ago in the book The Holy Science by Swami Sri Yukteswar, (which I think was the first mention ever of it in the Western World, as far as I know), that's why I added the bit I did to his article, which Pilatus promply deleted, as he follows me around deleting whatever I write. Apparently the fear that I might be connected to this organization (I am not) or worse, that I might be Mr. Cruttenden (I'm not) strikes fear in a lot of people's hearts. I'm sorry I have offended the sensibilities of so many.</i> Posted by IP 65.9.158.81, haven't registered yet.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Being available for purchase on amazon is not verificaton of notability. There are lots of self-published books for sale on amazon, but we don't want them.

<li><b>Comment</b> <b>Did it air on PBS or not?</b> This is important to me, at least, in assessing whether we should have an article on it. If it did, it should be easy to provide verifiable evidence, and I hope some supporters will do so. For my part, I note that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000YHVMG/qid=1127737821/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-6667406-3192662?v=glance&amp;s=dvd&amp;n=507846" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000YHVMG/qid=1127737821/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-6667406-3192662?v=glance&amp;s=dvd&amp;n=507846" rel="nofollow">the Amazon listing</a> makes no such claim (nor do any reader reviews). It is trivially easy to self-publish books and get them listed on Amazon; I don't know if this is true of DVDs. Search for "Cruttenden" at www.pbs.org yields six hits, <i>none referring to this film.</i> ("Abigail Cruttenden is a British television and film actress...") Search for "Great Year" at www.pbs.org yields 46 hits, non referring to the film. Search for "James Earl Jones" returns 40 hits, none referring to the film. DID IT AIR? IF SO, WHEN AND ON WHAT STATIONS?

<li><b>Delete</b> I thought a while about this. Basically no one can find a source for the PBS claim other than message board posts and statements from the organization, which leaves it highly suspect. Without the PBS claim its just another DVD.

<li>Same thing (my God, this is insane). If this discussion is about the article about THE DOCUMENTARY FILM, then I would suggest it be kept. If the pseudoscientific theory his "Binary Research Institute" doesn't deserve a place at Wikipedia for being original research, or not enough mainstream, or not sufficiently recognized... well, then the article about that theory deserves being deleted, but this stub... how does it promote a POV? It merely states what the film is about, who produced it and who narrates it... Now I've registered (BattleTroll)
<ul>
<li>A film produced by the subject in order to promote the subject's crackpot theory does not deserve an article in an encycloedia. ***<a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:56, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>It does deserve its entry when it's sufficiently well known. Instead of finger-pointing on all sides we should ask ourselves how well know it in fact is. Amazon gives a sales rank of 18000. How much is that?

<li><b>Comment</b>, thank you Pilatus for proving my point. I couldn't have done it better myself.

<li><b>Comment</b>: although I have as yet been unable to find a PBS airdate for this (I am seeing signs it may have been aired as an episode of another program), and PBS stations don't tend to archive their listings online, I have found reference to the documentary being shown at the Southern California Writers' Conference sometime in early October 2005.<a href="http://www.writersconference.com/la/labios-all.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.writersconference.com/la/labios-all.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The film was also nominated for a CINE Golden Eagle Award <a href="http://www.cine.org/w_fall03.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cine.org/w_fall03.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I got curious about this when I saw the rabidness with which they are trying to get it deleted. I did a google search, and there are many mentions of it being shown on PBS. A search on groups.google.com turns up this, where a person wrote about it after seeing it on PBS: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan/browse_frm/thread/6f71327d6b7be05c/ce2d3c28feb74563#ce2d3c28feb74563" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan/browse_frm/thread/6f71327d6b7be05c/ce2d3c28feb74563#ce2d3c28feb74563" rel="nofollow">The Great Year and The Wheel of Time</a> in 2004. One thing I will say about those who are looking for it on the PBS website, I think PBS only keeps webpages about specials that they produce, or their affiliates around the country. This wasn't produced by PBS, that might be why there isn't mention of it on their website.<a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarthian_7789.html" title="User:Earthian">Earthian</a> 18:05, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Conflict of Interest - Question</b>: should the person who nominates articles for deletion also be making changes to those articles? In this case, <a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">Pilatus</a> has nominated these three articles for deletion - Walter Cruttenden, <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_Research_Institute_cb5f.html" title="Binary Research Institute">Binary Research Institute</a>, and The Great Year - and has made extensive changes to them. In most of his changes he leaves behind typos and grammatical errors, broken links, and straggling headers (i.e., after he's removed everything that was under a header), not only messing up other users' work but leaving the article in much poorer shape than it was before. He also deletes extensively, and removes categories and stubs aggressively. He goes in after anyone adds anything to an article and removes everything the other person contributed. He seems to be working to <i>increase the chances for deletion</i> of the articles. In light of this, it would be appropriate, in order to avoid this obvious <b>conflict of interest</b>, for the person who nominated the articles to refrain from modifying them until the decision has been made? <a href="../../../s/y/u/User%7ESyug_2b31.html" title="User:Syug">Syug</a> 21:08, 28 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Most articles up for deletion are not judged upon the quality or quantity or their content, but rather the appropriateness or notability of the topic. Any edits that Pilatus may have made to the content of the article are irrelevant, for he cannot make a worthy topic unworthy by bad grammar or misspellings. <a href="../../../o/s/w/User%7EOswax_0a10.html" title="User:Oswax">Oswax</a> 21:47, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. There is exactly zero primary evidence for Cruttenden's notions about the Sun being part of a binary system. There is no excuse for inclusion of this trash in an encyclopaedia, except as an example of pseudoscience/bad science. <small>Comment left by anonymous user <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.64.220.164_053d.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.64.220.164">62.64.220.164</a> who has only participated in this and the three other related articles being nominated for deletion and left the same comment in each.</small> Red herring! Surely it is the <i>content</i> of the comment, not who left it, or where else he left it, that is relevant? 62.64.237.112 15:15, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Try not to take it personally. It's not fair, but it's done for fairly good pracical reasons.</dd>
<dd>There is a longstanding tradition in Articles for Deletion of pointing out remarks left by users without accounts, and users with very, very new accounts--specifically users who have made very few edits except to matters closely related to an AfD. The reason for this is that a) because of WIkipedia's openness and anonymity, there is absolutely no way to know for sure whether the same person is casting multiple votes under different identities; b) it frequently occurs to people that this is possible, and virtually all Wikipedians believe that "sockpuppets" are very common in AfD, and virtually all Wikipedians believe that it is frequently possible to recognize them; c) ignoring sockpuppet votes is a matter of judgement; d) ignoring votes by not-logged-in users or very new user accounts is generally accepted as a reasonably neutral guideline. It's not fair to legitimate users with IP-address or very-recently-created accounts.</dd>
<dd>It is the <i>vote</i> that is being ignored, not the comments that accompany the vote. Wikipedia is probably the least authoritarian organization you are likely to find. If you make a cogent comment in AfD, your comments will influence the subsequent discussion, no matter whom you are. Since creating a Wikipedia account does not require disclosure of any personal information at all--not so much as an email address--everybody in Wikipedia is judged by the identity they create by themselves by their writings within Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:44, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'd like to remind everyone that the subject under discussion is this article, about a particular film, not this article, about a hypothesis. The latter half of this article doesn't address the film, which leaves a stub that amounts to vanity/advertising about a documentary of debated legitimacy and notability. As such, in accordance with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> Sec. 1.4.3, it ought to be deleted. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 22:30, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
