<li><b>Weak keep</b>. A lot of the notability is supposed to come from a relation, but the article states she's a model. Unless that can be refuted I see no reason to delete. Just a good scrub and cleanup. Badly formatted, but not fancruft and even if it was, fancruft is not a reason for speedy deletion for whoever tried to re-tag it. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 20:35, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> There are a lot of people waiting tables at diners in LA claiming they are actors/actresses, but this does not make them people worthy of wiki entries.

None of the cited, including being engaged to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chad_Michael_Murray_5e90.html" title="Chad Michael Murray">Chad Michael Murray</a> and participating in a <i>CosmoGirl!</i> modeling contest confers notability per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:10, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I certainly concur in Mgm's assessment that the article, even in its earliest incaranations, was not speediable; the noting of a subject's working as a fashion model with a notable publication and of a subject's being engaged to a notable individual must surely be understood as a proper assertion of notability. I vacillate on the <i>notability by familial relation</i> question but here think Mgm to be quite right that Dalton qua fiancée of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chad_Michael_Murray_5e90.html" title="Chad Michael Murray">Chad Michael Murray</a> is non-notable; I don't, though, think Dalton qua model to be notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, although I think it to be eminently likely that further and more prominent modelling work (especially that for which sources might be found) would confer notability. In any event, it should be emphasized that, to my mind, the disposition of the question is not wholly clear, such that intimations of speediability are, IMHO, unfounded. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 04:29, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a long nomination, but please, I ask you to read on as I would like some participation from the wider Wikipedia community. This comic was previously deleted at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Outsider_%28comic%29_eadd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Outsider (comic)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Outsider (comic)</a> and was nominated for a second time at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Outsider_%28comic%29_%282nd_nomination%29_db2b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Outsider (comic) (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Outsider (comic) (2nd nomination)</a> where it ended as a no consensus. I am nominating again because I feel that the outcome of the second discussion was erronomous. Although the second nomination had such great keep votes such as "I masturbated into a sock last night" and general ILIKEIT style comments, I really do not think that their arguments hold much weight. They claim that this webcomic, seen <a href="http://well-of-souls.com/outsider/" class="external text" title="http://well-of-souls.com/outsider/" rel="nofollow">here</a> is notable because it was nominated for the 2002 outstanding sci-fi <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_Cartoonist%27s_Choice_Awards_888a.html" title="Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards">Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards</a>. This however, is not a notable award, the WCCA's have more categories than the <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscars.html" title="Oscars">Oscars</a> (really), and so many are nominated every year, it's meaningless. Just because it was nominated once for a web award with no ceremony (they just gather up votes in an online poll then post the results) doesn't mean that it's more notable/popular/better sourced than Encyclopedia Dramatica. Having one nomination puts it up with those big hitting websites such as Psychic Dyslexia Institute, Bikeeni 2000 and The Tenth Life of Pishio the Cat . This comic has no other reliable third party sources, has not achieved great popularity as seen by its <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=well-of-souls.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=well-of-souls.com/" rel="nofollow">Alexa rank</a> and pretty much all the information is sourced from the website itself. We should not have slacker inclusion guidelines for webcomics over other web content. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 00:08, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Haelth, I think we can agree that the article is quite good. The subject itself seems to be the problem.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I don't think the case has been adequately made that the Alexa rankings for Outsider don't demonstrate a notable webcomic. I have not seen any guidelines that quantify what sort of traffic ranking qualifies as notable. Previous comparisons with traffic rankings for Penny Arcade and Megatokyo don't seem very appropriate; I don't know whether a webcomic must be among the four or five most popular in the world to be considered "notable", but in any event comparing the traffic numbers of a daily or thrice-weekly comic strip with those of a weekly (or less) long form comic doesn't seem to be a very good basis for judgment. An informal survey of long-form, weekly-or-less updated comics with current Wikipedia articles produced this general range of Alexa numbers:</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I have always maintained that the standards for webcomic inclusion have been incredibly lax, and that they seem to be treated through rose tinted spectacles in comparison to other websites. There is an absolute shedload of webcomics on my watchlist which have Alexa ranks like the ones you quote and should be deleted. Encyclopedia Dramatica had a rank of around 8000 I think, Final Fantasy Shrine has a rank in the top 10,000 also. They were both deleted. Barring the sci-fi web cartoonist's choice award nomination, there have been no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> or professional third party reviews or critical commentary on your work. I cannot imagine any other set of websites outside of webcomics in which the claim that an Alexa rank of 370,000 makes it notable would be used as an argument for keep. The Alexa rank wasn't even the main point of this nomination. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 03:33, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong delete</b> - No reliable secondary sources of information regarding the notability of this. Doesn't meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> at all. For what its worth, I would've closed the previous AFD as delete, due to complete lack of arguments based on WP policy/guidelines and instead stuff like "the comic clearly exists and has some history". I'm actually busting out the "strong" delete on this one, which I haven't done in awhile. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 06:25, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> - I find the fact that the WP:WEB classifications as being incredibly short sighted and that such criteria will create false positives and false negatives all over the place if used as criteria for deletion in the particular case of webcomics. If a webcomic publishes their material in paperback form, and opens their own personal bookshop out of their garage, they immediately qualify as they have an outside source(their publisher). Why should a site suddenly be better because the owner decides to shell out money to publish? A webcomic is a peice of fiction, not fact, and I think after scrutinizing the INTENT of the rules in question, that this webcomic is sufficient to warrent a wiki article. I do agree that webcomics are a dime a dozen, but *any* award from any organization (whether web derived or not) therefore implies quality of work simply because winners had to compete against hundreds or thousands of similarly themed works. Just troll through the latest comic ranking sites like buzzcomics and see how many exist. But I ask you to think, go wiki some webcomics like inverloch, earthsong, no need for bushido, look at their pages, and think about why all of these shouldn't deserve to have a wiki page. If you think that they shouldn't, than why are ANY fictional works presented herein? I think the time has long passed that having a paperback published copy of your fictional work somehow makes the work more immortal. I'll finish up with some counterpoint aimed at Hahnchen. Reliable sources I quote&#160;: "Evaluate the reliability of online sources just as you would print or other more traditional sources. Neither online nor print sources deserve an automatic assumption of reliability by virtue of the medium they are printed in. All reports must be evaluated according to the processes and people that created them." This is a work of fiction, the author's word is final, hence it is no different than the lord of the rings or any other published non-fiction work. Another point, because we are to consider this source just as we would if it were published in another medium, why are we even talking about alexa rankings as we certainly do not consider how many copies were printed, or how widly circulated or translated a particular book is. Addiitonally I would question your criteria for "well known" award, as I think it is very well known within the commuity it serves (i.e. those who read webcomics). The point of the rules is to keep fradulent works out, to keep facts close to reality etc. That is the spirit I see behind the rules being sited, and that is why I find that works such as webcomics break that mold. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.169.189.3 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.169.189.3_54e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.169.189.3">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>Do you even know what a reliable source is? The difference between this webcomic and Lord of the Rings is that in one case, we are taking the author's word for every claim, and in the other case, there are thousands of other people who have intently scrutinised every claim, checked every fact, and published their own findings independently! A reliable source, whether online or offline is necessarily and inherently a <i>secondary</i> source, and that completely and utterly rules out any author whatsoever as a reliable source on their own work. If Shakespeare himself had a website about his plays, we would not be able to cite it as a source! How much less, then, can we have an article about a lesser author that doesn't cite adequate sources? — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 12:36, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>How is the "reliability" even in question, it is a work of FICTION the author is the sole person responsible for it. Are we going to eliminate Lucas's early Star Wars films because the commentary on it by people before the rereleases are now moot as he changed things around? I fail to see how external commentary makes a work of fiction any more or less reasonable as a wikipedia article.</li>

</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, right? And it's the only encyclopedia that 'records' the Internet. This is information about a lasting place on the Internet. More, it's about a carefully, extensively and deliberatly crafted place on the Internet. I would love for, one day, to have Wikipedia have an entry for /every/ Webcomic; atleast enough to know what it is and some review quotations. Why? Because it's information. Usefull information</li>
</ul>
<p>. Quite frankly, I think it's notable simple because it very deliberately exists (as can be seen in the effort of world and art creation), and has existed for a long enough time that I'm very certain it will continue to exist for a good long time. Summarize: Information is usefull; content has deliberatly existed and shows all signs that it will continue to do so. <s>Narfanator 3:26 AM EST August 23 2006</s><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.7.93.7 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.7.93.7_0308.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.7.93.7">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> per Geogre and Wickethewok.

<li>I don't think that wikipedia should use external reasons such as "comixpedia exists for a 'reason'" as why even have wikipedia exist. There are encyclopedia, and countless volumes of books that contain the same information, and some would say more accurately.

<li><b>Keep</b> Seriously, I thought the whole point of wikipedia was that if you want to know something, you go to wikipedia to get infomation on it.

<li>That's a very common misconception, but no - that is not what Wikipedia is for. Wikipedia is meant to collect information from secondary sources about notable topics. There are standards for <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">inclusion</a> as well as standards for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">sources</a>.

There has never been a consensus to keep this. That's all beside the point anyway, since the results of previous AfDs don't have any bearing on the previous one as long as it was nominated in good faith.

<li>That's the problem with the folks here who try to use <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> on AfD. Verifiability, while an official policy, doesn't really matter in this case. We all know the comic <i>exists</i>. The question is whether or not it is <i>notable</i> enough for inclusion, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">the standards for which</a> are only guidelines. This discussion is intended to decide its notability, not its verifiability. The information is obviously verifiable, but if consensus holds that the subject is non-notable then it's pointless to add sources. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 00:44, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>In response to Flamarande, no, linking to the website will not satisfy our content policies. First, per <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, "If an article topic has no reputable, reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic." I feel like I'm stating the obvious, but a website is not a third-party source for an encyclopedia article about itself. Second, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> requires website articles contain info on "achievements, impact or historical significance," not simply descriptions of the website. Anything that is actually an achievement or of historical significance will be covered by third-party sources. To Kafziel, I'll point out that that this article is not "obviously verifiable" in the sense of our Verifiability policy. That is, "Information on Wikipedia must be reliable and verifiable. Facts, viewpoints, theories, and arguments may only be included in articles if they have already been published by reliable and reputable sources." Nothing in this article has been published by a reliable and reputable source. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 01:52, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>True. One thing I checked was the "Fictional Holidays" category under which this article had been categorized. Most of the articles tagged with that category were just that - holidays taken from works of fiction. All (or most) of the works of fiction were notable, and the holidays contained therein were verifiable. I tagged one or two other made-up holidays that weren't part of fictions for deletion just as I did this one. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 23:46, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are a lot of claims made about this person. <b>Filmmaker:</b> well, a 10 minute short from an LA film festival, a documentary also from a film festival, and a full-length movie, starring two people which have never stared in any other movie. <b>Author</b> His book <i>The Gods of Business</i> is apparently unpublished; it is not listed at Amazon, B&amp;N, Books in Print, or the Library of Congress. Founder of the charity <b>God Farm</b>. Except that the God Farm web site says it isn't up and running yet. All the references are to sites he owns or to anonymous glowing reviews at IMDB. None of the other claims can be backed up by reliable sources. Great self-promotion, not so great for this encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Also nominating:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Gods of Business</b> Has a very pretty web site, but is not listed in Amazon, Borders, Books in Print, or the Library of Congress. Wishful thinking at best; wikipedia is not a crystall ball.</li>
<li><b>The proverb</b> A 10-minute film by Todd Albertson (see above). No coverage in Lexis/Nexis entertainment reporting. <s>Not for sale anywhere.</s> For sale at Amazon as a <a href="http://www.customflix.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.customflix.com/" rel="nofollow">self-published DVD</a>. ( Possibly shown at one film festival. Only references are the film's web site and IMDB. Like all Todd's projects, tagged with a false {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikiquote_fab6.html" title="Template:Wikiquote">wikiquote</a>}} tag. Like all Todd's projects, a very pretty article with infoboxes and everything. Non-notable and not verifiable.</li>
<li><b>Soliloquy movie</b> No coverage in Lexis/Nexis entertainment reporting. Not for sale anywhere. Stars two people who have never been in any other film. Possibly shown at one film festival. Only references are the film's web site and IMDB.</li>
<li><b>Sidewalk soldiers</b> A documentary produced, written and directed by Todd. No coverage in Lexis/Nexis entertainment reporting. Not for sale anywhere. Possibly shown at one film festival. Only references are the film's web site and IMDB.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that several speedy and prod tags have been removed by different redlinked users and/or IP addresses, so expect someone to be watching out for Todd.

<li><b>Delete each</b> as the article bears the burden of proof. A very young person with ambitions is likely to promote himself, and we should not be included in those plans. It's awful that we have to prove conclusively that there is no evidence for the subjects, but the one thing to add is that IMDB has never heard of the film maker, either. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:15, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Albertson (weakly) as fundamentally unverifiable other than from his own website. He gets 250 unique Googles, which is about the same as I get and is rather implausible given the CV presented in the article. Strong delete of the balance, which give every appearance of <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">vanispamcruftisement</a>.

<li><b>What a bunch of...</b>!$!@# are the comments of the estemed contributors to this thrred. I don't know this guy, but I did design his book cover and I delt with the publisher and the webmaster not him. I don't care whether you delete him or not and he probabaly doesn't either since wikipedia is so slanted and unreliable anyway. I just looked at these comments and am disgusted with the entire process. You guys make the Bush Administration dealing with Hurricane Katrina seem smart! But as thatcher would say "so expect someone to be watching out for Todd." There is no way Albertson wrote his own bio, he didn't even want his picture or bio on the book cover. If he wrote his bio, why wouldn't he have the same stuff on his websites or link to wikipediua? It doesn't make sense to me as he hardly says anything about himself on his sites. Someone who wrote their own bio would have a link and say something like "Wikipedia now recognizes my expertise. Go to this link to see for yourself." Check your facts before you say crap about somebody. I hope you end up getting sued for defamation. For example, his website clearly says that his book isn't published until the Fall and you can't pre-order until October, thus it wouldn't be listed for sale yet nor would it be in the LOC. DA! Someone said that his 10 minute film isn't for sale and there is a link to on his website that takes you amazon. Someone else said only imdB verifies his films. imdb is far more difficult to to get into than wikipedia as they check stuff ahead of time and don't allow annonymous contributors. Instead of talking all this crap and acting like idiots, why don't you contact him, there's a link on his website, and ask him. You don't verify any information submitted to wikipedia except when you think someone is self-promoting. What if an ex-wife or disgruntled employee or stalker wrote this stuff. What if it is 100% accurate and verifable? Grow up and act like adults. If you're going to fact check, then be professional about it, and don't sling mud.

<dd>In my nomination I did not link to the various relevant policies.

Also what <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a>. For example, wikipedia generally does not have articles on things that do not exist. If and when the book is published, and if it otherwise meets the notability requirements for books, the article can be rewritten. Movies with very little audience and exposure generally do not meet notability guidelines. In the case of Todd himself, Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collector of information, and the importance of individuals must be independently verifiable (such as through newspaper articles about his achievements). Whether the article was written by an ex-wife and said bad things or written by himself and said good things, it would be a candidate for deletion because it can not be independently verified. On final comment, funny thing about his personal IMDB profile, it says it was submitted by "anonymous." <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 20:37, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete Them All and Response to Thatcher131</b>!I don't know how to respond in-the same thread as Thatcher131, so I am posing this here. I apologize, but I've never done this before and don't have the time to learn a new markup language.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I apologize if I came across as a jerk earlier, but some of the comments didn't and still don't sound professional or objective, but rahter feel like a bunch of bullies ganging-up on someone and I find that unfair or plain old wrong. Nonetheless, I think all of these listings should be deleted too.</dd>
<dd>My reasons are differen't than Thatcher131's reasons. When I read these articles I don't find them flattering to Albertson at all. Nor do I think they are accurate. I do believe his websites are accurate and they don't say 99% of this stuff. So they should be deleted because no data is far better than bad data.</dd>
<dd>I also believe these articles should be deleted because I don't think the fact checkers are objective and probably not qualified to fact check. Most of these comments are nasty personal attacks. For example, he's a wannabe or this guy really worked hard on creating the phony websites. Again, they were not written objectively by professionals and I question the competency and motives of the contributor.</dd>
<dd>For example after I correccted Thatcher131 on a few of his obvious mistakes, he changed the verbage to read that his DVD was self-published. His Proverb was publised by CustomFlix. They are same people who publish 60 Minutes, A&amp;E, NBC among lots of other "big boys." The company is owned by amazon and very legitimate. Saying "self published" makes it sound like he is shipping VHS copies out of his garage. Then Thatcher131 says, in a "I told you so" tone, that his imdb biography is written by anonymous. WOW!!!!! 95% of imdb's bios are written by anonymous or just signed with someone's email address. You have to be a major A lister to have a big name attached to your bio. For example, Jim Belushi's bio is written by anonymous. Go to imdb and actually do some research and check this out instead of just talking out of both sides of your mouth.</dd>
<dd>Here's the point, I'm not a film expert, I'm just a graphics designer and I know this. Even a half way smart person who has done anything at all in the "industry" knows this. Thatcher131 and I suspect most people claiming to be experts here don't know this because they're not experts, they're not even smart, they're wannabes. If they were experts, they'd be doing this for a living not living out some sort of fantasy by self-publishing on a free encylopedia.</dd>
<dd>Just so there is no confussion, I think all this articles should be deleted as well. And I also think that if wikipedia ever hopes to be taken seriously, you need to have some serious people running it. There are other models like dmoz that lets the average joe edit, but they do so under the supervision of qualified editors. This whole thread illustrates this perfectly in my mind.</dd>
<dd>Just my two cents. Have a nice day!</dd>

I personally don't consider imdb entries necessarily as criteria for judging notability. Even if there's an entry at imdb, editors need to check qualitatively whether the global achievements of the subject meet wiki's criteria by looking for other corroborating sources.

<dd>I was not aware that there was a Wikipedia article about me, let alone 5 of them until “Miss_Pat” brought this matter to my attention a few hours ago. I have neither written nor commissioned nor asked nor approved nor authorized anyone to create, modify, or edit the articles entitled Todd Albertson, The Gods of Business, Soliloquy movie, The Proverb movie, and/or Sidewalk Soldiers. Had I created these articles, they would have been far more polished and professional in appearance and content than they are now.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Some of the information in these articles is correct and verifiable. That information appears to be directly stolen from my websites verbatim in violation of US and International copyright laws. The rest of the information is completely erroneous and/or taken out of context and is malicious and damaging. Therefore I have already contacted Wikipedia's copyright violation department and asked this information be removed immediately because of the copyright infringement. Additionally, I have contacted the Wikipedia info team and asked them to remove the libelous portions of these article, i.e. - the remainder of garbage.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have no desire to be listed in Wikipedia. To be listed in the Encyclopedia Britannica, which I am not, is an honor. I am not of the opinion that being listed in Wikipedia is any sort of "badge of honor”. It is more on the order of being mentioned on someone’s MySpace blog.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Moreover, I am outraged at how easy it is to add and create erroneous and libelous information without someone verifying it first. To put the burden on an individual to find out that this erroneous information exists is not the correct way a professional organization should conduct business. Some of these articles are over a year old and went unnoticed. There are some very serious and alarming errors in the Wikipedia editing process.Toddalbertson 03:40, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> There are examples of subjects who do not wish, for whatever reason, to have a wiki article on them. So the issue is not whether the subject approves of their bio or whether they want to be listed.

<li>Don't delete~!!!!-Its a good comic to me so far...and probably a lot of other people! &gt;_&lt; Why delete it if just for fun??? Or just for apathetic boredom? There's not that many hosting sites that display comics like Spinny's&#160;;_; It would be really disappointing to see it disappear~after all the hard work Spinny did! Some of my friends saw Spinny's work and was really surprised. They don't know that much people that could draw that good and actually post it online for everyone to see and enjoy. Everlasting Wanderers deserves a wiki because its been a comic since 2 years ago. Ok, that didn't make much sense...but this comic was created by a very hardworking person, Spinny. A wonderful artist who posts comics online so everyone could read it. And now there's a wiki for Everlasting Wanderers. Why are people opposing it? Just because it isn't in the encyclopedia, doesn't mean that it has to have something to do with world views, etc. Everyone has their own opinions from what they see in daily life. Hopefully some people understand what I'm trying to say. &gt;w&lt;" <a href="../../../x/o/c/User%7EXoChibiox_edda.html" title="User:XoChibiox">xoxo Chibi =</a>] 01:32, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>- Using Alexa as a gauge to rank webcomics is not an accurate gauge. Many comic hosting sites, such as <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_Genesis_e932.html" title="Comic Genesis">Comic Genesis</a> and <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smack_Jeeves_7118.html" title="Smack Jeeves">Smack Jeeves</a> get blanket Alexa rankings for the domain itself, while their individual comics may not necessarily receive the listed high traffic. Furthermore, while there may be only 95,000 google hits for Everlasting Wanderers, the top hits are obviously the fancomic and related information. Fans of Everlasting Wanderers also know it goes by the shortened name "Everwander, which net a few thousand more hits that are almost entirely dedicated to Everlasting Wanderers. If you utilize only Google hits and Alexa rankings, The Lounge piggybacks from Comicgenesis.com's Alexa ranking, and obviously does not share the majority of google hits from the rather generic title, yet it (and more like it) would be allowed to maintain a wikipedia entry. If you mark Everlasting Wanderers for deletion based on these two criteria, you are being unfair and discriminatory, simply because there are many other webcomics in the same situation, but happen to be hosted on the correct domain to provide an aggregate Alexa rating. If Wikipedia is going to crack down because of the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> requirements, that's fine. However, if Wikipedia does so, it should affect *all* offenders, and not just this one. <a href="../../../h/o/o/User%7EHoorayforicecream_30b9.html" title="User:Hoorayforicecream">Hoorayforicecream</a> 05:02, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>- I feel that the argument to delete this page, based on the premise that the subject does not have many hits on Google, is a very weak one. Unless it can be proven that this page violates any of Wikipedia's rules, or that it can be treated differently from the hundreds of other webcomic pages currently on Wikipedia, this page should not be deleted. - <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinter04_9c5f.html" title="User:Winter04">Winter04</a> 06:15, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. The argument to delete this page, based on the premise that the subject does not have many hits on Google, is a very <i>strong</i> one. As this is Internet-based content, a lack of Google hits or a low Alexa rank shows that there may not be enough interest in the webcomic for external independent sources to write about it. Wikipedia requires all information in articles to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> from external reliable sources. Unless it can be proven that this webcomic has been mentioned in multiple such reliable sources, this page <i>should</i> be deleted. <a href="../../../a/w/y/User%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3b01.html" title="User:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh</a> 10:47, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>- I would like to point that the format for this page is similar to how almost every other webcomic page is built, so I fail to see how this can be considered "non-encyclopedic content". Also, the page is not forcing anybody to read the comic or telling readers that it is the best comic in the universe. It's simply there for people who want to read up on it. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinter04_9c5f.html" title="User:Winter04">Winter04</a> 02:57, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>- the comic's title was based off of the game's soundtrack so i don't find it suprising that the soundtrack would have a majority of the google hits. but the fact that the comic itself is at the top of the results should count for something69.109.114.249 03:48, 24 August 2006 (UTC) 20:48 23 august 2006 (pst)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>- I always thought of wikipedia as an online encyclopedic source where you could find *anything* you were interested in learning about (within legal reasons). Soleras 06:23, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> As others have said it's doing no harm and the reasons for deleting it seem fillwed with technicalities, inconsistencies and lack significant knowledge. If you don't like it, don't read it - but don't ruin what is a good resource for others who want to read about this comic. Additionally, I feel Soleras has made a very useful point. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.3.101.104 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.3.101.104_bb7b.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.3.101.104">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> ok, since when did webcomic follow strict restrictions, or have certain guideline that made them a webcomic? you people who try to make everything perfect, saying that this comic does not meet the guideline, or does not have much google hits or what not, ask a question to yourself, who are YOU to judge eh? are you perfect? are you SOOO smart that you must delete this small piece of work that few of the people enjoy as entertainment and as simple pleasure? And this about how this page is a non-encyclopedic? the page is providing information, isn't that enough? just providing information. As long as this comic is legal, it has every right to be on wiki just like the other pages. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.130.79.198 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.130.79.198_c960.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.130.79.198">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd also like to note that Hoorayforicecream's comments about pages like The Lounge need to be taken into heavy consideration. If we're going to nitpick the details, then we must nitpick the double standards. Soleras 22:00, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> If you do any research on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_webcomics.html" title="List of webcomics">List of webcomics</a>, you'll see a large number of comics listed that not only have extremely low Alexa ratings (over 2 million), but also fall under the same criteria. Furthermore, some webcomics can maintain a wiki entry simply by having met the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> standards at some point in the past, but have since stopped updating. Some have even maintained their wikipedia entries (such as Acid Reflux (webcomic))) for over a year. Acid Reflux was added to Wikipedia 3 years *after* it had stopped updating, and has not met any of the requirements for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Everlasting Wanderers' entry has existed less than three months, yet WP moves to strike it down now? That seems not only unduly harsh, but discriminatory. <a href="../../../h/o/o/User%7EHoorayforicecream_30b9.html" title="User:Hoorayforicecream">Hoorayforicecream</a> 23:05, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Nitpick? you people are going to nitpick on a webcomic? what kind of lives do you people have?!? and this webcomic deserves a wiki page as much as the other pages. If you people have any sense of pity, or guilt, you will leave this wiki page alone. If not, then our society is definitly heading the wrong way.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> If this is meant to satisfy the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> requirements for Notability, would there really be any difference in Notability if the author had posted this comic on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_Genesis_e932.html" title="Comic Genesis">Comic Genesis</a> instead? That should satisfy the #3 requirement for Web Notability, despite <i>nothing really changing</i>. 66.77.144.8 21:28, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment/Reply</b> - This is just a reply to some of the comments raised. Comic Genesis does not imply notability, in fact, I do searches on wikipedia on for Comic Genesis domains to flag them for deletion. Having it on Comic Gen is just like having it on Geocities, absolutely meaningless. The reason there are a a literal shitload of entirely unnotable webcomics on Wikipedia doesn't mean we should keep them. My watchlist has around 70 webcomics, all which should be deleted, but I just haven't got round to them yet and very few others seem to nominate webcomics. I mean, here's just a small selection of the webcomic tripe on Wikipedia, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corner_Pocket_1130.html" title="Corner Pocket">Corner Pocket</a>, Killer Robots from Space, <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friend_Bear_a58d.html" title="Friend Bear">Friend Bear</a>, Insert Funn13 Here. By all means nominate them for deletion, they need it. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 01:41, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment/Reply</b> - Hahnchen, are you the one who determines what is notable and what is not? Did you create requirement #3 on the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>? Comic Genesis does exactly what Requirement #3 states. It provides an independent third party online publishing site for web works. Your opinion may be that Everlasting Wanderers, Killer Robots from Space, <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friend_Bear_a58d.html" title="Friend Bear">Friend Bear</a> and whatever other comics are not notable and should therefore be purged from Wikipedia, but that is it. It is your opinion. The rules that Wikipedia have put forth regarding notability do not agree with you. Rather than mark entries for deletion that clearly meet the existing notability requirements, perhaps your time would be better spent lobbying to get the notability requirements themselves changed. Obviously, it is in need of amendment. But not only is it stupid to continue attempting to delete the Everlasting Wanderers entry by spitting in the face of the very rules you claim to be deleting them for, it is hypocritical. <a href="../../../h/o/o/User%7EHoorayforicecream_30b9.html" title="User:Hoorayforicecream">Hoorayforicecream</a> 05:54, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - There is a difference between "being distributed" and being hosted on free web space. Criteria 3 on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> refers to cases like <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Gamers_d154.html" title="Little Gamers">Little Gamers</a> which is distributed by <a href="../../../c/u/s/Custom_PC_e977.html" title="Custom PC">Custom PC</a> magazine (as well as others). Some take this criteria to refer to all "keenspot" comics to be notable, although I myself to not subscribe to that school of thought. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 14:27, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Once again, this is your <i>opinion</i>. You may not think that something distributed or published by <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_Genesis_e932.html" title="Comic Genesis">Comic Genesis</a> is notable. You're entitled to your opinion. However, <i>you do not speak directly for wikipedia</i>. You are not the rule-maker. You are not enforcing Wikipedia's rules, you are enforcing your own interpretation of the rules, which may or may not be correct. Comic Genesis promotes the comics it hosts. It provides link exchanges and advertisements on a scale that the majority of free web hosting does not. These are all services that free web hosting lacks. Do I think the rule is wrong in this case? Sure. However, I would go about trying to fix things <i>by changing the rule</i> rather than enforce my own viewpoint on WP entries that may or may not conform to my own interpretation of the rules. As an individual user, you can state and pontificate, but you do not speak for everyone, especially when you are going against the rules as written. Read it yourself. "3. The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.". Well known. Independent. Online Publisher. Yes, comic genesis falls under all of those terms. If you disagree, then <b>change the rule</b>.<a href="../../../h/o/o/User%7EHoorayforicecream_30b9.html" title="User:Hoorayforicecream">Hoorayforicecream</a> 18:41, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I suggest you read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB#_note-6" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB#_note-6" rel="nofollow">Note #7</a> of Criteria 3 on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which states that "although GeoCities and Newgrounds are exceedingly well known, hosting content on them is trivial." Since Comic Genesis is similar to both Geocities and Newgrounds in that anyone with a webcomic can be hosted on Comic Genesis, being hosted on Comic Genesis is considered trivial and thus does not satisfy Criteria 3. Also, Hahnchen doesn't seem to be enforcing anything (he isn't an admin so it isn't possible for him to), he is only offering his opinions to this debate, similar to what you have been doing.--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 19:15, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You might misunderstand me. I am sure there is a huge amount of published material on what might be termed the "urban lifestyle", just as there is a whole pile of material on what might be termed "country living". The question is whether the term refers to a generalisable phenomenon in the way that the article currently suggests it does. To add an article in which one says everything possible about what it's like to live in a city is perhaps a bit of a stretch- I would say that it either drags us into the "random collection of information" zone or, otherwise, would simply be a statement of a stereotype- for which there is no place on WP. However, if this refers to a specific term used in a specific way (I haven't yet seen any evidence that it does), then that is a different matter. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 20:18, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am very familiar with the defense industry, Navy League ,and the US Navy. The first time I ran across the name was in the <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spruance_class_destroyer.html" title="Spruance class destroyer">Spruance class destroyer</a> article. This was caught my attention,because other articles of this type don't detail the commanding officers for the ships involved - every class would of course have a first commanding officer, and each ship in that class would have one an initial commander, and many more thereafter. Following the link,I thought perhaps the gentleman was notable for some other reason, but he appears, at best, to be known in the San Diego area. He works for a division of a large company, but does not head that division. The first commanding officer of a retired admiral? Hardly notable; in fact the admiral in question doesn't have an article on WP.

<p>The article seems confused about what the topic is. It originally contained no mention of the word <i>quenzer</i>, and now only uses the word to point out that the article doesn’t define it. It contains an apparently unrelated brief description of the origin of the name <i>Smith</i>, text that was also added to (and later removed from) the <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smith.html" title="Smith">Smith</a> article. A Google search for <i>quenzer</i> sheds no light on the mystery of what this article was supposed to be. Maybe this was meant to be a user page, or maybe it was supposed to have a different title. Either way, it doesn’t belong here. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob_Kennedy_d47c.html" title="User:Rob Kennedy">Rob Kennedy</a> 04:44, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Non-notable Wiki. I don't see any verifiable information from reliable sources and certainly there are no secondary sources cited. Doesn't meet WP:WEB. Also, not an especially large number of articles on this wiki either, though thats not a criteria for keep or delete. This was nominated for deletion before (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_CreationWiki_b6a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/CreationWiki">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/CreationWiki</a> - 4 months ago), and was "no consesus" with most of the keep votes being bad reasons, such as the idea that we should keep this article because it shows that Wikipedia doesn't hate it. All the keep reasons in the previous AFD had no basis in Wikipedia policy and it probably should've been deleted by the closing admin. Anyways, a brief mention in <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_wikis.html" title="Christian wikis">Christian wikis</a> (which there is now) is enough. <b>Delete</b> per above reasoning. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 06:21, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Thousands of sites run MediaWiki. Is nevertheless not part of the Wikimedia Foundation? Yeah, like guesstimatingly 99% of all MediaWiki sites. They don't like Wikipedia's NPOV policy? Neither do a lot of people who can't realise most people disagee with them, I'm afraid.)

<li><b>Comment</b>. This list was created as an attempt to forestall the re-creation of the Pseudoscientists category. The strongest argument against the category was that it didn't allow for annotation of entries, and so a list was suggested as an alternative. Before you delete this list, I would suggest trying to re-delete the category and see for yourself why this is quite possibly the best compromise available. Also, FYI, I was the person who nominated the category for deletion in the first place. --<a href="../../../w/c/l/User%7EWclark_3ce6.html" title="User:Wclark">Wclark</a> 07:10, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep, otherwise merge, (NOT delete) but a bit of info:</b> - When I was writing the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spa_Road_Junction_rail_crash_c439.html" title="Spa Road Junction rail crash">Spa Road Junction rail crash</a>, the description of the junction appeared to take over the article. I considered that at the beginning of the article of the accident, it would put people off reading and detracted from the article for this reason, even if it had it's own subheading. I also considered it inappropriate at the end. I therefore considered it best to put it in an article of its own where there was a link very early on in the crash article. This stopped the relevannt but lengthy information about the junction taking over the other artcle, but offered it very early on. Notice how only the minimal information about the specifics of the junction was mentioned in the accident article. I think if we get rid of this then we need to <b>merge</b> and <b>not delete</b>. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickg1980_9b87.html" title="User:Nickg1980">Nickg1980</a> 12:09, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>and is already a Icelandic under-17 international</i> &lt;-- Does this mean he's played on the national junior team? (I don't really follow soccer).

<li><b>Keep</b> per ChrisTheDude's explaination that he passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, specifically <i>Sportspeople/athletes who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports</i> <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 12:57, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Umm, ChrisTheDude says nothing of him meeting WP:BIO. Do you know why? Because he doesn't. Playing on the national boys (not junior) team does not constitute notability, and Illugason has not played in a fully professional league. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 20:40, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>It still does per <i>or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports</i> - a professional league is not required. To boot, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is just a guideline, so it is more important to follow the spirit rather than the letter (which we're also following in this case) under <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:28, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Football is not a mainly amateur sport, so that one doesn't count. Second, it's easy to play the WP:BIAS card in discussions like these, but I would rather direct the effort to Icelandic <i>national team</i> players without articles, which I have had on my task list for some time. See RSSSF for a comprehensive list of national team players who ought to have articles here (unfortunately the page doesn't load right now). <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 16:03, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course there are lots of articles that still need making, but that's hardly a good reason to delete other articles - Wikipedia is still a work in progress. As for there being lots of professional soccer players, that may be true, but given the context, it's an inappropriate comparison. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:32, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What context? His Icelandic nationality? We can't keep articles just because they relate to subjects about some of the more obscure nations. That is not the essence of WP:BIAS. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 20:25, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, if there's a fully professional league in Iceland that he's elidgible to play in but doesn't, it might be used to make a case for him failing <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> - but even still, playing on the national team is the kind of thing that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is looking for. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:52, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>This is a dead end article about a non-notable author. I'm sure her books are very readable in Norwegian, but her books aren't available in any translation.

<dd>I don't think so - the bot has been picking out orphaned AfD nominations not on the daily logs and listing them, with deadly accuracy.

<p>The result was <b>keep</b>. TerriersFan is correct that 'merge and delete' is not an acceptable outcome to support (it destroys the edit history, which violates the <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">GFDL</a>). He also doesn't go quite far enough, because there are in fact only two possible 'choices' - keep or delete. AfD does not govern merges. After an AfD merging or redirecting may be done based on discussion that took place during the AfD, sometimes by the closing admin, but it is still effectively a 'keep' result as far as the AfD goes - that its content may be moved elsewhere or its own content may be replaced with a redirect is secondary.</p>
<p>Clearly many believe that this should not be a separate article, but it is up to them to discuss, perform and defend the merge in the normal way if they want to. Apart from that we have very few editors arguing for actual deletion, and 'keep (in some form)' is the only possible summary of the consensus here. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:28, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Some thoughts. This section was starting to overwhelm the original article. It was becomming hard to navigate around the article. There was certainly no intention to 'sanitise' the article; the new article is clearly linked and the link can be made more prominent if required. Inevitably, the section is going to get much longer, and the problem worsening.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It certainly is not a content fork - the guidelienes say:</dd>
<dd>'Sometimes, when an article gets long, a section of the article is made into its own article, and the handling of the subject in the main article is condensed to a brief summary. This is completely normal Wikipedia procedure; the new article is sometimes called a "spinout" or "spinoff" of the main article, see for example wikipedia:summary style, which explains the technique. Even if the subject of the new article is controversial, this does not automatically make the new article a POV fork. However, the moved material must be replaced with an NPOV summary of that material.'</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The criticism of the title is a matter of no importance; it was chosen to try to be NPOV. If the length is truely of any import then it can be renamed John Prescott: controversies or whatever.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is no point in saying that the article needs attention or this or that section needs spinning off unless an editor is prepared to do the work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If this section is simply merged back then not only will the problem remain; it will get worse. What is needed is a concrete proposal backed up by some editorial action.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let me emphasise that I will lose no sleep whatever happens to this article. If the split is undone; so be it but unless someone else is prepared to take an initiative then an article on a major political figure will progressively decline. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 21:55, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - On balance, I think that TerriersFan's arguments hold true. Merging this section back will more than double the length of the article.

<dd>Currently, ALL the controversies that Prescott has been involved in lie in this separate article- how therefore is the main <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Prescott_aa59.html" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a> article NPOV? I am not criticising TF's boldness- but he has got this one wrong. For a start, from what I can see even with the controversial material back in, JP was only 34 kb- reasonably big, but hardly enormous. Moreover, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">WP:Article size</a> specifically states that an adequate summary of the material must be left in the article proper after a split- this is not currently the case (and it is imply not appropriate in this case to spin out all the negative stuff anyway, in my view). <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Prescott_aa59.html" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a> could do with some improvement, but I do not see any reason to take this kind of drastic action, although I am not criticising anyone and TF has gone about things correctly (it's particularly laudable that he advertised this AfD on the main JP talk page). It's a straw man to criticise other editors for pointing out a mistake. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 01:08, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair point about the main article summary; I think that TF got that wrong - I have now expanded <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Prescott_aa59.html#Involvement_with_specific_events" title="John Prescott">John Prescott#Involvement with specific events</a> to list all the incidents and toughened the text. Nothing is now concealed! Do you agree that the main article is now NPOV? I would add that with JPs disappearance over airport terrorism, alledged links to his son's company etc to be added this is going to grow and grow! <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 01:19, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The section in <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Prescott_aa59.html" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a> is now a wikified bulletpoint-list of controversies (listed under the bizarre heading "Involvement with specific events") involving Prescott, with very brief descriptions (some of which are rather juvenile (and inaccurate), e.g. <i>Brit Awards, 1998; dockers cool him down</i>). I do not agree that this is an adequate summary, nor is it NPOV, and it is certainly not an improvement over what was already there. Other editors can obviously have a look at it and judge for themselves. The removal of the "controversies" section wholesale was a mistake, but one that is easily remedied at the moment by re-merging the recently excised material. If the two articles remain separate, the problem is really going to grow and grow. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 01:09, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - in view of the debate that the name of this article has caused it may be of interest for me to explain to where it came from. The <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Newton_6c7e.html" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> series of articles is generally used as an example of good naming conventions. The subsidary articles start <i>Isaac Newton's</i>; for example <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Newton%27s_early_life_and_achievements_c963.html" title="Isaac Newton's early life and achievements">Isaac Newton's early life and achievements</a>. Hence I extrapolated to John Prescott (not that the two are comparable&#160;:-) ). I also wanted to avoid a POV title such as 'controversies' in the hope that the succesful intervention by Prescott in an event or incident can also be included. Having said all that, the mood of the Community is obviously for a title that is much shorter and snappier.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree that merging all the information back into the main article would greatly affect its balance. It's well referenced and I believe the detail is encyclopedic and warranted. Changing the title to TerriersFan's suggestion would be fine, still remain NPOV, and I agree be more descriptive and less unwieldy. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransUtopian_743a.html" title="User:TransUtopian">TransUtopian</a> 18:03, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b>. Linda is not a star. The only reason she has a page is because she married Hulk Hogan and is in Hogan Knows Best. Nothing else.

<p>While I disagree on the fact that Linda Hogan is not a star as she is one of the stars from Hulk Hogan Knows Best which is a successful show, I don't think anyone is going to bother to look at this page or correct it. Even though she's a star and she is well-known and famous, that doesn't mean she is a big star to people. Linda Hogan IS a star but not a big star and if she does bigger things that there can be more info on for a page, then we can give her this page. Right now, the page has basically no information and no one is going to be interested in looking at it. I say, get rid of it. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonetare_2013.html" title="User:Tonetare">Tonetare</a> 18:08, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>REDIRECT</b> Redirect this to Hulk Hogan's since they are married and she has not done anything to deserve a page besides be in a reality show with her husband which does NOT make her a star no matter who knows her or how many red carpets she goes to.<a href="../../../m/g/h/User%7EMgHoneyBee_39e0.html" title="User:MgHoneyBee">MgHoneyBee</a> 01:11, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>LMAO at no matter who knows her or how many red carpets she goes to. That was pretty funny. But anyway, the WWE has about a trillion fans even though, lets be honest, WWE is going downhill, but they still have lots of fans. A star is just someone who is famous which means well-known. If Hogan Knows Best has good ratings it means lots of people watch it, probably all the WWE fans and some. Linda Hogan is well-known now and that's the bottomline. However, she is not real real well-known. not a big BIG star like Whoopi Goldberg or her husband for that matter. I agreed with you to get rid of this page so lets leave it at that. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonetare_2013.html" title="User:Tonetare">Tonetare</a> 07:12, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> - Blanking and redirecting seems a bit premature.

<p>Unencyclopedic, Wikipedia is not a directory (WP:NOT). Detailed information such as this can not be easily maintained as bus routes and frequencies change. Information on the areas served by buses should be on a general page such as Buses in London, with a link to detailed information of bus timetables etc that is readily available from the Transport for London's website <a href="../../../m/r/h/User%7EMrHarper_12cb.html" title="User:MrHarper">MrHarper</a> 22:37, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep:</b> These articles provide an insight not just to where they are now, but where they have been. It is common knowledge bus routes are changing but this adds to the history. I think the bus routes are not really showing to be timetables either and are constantly expanded. Also, in what way are they directories? They do not show adresses and contact numbers or any other similar info. Those are not my only reasons.<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimply_south_c93c.html" title="User:Simply south">Simply south</a> 23:49, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - It is a good index for the route articles (which have themselves survived AFD). Furthermore, the information is not set out in the style of a timetable (which may be cited as criterion for deletion); instead it shows which operators control the various routes and their scope (start and end points). The information, in this format, is not available elsewhere. Mrsteviec 07:46, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> London bus routes do not change that often, and this list, with just start and end points, is not that detailed making it easy to maintain. It does not contain frequencies as mentioned in the deletion request. It is an efficient way of presenting information not available in this format from the TfL website. How exactly would "Information on the areas served by buses should be on a general page such as Buses in London" work? Sounds like one very long and complicated page to replace a simple, easily used (and maintained) list. <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPage94_2518.html" title="User:Page94">Page94</a> 10:30, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> - Most of the article seems to simply be a directory of unverified and (possibly) non-notable facts, which has presumably been sourced directly from bus timetables. If that was all there was, then I'd recommend deleting the article for breaching <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> in several ways (mere collection of public doman material, directory, indiscriminate information). <i>However, a part of the article is a list of links to articles.</i> The linked articles have recently survived the deletion process (see: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_London_Buses_route_1_5c19.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/London Buses route 1">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/London Buses route 1</a>, though it is worth noting that despite that AFD those articles still all look to be OR), so can be regarded for the sake of this AFD as valid articles. So while I think that this sort of article shouldn't normally belong on Wikipedia, as <i>this article</i> is a valid list, linking to a large number of articles, it should be kept. It's also worth noting that it, and all the bus route articles, are in need of some references. Hopefully this AFD process will motivate someone familiar with the subject to reference these articles. --<a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako_0eb9.html" title="User:Mako">Mako</a> 22:35, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> as has been stated earlier, the bus routes in London do not change very often. Also the fact that the article <i>is</i> up-to-date and has continuously been so shows that your assumption that it cannot be kept up-to-date is wrong. There are many articles that most people would not even consider deleting that are not being kept up-to-date (e.g. <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luiz_In%C3%A1cio_Lula_da_Silva_2200.html" title="Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> (President of Brazil), <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_Air_66fc.html" title="Ryan Air">Ryan Air</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_29%2C_2003.html" title="September 29, 2003">September 29, 2003</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republika_Srpska_295d.html" title="Republika Srpska">Republika Srpska</a> all contain the phrase "expected in 2005" used in the future tense). <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 03:55, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This isn't a timetable, it's a useful compendium of routes, along with links to dozens (hundreds?) of related articles. Could be further enhanced by adding historical routes now discontinued, as has been done in similar articles. While this information may seem trivial to some, it is useful to others, and doesn't detract from the project. --<b><a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkatz_0c62.html" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a></b><i><small><sup><a href="../../../c/k/a/User_talk%7ECkatz_91bf.html" title="User talk:Ckatz"><font color="green">chat</font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ckatz_cb51.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ckatz"><font color="red">spy</font></a></sub></small></i> 08:07, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Another <b>comment</b>. As I mentioned above, keeping it "up to date" shouldn't be the issue. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a directory. If something is worthy of being included in Wikipedia it doesn't matter if that thing is active or not (for example we have articles on topics such as <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Caesar_5dfd.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Waterloo_202f.html" title="Battle of Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a>, even though those things do not exist today). So if today's London bus routes are worth listing then so are all cancelled London bus routes. -- <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako_0eb9.html" title="User:Mako">Mako</a> 22:15, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The London bus route structure has been remarkably stable, and we have been able to have articles on individual routes because of it. As such, listing them together appears to be completely justified. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 14:37, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There appears to be no independent corroboration of the existence of the Paghman Saadat. Biographical material on Ikbal Ali Shah and his offspring and their offspring should be moved to their respective pages. The article appears to have been written mainly to promote <a href="../../../i/d/r/Idries_Shah_9bc6.html" title="Idries Shah">Idries Shah</a>, while avoiding the dispute about his claims. <a href="../../../j/e/d/User%7EJedermann_9261.html" title="User:Jedermann">Jedermann</a> 15:35, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Why not merge the articles. If not a very large amount of accurate information (which is what an encyclopedia is about) will be lost, which amounts to vandalising. (<a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunarian_d37c.html" title="User:Lunarian">Lunarian</a> 17:17, 14 August 2006 (UTC))</li>
<li>Already suggested on the discussion page. No response.
<p>BTW, how is Wikipedia to determine whether the information on a trickster figure is accurate and not deliberate misinformation repeated by uncritical hagiographers? Idries Shah's statements about his origins, early years and activities were notoriously inaccurate. He grew up in England from 1927, but allowed his follower Elizabeth Hall to repeat his myth that he first went there in 1960. And so on... <a href="../../../j/e/d/User%7EJedermann_9261.html" title="User:Jedermann">Jedermann</a> 09:11, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
</li>
<li>And so on, and so on. But I doubt Wikipedia is going to determine.
<p>You are, by refinening your studious judgement. "Jedermann" means "Everybody" (Elckerlyke), no? So do not worry. (<a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunarian_d37c.html" title="User:Lunarian">Lunarian</a> 09:48, 15 August 2006 (UTC))</p>
</li>
<li>I must apologize for budding in again. I had to verify something that may be to the point about the article under discussion. When the links are carefully examined it follows that Idries Shah was accepted as an advisor for the Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge (ISHK) alongside <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Burke_%28science_historian%29_007c.html" title="James Burke (science historian)">James Burke</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_C._Dement_61fe.html" title="William C.

<li>The Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge (ISHK = <a href="../../../i/s/h/Ishq.html" title="Ishq">ishq</a>) was set up by Bob Ornstein, Shah's deputy in the USA. Is it surprising that IS was 'accepted as an advisor', or that they invited him to speak there, or that they gave him an 'award' for so doing? This article should be deleted. Ridding it of promotional material would leave next to nothing, IMO. <a href="../../../j/e/d/User%7EJedermann_9261.html" title="User:Jedermann">Jedermann</a> 14:47, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Are you privy also to Robert Ornsteins tenure at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_University_8e23.html" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a> or was that a bum ride&#160;? I doubt that promotion is going to be of much avail to IS in the position he reclined to. The ideas he proposed deserve attention. But ideas you should be generous to. Have you noticed the article integrates ideas on <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_M%C3%BCller_d794.html" title="Max Müller">Max Müller</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Merton_6c5e.html" title="Thomas Merton">Thomas Merton</a>, on <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viktor_Frankl_0c8a.html" title="Viktor Frankl">Viktor Frankl</a>? Did you know about Reza Arasteh?
<p>If I am not mistaken the bibliography refers to the biography of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Graves_42ea.html" title="Robert Graves">Robert Graves</a> that carries all the criticism you need, if you really want to balance your opinion.(<a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunarian_d37c.html" title="User:Lunarian">Lunarian</a> 18:57, 16 August 2006 (UTC))</p>
</li>
<li>For the last time, the place for presenting I. Shah's ideas is on his own page - not in a manufactured POV-fork. On a point of English, 'mentioning' Mueller and Frankl does not amount to 'integrating' them. The first sentence really sets the intellectual tone, since <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> had no male line of descent. <a href="../../../j/e/d/User%7EJedermann_9261.html" title="User:Jedermann">Jedermann</a> 14:04, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You are right of course. The english is not perfect. And, "...males accepted as descendants..." it ought to have been (<a href="../../../s/a/y/Sayyid.html" title="Sayyid">Sayyid</a>).
<p>What is a man to say about this&#160;? Delete and get it over with, I guess. But since I cheer for the weasel I still say: do not delete. And since you promise to stay out of the picture, I will too. It's oblivion for both of us anyway.(<a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunarian_d37c.html" title="User:Lunarian">Lunarian</a> 23:08, 17 August 2006 (UTC))</p>

Countless billions of tax dollars will be spent on getting heroic spacemen to the moon in the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle to distract us from problems here on earth and to enhance our national prestige. The new project is expected to take 14 years with 21st century technology, so they can walk around and pick up rocks.

Further, given the mobility of people, not just now but in previous decades, there's really no value in these kind of lists because the people on these lists can be "from" many, many places. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 18:51, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please see <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> to find out why this argument is wrong. Lists serve a function that categories and consitutant articles do not - especially good lists. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 03:55, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Read it before I posted this. LIST is a guideline, not gospel. I do not think that this is a good list or that my argument is "wrong". <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 16:01, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>List is a guideline, but it does explain the difference between lists and categories, and rather than rehash it here, it's easier to point you to a place where the explanation is already eloquently explained. This is not really a "good list" in the sense that it couldn't make "good list" status, but we don't delete articles because they're not yet up to good article status - it doesn't make sense to hold lists to a higher standard. Given the facts of the case, your argument remains wrong. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:55, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just to clarify, I understood you to be using "good list" in the vernacular and not WP sense, and responded using the same sense of the phrase (and please don't construe it that I'm saying the <i>quality</i> of an article is a basis for deletion, because it's not). That said, I happen to disagree with you, and stand by my opinion on this matter. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 22:30, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I more or less, but I played a bit with the phrasing to suggest that your standards for the article are too high. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 12:54, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The Smithfield Cafe is a real but thoroughly non-notable restaurant in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (the comment about it being "the only establishment that serves alcohol before 10 am" is simply wrong, in addition to being completely unsourced). Wikipedia is not a directory. The fact that the article is written from a non-neutral point of view, and that the link has been added to a few places it doesn't belong only serves to underscore the fact that it probably doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 11:49, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>Original creation</i> - Article originally created following a request at "Articles for creation", as shown <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-05_b591.html#Transfersome" title="Wikipedia:Articles for creation/2006-07-05">here</a>.

<li><i>Deletion proposed</i> - Proposed deletion template added on 13 July 2006. Original comment when the proposed deletion template was added was "Advertising for a company's <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">non-notable</a> product. Google search for "Transfersome" turns up only some 900 results, a lot of which seem to be solely understandible by the Medical community, or are in German." This was added by <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen451_48b7.html" title="User:Green451">Green451</a> with an edit summary marked as "minor" (in actual fact, prods should not be marked as minor edits).

<li><i>Undeletion proposed</i> - My original comment on this, on 23 August 2006, when deciding to ask for the article to be undeleted was "Well, I found a <a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00265304" class="external text" title="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00265304" rel="nofollow">current medical trial</a> involving the product. I'm not sure what the guidelines are on medical products still being tested (I know some drugs being trialled have articles), but the actual science behind it seems interesting." <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> was kind enough to undelete the article for me on 23 August 2006, and I then nominated it for a deletion discussion the same day. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 13:08, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(1) The 'understandable' comment is hopefully being addressed. (2) How does the results being in German affect this debate?

<li><b>Original PRODder comment</b> - as the person who originally PRODded this way back when, I had no idea this would come back and cause a debate like this. I should mention that marking the ProD as minor was an accident, and I apologize for that. As for the matter of this article, I still cannot make any sense of it, and as such, I don't believe I should vote on the matter. If the article is kept, some *serious* rewriting must be done to make it understandable to the "Average Joe". <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen451_48b7.html" title="User:Green451">Green451</a> 15:16, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - it appears to have quite a bit of publications in medical journals.

It might well be obscure, and it might well end up as a failed technology, but I think it is worth giving this one a chance. A fair bit of cleaning up, tidying of references, and wikifying has taken place, but it still needs a rewrite for readability, and it should focus on the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a>, not the company that developed it or even the name they've come up with for this technology. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 16:25, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Since they played in level 10 (I'm assuming this is accurate), that made them notable at one time. I don't think they suddenly become no longer notable after dropping down a league, especially when you consider they could promote right back to level 10 after this season, thus officially regaining their notability. Perhaps the notability guideline needs to be expanded to address this issue. - <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPal_3bfe.html" title="User:Pal">Pal</a> 00:03, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm basing this partly on DJ Clayworth's asserton that they aren't in the top 500 clubs in their country. There's a limit. We don't want to end up with 10,000 articles on football clubs - leave that to the football wiki, if there is one, and if there isn't I'm sure there will be. Plus, nominator notes it clearly fails to meet the specific criteria for football clubs. Yes, they were in Division One -- for one year, after which they were kicked out.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> since it is a big improvement on the Party Political Broadcast that was here before. At least it is now amenable to edit. Last time, I tried inserting "they say that" in vain attempt to achieve NPOV before deciding that it was a hopeless case and nominating for afd. The comments then were even less charitable.<br />
But it does open the door to every lobby group to push up their Google rating by being listed on Wikipedia and that is why I vote to delete.

<li><b>Keep</b> - There seem to be two different issues in play here - (a) whether the page is incapable of being reformed to be NPOV and (b) whether Open Europe is a notable enough group to include to avoid the Catholic Mothers for a New Holy Roman Empire issue. On (a) I agree it badly needs a critical section and general conversion to NPOV, but I don't think it's irredemable. On (b) I think it it passes the notability test. On a two second google search I found that the OE site is being archived by the British Library <a href="http://www.webarchive.org.uk/tep/13267.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.webarchive.org.uk/tep/13267.html" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> as part of a project archiving a fairly small number of UK politics sites, which is, I guess, a pretty good claim to some sort of fame. --Monalisaoverdrive 22:16, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Rather than being deletionist for the sake of being deletionist, I think it's within the realm of common sense to recognize that the CML is a much stronger and better-known league than almost all of its counterparts at its level. I understand the need to delete pub-league type clubs and understand that it is policy that notability is inherent, but not limited to levels 1-10, but I think it would be a waste to junk all these clubs because they do have the potential to be expanded, unlike a random level 15 club that almost no one knows about.--<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalerion_82c4.html" title="User:Balerion">Balerion</a> 17:53, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Where do we stop, though? I'm not really deletionist, but to allow these teams means we shouldn't prevent future level 12 teams from getting articles. Since the rule is <i>generally</i> level 10 and up, it's already a stretch to include more than the odd very notable level 11 team, let alone a bunch of level 12 ones. Eventually someone will come along and write a really excellent article for a level 13 team (or a whole league-full of teams). What will we do then? <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 18:41, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
I would like to point out that this entry is notable for more than simply the level of football played by the team in question. The club's FA supported tour of Malawi during the summer has generated national and international press coverage, with an additional article due to be published in the Guardian Travel section in the near future.</p>
<p>As part of a FIFA initiative, each African Football Association is twinned with a European equivalent, on which it can call for support in its development. Malawi's allocated partner is England. A major responsibility that can be taken on by the clubs and individuals who sit within the structure of the English FA, is that of raising awareness of football in Malawi, and the role it can play in assisting the country's development. In my opinion, the Wilberforce Wanderers tour of Malawi can contribute to this goal, and therefore should be maintained on the site.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at a time when international sporting relationships are visibly fraying (as is the case with the current animosity between Pakistan and the ICC) the publicity generated by the Wilberforce Wanderers' tour of Malawi can only serve to re-inforce the idea of sport as a force for uniting, rather than dividing, the world community, regardless of any cultural or economic differences.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Old Chelmsfordians recently played in the Essex Olympian League, which, while Step 7, is effectively a 10th level league because it is a direct feeder to the level 9 <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essex_Senior_League_1d3c.html" title="Essex Senior League">Essex Senior League</a>. Furthermore, it was agreed that EOL Division One clubs are inherently notable. Wareham Rangers were just relegated from the Dorset Premier League, which is Step 7/level 11, but is co-feeder to the Wessex League Division One with the Wessex League Division Two (in which all clubs are considered notable). DPL clubs seem to be considered notable as they all have pages and there is a template. Up until a few years ago, the DPL was a direct feeder the Wessex League before the WL expanded. It has sent <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamworthy_United_F.C._0091.html" title="Hamworthy United F.C.">Hamworthy United F.C.</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaftesbury_%28Dorset%29_F.C._cabb.html" title="Shaftesbury (Dorset) F.C.">Shaftesbury (Dorset) F.C.</a>, and <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherborne_Town_F.C._23b7.html" title="Sherborne Town F.C.">Sherborne Town F.C.</a> to higher levels within the last three years, so it's certainly a Step 7 league with some standing. As such, Wareham Rangers' long-term participation in the league until their relegation last season should merit notability. --<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalerion_82c4.html" title="User:Balerion">Balerion</a> 18:02, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, to illustrate it with an unlikely example, if Manchester United or Arsenal were relegated to below level 10, then obviously they should retain their articles because in the past, they had won major trophies and been extremely well known.

<li><b>Retain Wilberforce Wanderers</b> The Wilberforce Wanderers played in what was considered an international friendly on this tour, the game was attended by the Malawian FA president and overseen by 4 full FIFA officials.In particular the ADMARC tigers side contain a number of current full internationals (R Gonani, V Gona amongst others). I understand that playing against international opposition with the last 12 months coresponds to playing at a level well above 'level 10' of the English game and hence the club must be considered notable. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.171.142.219 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.171.142.219_048b.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.171.142.219">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Keep Wilberforce Wanderers</b> Notable as I and the Oxford English dictionary define it means <i>worthy of note or notice</i>. The reference to level 10 and above of the English game is a simple and crude proxy for this assessment, but is clearly no replica for a full understanding of a clubs presence. As I see it, the Times and shortly the Guardian will see fit to take notice of The Wilberforce Wanderers, and record their exploits which is more than can be said for the majority of those clubs operating at level 10. I would trust these mainstays of the English media as a better judge of what is worthy of note than any simple proxy.</li>
<li>I see that Robotforaday has completely missed the point with his comment. The reference to notability is not based on simply going on tour as choirs could equally do, but is based on being recognised as worthy of note from an independent body, in this case the national press. Any choirs who the national press see fit to report on are also very deserving of a place.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.171.142.219 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.171.142.219_048b.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.171.142.219">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>This article was nominated once before (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_NiMUD_42d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/NiMUD">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/NiMUD</a>). The voting was flooded with sockpuppets of this vanity article's main author, <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoung_Zaphod_f689.html" title="User:Young Zaphod">User:Young Zaphod</a>. That AfD was closed as no consensus, although when you subtract the sockpuppets from the discussion, I think there was a strong consensus for deletion. That sockpuppet has been active again recently, and in cleaning up his mess I came across this article and its history. Since I think the original AfD got it wrong, I'm bringing it up AfD again. This software package is largely non-notable, and the article is clearly a vanity article - the MUD has few users, and little activity. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 15:33, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Yet nominator claims, "No notable mainstream work, no notable magazine appearances." Amazing what you can find if you actually look around rather than delete an article simply because you've never heard of it, and don't approve of the subject. The subject nearly passes even the absurd 100-film <i>American</i> test. Why not set a 5-book minimum for porn-star notability? That way, Japanese models like 古都 ひかる <i>are</i> notable, while probably <i>every</i> American porn star is <i>NOT?</i> Applying standards of one country onto another is an attempt to ensure cultural bias on Wikipedia, if not a covert attempt to censor it. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 14:35, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>as i put on the talk page......... why delete it. it doesnt hurt anything having it on here, its all factual, so why not have it just in case... its all true stuff, it is notable with 50 thousand people, and if small towns such as east rutherford new jersey get a page, which have not even a fifth of the population as this ZIP Code, why not have this page? doesnt hurt anything, its there just in case, thats it</p>
<p>- i also saw your comment about 90210 not even having a page, and so i searched it. i found links to beverly hills, but more importantly i found a definition stating that 90210 is the number ninety thousand two hundred and ten. so what your saying, is that the zip code 43228, a major area in Columbus, Ohio, with a population of just under 50 thousand people, is "non-notable", but point out that 90210 is the number ninety thousand two hundred and ten is? if the numerical definition of 90210 stays around, why should true information on a region?</p>
<p>May I also point out a page titled: "1976 Indianapolis 500" which has only the results of the race and a bit of information on a rain delay. But noooooooooo.... this is notable. Because you know thousands of people will be looking up who finished 14th in the 1976 indi 500. however if a present day geographical location pops up, it isnt notable. why? because some random person said it isnt, and because of that, his/her opinion should be forced onto everyone. ive ran into many problems with people nominating articles for deletion, while keeping other seemingly ludicrous ones. but i dont propose they be deleted. why? because it doesnt hurt anyone to have them around. ive actually been experimenting with this site for a while, and it started out just as an experiment on sites this large being open to the public to edit. but i have now decided to focus on the prejudice of the administrators. i will continue to experiment here, and if the results are drastic enough i plan to have them published. this is just one more example <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe03era15strong_28bc.html" title="User:The03era15strong">The03era15strong</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe03era15strong_c102.html" title="User talk:The03era15strong">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The03era15strong_9733.html" title="Special:Contributions/The03era15strong">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>Yep, see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ZIP_Codes_in_the_United_States_24ac.html" title="List of ZIP Codes in the United States">List of ZIP Codes in the United States</a>, there are also lists for individual states.

<p>Exactly, no articles on individual ZIP Codes. That's something I think is needed. If there was information covered on most of them here, that would be great. While you all apparently think of a ZIP Code as just post office related, I think of it as a small geographical area. In ZIP Codes right next to eachother, average income may differ by 50% or more, crime may differ greatly, education, school districts, politics, which is why I think that these pages should be allowed. I encourage others to follow and create pages about different areas as I am. Most of my pages are about neighborhoods, and other areas. If someone wants to know about West Hollywood, they can easily find information on it. However, if someone hears of a place called Whatever, Minneapolis, Minnesota, which isn't famous to the whole world, they can't as easily find things on it. That is why some of these smaller less known areas I am trying to create articles on. If this article is deleted, I will still create neighborhood, ZIP Code, small town, and township articles. If there is anyone who takes my intentions the wrong way, I apologize. I would especially like to clear the tension between myself and a certain MrFizyx. I still disagree with the majority of you, but do what you please.- The03Era15Strong</p>

<li>Yes, but please do consider what I wrote carefully. "... I don't think those writing [an acceptable article on this subject] would even find this stub to be of much assistance." What good does it do to say "oh, a good article <i>could</i> exist on this subject, so we have to keep a poor one that won't lead to a good one"? Please, try this and tell me if you get a different result than I did: remove the vague and poorly sourced portions of the article. How much is left? Can you really see it as even a decent stub? If the focus were tighter -- if it were specifically about "TR-L", the Training Route that taught Guardian's Office members how to "outflow false data effectively", i.e., to lie, then there might be enough to make a usable stub. But for the whole topic of "Scientology public relations" ... I'm afraid that I have trouble not seeing it as "Hey, this is a <i>perfectly good</i> jigsaw puzzle piece... let's keep it around in case someone chooses to build a jigsaw puzzle it fits into." -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:35, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Vanity, Non-notability <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 16:36, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article, which in the end is nothing more than a repetition of <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">User:D C McJonathan</a>, is a vanity piece. It was started by a "Louise C", which I think is a <b>sockpuppet</b>, considering the subject's mother's name is Louise, and Louise C's only contributions have been to articles about McJonathan, and his equally non-notable buddies (save one, perhaps). Coincidence? Probably not. It smacks of <b>vanity</b>. Google shows this subject to be completely without any shred of notability, as the only results on Google are wikipedia clones, the user's contributions to Wikipedia and to Find-A-Grave, and a few quotes in an article/obituaries about one-dead, semi-notable friend. This person is <b>not notable</b> any more than being the hanger-on of someone remotely notable. User's contributions to television and radio are over-exaggerated, <b>largely unverifiable</b> and we don't put every possible game show contestant on wikipedia, or else we'd have 200,000 jeopardy contestant articles for example. So in terms of policy, I don't think this article meets the criteria for inclusion of a biography, violates the anti-vanity policy, and the subject is non-notable. I'd recommend this be moved to the User Page for D C McJonathan, but it's largely already there. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 16:41, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Comment: 1.) can you find any mentions of his radio work aside from his own self-statements? 2.) Lack of assertion of importance...um, how about non-notability? While vanity isn't sufficient reason alone, the vanity policy does act in conjunction with other criteria and policies, as I have stated here, first you should reread <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> and then I think you should reconsider your vote. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 17:24, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I considered listing this for deletion myself when I fist saw it and could care less on the outcome except for the spirit of vendetta with which it was proposed. This was one of two attacks by the nom after I disagreed with his interpretation of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_of_people_2346.html#Ordering_names_in_a_category" title="Wikipedia:Categorization of people">Wikipedia:Categorization of people#Ordering names in a category</a> where he interprets that the exception should be the rule. He has ranted, shouted and threatened on my talk page to block me when all that I have tried to do is follow the guideline above. He has also listed me for RfC without even meeting the requirements of 2 persons trying to first resolve the issue on talk pages. If anyone cares for newspaper and TV Guide quotes from the 1970s I could dig them out. The laughable part of this whole hype about nobility and the "de" is that the "de" is a coined use in his name anyway, it was not a part of the original <a href="../../../g/%C3%BC/n/G%C3%BCnzburg_%28surname%29.html" title="Günzburg (surname)">Günzburg</a> heritage. I knew the man, was a significant contributor to the article, added the images and placed it in and expanded the family list. If you will read both of our talk pages you will, I believe, see where the nom is coming from. He allows for no flexibility or consensus as he already knows what is right. <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> ♬ <a href="../../../d/_/c/User_talk%7ED_C_McJonathan_3332.html" title="User talk:D C McJonathan">talk</a> 21:46, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment to Comment.</b> Sorry, Doc, but don't take it personal, but after you annoyed me by not following the rules, I scratched the surface...and found you have left behind a whole bunch of vanity articles and other fluff.

<li><b>Reply</b> What I take exception to is that unless you make the rules, it is you that have not followed the Wikipedia guidelines, IMO. You have not met the standards required for the RfC above, you have challenged the value of my contributions, when you have been here twice as long, with fewer edits and more than half of your contributions have no edit summaries. <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> ♬ <a href="../../../d/_/c/User_talk%7ED_C_McJonathan_3332.html" title="User talk:D C McJonathan">talk</a> 01:52, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's sorta slicing hairs, Doc. Once you subtract your vanity articles...and I don't think my near 2626 edits are all that shabby when compared to your 2477....given that you claim to have been here longer and I had a 15-month hole in my activity due to a little participation in a war.

<li>Once again you miss the point entirely. And you claim to be "better at reading comprehension and counting." Not. My claim above was that you have been here twice as long as I and your current edit count is 3632 edits and mine is 3679 edits. But again, that is not the point, in both of your responses above you fail to acknowledge your own failure to follow guidelines. None the less, thanks for fighting for our country. <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> ♬ <a href="../../../d/_/c/User_talk%7ED_C_McJonathan_3332.html" title="User talk:D C McJonathan">talk</a> 05:19, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, in the end, this isn't about you not following guidelines or me, it's about whether the article (herein the point of discussion) is worthy of inclusion or deletion.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> The entry reeks of original research. For example, how can one know that this person's "name was submitted to The Guinness Book of World Records for being the first to break the record of the largest number of call ins to a radio talk show on WCAU in Philadelphia" unless one were involved somehow in that submission? If he had made it into the book, that would be more obviously notable, but the listing of the mere fact that his name was <i>submitted</i> makes me think this is basically a vanity, promotional, or advocacy page, of a sort wikipedia can do without. <a href="../../../u/u/c/User%7EUucp_ab6c.html" title="User:Uucp">Uucp</a> 22:15, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per Abu Badali, with one caveat. The article is in my opinion quite <i>poorly</i> written. I've tidied it up some (largely by rewriting/deleting much of the fluff) but it really should be deleted outright.

<li><b>Keep</b> Instead of asking for deletion so rashly, you should have proposed that the article be "cleaned up" first. Please explicitly state what parts of the article you deem inappropriate and how the article may be improved to comply with the policies. Most of all, do not simply say "it does not comply with the policies", but elucidate that statement properly, e.g. by listing the parts that are disagreeable to you. The article relates the history of WGC and its features and is not supposed to be an advertisement but an informative article, and I am convicned that it can be properly "cleaned up" to comply with the policies.

If you wish to make a case for keeping the article, please <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a> to demonstrate that the aforementioned criteria are satisfied.

<li>The article does indeed need cleaning. But after I reviewed the article I did not feel that it met the criteria and that cleaning it would not really help. Please look at the link I provided above and see if you can find anything that would fit under "Criteria for web content". While I still think the article is an advert, I will say that it is generally better written than most I have seen and stays away from most of the over-the-top comments. By the way this was not a rash decision. I read the whole article, looked at the external links and did try to find some evidence that it could meet the criteria. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/User_talk%7ECambridgeBayWeather_e92a.html" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">(Talk)</a> 07:23, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Keep by all means</b></s> I noticed that some entries in favour of the article were deleted and want to have them restored. Moreover, I don't deem it appropriate that this discussion is "protected" and thus prevents the public from making its opinions known. I do not altogether approve of this whole conduct and the fuss that is made about this article - some people here seem to be bent on having this article deleted as though it was something terrible that could not possibly be kept, yet it is merely an article giving detailed information about an online gaming site that takes a different approach to providing services than other gaming sites, which, in my opinion, is very noteable indeed. Wikipedia has more information about a wide range of topics than other encyclopedias, and this renders it more attractive; I personally don't think it's important if the article is "noteable" or not according to the abovementioned policy (indeed if you were serious about complying with that very policy, a lot of articles on Wikipedia would have to be deleted) - it is only important whether information is available or not, and WGC exists and information ought to be available (its mere existence, I believe, makes it noteable - also think of the different and noteworthy approach to organisation / providing services that WGC has in comparison with other gaming sites). The article ought to remain, deleting it or other articles of the kind makes Wikipedia lose information worth keeping and people will wonder why Wikipedia has so little information about certain topics.

The subject seems on the border of notability, and something of a low-grade edit war has cropped up over Mr. Ochoa's claim to be a co-founder of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intense_Football_League_f59e.html" title="Intense Football League">Intense Football League</a>. User Veronicadittman vehemently contests that claim and has repeatedly removed it from the article. The claim is certainly poorly sourced and may well be false. It should be noted that Veronicadittman's username and comments also suggests a relation to Chad Dittman, who currently runs the league, so there may possibly be other motives involved as well. The article has been tagged and then <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PRODded</a>. I thought the deletion proposal should be discussed, so I deprodded it and listed it here.

<li><b>Comment</b>: There are countless books in Japanese on Jidoka and a few in English, I suggest that you review those if you want to learn more about Jidoka. There are many 'resources' on ISO; I suggest that you start by reviewing www.ISO.org. Explaining the birth of Jidoka/ISO is not my goal; my goal is to develop a starting point to discuss a ISO-Jidoka cross-implementation... who, what, when, where and why (unfortunately, a company developed this synergy not an academic institution; this is inconvenient within the current framework). Like all currently verified articles in Wikipedia, they start humbly and develop; this is a starting point. This discussion is marred with irony because the notion of ISO-Jidoka cross-implementation is novel; I guess I have to become a consultant and charge clients to discuss advanced system concepts, development and implementation. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by JPCIT (<a href="../../../j/p/c/User_talk%7EJPCIT_2d83.html" title="User talk:JPCIT">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JPCIT_8180.html" title="Special:Contributions/JPCIT">contribs</a>).</small> JPCIT 19:57, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps you're approaching this from the wrong angle. If it is your intent to write an article about ISO-Jidoka cross-implementation, then perhaps you should actually write ISO-Jidoka cross-implementation. This article does not seem to have much substantive material on that subject, other than the fact that they implemented it, and doesn't seem to pass muster as an article about a company, because the company itself doesn't seem notable. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 20:18, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The purpose of this discussion is not to assess whether the connection of the text to the sources is as tight as it could be. Wikipedia is full of articles that no one would propose for deletion, that provide a general list of references rather than footnoting every fact. If it should turn out that "important" is truly an unsourced POV, perhaps my vote would change. But as this article appears to represent serious work, my vote is to give the editors a chance to fix what is wrong with it.

<li><b>Keep</b> the sources provided are appropriate for the topic. Being <i>referenced</i> does not mean the same thing as having <i>inline citations</i>. An article can be referenced without having inline citations, and I would say the references given are appropriate. The reason the sources are general opera books is because the topic is an important <i>general opera topic</i>. There are two other lists of operas, one including all the operas which have articles on Wikipedia, and one which is working on being a comprehensive list of operas, and this I think cuts down significantly on the POV concerns. The reason I think this list is needed is that the subject of opera is so huge, and the number of operas is so huge, that for a neophyte a list including all of these would be overwhelming, and frankly, not very useful. If a person comes to WP and wants to find an opera, not knowing anything about opera, this list is far more helpful than the list of all the operas or the category system. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 21:39, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> the decision to include anything in a Wikipedia article requires original synthesis. Are you saying that a selective list is always POV? Just because editors are involved in choosing what to include does not make the list inherently POV, because they're basing it on mainstream understandings of the works' significance. I could, for example, if I had a source, add to the Chopin article that his eyes are blue. It might be verifiable and true, but it is no POV not to include it, because it's not important to a person's understanding of Chopin. The same is true of this list -- decisions are made based on what the mainstream understanding of a works significance is.

<dd>The point is to include works which are <i>important</i> for whatever reason for a person's understanding of opera. This includes operas which are considered by some to be "part of the standard repertoire", such as La boheme, or works which show a significant shift in the way operas are written or performed, such as Armide. There is no one criteria which make a work important to the development of opera, but there are agreed-upon benchmarks, and I think it makes sense to have a list which points out these benchmarks. You are right that there must be a certain amount of editorial discretion. You label this as original research, which is a legitimate concern. I would argue that it is original synthesis (there's an essay which needs to be written), based on a reasonable amount of research and accepted truths. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 17:54, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, sort of. But what are these authoritative guides? First, there's Opera Grove, which has (I believe) articles on about 1800 operas. Then there are Kobbé and the Viking/Penguin guide (I own the penultimate edition of each). The former contains over 300 operas, the latter well over 1000, although music-theatre works are included as well as operas proper.</dd>
<dd>The list of important operas currently contains around 110 entries. I'm prepared to bet that very nearly all the works currently listed are in all those guides (and, quite likely, in the Rough Guide, too). This might satisfy <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a>, but would it satisfy <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a>? Will we be compelled to add the other 200/900/1700 operas, too?</dd>
<dd>Oh, by the way, my vote is <b>Keep</b>. This is a useful list, aimed at the beginner, and is not dissimilar to the 500+ "List of notable xxxxx" articles. <a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuillaumeTell_4aa9.html" title="User:GuillaumeTell">GuillaumeTell</a> 16:08, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The difference is that we usually leave the choice of sources to editorial discretion, as long as they fulfill that foggy <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">"reliable"</a> criterion. The talk page discussions looked fairly collegial to me, so I'm not too worried that picking the guides will turn into encyclopedic mud wrestling. The other difference is that you can actually make claims of the "considered X's masterpiece" variety if that's the opinion of one or more guides. As it reads now (and by looking at the selection process) it smacks too much of POV &amp; OR. Also, if you find two guides with 300 operas each, but a number of more exhaustive ones, I'm fairly sure that the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intersection_%28set_theory%29.html" title="Intersection (set theory)">intersection</a> of those sources isn't bigger than 150. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 17:11, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Above poster, please sign your entry so we can tell who we're talking with. If the Fanon entry is poor, it will doubtless be improved by the inclusion of whatever part of this article is worthwhile. I, however, see no content here to be saved. Steven Grant can have whatever terminology he wants for this phenomenon, but that serves as no evidence that it's a significant term of art. Lots of professionals coin terms that never make it into their profession's jargon, and (as nominator points out) the article cites no evidence that anybody else on the planet uses this term. The meat of the article is the "Use" section, which shows no evidence of being anything but original research laced with weasel words about what "many fans" think. - <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStellmach_2360.html" title="User:Stellmach">Stellmach</a> 13:27, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't want to make myself unpopular here (hah!) but it seems to me that this is distinct from the list by capacity, although I agree we are duplicating content unnecessarily. Can we separate the other article by division? Or maybe have a category for premiership grounds?

<li><b>Comment</b>Well, I think it's far more useful to have all the stadiums in one place in order of capacity rather than chop them up into seperate league articles. What's the point?

<p>Wikipedia is not an indescriminate collection of information and should not feature articles on every baseball game or series in existence. In the course of a 154 or 162 game season, there are numerous times when a team has a chance to take the lead or further their lead, and this one is not really any more significant than most others. The Red Sox were already in a fair amount of difficulty before this series even occured, and equating this with the 1978 collapse in which the team blew a fourteen game lead is really quite silly and just a media play to hype what is already one of the most overhyped rivalries in Baseball (hey, I think the fact that the two teams have such passionate fans is great, but to read most of the media you would think they were the only two teams playing). This is just not an earth-shattering occurance in baseball history. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 21:55, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> It's something that hasn't happened in at least 50 years. Certain games are notable, as are certain series. Since this is a rather rare occurance and attracted quite a bit of media attention beyond the sports pages, it's worth having an article on it. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 22:14, 23 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It attracted a lot of media attention because it involved the largest media market in the United States which happens to have a fanatic baseball fanbase. It has not happened in so many years because five game series are not played as a general rule. It is far less important than the 1978 collapse, or the 1964 Phillies collapse or the 1995 Angels collapse or the 1969 Cubs collapse or many other events in baseball history. Teams lose five games in a row all the time, even good ones, and the entire Red Sox season did not hinge on this one event. Should we start having articles on every incident in which a first place team got swept or a contender lost five straight games? <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 22:55, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, unfortunately. I'm a big-time Yankee fan who was sure glad to see the Sox choke, but that doesn't mean it deserves its own Wiki entry. It should certainly be mentioned in <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yankees-Red_Sox_Rivalry_439f.html" title="Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry">Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_baseball.html" title="2006 in baseball">2006 in baseball</a>, but a whole article for a regular season series seems a bit much, especially since out of 162 games it's hard to say that 5 are more important than another. Besides, the jury's still out on this one with about 35 games left in the year. The Sox may come back to win the division (hopefully not) making the series a moot point. Also, Boston Massacre (as applied for 2006) is a neologism that hasn't withstood the test of time like 1978's Massacre has. Finally, I don't think there's precedent to give series or individual games their own article. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 23:28, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Go ahead, but be prepared to take a lot of flak for it. On a more serious note, there is nothing wrong with the series being mentioned in the appropriate articles, it is just not an important enough event to include its own article and a game-by-game analysis. That's what Retrosheet is for. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 00:21, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>"Memorable" is not a criterion to determine encyclopedic worthiness. Postseason series are automatically notable because of their magnitude. A regular season series does not automatically get that status two days after it finishes. If it becomes important and historically relevant, then it can be recreated next year, when we have the power of perspective and hindsight. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 00:23, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This was not a playoff series, but 5 random games in the middle of a 162 game season that may or may not end up having an impact on the pennant race. Does a 4 game sweep by the Cubs over the Cardinals warrant an article&#160;? What about a 3 game sweep, or a doubleheader sweep by the A's over the Angels&#160;? The press has to hype these things, that is thier job but at the end of the day, NY or Boston media hype does not make this article encyclopedic. <a href="../../../n/o/_/User%7ENo_Guru_cc59.html" title="User:No Guru">No Guru</a> 00:24, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Ok</b>. Maybe I went a little overboard with the game by game analysis but to be honest I was at work and really bored so I had some time. The thing is, there are so many things on here that should not be an article (not just in my opinion either) but they are. This was not just an ordinary 5 game sweep, and I'm pretty sure that people will remember this for a while to come, but if you <b>really</b> want to delete it then go ahead. --<a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESportskido8_4685.html" title="User:Sportskido8">Sportskido8</a> 21:04 EST, 23 August 2006</li>
<li>SK8, we're all <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> here and appreciate the effort of uploading newspaper images and linescores. But at the same time, some policies of Wiki apply, such as notability and precedent (of not having individual articles on the majority of regular season games). If people remember this series as one that really had an impact on the 2006 season, you can recreate the article. For now, though, it seems too early to judge how important this is. As to your comments about things that shouldn't be on Wiki, you have a valid point, but the more quality articles and the fewer bad articles there are, the better. Remember, you're entitled to nominate any article you want and have it go through the process just like this one is. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 01:13, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

That's not the case here. The rest of us baseball fans have already forgotten. There are no articles for the 1978 Bucky Dent game or the 1986 Game 6, etc. and those no doubt will always be far more famous than yet another occasion of the Yankees stomping the Red Sox. If the Yankees win the WS this year and this is still being talked about afterwards, I'll be happy to undelete this myself. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 20:37, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with <b>Weak keep</b> but for a slightly different reason: I think that only time will tell if the vernacular phrase "2006 Boston Massacre" has much sticking power. (I will admit right up front that I don't follow baseball, so I don't know.) If that phrase is just something that a Yankees devotee would use for vanity purposes, then I'd say to delete it. But if in a few years (even 2 or 3 years) the general sports world refers to it with that name, then its validity is established. I'm not knowledgeable enough on baseball, or baseball taxonomy, to agree/disagree with <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYankees76_f29c.html" title="User:Yankees76">Yankees76</a> about instead having it on the <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yankees-Red_Sox_rivalry_e87c.html" title="Yankees-Red Sox rivalry">Yankees-Red Sox rivalry</a> page but that seems like a reasonable middle ground. Perhaps it could be moved there, and then if time grows the series' legend, it can once again have its own page. Migp 18:43, 24 August 2006 (UTC)migP</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: There are several undoubtedly pivotal series that deserve articles before this one. This series was in the middle of August and the Yankees were already leading the division. How about the last regular season series between Detroit and Toronto in 1987? With the Blue Jays up by a game, the Tigers had to win 2-of-3 to force a one-game playoff but, instead, won all three to win the division by 2 games - with Frank Tanana pitching a 1-0 shutout to clinch. Toronto last the last seven games of the season to blow a 3½ game lead in a week. Keeping this article without making that one is just recentism and Yankee-cruft gone wild. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 01:56, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: This may be a case of recentism. How about the principal editor moves it into a sandbox in his userspace? If the series still seems important at this time next year, he can just move it back into article space. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 04:04, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Suggestion</b>: Perhaps we can find a compromise here. There is no denying that this is a big event in baseball, an event that broke a record, and changed a penant race. Perhaps we can move the article to the Baseball Wiki, and link to there from the Boston, New York, and Rivalry pages. The article will exist, and be linked to, but it won't be an actual part of the main Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilent_Wind_of_Doom_ba59.html" title="User:Silent Wind of Doom">Silent Wind of Doom</a> 06:22, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ghetto rigging (a bong) is very important to stoner culture, and I don't know of any other proper slang terms for creating a bong using minimal materials. Perhaps, there's a more universally accepted term for "ghetto rigging" that I haven't heard of. I removed the prod on accident when I added the source (which I originally left out precisely because it is "The Stoner's Dictionary") and removed the message requesting sources. --Cynadar 23:15, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I would not class her as especially notable (unlike both her advisors, Rao and Rubin, who we don't seem to have articles for).

<dd>I certainly have nothing against Dr. Zenutto (who I have absolutely no knowledge of), and as you say, the CV reads impressively. Personally I'd be cheering this person on - going to Carlton means she is likely a fellow Canadian, and I work with a bunch of government statisticians who deal with surveys and census stuff. But certainly there seems to be no notability requiring an article - nothing that would produce any linkages form other articles, etc. If Wikipedia wanted to go in the direction of ignoring <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> and including stubs on pretty much all established academics I suppose there would be nothing wrong with that, but having these sorts of articles decided haphazardly based on who happens to come across the AfD doesn't seem useful (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Roberta_Wenocur_987b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Roberta Wenocur">Roberta Wenocur</a> was deleted, for example). - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 06:19, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete all</b> Whether or not they've played that the Glastonbury Festival is pretty much irrelevant, as being one of dozens of indie bands to play a big festival does not confirm notability (nor do the links added by Truthbringer, whom has never voted to delete anything, no matter how non-notable).
