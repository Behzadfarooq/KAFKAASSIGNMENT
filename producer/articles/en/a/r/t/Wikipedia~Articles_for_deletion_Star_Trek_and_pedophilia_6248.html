<li>Much as I hate to say it, <b>Keep</b>. That specualtions are made by the press, and by police, and fairly widely reported, is a fact. This article merely notes that fact. It does not claim that the specualtions are accurate, merely that they ahve been made. It seems reasonably NPOV to me. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 03:34, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - A single original story, which doesn't even suggest anything more than coincidence amounts to nothing notable. If this was widely reported and discussed, than yes, I would support it's inclusion in wikipedia in *some* article. Let's pretend it was real: why create an article? There's a widely beleived correlation between crime novels and crime, but we don't create a specific article for each in every combination of specific crime novel and specific crime. Instead we make an appropriate comment in the article about the book (if it's pecular that specific book), or to the crime (if a type of reading material is common to the crime), but we don't (or shouldn't) have an article on every conceivable crime/book/tv/movie/work-of-art combination that some local cop noticed. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 04:23, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (but I am the author of the original article.) As pointed out above, I was merely noting that the correlation was considered and widely discussed, not that it was necessarily true - it could be like the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_Rainbow_Party_2ace.html" title="Sexual Rainbow Party">Sexual Rainbow Party</a>, which was a subject of wide discussion despite flimsy evidence the phenomenon actually existed. I think that if we keep that article, this is worth keeping as well. Oh, and here's another recent article on the subject from <a href="http://www.macleans.ca/topstories/justice/article.jsp?content=20050530_106573_106573" class="external text" title="http://www.macleans.ca/topstories/justice/article.jsp?content=20050530_106573_106573" rel="nofollow">Macleans</a>; this isn't based on just one news story. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoultaco_1629.html" title="User:Soultaco">Soultaco</a> 04:33, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment: Well, if we follow the Maclean's article, we can either create a Star Wars and pedophilia article also. or we can find an appropriate existing article, and put it there (*if* sufficient notability exists). I'm sure there must be hundreds of *other* apparent commonalities or patterns that police see (or think they see). Also, putting this "theory" in an existing abuse-related article will subject it to appropriate peer review, by active editors on the subject. Passing off a POV in such an article will get you reverted much quicker than in some obscure little article, nobody sees. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 12:05, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, perhaps this could be merged into an existing article, but I didn't find one that seemed particularly appropriate. Suggestions? <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoultaco_1629.html" title="User:Soultaco">Soultaco</a></dd>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> Inherently POV; no matter how matter-of-factly the article is written, the discussion of such a correlation on what is presumably a coincidence is always going to result in a skewed point of view. Trekkies, as abhorrent as they may be, may not necessarily <i>all</i> be paedophiles. Consideration of a correlation does not make for an encyclopaedic article. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 11:09, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, it does specifically note that the hypothesis does <i>not</i> imply that all or even most Trekkies are pedophiles - rather, it implies that pedophiles are attracted to Star Trek, which is quite different, as it says nothing whatsoever about Star Trek fans in general (who could also be attracted to Star Trek for other reasons entirely). <a href="../../../s/o/u/User_talk%7ESoultaco_02c5.html" title="User talk:Soultaco">Soultaco</a></dd>
