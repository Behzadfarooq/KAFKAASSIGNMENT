<p>Appears to me to be non-notable diploma mill. Author effectively acts as he owns the article, and while I hesitated to propose it for deletion (because he took the "use my version or delete it" position, and I do not wish to further it), on second thought I felt that the organization is simply not notable enough. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 05:04, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - isn't deleating at this point really just giving in to BertWoodall (<a href="../../../b/e/r/User_talk%7EBertWoodall_968e.html" title="User talk:BertWoodall">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BertWoodall_d20f.html" title="Special:Contributions/BertWoodall">contribs</a>)? I don't see how that meshes well with your statement that "[w]e will not bend to your demands". As an accredited school of higher learning, one would expect NCU to have a entry in Wikipedia -- for heavens sake we have thousands of articles about non-notable High Schools here at Wikipedia, and we are going to delete an entry about a controversial post-high school educational institution just because their PR man is being too noisy? That doesn't seem to make sense, but then I am just an anon coward, so what do I know... -- 63.226.38.202 06:00, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As a regionally accredited university at the center of recent controversy it seems like a most ideal topic for Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> Such an entry belongs in a place like Ripoffreport.com and not a forum guised as a source of valid information. Is the purpose of the Wikipedia forum to service individual vendettas, disgruntled employees, or un-informed individuals? This type of entry assumes much and does not serve as a source of valid information but as a tool of misdirection and assumptions. Silensor seems extremely un-informed with regards to the facts about NCU and can only assume that s/he has no experience with the institution directly and therefore is making unfounded blanket statements. S/he speaks of "recent controversy" as the ration for their view, but in fact the issues I can only assume s/he speaks about are historical because in truth they are related to NCU only through their former President Donald Hecht. There are no recent issues to speak of. I suggest s/he at least attempt a course so that they may avoid speaking from ignorance. There are other forums an individual may use for such recourse, this forum is inappropriate as Wikipedia might be misinterpreted to be a source of valid unbiased information on this subject. NCU has nearly 4000 students and over 600 affiliated staff. The information contained within this site serves no public interest, in only serves to satisfy a vendetta of a few individuals. If such a page must exist, it should be put under the heading of Donald Hecht as the topic and not NCU. Do the right thing. Delete this item.

<li><b>Comment</b> 24.116.71.38 tracks back to CableOne.net in Arizona.

<li><b>Keep</b>. We always keep accredited institutions of higher education, and we tend to keep the more notorious diploma mills. Northcentral University is indeed in the <a href="http://www.ope.ed.gov/accreditation/Search.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.ope.ed.gov/accreditation/Search.asp" rel="nofollow">database</a> of <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_accreditation.html" title="School accreditation">accredited</a> institutions kept by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Education_de27.html" title="United States Department of Education">United States Department of Education</a>. If it is actually a diploma mill, being accredited makes it somewhat unusual. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 06:02, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and protect</b>. Hecht's involvement would probably make it more than "just a diploma mill". It is probably notable to have been fined a cool $500k for breaches of the law. As we have seen, the page will continue to come under attack. I believe that the public has a right to know about the organisation and its founder. Wiki is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> censored. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 06:19, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Assuming that it really is accredited by North Central, then it can grant bachelor's degrees. We have tons of articles on elementary schools... I think most any college should have an article. The <i>content</i> of the article is another story. In a really bad case, which this appears to be, it might be OK to just delete the article to save everybody a lot of heartache. Still, the material at least has some references. I mean, the scandals and stuff just make the college <i>more</i> notable. I don't see how it can go. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 06:33, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Ohconfucius and Herostratus, accredited universities are absolutely notable, there is no need to be prejudicial against those that are on-line. <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F_6995.html" title="User:Yamaguchi先生">Yamaguchi先生</a> 23:08, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> General information to define NCU okay. Biased information designed to slander has no relevance here.

<li><b>Keep</b> The information in the Northcentral article is accurate and should be kept. I understand that it may be unflattering, but this site is not meant to be a marketing tool. Students spend a lot of money working on their education. If the school has controversial practices, it may negatively affect their accreditation status, and thereby make degrees from the school of questionable value. Prospective students and others should be aware of this information. Bluecanada 18:13, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
