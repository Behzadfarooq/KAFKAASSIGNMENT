<li>Welcome to the everburning brushfire war of the month here on Wikipedia. Kibitzing on AFD doesn't take much effort (unless you get too emotionally invested, I suppose), so it's not as if valuable resources are being consumed. Personally, the only reason I still bother to vote on these is because I don't want people to be able to claim that "consensus is clear" just because people have stopped voting on "pointless" AFDs. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 10:00, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>The first two cases are examples where contacting the school itself is trivial.

<li>Is Wales now part of England? I need to pay more attention to the current events page. In answer to your question about who might be looking for articles on schools: if and when wikipedia rises to the level that it hopes to attain, (where people use it as a reference tool containing useful, reliable and detailed encyclopedic articles on important topics), then I could think of any number of situations where a researcher may need to gather information about public schools.<em>—<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff"><font color="Indigo">Gaff</font></a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff"><font color="MediumSlateBlue">ταλκ</font></a></b></small></sup></em> 20:25, 19 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can't think of a single non-contrived situation where it would be easier or more useful to read an encyclopedia to find out about a local p[ublic school than to simply call that public school. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 23:31, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>There may be no "policy" per se, but there certainly is a <b>precedent</b>. 85%-90% of all schools nominated for VfD/AfD in the past year are not deleted. See: <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Votes_for_deletion_archive_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Votes for deletion archive">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Votes for deletion archive</a>.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 06:05, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>True but they haven't been "keep" either. There is no consensus on school articles as 90% of the VFDs show.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 07:21, 19 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Depends on the school type. Elementaries almost always lack consensus. High schools, are usually kept with a clear majority, and often consensus, especially if complete articles. Also, lets not forget the delete counts include unverifiable schools, including out and out hoaxes by vandals (so the real school keep rate is possibly higher than suggested). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 07:34, 19 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One thing I think the "keep" crowd has glossed over is the fact that a large majority of the schools that are "no consensus" at closure are actually being voted around 60% for delete. The only reason they are being kept is that there is no supermajority, but the vast majority of schools do have a majority of delete votes.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 23:51, 19 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Irrelevant. AfD policy and guidelines are clear that when there is no concensus to delete an article, it isn't deleted. That is the standard, the policy and the precedent. The important aspect of all this, is that as a matter of <b>precedent</b> derived from the practical application of the AfD policies, is that almost all school articles are not deleted.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 01:49, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, there's a massive majority for deleting fake hoax schools, like the one you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FRollings_middle_school&amp;diff=25962390&amp;oldid=25961992" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FRollings_middle_school&amp;diff=25962390&amp;oldid=25961992" rel="nofollow">admit</a> to making. School articles with a reasonable amount of content (even if not famous) are likely to get a majority to keep. Sub-stubs are likely to have a majority to delete. That shows people do in fact want school *content*, they're just not happy with articles lacking it. If you look at votes, you'll often see the first few are delete based on a one-line stub, and then keeps after modest improvement. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 01:18, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You act as if debating on AFD somehow prevents people from contributing to Wikipedia. It isn't a zero-sum game; discussing and debating on AFD doesn't detract from work on the encyclopedia.<br />
I'm uncomfortable with this theme of "Stop arguing about this!"

<li>Then by all means, start expanding some of those stubs and show it's actually possible. School articles that already survived an AFd discussion are likely not to be deleted anytime soon, so if you're scared of your work getting deleted, start there. Also, take a look at our featured school articles and just do it. A lot of the discussion would be moot if there was a real article instead of a substub to begin with. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:53, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Unlike some keepers, I don't mind (don't love, but don't mind) a limited number of selective school AFDs each month. At some point the line does have to be drawn. For instance, I don't support pre-schools or home schools (which have had articles, that had to be deleted). I respect those who use reasonable means, even to delete schools I think should be included. However, a small number of AFDs a month, does a perfectly good job at this. It picks the "worst" for attention. Such limited cases are more likely to either be deleted (though I oppose that) or cleaned up (which is a fine result). However, with masses of schools are nominated, then everybody just repeats the same vote, same words, and nothing is acocmplished. It's interesting how a couple months with the highest nominations actually resulted in the fewest deletes. Huge numbers of nominations is disruptive and pointless. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 10:37, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>What B.S. The claim from "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles on the basis of being non-notable" that being called "deletionists" is a personal attack is the biggest load of horse manure that gets spewed all over these school AfD pages. It simply is not a personal attack to refer to "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles on the basis of being non-notable" as deletionists, any more than calling some of us "keepers", "inclusionists" or "weak" or any of the labels your side comes up with.

<li><b>Keep</b>: I agree with the "high schools should be kept" ideology. Most communities only have one (sometimes they even share on with a neighboring community or two), so they are an important place.

<li>Irrelevant. AfD policy and guidelines are clear that when there is no concensus to delete an article, it isn't deleted. That is the standard, the policy and the precedent.

<li><b>Keep</b>, why do people keep nominating schools for deletion which no final decision has been reached on whether all schools can be classed as notable.

<li>Aha. Somebody else who's rushed in on their high horse to make a comment without bothering to investigate the reasons for nomination thoroughly. Well done!

<li>From the article in it's current stae, I can see no reason as to why it has bee nominated, nor why anyone can now deem it suitable for deletion. Maybe in a previous formate the article wasn't what some people thought acceptable, but surely rather than nominating for deletion it would have been no more or less work to have edited the article of the 'offensive' sentences or to have done minimal research to have made the article suitable for inclusion. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 01:01, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is an excellent illustration of the reasons why encyclopedic overviews of interchangable sets are more valuable than overly-specific individual articles about the members of those sets. An overview can answer these questions, typical of the expectations of an encyclopedia reader, whereas individual articles formed largely of demographic data cannot. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 18:33, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
