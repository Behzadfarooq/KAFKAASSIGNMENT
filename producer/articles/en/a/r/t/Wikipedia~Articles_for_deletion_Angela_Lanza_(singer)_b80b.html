<li>Is there a consensus that being rejected by American Idol makes one notable?

<li>I'm not basing the keep on her trying out for American Idol. It's mainly for her international touring, and the fact its covered. <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> was *intentionally* changed to allow for notable people without huge commercial success to be included. If we got adequate independent reliable sources, covering the tour, then that's adequate. Also, hopefully we don't go and delete articles because newstory links go dead. That's pretty typical, as free access is normally only given to recent stories.

<li><b>Comment</b> I was thinking I'd lean toward keeping this one based on the USO tour, but after a little searching, I'm not sure about that now. Take a look at <a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:epzOahLZkvYJ:www.detnews.com/2004/metro/0405/20/d08e-158345.htm+%22angela+lanza%22+uso&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=8" class="external text" title="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:epzOahLZkvYJ:www.detnews.com/2004/metro/0405/20/d08e-158345.htm+%22angela+lanza%22+uso&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=8" rel="nofollow">this article (Google cached) about her participation</a> in the USO tour. After reading the circumstances of the tour, do you feel that she's notable enough? And further, can there be a good article here? I know that participating in the USO is technically touring internationally, but is this really the same as being individually booked (and in most cases, paid) to play in another country? I'd be interested in hearing the reasoning one way or the other. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 00:49, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It'd work for me. Moreso, in fact, that it's the USO and not some random club tour. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 01:15, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, the USO part is why I was originally inclined to say keep. That's certainly a notable enough organization. The way she was sent though was almost club-like though. And I guess what troubles me the most about this one is that there's little coverage of her beyond 'local girl makes good' type articles. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 01:25, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But, also consider, that in this case we have more verification that she was actually independently selected for the tour, than in other cases. Sometimes, we have articles on singers/bands that "tour" nationally, but the "tour" is really them renting various small venues at their own expense, and getting write-ups in music sites, that basically cover every gig around. In this case she was selected by an organization independent of herself. While she just got her expenses covered, those expenses are probably more than what many performers get paid for smaller venues. Often, booking a singer/band as the non-headline member of a tour is no big deal, because if it doesn't work out, you cant punt them pretty easy. Going to Iraq, probably takes more thought and committment, though. But, I'm going to make the obvious concession, that I'm not seeing this becoming Featured Article. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 01:39, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>From the articles on her tour, it seems as if she was chosen for the tour based upon a minor beauty pagent. I agree, though, that this isn't some group who paid their way to Canda one weekend to perform at an open-mic night. She definitely participated in a substantial tour, but is it a tour she took because she was in demand, or one she took because she won it from being a runner up in a Hooters contest? If it's the former (or even if it's just somehow shown not to be the latter), then I'd feel much better keeping this one. For tonight, I think I'll refrain from commiting one way or the other. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 02:16, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. All news articles appear to be about the same event (and so count as one). I don't agree with her passing <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Does being part of a large tour qualify as going on one? Does every <a href="../../../r/i/v/Riverdance.html" title="Riverdance">Riverdance</a> dancer qualify under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>? <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 02:12, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> refers to a "<i>single day's news event only</i>", and this is much more than one days event. Also, Riverdance involves a large number of people on a stage at once, doing similiar things. Hence, they warrant an article, but only a combined article for the whole production. Lanza was a solo act. The only other musical act mentioned (or in the photos) is UC3. So, for a made-up analogy, if a solo act toured with Riverdance to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Qatar and Iraq; then they would likely warrant an article. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 05:35, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm referring to the news stories which all seem centred around May 19-20, 2004, about the USO tour. The rest seem to be either about trivial events or from local media. Nevertheless, I'm suspending my delete vote for now. <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 06:58, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
