<li><b>Comment</b> I would just like to point out that the above user created the article, so they have a vested interest in the article and their discussion should be heavily discounted. Personally, this is one of the worst pages I have ever seen on WP, and there is no reason whatsoever why it should be kept.

<li><b>Comment</b>. There is actually strong case for deletion, maybe it will be mreged, and no case to keep it. The page is total dreck, unencyclopedic, and it doesn't belong here. And I suggest that you don't write long ditribes insulting the other editors and cluttering the page. The afd guidelines do discourage those with a vested interest (like creating the article) from voting, or at least having their opinions discounted. And if you don't like it, tough. There's plenty of other notable articles to create or fix, and this is not one of them. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 23:36, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep (Weak Merge)</b> John Dalton makes a strong case in his dissection of the AfD in the comments below. Booshakla's stated reasions for deletion are weak on their face and mostly opinion.

If the WWE's <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_announcers%27_table.html" title="Spanish announcers' table">Spanish announcers' table</a> deserves it's own entry, something like Thumbtacks, which have been used in multiple matches in multiple promotions, certainly has the notibility to deserve it's own entry. Also, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_object_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Foreign object (professional wrestling)">Foreign object (professional wrestling)</a> appears to be a general discription of the use of Foreign objects in professional wrestling rather than going into specifics about the items themselves. --<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVladamireSteelwolf_c290.html" title="User:VladamireSteelwolf">Vladamire Steelwolf</a> 05:57, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comments</b></li>
</ul>
<p>A first proposal for deletion has already been answered on the talk page of the article. I reproduce the original proposal and its rebuttal here.</p>
Original Proposal:
<blockquote>
<p>essay, nn, uncyclopedic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rebuttal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I object to this proposal for deletion. I refute the arguments put forward for deltion as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>essay. By essay, I presume that the proposer is referring to the policy that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_publisher_of_original_thought_Wikipedia" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">is not to contain essays stating a personal opinion</a>. This article is not an essay and contains no personal opinion. Every sentence is a fact and is drawn from a reference independent of the author, as such the accusation of essay status is false.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>nn. I presume 'nn' means <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">non-notable</a>. Notability states "if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other." This article draws from four independent sources. In addition three of the sources are peer reviewed. As such the article well and truly exceeds the criteria for notability and has a stronger claim to notability than most Wikipedia articles.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>uncyclopedic. According to the Category:Articles_which_may_be_unencyclopedic page, unencyclopedic means the article fails to pass <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>. The claim of unencyclopedic is false as the article passes all these tests. The proposer needs to point out which, if any, tests on <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> this article fails.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As directed in the template: "You may remove this message if you improve the article, or if you otherwise object to deletion of the article for any reason.", so I am removing the template.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original proposer has gone on to reinstate the proposal and modify the reasons given. The proposer seems to be taking a shotgun approach, where if enough allegations are made one will hit the target. To answer this new set of allegations:</p>
<p>nn. Already answered above. This article exceeds the notability guidelines.</p>
<p>very specialized. Specialization has <b>never</b> been a reason to delete from Wikipedia. By the same criteria any one of thousands of physics, mathematics, or any field of endeavour that requires a high level qualification would also have to be deleted.</p>
<p>borders on original research. Nearly every aspect of the article comes from a peer reviewed publication. The allegation of original research is baseless. One or two statements do not yet have references, but these are not original research and are definitely not grounds for deletion. Again, if every article that had a minority of unsourced statements was deleted nearly every Wikipedia article would have to be deleted.</p>
<p>essay. Answered above. There is no point of view or personal opinion being pushed in the article. Essay seems to be the proposors personal point of view, with no objective basis.</p>
<p>doesn't need it's own article. Personal opinion of the proposer. Please back this up with reasons based on Wikipedia policy.</p>
<p>Violates various aspects of WP:NOT. A sweeping statement. Please state exactly which aspects of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> are being violated.</p>
<p>I will point out that the proposer has made no attempt to answer the rebuttal given to the original proposal to delete. Instead the proposer put up another proposal with modified reasons. The proposer seems to think that it is not necessary to justify his/her position but that it is sufficient to just repeat it.</p>
<p>To quote from <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">Wikipedia:Deletion_process</a>: "deletion is based upon policy and not personal likes and dislikes." and "So deletion is not a strict "count of votes", but rather a judgement based upon experience and taking into account the policy-related points made by those contributing."</p>
<p>What it says is that the deletion process is not a popularity contest. Rather it is to be policy based. Let me answer each commenter:</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a>: You are putting words into my mouth. Your conclusion is baseless. Yes I did create the article. No I don't have a vested interest in it and personally have no interest in professional wrestling. I am defending this article to prevent abuse of the Wikipedia deletion process. Every objection you have to the article has been answered, yet your only response is to repeat the allegations louder. As per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">Wikipedia:Deletion_process</a> you need to prove that the article violates policy and not attack the messenger.</p>
<p>Simply calling for deletion is not a positive contribution to Wikipedia. At the minimum you need to be able to back a call for deletion with valid arguments. Better still contribute to improve the article in question.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a>: Merge into <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_object_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Foreign object (professional wrestling)">Foreign object (professional wrestling)</a>. That is a useful suggestion.</p>

A useful point about the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_wrestling.html" title="Hardcore wrestling">Hardcore wrestling</a> article, though overlap between articles is not a reason for deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have real concerns with the direction the AfD process heads at times. My understanding is that the AfD process is not about voting. As such there is no need for abstention from voting due to interest. Rather than being a vote the keep/delete statement is a one word summary so each reader knows where the commenter is coming from. I understand the AfD process to be about putting forward the pros and cons of deleting an article in accordance with wikipedia policy. Once the cycle of pros and cons has run its course hopefully a clear answer has emerged on what to do. It concerns me that some see the process as a "yes/no" vote where the majority rules. Are my concerns shared? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Dalton_7b14.html" title="User:John Dalton">John Dalton</a> 07:01, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Here are some questions to consider. What if there was an article called <i>"Use Of Daggers By Roman Gladiators"</i>. Would you have the same feelings towards that article as to this one? Are your attitudes towards this article being influenced by wrestling being seen as "common man's" entertainment? Do you think the "scholarly" field of gladiators is more worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia than today's wrestlers? Why? Hopefully these questions will aid people's objectivity. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Dalton_7b14.html" title="User:John Dalton">John Dalton</a> 01:32, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If the use of daggers was a side-issue in terms of the overall topic of gladiatorial combat, and there was already an article about the use of other weapons or other styles of gladiatorial combat than the norm, then yes, I would feel the same. Hence my suggestion that this can be covered in or merged with <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_wrestling.html" title="Hardcore wrestling">Hardcore wrestling</a> or <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_object_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Foreign object (professional wrestling)">Foreign object (professional wrestling)</a>. In my opinion, the use of thumbtacks <b>is</b> a complete subset of Hardcore wrestling. --<a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatsnumbereleven_aa67.html" title="User:Batsnumbereleven">Dave.</a> 09:10, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
