<dd>PLEASE DON'T DELETE</dd>

<dl>
<dd>We think that it is valid to have a small link to wiki pages for University of Bath Media pages impact and urb, it is as least as valid as a page for the universities football team.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1449 URB has a long and historic career as one of the first and longest running student radio stations in this country.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It has produced many mainstream famous dj's including annie nightingale and dr fox so please do not delete it, if you don't care about impact or urb then just don't click the link, it is the start of the articel, and we will contiue to develop it to include more of the history of urb and student radio. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/c/m/User%7EMcmadhatter_03ef.html" title="User:Mcmadhatter">Mcmadhatter</a> (<a href="../../../m/c/m/User_talk%7EMcmadhatter_9947.html" title="User talk:Mcmadhatter">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mcmadhatter_01dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mcmadhatter">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<li>I'd say not (of course) on the grounds that it is perfectly normal for DJs (and others) to start out in completely anonymous student stations / papers / whatever before moving on. The one-time editor of my old University students union newspaper (which was as navel-gazing as any) later went on to the Sport and then the Sun. That doesn't make the Wessex News any less of a rag. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 18:01, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> non-notable, self-promoting. I researched its claim of being one of the oldest college radio stations and found it falls several decades short. I'd vote in favor if this were somehow exceptional in its field, perhaps a co-founder of National Public Radio or the first venue of acts that later changed popular music. It claims to have launched two careers that are themselves not notable enough for encyclopedia entries. To the students: I know any college radio station is hard work and I wish you well but it doesn't help to say that you throw good parties. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 16:41, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Um... just so you know, this radio station is in England. Which may have something to do with why it wasn't involved in founding an American network. ^_^ — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small>
<ul>
<li>Point conceded. What important journalism originated from this radio station? You'd have a real case for inclusion if you could say something like, "Brent Bigley's 1982 stories first aired on our station, which led to new British automobile emission standards and contributed to the 16% nationwide gains for the Labour party in the following election." <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 18:54, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I guess wikipedia is fairly pointless as far as encyclopdiea's go then, not much point having an encyclopedia of everything if new people can't add their own pages. the page was one link from the university of bath wikipage, hardly damaging to anyone, and lets face it you'll only click on it if you're interested. But I guess there are a lot of people on here who like removing small articles they aren't interested in, i mean that would be ok if wikipeida was pushed for space on it's servers, but i hardly think it is.</p>

<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous. I count 3 clear "deletes", one "delete or merge", one straight "merge", one "keep or merge" and only one "keep as is" (the unsigned edit discounted). While the general concensus seems to be leaning toward a decision that the article should not remain independent, I am going to call this as a "no consensus" decision. My own opinion is that he probably does not meet the recommended criteria <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I can't find anything in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> that would sway the decision, either.</p>
<p>What notability he has appears to be entirely derivative of his founding of the company. As an ordinary editor, I am going to merge and redirect this article to <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squaw_Valley_Ski_Resort_fc78.html" title="Squaw Valley Ski Resort">Squaw Valley Ski Resort</a>, the company he founded. That article has plenty of room for expansion.

<li><b>Comment</b>: In regards to the primary line of argument, I'd point everyone to <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Hackett_1070.html" title="Paul Hackett">Paul Hackett</a>. Wikipedia has a very long profile on Mr. Hackett even though he's never been elected. He lost a Congressional race and is now running for the U.S. Senate in a Democratic primary. His claim to fame is that he's an Iraq War Veteran running for political office.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also reference again Paul Babbitt. Mr. Babbitt lost his congressional election over a year ago, yet his profile still remains on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Also, most comparable to Andrew Duck is <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Ashe_06cd.html" title="David Ashe">David Ashe</a>. Wiki has not flagged Mr. Ashe's entry for deletion even though his credentials are identical to Mr. Duck's. Both are Iraq War Veterans running for Congress.</p>
<p>I think that the Andrew Duck entry must be judged on its merits - and the merit here is that he's one of a very select group of Iraq War Veterans running for political office. That's good enough for Wiki to keep Paul Hackett's and David Ashe's profiles, it should be good enough for Andrew Duck.</p>

Most of the others named have now been AfDd (by me) for exactly the same reason. One caveat: if someone wants to discuss the issue of war veterans running for political office in time of war (which might well have some interesting parallels with Vietnam) then <i>brief</i> summaries of these guys might form <i>part</i> of that discussion. Substantial media coverage does not make for significance - every candidate in every election goes out to garner as much media coverage as possible, and in any case that's just a version of the ad populum fallacy. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 12:42, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>:I believe that this page should stay, simply because it's docutmenting a series of current events in the realm of American politics during a very volatile year. I think the page should be deleted if this guy doesn't get elected, in which case it would certainly be just a vanity page about a guy with an opinion. But it seems like the historical signifigance (the fact that he's an Iraq war veteran) of his political race, gives it the necessary stuff to remain a wiki. Especially if the wiki is updated with unslanted factual stuff about the race that he's in, and not just personal bio trivia. As the race develops, so should this page, and it's possible that others might have some very good stuff to post here, but it's too soon to tell. Let's keep an eye on it, but in the mean time I would not delete it.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Who are you to decide the significance of other people's interests? "WP is not a repository of indiscriminate information..." I think there might be a bit of confusion in regards to the difference between assessment and assumption here. This entry was obviously not created by Andrew Duck. It's more likely the effort of an individual documenting their own local history as it's happening. Assuming the intention of this entry's creator is not what this forum is for. It's for assessing the merit of the entry itself. And Indiscriminate? There are tens of thousands of entries that are utterly useless, if not indiscriminate. Half of WP would have to be deleted if we followed that line of logic. For an interested party this page could be immensely significant. So let's lay off the elitist banter. This isn't about you and me. This is a notable entry. (I'm so glad that I stumbled onto this nonsense. Now I know what to look forward to if I ever want to create an entry. Jeez.)</li>

<li>I think the general point being made is that the number of interested parties, at this point in time, is likely to be negligible. Is that not assessing the merit of the entry itself? On your second point, any article you find "utterly useless" you can nominate for deletion. If the consensus of opinion is that you are right, those "utterly useless" entries will also be deleted.

<li><b>Transwiki</b> In retrospect, Wiktionary is indeed the better place for this article. I would point out that all words have their origin somewhere; and also that just because it isn't in Urban Dictionary doesn't mean it's not in use. In regard to Dalbury's comment - <b>bagurk</b> (or, at least one of them, though most of them are probably one and the same) is the Lawrence mentioned in the article (see <a href="http://whirlpool.net.au/forum-user.cfm?id=6538" class="external autonumber" title="http://whirlpool.net.au/forum-user.cfm?id=6538" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>). I attend UQ and can vouch for its usage amoung people there. If usage of the expression continues to spread (I have witnessed this, hence my motivation for creating the article), it may very well end up in Wiktionary sooner or later anyway.

<li><b>Keep</b> and improve. Dr. Bernard Nathanson is a prominent figure in the U.S. abortion policy debate. He co-founded the National Abortion Rights Action League, then had a change of heart and created several books and films for the other side. NARAL remains a leading pro-choice advocate while his anti-abortion film <i>The Silent Scream</i> got widespread attention in the 1980s.

<li><b>KEEP</b>. Certainly clean up. Certainly don't delete. And the ideal thing for this article, in its cleanup, is that it become more than just a list. It should even be more than just a glossary. It should have not only definitions and etymology, but comments on the social context, including in which regions terms are used, at what times they have been considered more, and less, objectionable, whether they are more common in certain social groups, when they began to be carried in mainstream media (TV, radio, newspapers, &amp;c.), when they were and weren't printed by mainstream publishing houses, equivalents in foreign languages, how they have spread to English in other parts of the world, how their definitions have changed in different places or even in the same places, &amp;c. Profanity is an integral part of most languages; British profanity is a fascinating part of English. The topic deserves a good Wikipedia article. The article in its present state is a messy list. The list needs serious work; and the result of the serious work needs to stay on Wikipedia, not be thrown out. When your hands are messy, you wash them; you don't cut them off and consider maybe getting some new ones in the future. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreslethe_e6c4.html" title="User:Preslethe">President Lethe</a> 16:28, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment: Like tightwaddery, cheapskating is a pejorative term, but frugality is a virtue. The current text states it is "often incorrectly confused with cheapness or miserliness". So I don't think it appropriate to redirect there. We have <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheapskate.html" title="Cheapskate">cheapskate</a>, which IMO should probably be redirected to <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miser.html" title="Miser">miser</a>. <a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 08:31, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>KEEP</b> I think that this article proves to me one of the few measures to compile and distribute information on corruption amongst other Indians in general and thus remains as a trivial process in the eradication of it. I feel that the article shows what is done and the problems with it so that future generations can improve in the process. The article provides vital information to many people who, though they have a high loyalty to the Tiranga, are illiterate in this particular subject. Thus, I strongly state that this article should be kept at any and all costs. If, however, you do decide to remove this article, please contact me so that I can save a copy of it somewhere else. -- <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoylakaekka_6b94.html" title="User:Koylakaekka">Koyla</a> 20:55, 10 November 2005</dd>

<li><b>Redirect</b> -- this page has always been a redirect to <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Ages_%28disambiguation%29_d5fb.html" title="Dark Ages (disambiguation)">Dark Ages (disambiguation)</a>. "Dark Age" means a lot of things, thats why we have a disambiguation page. There is no such thing as "civilization at its nadir called dark age", pure nonesense and original research by Timvasquez. I challenge him to provide academic citations that prove such a concept exists, we allready have articles for the few "dark ages" that are commonly recognized, but there is no general term that corosponds to "civilization at its nadir". In any case the article is a simplistic summary of whats allready contained in other articles, it's a repeat, we allready have articles, its a fork in an attempt to create a new concept. "Dark Age" is an ambigious term that is handled on the disambigutation page. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 20:38, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> and moderate the apparent dispute. The article deserves some sort of flag. It's a legitimate historical concept that refers to the lack of primary source documents for periods following a civilization's collapse. The era following the fall of Rome is only the most famous example.

<dd>Several long private messages came to me following this vote. To clarify: I agree the article needs cleanup. Advocates for deletion seem to proceed from the assumption that the centuries in Europe following the collapse of Rome are historically unique. Other dark ages, most notably the era in Greece following the fall of Mycenae, meet their strict interpretation of Petrarch's use of the term. My challenge to demonstrate a difference met obfuscation. I am therefore changing my vote to <b>strong keep</b> with the conclusion that the drive to delete is POV.</dd>

<li>Yes, the Perot comparison is informative.

Even if Perot had never run for office, he would still be notable. And if he were not notable independently, his running twice for the office of President of the US against <i>both</i> major parties might arguably qualify him. Ashe is a hopeful for a much less important office, and completely lacks the other claims to notability.

<li>NN? There's a claim to notability in there, and it's a good one (author of a book, he was featured heavily in news coverage, etc.). However, Google and amazon.com both swear he doesn't exist, which seems odd for someone with his profile. So <b>delete as a hoax</b>. PJM, please try to expend a bit more effort into your nominations.

<li><b>Hey</b> Okay, here is the story... I've been going around and asking my realitives about my family history.. this is the information I've gotten along with some info about a Former Soviet Village called Dudnika, I put this artical together... there is a beter history somewhere I don't know where based on the fact that there are really just 10 Dudnikoffs in the world living I'll possibly never know it. I've tried research and asking my realitives in Moscow, they tell me the same stories... I geuss it possibly wrong.. but it could have fact there also.

<dd>For anyone who wants to vote on this entry, here are some salient facts:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fact 1: The article was created on July 9th, 2005. From the creation of the article up until October 3rd, the article appeared to be a normal scientific wikipedia article. Interested readers are cordially invited to examine the early drafts of the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fact 2: The article was nominated for deletion on September 24th, and was ruled as a "Keep" on October 2nd. On October 3rd, the article was edited by an unsigned user, and, for the first time, the article makes the claim that the term was invented by the article's original author. Prior to the AfD vote (and subsequent "keep" ruling), the article mentioned that the effect was described by <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Lodge_f0eb.html" title="Oliver Lodge">Oliver Lodge</a>, a 19th century scientist. Since that time, the article has been systematically altered by a series of anonymous users to make the article appear as unprofessional (and as AfD-worthy) as possible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fact 3: The <a href="../../../f/a/l/Talk%7EFalse_Doppler_915f.html" title="Talk:False Doppler">talk page of the article</a> is instructive. It is filled with shrill accusations and chest-beating, levelled at the original author. The original author of the article cites his sources and generally makes a credible argument for his position. The person levelling the accusation...does not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fact 4: Googling on the phrase "False Doppler" turns up 314 hits. Examining the various webpages which turn up indicates a common theme: The "false doppler" effect involves motion perpendicular to a stationary observer. That is, moving neither towards nor away from the stationary observer, but rather moving "transversely," as a car, on the road, driving past you, on the sidewalk. Which is what the original "false doppler" article was also about.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Conclusion: I smell a crank. And it's not the original author of the article. If the person who put this article up for nomination isn't the same person nominated it previously, and then took a steaming dump all over the article and its associated talk page after the original AfD failed, I'll eat my hat.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And I have a BIG hat.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> First, no metric equivalents are given, and since only the US and Libya (or is it Yemen? I forget) have yet to move into the 21st century in this regard, that's important. And I have way better things to do than make these conversions. Second, this topic is subtrivial, and I cannot imagine that anyone would want to know how long it takes an hour hand to move a mile for anything more portentious than winning a bar bet. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 03:02, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually, the US has been officially metric for over a hundred years, and requires prices to be marked in both systems. What it has failed to do, however, is regulate how <i>big</i> the prices have to be marked, so you get imperial prices in 200point and metric prices in 10 point. The US has, as I'm sure you're aware, done absolutely nothing to encourage the use of the metric system, choosing not even to conduct its own business in metric (except, oddly enough, for the military. go figure.) BTW, I <i>like</i> "Merkin redneck units".

<li><b>Comment</b>: The part about speed should be deleted, or at least completely redone, no matter what happens to the article. It isn't just useless trivia, it is garbage. The units are the smallest problem, after all it says it's only talking about the most common American size of clock. But that's wrong - the speed depends on the size of the hour hand, not the size of the clock. Also, the whole hand doesn't move at the same speed - I assume it's talking about the speed of the end of the hand - after all the part of the hand in the centre of the clock doesn't move at all! <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> <a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">(talk)</a> 11:27, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge or Redirect</b> or whatever it's called. There's useful information here—which should be put into a cool article about the history, design, present state, &amp;c., of clock faces in different regions. So all the info could go into an article on Clocks or Clockfaces or whatever. I usually don't mind letting things that are smaller components of bigger things have their own articles (if we didn't do that, there'd just be one, gigantic article); but this would so neatly fit into a larger article, and probably be more useful with surrounding context about other aspects of clock design. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreslethe_e6c4.html" title="User:Preslethe">President Lethe</a> 16:50, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The Fact of the matter is, having known Ian personally and attended school with him (and knowing he didn't write this article) he is an influential individual within the Washington DC community... you may refer to him as a college kid but he is much more... In his years not only is he on the board of directors of the largest food kitchen in DC, but he is also a local hero for his work as a firefighter and other charitable contributions. Wikipedia chronicles Hitler, Stalin, Tojo and many others, but a good guy who strives to use his position in society to help others is "not notable" and BTW he lives in DC not Australia, idiot</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> There was quite a bit more to this article than what it is now showing. An anon user 199.126.210.155 was removing quite a bit of information, and it of course looked like vandalism, but the anon user left me a msg on my talk page saying why he was removing large portions of the article. His comments were polite and civil so I've left it alone due to the fact he seemed to know a lot more about this article than me. Maybe if someone who knows more about Jung-Suk Ryu could go back and check, to see if the information the anon user was removing could make the article meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledgeOfSelf_7104.html" title="User:KnowledgeOfSelf"><font color="#151B8D">Knowledge<font color="#C11B17">Of<font color="#C11B17">Self</font></font></font></a> | <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledgeOfSelf_36c0.html" title="User talk:KnowledgeOfSelf"><font color="#461B7E">talk</font></a>. 06:47, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I listed this page because a gentleman raised concerns about the neutrality of the article on the helpdesk list. I checked out the article and considered that notability was a real concern of the article. If someone can deliver verifiable evidence that Mr Ryu meets our biography notability guidelines, I would withdraw this nomination.

<li><b>Comment</b> - As previously stated on the articles talk page, I am an acquaintance of JSR. I have chatted with him about this article, and am quite sure that the anonymous user deleting things was him, seeking to remove the heavy negative bias the article had. Although his achievements go beyond being a city council candidate, they are still relatively local in scope and are perhaps not significant enough to warrant an article. Combine that with the fact that edit wars would probably just continue between JSR and those who have a negative view of him. I believe someday there will be enough content for this article, when his run for city council can get just a brief mention.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidGA_d8bb.html" title="User:LucidGA">LucidGA</a> 19:30, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I was unable to find a reference to this. The Google test is <i>not</i> the best way of figuring out if something like this actually exists, but as the article itself is very vague and I was not able to find a single hit that appeared relevant, I'm inclined to think that this is a hoax or something similarly unwelcome.

<li>You're right, but I still stand by my keep vote. There is a reasonable amount of information in this article. It says where the school is located, how it is administered, and includes a performance record and a link to the school's website. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 13:50, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> and delete all articles that contain summaries of reasoning. <b>Reason out your vote for this particular ARTICLE</b> and not "all schools, ever, everywhere, at all times, no matter what." If your vote shows no indication that you've even <i>read</i> this article, how can you be expected to be taken seriously as a deliberator on it? In my case, I do not think we are in the business of replicating the Yellow Pages, and the information in this ARTICLE is virtually nil. If a mention of the school, with basic information, were put into a school district article, that would be fine, but it is a primary school with no information presented on it. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:47, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>If someone nominated a small country, it wouldn't be necessary to read the article to justify a keep vote. If one believes that schools should be kept, there is no difference. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 23:40, 10 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, one <b>would</b> need to read it, because we are not discussing <i>possible articles</i> but <i>actual</i> articles, here. I.e. the deliberation is not on the <i>topic</i> but on the actual <i>performance.</i> This is not Requests for Comment on content issues. An article that said, "Fiji is an island country" would be and <i>should</i> be deleted, even though the topic of Fiji should get full coverage. That's why "school watch" and all other voter busing projects must stop. Read the article (which got rapidly filled in by voters), and assess it per the deletion guidelines. Does the article advertise? Is it a copyvio? Is it a dictdef? Only then do you get to "Is the subject encyclopedic?" All the blather about schools addresses the strawman of "notability," but that isn't sufficient nor comprehensive in voting. (As for awards, it's a mug's game to base anything on awards. "World's Greatest Grandpa" doesn't get an article.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:34, 11 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So if "Fiji is an island country" would and should be deleted, an article which says "Coombe is a settlement in the county of Hampshire, UK." would also be deletable, perhaps even if it gave the grid reference? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:46, 11 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why should anyone ever do a thing like that? If someone intends to assemble a decent paragraph, they should assemble it in user space or offline and create the article <i>when there is something worthwhile there.</i> If, on the other hand, someone does <i>not</i> really intend to do even ten minutes' work but merely wants to remind people that we need an article on that topic, they should make an article request. See <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_perfect_stub_article_271a.html" title="Wikipedia:The perfect stub article">the perfect stub</a>. An article that says "Coombe is a settlement in the county of Hampshire, UK" is <i>not</i> a good stub. People shouldn't just type "Chapter One" at the top of a blank piece of paper and feel they've made a useful start at writing a novel. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:15, 11 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Stubs like <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coombe%2C_Hampshire_ebff.html" title="Coombe, Hampshire">Coombe, Hampshire</a> are incredibly useful, I wish we had at least that much for every settlement. They answer the question "where the heck is Coombe?" which is pretty much the most important thing about a place. Also they let me link there and categorize it, and provide a ready-made base for someone who knows about it to expand. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 13:58, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Deletion, properly understood, is an issue of the worthiness of the subject for inclusion in the encyclopedia, not on the content of the particular article.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Alexa rank really isn't the best measure of notability. Consider:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Ashdown_d4a6.html" title="Pete Ashdown">Pete Ashdown</a>'s US Senate campaign site has an Alexa rank of 2,530,023. Steve Urquhart's rank is 2,910,251. Nobody's suggesting deleting them -- especially if one of them actually manages to beat <a href="../../../o/r/r/Orrin_Hatch_751f.html" title="Orrin Hatch">Orrin Hatch</a> in next year's election (please, please, please). Orrin's site, BTW, ranks 1,490,351.
<ul>
<li>Those people are known for their political activity outside the internet. webcomics only have their internet presence to show. If that can't be verified through Google, Alexa or any other means, that means it doesn't have that presence. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:32, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>And I would add that <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Ashdown_d4a6.html" title="Pete Ashdown">Pete Ashdown</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/r/Orrin_Hatch_751f.html" title="Orrin Hatch">Orrin Hatch</a>'s websites don't have their own wikipedia article...--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 21:02, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On a more webcomic-related note, it appears that all Keenspace comics get a single ranking of 5,395. That means that a comic like [<a href="http://saturnalia.keenspace.com" class="external text" title="http://saturnalia.keenspace.com" rel="nofollow">Saturnalia</a>], that never had a very large reader base and that hasn't updated in a year and a half, ranks more than twice as high as <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a> (13,920) or User Friendly (12,251). (Nothing against Saturnalia, BTW: Space Coyote is a great artist and the story was good, too. After this long, though, it's pretty well dead.)</li>
<li>Also on webcomics, even <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_%28webcomic%29_73fc.html" title="Penny Arcade (webcomic)">Penny Arcade</a>, one of the originals, only ranks 404,199.</li>
<li>Alexa does list a few other sites that link to leveL. The best I found there was <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a>.--12.160.33.128 15:39, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

Doesn't appear to be notable; frankly, any webcomic where a Google search for "&lt;webcomic's name&gt; &lt;creator's name&gt;" returns ~50 hits is non-notable in the grand scale of things, and possibly also in the webcomics scale of things.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'd like to correct the earlier assertion that the Penny Arcade webcomic has an Alexa ranking of 404,199; it's ranking is in fact 4,520<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. Further comparing the Alexa ranking of webcomics (which are by definition read primarily on the web) to those of Senators (who relay their information through mainstream news media coverage, talk shows, etc.) is a bit of apples to oranges.

<li><b>Comment</b> The point of me mentioning the visits a day was to show that it is obviously known aside from the 40 people in the forum, since some of the voters for deletion used 'forum has 40 members, noone reads this thing' as an argument. It's not like this site DOESN'T generate tens of thousands of visitors a month. I was also referencing the guy that brought up points against Alexa rating, but he didn't have a user name, so it was probably easier to refer back to me. As for the ways that need not be described, it's obvious I'm a reader of the comic and thus have a bias, which is why mentioning any points about the actual quality of the comic over the quantity of activity around it would be putting myself on display to be torn apart. When I looked at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> before suggesting the article, it still had the alternate proposal that included longevity, a certain number of existant strips/pages and some other things that I can't remember right now but that were all met. Now that it's pretty much popularity only, any such argument has become void- I can't argue against the fact that it doesn't have an audience of millions. -Flare- 13:23, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I am probably going to hate myself for saying this, but I'm all for frankness: <b>This is still only a proposed guideline.</b> It's referred to as a pointer for what the current suggested direction for this guideline is according to those who have taken part, but that is it. Don't let it deter you from making a pitch for its inclusion based upon longevity or something else.

<li>Delete: Fails every guideline we've ever had for "notability," and the fervor of its fans in voting is not any argument against that. For those who wish a "reason why" it shouldn't be here, even though there is no reason why it <i>should</i> be here, I'll simply say that encyclopedias cover that which is referred to in alien context and which needs explanation and contextualizing. This forum/comic/game is known by its fans and referred to by none else. Those who wish to know, know. Those who do not know, will not hear of it and need to know. Since Wikipedia is <b>not</b> a place to satisfy the fan's obsession nor a place for people to advertise, the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:22, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I was the original nominator, so please don't count my vote twice. I wasn't too happy with the no-consensus of the first vote. I did not have a chance to reply to the erronomous and misleading comments above. Dragonfiend has already established that a popular webcomic like <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_%28webcomic%29_73fc.html" title="Penny Arcade (webcomic)">Penny Arcade</a> has a respectable Alexa rank. The comparisons to <a href="../../../o/r/r/Orrin_Hatch_751f.html" title="Orrin Hatch">Orrin Hatch</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Ashdown_d4a6.html" title="Pete Ashdown">Pete Ashdown</a> are totally irrelevent, these are people who have had major press attention, something which this comic lacks, even in the webcomic community. I would however, either redirect an article on Orrin Hatch's website to Orrin Hatch, or even move to delete. Just because a site links to it, does not mean it is notable. Heck, some blogs even link to my wikipedia page. This comic has no assertion of notability, a low readership and almost empty forums. Other arguments above, saying that "keep - long archive", I just don't agree with. One of my main points against the no defunct original WP:COMIC was the, longevity = notability" clause. Would you keep an article for a person who's only claim to notability was living up to retirement age? - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 18:55, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for that it's not actually been "re-listed", I mispoke before and have corrected it. It has been extended as is common for AfD discussions that do not reach a clear consensus. For example, a 50/50 split with strong arguments presented by each side is a "no consensus" and thus no action is taken. In <i>this</i> example, neither the numbers nor the arguments clearly indicated the "will of the people", and extendind the discussion appears to have made things clear. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 00:37, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Based on the discussion, I am reinstating my delete vote.

The first three paragraphs, the introduction, is the only segment that begins to approach meeting the definition of an encyclopedia article; the remainder, whether it's useful or not (which is irrelevant), is just a list of terms.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. It is informative, descriptive by comparisons/groupings, and it is extensive (which indeed has its strong and weak points). Further, there is a competing section of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, namely 1.5.2, which allows for "structured lists to assist with the organisation of articles". Since many of the terms on the page indeed have their own articles, it is useful for encyclopedic purposes to group and compare them, and this indeed assists with the organization of articles. Also, just because it is long is not an excuse to delete an article, but rather should be an impetus to break it up into separate articles. There's no denying that neologisms and cruft have crept into this article, but that fact demands that more contributors participate in handling verification of such terms. Last, I have to protest this "nomination bombardment", where a consensus wasn't arrived at the first time, so the argument losers try again. This also happened with <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_parts_slang.html" title="Body parts slang">Body parts slang</a>, and its deletion resulted in a very informative article being wiped off with a slight majority that could not have been reasonably construed as a consensus. — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><span style="color:green"><b>Stevie is the man!</b></span></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 22:36, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> why is no reason given for re-nomination? It was voted on like 2 weeks ago with a quite high ratio of keeps. Anyway like it or not there are lots of lists of jargon/slang/technical terms on Wikipedia, for example <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_baseball_jargon.html" title="List of baseball jargon">List of baseball jargon</a>. As long as they're well organized and useful, I don't see the problem. It's just when the subject is sex or something controversial that people start to look for excuses to delete such lists. Until consensus is to delete all slang/jargon/terms lists changes, I can't see deleting just certain ones for subjective personal reasons, under the thin excuse of arguably breaking <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 23:39, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> When it says "Wikipedia articles are not a usage guide or a slang and idiom guide", I think it means that we shouldn't devote an entire article to each and every one of these slang terms. And rightly so. I think having them all quarantined on one page will suffice. I also think that after weeding out a lot of the obviously obscure (and bogus) slang terms, the page should be capped and not strive to become a neverending all-inclusive list of every ridiculous dirty phrase ever conceived. - <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">Wikipediatrix</a> 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

But yes, I'm not sure what useful encyclopedic purpose this list provides, other than perhaps as a future reference. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 15:41, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge, redirect, and then delete</b> — I was the originator of what is now stored as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_sexual_slang_2005-10-18_f7dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of sexual slang/2005-10-18">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of sexual slang/2005-10-18</a>, where my rationalle was <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> (#3 A usage guide, or slang and idiom guide), <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. I apologize for the length of my comment; however, I feel it is necessary to address the various issues involved in this renomination. My original nomination was timed specifically to coincide with discussion then ongoing at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Body_parts_slang_2_159f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Body parts slang 2">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Body parts slang 2</a>; in reference accusations of <i>nomination bombardment,</i> I feel that it is appropriate that similar nominations be made concurrently, both to focus the attention of those having opinions on the issue, and to forestall, in some measure, the inevitable claims that the existance of one policy violation supports the existance of another (i.e., if <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_parts_slang.html" title="Body parts slang">Body parts slang</a> exists, then <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sexual_slang.html" title="List of sexual slang">List of sexual slang</a> should also exist, and vice versa) as were proffered this time by <a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a>. Given the number of people who would agree with the statement "'List of' considered harmful," real nomination bombardment would be stuffing an AFD day with every "List of" article on the site - and that <b>would</b> be harmful, IMHO. Further, the circular logic of using one policy violation to support another at best puts precedent over policy, an idea I think would seriously degrade Wikipedia over time. After all, there's precedent for <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a> pages too, and we <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">AFD</a> them, even though at any given time there are plenty of others continuing to exist. That said, I have to agree in part with <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman">Stevie is the man!</a> when he claims that Body Parts may not have had proper consensus; if he feels that strongly about it, I would direct him to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_Undeletion_349e.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for Undeletion">Deletion Review</a>. Similarly, I am disappointed that this nomination was made so soon, as this diminishes the odds that it will ever be removed - we can't simply renominate every three weeks until we "win," and apparant out-of-process nominations will garner more Keep votes, as exemplified by <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a>. Nevertheless, in the end, this article has <i>numerous</i> problems that speak in favor of, at worst, deletion and, at best, <b>Merge</b> as appropriate (the text of the intro and significant, verified terms to <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_slang.html" title="Sexual slang">Sexual slang</a> per <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a>, the remaining <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> terms to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:WikiSaurus" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:WikiSaurus">WikiSaurus</a>), and I suppose that is constructively my vote here, even if it means my <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Deletionist_Wikipedians" class="extiw" title="meta:Association_of_Deletionist_Wikipedians">Disciplined Deletionist</a> credentials are revoked. I wish I could spend more time policing the article; OTOH, I would also like to keep my job, and spending time on that particular page is not likely to help me there. FWIW, I think a move to <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_slang.html" title="Sexual slang">Sexual slang</a> should, at a minimum, keep the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologisms.html" title="Neologisms">neologisms</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Neologisms:unstable" class="extiw" title="wikt:Neologisms:unstable">protologisms</a> to a comparative minimum. One thing I'm sure of: if we decide again to keep this article, we need many more people looking at it to ensure that it <i>does not suck;</i> to do otherwise will serve only to undermine the credibility of the project as a whole, and of <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia policy</a> in general. Keeping it under the present title creates the appearance of condoning, if not <i>encouraging,</i> the addition of, well, anything that makes a schoolboy snicker. Finally, I would also point out that, aside from the fact that this particular subject field has more than its fair share of attraction to vandals, my nomination and comments have never had anything to do with its contents <i>per se,</i> because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors</a>, nor should it be. --<a href="../../../k/g/f/User%7EKgf0_e092.html" title="User:Kgf0">Kgf0</a> 23:07, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. These are games for which there is broad consensus that they were just terrible; I don't think there's much debate about any of them.

<p>Thanks for pointing that out JiFish. I found this particular excerpt rather interesting, however:</p>
<p><i>"An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia (although consensus exists regarding particular kinds of article, for instance see WP:MUSIC). Lack of fame is not the same as vanity.</i></p>
<p><i>Furthermore, an article is not "vanity" simply because it was written by its subject. Articles about existing books, movies, games, and businesses are not "vanity" so long as the content is kept to salient material and not overtly promotional."</i></p>
<p>While I don't intend to be snide about this, I don't believe anything written was promotional. You proposed 'autobiography' as a reason for deletion, as well as 'non-notable', both of which appear to be insignificant points for deletion. After further investigation, however, I learned that autobiographies are frowned upon and typically result in a mark for deletion, but does not necessarily mean they will. I'm sure you're all well aware of these policies and guidelines, this edition is more of a Wikipedia policy exploration for me. All said and done, the way I see it, my autobiography would be fine assuming it included more than a short, incoherent biography and a few quotes (and useless trivia as has already been brought up). <b>Deletion</b> is still the most plausible course of action, but technically, a <b>rewrite and revision</b> would be suitable, as well, I think. Regardless, seeing as though it's been contested as much as it has already, I'll wait until I'm worth writing about. Gee, sorry, that was a lot longer response than I imagined. -- <a href="../../../l/t/d/User%7ELtdonahue_d6ec.html" title="User:Ltdonahue">Logan</a> (PS: I had my own Wiki set-up at one point, and was aware of many automatic codes, but now I'm rather inept; anyone care to point me to a page detailing special codes, like date?)</p>

<li>Since the author/subject is involved in this discussion, I will advise <a href="../../../l/t/d/User%7ELtdonahue_d6ec.html" title="User:Ltdonahue">Logan</a> to <b>userfy</b> the content (put the more worthwhile information on his user page). The current article does not appear to contain a claim to notability; writing a blog "detailing insignificant events and general rants" which appears to have only existed for a week so far does not constitute such a claim. Therefore, the content should be <b>deleted</b> from the main namespace. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 05:35, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey guys, give me a break. There are entries on berkeley sockets and Windows sockets that give most of the API away, or have stubs for API to be added. The windows sockets article is largely obsolete as it is being replaced by the topic of this article. This article even directs people to the other sockets SDK API and MFC. I don't have a problem with folks jumping all over this thing and re-writing it, but I don't see how deleting it outright is going to improve things. If this thing were the size of a textbook, I'd understand, but it's no bigger than the other sockets articles. Please rewrite or improve it, don't delete it.<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">User:wiarthurhu</a> 14 Nov 2005, I'm the original author and I'm teaching a class in .NET sockets.</li>

<dd>Perhaps "failed" is confusing me. The original AfD seems to have succeeded because there was a unanimous vote to delete. Then it was supposedly deleted according to the page. Now it has reappeared. The vote was late October. But the article history shows the new one with title in all caps was created in September.

<dd>Hmm. I see it as failing the vote if everyone votes to delete... I guess it's semantics. I'm not really sure what it means that this was voted to be deleted under a very similar name... if nothing else it sets a good precedent to vote <b>Delete</b> (again). --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 06:08, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Let me say this and make myself very clear: 1) Articles for Deletion is not some little separate fiefdom of Wikipedia. Using shorthand that others may not be able to interpret ("AfD-speak", etc.) <b>is not acceptable</b>. If you are going to take the time to comment here, <b>use real words and phrases that everyone can understand</b>. 2) Wikipedia is not a government or bureaucracy. Bloc voting and the misuse of prior discussions as reasons to keep <i>all</i> articles of a particular type is invalid and fails to deal with the peculiarities of individual situations that each article may have. Recommendations to delete something based solely on legalistic "precedent" is nonsensical and may be ignored by those who eventually close particular AfD discussions.

<dd>This discussion should take place on the talk page for BIO, not here. But I'd point out that even if every major-party 2006 U.S. and Candian legislative candidate gets an article, and we throw in every major-party candidate from the 2005 UK election, they would still make up only a tiny percetage of the 1 million plus articles Wikipedia will have by next year. Articles on losing candidates who don't go on to do anything special can just sit there until the candidate dies.</dd>
<dd>It's also worth noting that it's rare that you would get a complete non-notable person as a credible, major-party congressional candidate. Usually, congressional candidates have served as state legislators, mayors, county officials, etc. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 23:31, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>But it would be hundreds (eventually thousands) of unexpandable, likely unmaintained stubs, most of which will be ignored after the election by both readers and editors. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Black</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 01:13, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I would very much disagree that articles on losing congressional candidates would be unexpandable stubs.

<dd>And for every individual like that, you'll have literally dozens of other articles that will never be expanded beyond "This person was a nominee in such-and-such election, and didn't win. They're now selling insurance in Poughkeepsie." If the person is notable, the article will be created on its own and will survive an AfD. The notion that we must create an article on every person who might, someday, be notable under the proper confluence of circumstance is not a notion that will lead to a quality Wikipedia. → <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>Ξxtreme</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Unction</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtreme_Unction_3e82.html" title="User talk:Extreme Unction">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Extreme_Unction_b4bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Extreme Unction">blah</a></sub></font>} 02:19, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Are you saying that there's not enough to be written on most congressional candidates, or that people won't bother? As I pointed out with <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Hackett_1070.html" title="Paul Hackett">Paul Hackett</a>, detailed articles can be written even about "outsider" candidates with little political experience. I would guess that with so many Wikipedia editors interested in politics, we can expect to see full articles on many if not most major-party congressional candidates next year. But for AfD, the key is not whether people want to expand stubs but rather whether there is enough verifyable info out there to do so. With campaign websites, campaign-finance databases, newspaper stories, League of Women Voters guides, etc., there is more than enough available for any major-party candidate. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 05:06, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>KEEP</b>. I don't see any reason not to keep it. And the argument that, because a policy might ALLOW (not DEMAND) the creation, and keeping, of an article for any credible candidate in the offices mentioned above, there would be a huge load of articles is no reason to get rid of an article on a mayor of an important city and who additionally has run for Congress. Yes, the article is tiny at the moment; but who's to say it won't become bigger and have fascinating information and loads of cross-references to all kinds of other interesting Wiki stuff? One could already be writing an article on the Babbitt political family—for apparently this guy's brother was not only governor but also Secretary of the Interior.

I remain confident that his motivation for nominating this article for deletion has nothing to do with a desire to affect the outcome of an election which will never materially affect the quality of his life.

<li><b>Delete</b> While the subject might be noteworthy, this article is the mother of all edit wars.

They've filled hundreds of Web pages on writers' sites with their bitter sagas; they've complained to the Better Business Bureau of Maryland, the Federal Trade Commission and other law enforcement agencies.</i> There appears to be no possibility of NPOV on this subject.

<li>False analogy: yours is a press war between two opposing camps who each erase the other's entire content as rapidly as possible.

<li><b>Comment</b>: "mother of all edit wars"? Either you're deliberately exaggerating or you've got very little sense of proportion. You also seem a bit confused: you yourself address the fact that the article could have a "balanced presentation" on the subject, yet instead of actually, I don't know, <i>doing something</i> towards that balanced presentation, you're arguing to delete the article based, apparently, on an unspoken and unsupported claim that the article could <i>never</i> contain a balanced presentation. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:31, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Antaeus Feldspar.

<li>Apology: I misread the name of a respondent. Please accept my retraction. My deletion vote stands. The editors of this article make no attempt to achieve any NPOV consensus.

<li>What you actually mean is "I can envision a possible scenario in which the Wikipedia editors who keep reverting the edits by <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/helpdesk-l/2005-November/000696.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/helpdesk-l/2005-November/000696.html" rel="nofollow">representatives of PublishAmerica</a> which violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">NPOV</a> and of course <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a> <i>might</i> happen to be in some cases some of the same people who are bringing lawsuits against PublishAmerica. I have absolutely no evidence whatsoever that there is any such connection but the <i>existence</i> of <i>some</i> vested interest which is it possible to <i>imagine</i> some Wikipedia editor having is enough to "suggest" to my biased mind that this is the true motivation of the editors that I oppose -- or at least mud I can smear them with. In any case, the fact that there <i>is</i> some form of dispute makes this automatically "the mother of all edit wars" (much bigger than all those Middle East articles) and of course, this means we should delete it because mumblemumblemumblemumblemumble." So what's <i>your</i> dog in the fight, Durova? Up above you said that an intelligent reader should be able to tell the truth from a balanced presentation, and then you proceeded to present wild hyperbole and malicious baseless accusations in support of your delete vote.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I found a whole series of articles for individual songs by Rammstein on another album, and spent about half an hour merging and redirecting them into the album article (since none of them were in themselves asserted to be notable). The result was (IMO) a single, decent-sized article on the album and the removal of a series of articles with inconsistent formatting and substantial duplication of text. I suggest the same approach here, unless any of the songs is asserted to be independently notable. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 11:44, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

I'm hoping that someone who knows Hebrew can fill in some holes.

<li>Does it matter? I simply do not understand the crusade by "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" to ferret out whether or not someone feels that a particular school is <b>relatively</b> more important than others or whether the very fact that something is a school endows it with noteworthiness. I am baffled by this because I can't figure out, how in the context of the way Wikipedia works, why it matters. If someone holds the opinion that a school is notable, what bloody difference does it make what his particular <b>subjective</b> criteria are?--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 09:08, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus (merged)</b>, as I count seventeen delete votes and nine keep votes (plus an odd-man-out merge vote), with issues being confused by interpersonal disputes instead of discussion of the subject. While I don't see a firm consensus to delete this article, what I do see is a rather bare stub (that people were apparently unable to expand or reference during the AFD period), and a consensus to not have a separate article about this church.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I suspect that the number of members (5,300) is inflated because it is bigger than the population of the entire town (4,212).

If that is the case here, the number has been overestimated by over ten times. Even if church attendance in town is significantly higher than average, it is still far lower than the number given, unless the church has a lot of members that travel from other towns. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 01:42, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Are people sniffing glue? The article title is "St John's Roman Catholic Church," but the article (anyone read that?) says that it's not the name of the church. Supposing, however, that it were the name, how many <b>other churches</b> have that name? How many in New York City? How many in New York State? How many in New Jersey? How many in England? How many in South Africa? How many in Australia? The name collisions are inestimable. Wikipedia is NOT the Yellow Pages. Please, folks, get sane about this. I know you want every high school in the universe, including all home schools, to be included, but just think for a moment about what happens when you unthinkingly vote "keep OMG why are you nominating this!" on a misnamed, misplaced, empty article like this one. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:45, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

I voted to delete the article, and the church's full name isn't relevant to my comment, only that it's the correct town. The article would need to be renamed to its full name, if kept, and I found a lot of churches named "Saint John the Evangelist", so if all the other churches are added, there would be a huge amount of disambiguation required. I think the church's non-notability is the reason it should be deleted, however.

<li>I'd like to be. I really, really would, but this has been going on for two years now. When "consensus" gets inflated to be a requisite 80%, it only takes a couple of people who don't read the article but who vote on "principle" to get a vandal article kept. Folks mentioned that the nominator has a history of abuse. Is it possible that his nomination was not "let's get a good article deleted" but "let's get a bad article kept?"

<li>Maybe you should just keep your own contentious, uncivil rants off the AfD pages. If you don't like the policies upon which WP is built (in this case, the AfD consensus policy) go whine about it somewhere else without insulting people that are voting their own philosophical position. You have absolutely <b>no idea</b> whether editors read the article, vote as blocs, or whatever else. And suggesting that "voting on principle" is somehow wrong is hypocritical, elitist, consdescending and rude. Your vote and rant is every bit as much a "vote on principle" as your largely irrelevant dissertations demonstrate. Referring to an editor's <b>obvious</b> good-faith contribution as a "vandal article" is a clear violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 16:19, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's funny. I have been here for long enough to watch "consensus," which actually isn't defined by policy, get informally increased from majority to 70% to 80% to near unanimity. I have been here watching and voting since VfD had a whopping 30 articles a day to now it's routine 170 a day. I have been part of defining policy for that long as well. Do I know if votes are bused? I certainly do. Do I know if voting on principle without regard for the article is incorrect? I certainly do. If you feel that my comments apply to you, then that is your business, but, given the fact that this church's membership is greater than the town's population, your conclusion that it is "obviously" good faith is as suspect as that article itself. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:53, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>"Do I know if votes are bused? I certainly do. Do I know if voting on principle without regard for the article is incorrect? I certainly do." Please cite your evidence for these outrageous claims. You don't "know" anything. These are wild, uncivil, unsubstantiated charges that do not assuem good faith. I do not "feel that your comments apply to me", I am pointing out the absurd and unsupported nature of your ranting, whining charges. Please refrain from these offensive, uncivil rants particularly when flailing about what you "know" without citing any evidence whatsoever. Having, "been here watching and voting since...

Of course these are not misspellings, but <i>valid</i> variant spellings, every single one of which has actually been used in print. Personally, I think difficulty in finding articles is one of Wikipedia's weakest points, and the dozens of accidental duplicates we get (differing from existing articles only in case, for example) prove it. I wish there were a way to type in a <i>list</i> of titles and have them all created as redirects to a single target article. I think we need some kind of fuzzy or Soundex search, and no, I don't really think we will solve the problem by creating lots of redirects.</dd>
<dd>Now, you're talking about hypothetical misspellings, whereas we know "Terristrial" is a real one. I wouldn't exactly advocate creating redirects for all the misspellings on your list, but if someone felt like creating them I would certainly <i>not</i> advocate <i>deleting</i> them.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../t/e/r/Terristrial.html" title="Terristrial">Terristrial</a>, however, has already been created. It's a separate case, not a parallel issue.&#160;:-) As long as it's here, and doesn't interfere with anything else, I say redirect it rather than delete it.</dd>

<dd>I was not actually advocating any particular position, pro or con. I just find the lack of spelling ability these days appalling (don’t they teach spelling in school anymore?). It troubles me that we have to accommodate it. I doubt that you’d find redirects in <i>Britannica</i>.

<p>Its the centerpiece award at a summer program thats 104 years old and one of the best known "summer camps" in the US. For the 50,000 people who've come through the program over the last 50 years it is a big deal. Perhaps it could be folded into the main Culver Academies page if people are desperate to remove it?</p>
<p>An interested group of Summer School alumni are hoping to create a stronger web presence for a program that really should be better represented online considering the caliber of its alumni (George Steinbrenner, owner of the yankees won an "E" and considers it a big deal) and stature in the summer camp world. We're hoping to record the great history of the program slowly through pieces on here, a history that has involved some big names in American politics, military history, and culture.</p>
<p>Also, with a name like "the E" you would imagine it would be difficult to google it.</p>

<p>Point taken as I'm sure you're all more familiar with whats appropriate on here than I would be. The intention isn't to promote anything really though, but to document things, which I'd always thought was the point of this site but I could be off. Very interesting to see the review process here up close for the first time too.</p>

<li>The claim that you are not trying to promote anything is at considerable variance with the earlier claim that you are trying to create a "strong web presence."

<p>-I suppose. What i meant though was that for all the alums out there, when they want to read about the history of the school and go online, there's nothing there. We're not trying to promote anything but to put the historical information about the schools' traditions online like they are on here for many places. Now I concede there are better ways of doing it than others which we will try to find and also that not everyone and his brother is interested in everything having to do with the program which is why its helpful to have you all here, but I think its reasonable for us to try to include some historical information about prominent aspects of a prominent boarding school's prominent summer program on here. The "how" is the question. Thanks.</p>

<li>Edit the existing article to remove POV phrasing like "sacred and holy," then merge the result into the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culver_Academies_a145.html" title="Culver Academies">Culver Academies</a> article. Then it becomes an issue for further editing, rather than an issue of article deletion. Remember that, despite my comments above, putting an article up for deletion does not always mean that the information in the article should not exist anywhere within Wiki. It just means that the information doesn't warrant a distinct, seperate article. If you can merge this into the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culver_Academies_a145.html" title="Culver Academies">Culver Academies</a> article, in an appropriately neutral way, I suspect that most folks currently objecting would withdraw their objections.

<p>Not eligible for speedy deletion, as far as I know.

<p>Agree that "child prodigy" does not meet rigorous definitions, and has thus been removed. Article however does describe a growing phenomenon among high schools, expanding from Leon County. Note that article author (me) is not Max Pratt, and is not related to Max Pratt. Main argument for non-deletion of the article: THIS IS NOT INTENDED AS A JOKE.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Although this is an adorable little variation on <i>Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon,</i> Google returns next to nothing. If you can document the phenomenon or if it's better known by some other name, I might withdraw this vote. The burden is on you to prove this is (a) encyclopedic and (b) not original research. Good luck. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 06:35, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I cannot document this phenomenon, and due to lack of web-popularity, I sadly agree that this article is not appropriate for an encyclopedia.
<p>In this article's defense, an article is not "vanity" simply because it was written by its subject. Articles about existing books, movies, games, and businesses are not "vanity" so long as the content is kept to salient material and not overtly promotional. The article is a description of an actual form of entertainment and past-time of apparantly a growing number of high school students in North Florida, not a self-elevating promotion. The article rises above the "vanity" denotation clearly by the Wiki rules. There is no clear reason for deletion. Must I remind you all of the very goal of Wikipedia? This incredible website is not being misused by an addition of information. Popularity does not prove the pertinence of data, countless revolutionary figures have shown us that. <b>Reconsider</b>. -BerretSO4 (ts)6:39 UTC 11-10-05</p>
</li>
<li>There's a site, now located at <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~kate/cgi-bin/six_degrees" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~kate/cgi-bin/six_degrees" rel="nofollow">Six Degrees of Wikipedia</a>, which more-or-less has done the same thing for a while, albeit not as a competitive game. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKate_3866.html" title="User:Kate">User:Kate</a> started the Six Degrees of Wikipedia no later than December 2004, so Max Pratt should not receive credit as the namesake of this game for inventing it in 2005. Anyway, this article is too Wikipedia-self-referential for the main namespace. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 06:55, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>That's a fine point, but there's also an article on Wikipedia called "Encyclopedia" - too self-referential? Additionally, the site given by Metropolitan90 is a utility used to find the web paths from one article to another. The concept of the game itself (in which using said utility would be illegal) is original and can still be denoted "The Max Pratt Game" under no free use infringement. If one man invents numerals and another invents a game aimed at finding a way to count objects, do they not both possess original concepts? Certainly, though, the utility could be referenced clearly in the "Strategies" section of the article. -BerretSO4</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> because the claim of someone inventing this is obviously local to one person. While lots of people probably do this, the name given to it is inappropriate, and it is probably independently invented by most. As a general point, I believe that self-referential articles, e.g. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> are fine, but they must meet the same standard of notableness in the general(non-wikipedia) community as other topics. <a href="../../../a/1/k/User%7EA1kmm_995f.html" title="User:A1kmm">A1kmm</a> 09:56, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I wrote the article, and felt that even though it is not a high-traffic website, it does provide an integral role to the Utah music scene. Almost every single significant rock group from Utah has ties to The Rock Salt, and I thought rather than adding information to the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Utah_55b2.html" title="Music of Utah">music of Utah</a> article, I would add a new one.

<dd>I don't think this merits its own article.

<p>Utah is a tiny ultraconservative state (70% voted bush - highest in the nation). The Rock Salt and the smattering of random visits on any given day shouldn't give credence to it's elimination. Many wonderous movements, periodicals, publishings and postings start from a grain of sand. Sure, it's no google and it's IPO won't crush the GDP of a small nation-state, but it's a voice in a tumultuous sea of neo-cons, retro-cons and permi-cons in the great state of SALT&#160;!! Leave our sliver shine through.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, maybe. Just reading these comments on whether to delete the article, and then reading the article myself, I've learned some stuff and had my interest piqued—interest that I'll attempt to satisfy by reading other Wikipedia articles. This little piece is certainly not my favourite. But it has its merits. Then again, if the website itself includes a little blurb like this Wikipedia article, and if a different Wikipedia article already mentions this site or something related to it, perhaps it's better just to add (to that other Wikipedia article) a link to the external website and delete this article. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreslethe_e6c4.html" title="User:Preslethe">President Lethe</a> 21:43, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>—It doesn't look like there is much independent content there, so maybe redirection would be proper, but that wouldn't require AfD, just a sound editorial decision by the contributors familiar with the topic. I don't understand the prefaced comment that the storm was "non-notable." If it is non-notable, why would it be documented at all on Wikipedia? Do we have a precedent on this regarding named tropical storms?

<dd>It's non-notable that it only caused three deaths, and it's covered at the main hurricane article.

<dd>Can you point to the discussion(s) that established that consensus, or by what criteria "notability" and "major damage" are judged for storms? I'm not trying to be difficult, it's just that for most of us who have never edited a meteorological article, it would be nice to have some context. A named tropical storm, to me, seems like it could stand alone as an article, and this one seems to be able to. And the name of the article seems a rather obvious one, so I don't understand that comment either. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 01:01, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Also, and as a side note, there is no consensus on what justifies having a separate article for a tropical cyclone. Everyone has their own opinions. Current practice is that storms that are not <i>historically</i> notable are simply covered by the main season article. However this runs into trouble when non-<i>historically</i>-notable storms accumulate too much information about them (many of these storms kill people and do millions of dollars in damages, so they're definitely worth writing about) and begin to clog up the season article. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdorje_69b6.html" title="User:Jdorje">Jdorje</a> 01:50, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The duplicate-article claim is not a good argument, for two reasons. One, it is not a full duplicate of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season_0b33.html" title="2005 Atlantic hurricane season">2005 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, because it has information (including the infobox and added picture) that aren't on the main article. Two, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season_0b33.html" title="2005 Atlantic hurricane season">2005 Atlantic hurricane season</a> is 58 kb long and needs to be made shorter; moving information on that article into sub-pages is a good way to do that, <i>particularly</i> information which (like this storm) you consider not to be notable. If we were to make a new sub-article <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season_storms_bcbf.html" title="2005 Atlantic hurricane season storms">2005 Atlantic hurricane season storms</a> populated with all the information about all the non-notable storms, then we would have a way to move this excess information off of the season article without having to worry about clutter; however, I don't see why this would be any better than one article per storm.

<ul>
<li>I would disagree with that criteria - hardly anyone "talks about" most of the articles on Wikipedia. For example, I doubt people often "talk about" what happened in the year <a href="../../../1/1/3/1139.html" title="1139">1139</a>, but it's something that is worth having an article on, and most topics for research (this is an encyclopedia, after all) probably don't correlate with what is being "talked about". <a href="../../../a/y/s/User%7EAySz88_15e3.html" title="User:AySz88">AySz88<font color="#FF9966">^</font></a><a href="../../../a/y/s/User_talk%7EAySz88_f90d.html" title="User talk:AySz88"><font color="#FF6633">-</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AySz88_57ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/AySz88"><font color="#FF3300">^</font></a> 06:07, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The issue isn't if this storm should be documented. Instead it is where. There is a difference. I don't see that <a href="../../../1/1/3/1139.html" title="1139">1139</a> is going to be part of an article on the "1130s", or even expected to be there. However, 2005 AHS is an obvious container for this storm. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 06:52, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think we'll have to agree to disagree on that (and the other response to my comment below). To me, merging Tropical Storm Cindy into 2005AHS is exactly the same as trying to merge 1139 into 1130s. It's not that 1130s might not be a useful article as an overview of the events of the decade - but it'd have to be <i>in addition</i> to 1139, where 1139 contains more details. The articles are more organized and easier to drill down. I think the analogous would be appropriate for 2005AHS and Tropical Storm Cindy - get rid of detalis in 2005AHS and keep them in Cindy's article. (See <a href="../../../2/0/0/Talk%7E2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season_e377.html#Season_Summary_Section" title="Talk:2005 Atlantic hurricane season">Talk:2005 Atlantic hurricane season#Season Summary Section</a> for discussion on distinguishing between the amount of detail appropriate between 2005AHS and specific storms' articles, and <a href="../../../2/0/0/Talk%7E2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season_e377.html#Radical_reorganization" title="Talk:2005 Atlantic hurricane season">Talk:2005 Atlantic hurricane season#Radical reorganization</a> for taking this to the conclusion.

<dd>If there is a consensus on placing all storms (or maybe just all severe and/or landfalling storms) into seperate pages, I will not object. Such an agreement should include a clear deliniation of responsibilities betweenthe main article and the storm pages however. I see no such agreement at this time, nor will I anticipate one. As-is, this is best considered to be a piece of the 2005 AHS.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I see that some are voting to keep this article separate because it is too big to merge back into the season article. Maybe that means that the article needs to be tightened up and shortened. It seems to me that the length of articles should be roughly proportional to the importance of the subject. We don't need to shovel every last little known tidbit on a subject into its article. I also see a tendency to inflate articles about recent events compared to articles about past events. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and should not be biased towards very recent events. - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury">(talk)</a> 10:01, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia is inevitably biased toward recent events, if only because there is more secondary material from which to draw.

<dd>I thnk that your exercise only shows the ease with which this article can be shortenned up as part of a merge back into 2005AHS. Unless this article is seriously expanded, it is not needed. However, "<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> an indiscriminate collector of information".

<p>This appears to be a neologism which is not particularly widespread in the stated usage. It also appears to be equally (un)common in a number of other usages. So I doubt me that it is actually notable, and even if it were it's probably a dicdef of a neologism. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 17:48, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment, no vote.</b> The term “vote-o-rama” appears to be a BBS/blog term that has begun to spill over into news reporting. I found 386 Google hits for “vote-o-rama”, of which perhaps half a dozen or so referred to the US Senate. All the rest were references to blogs and discussion boards. Apparently the term has been around for at least a couple of years. If this article is kept, it should, I think, refer to its usage on the web and not primarily to the US Senate. For references to the Senate see <a href="http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0304/031204cdpm3.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0304/031204cdpm3.htm" rel="nofollow">[59]</a> <a href="http://govexec.com/dailyfed/0304/030804cdpm1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://govexec.com/dailyfed/0304/030804cdpm1.htm" rel="nofollow">[60]</a> <a href="http://newsmine.org/archive/war-on-terror/iraq/2003-invasion/senate-slashes-bush-tax-cut.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://newsmine.org/archive/war-on-terror/iraq/2003-invasion/senate-slashes-bush-tax-cut.txt" rel="nofollow">[61]</a> <a href="http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2003/Mar/20030326News008.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2003/Mar/20030326News008.asp" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>. ♠<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 22:56, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Weird. Looks like "waleed" was added between "SAFER+" and "algorithm" back on 19 August, probably just a newbie edit that got overlooked, then "waleed algorithm" was wikified into a link on 28 September, probably by a well-meaning editor, and finally someone created the Waleed algorithm article, most likely via the red link, on 9 November to promote their web site. (I'm so glad I stayed up late to unearth the provenance of a bad article; I'm just not sure I'll still be as glad in the morning.) --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 06:37, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep.</b> I've known people on (regular) art boards to post asking what the word meant, as they had heard of the term, but had no clue what it meant. It would be nice if people could <u>look this up</u> so it doesn't keep getting asked. (Although, The question was usually followed with a "never mind. Someone emailed me the answer in private" posting.) And I can see people unfamiliar with such things becoming confused when someone posts "yiff art in the past," or similar, and having no idea what they're talking about. At the very least, it should redirect to the furry page, so these people can get their questions answered. (And isn't that the whole point of Wikipedia? To provide unbiased factual information? This information is factual, and is looked up by many people. It's not our place to judge. We have articles on <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a> and <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_weapon.html" title="Nuclear weapon">Nuclear weapons</a>.

<li>Frankly, this is a stupid and pointless attack on our votes. You wonder why there is intransigence and difficulty in reaching compromise when you make comments of this nature? I can see that your supposed good-faith at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> is feigned. Your charge that "individuals show up to vote 'keep' only on schools and churches, and do not bother to make their voices heard, pro or con, on any other issue here." and then name myself and Cal is both demonstrably <b>false</b> (I vote on a variety of AfDs) and certainly uncivil. Maybe you should devote some time to reading the damned instructions at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> instead of making these offensive and snide remarks:
