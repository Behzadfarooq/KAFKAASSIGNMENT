<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus to delete</b>. At one level this is a cop-out decision, but I have not based it purely on the fact that we have many and strong voices on both sides. There's more to it than that. The issue here is whether a new article should be split off from the existing article <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29_e3e6.html" title="Objectivism (Ayn Rand)">Objectivism (Ayn Rand)</a> (I'll call this "the main article"). On one side, it is argued that the main article has become too long and is imbalanced by a very long section relating to criticisms and responses. The editorial strategy is to move this material to a new article, with a much briefer account retained in the main article and a link to the new one. On the other side, it is claimed that the relevant material should be kept in the main article for completeness and ease of access, and that any new article will thus be an unnecessary duplication. Those who oppose the new article, or at least some of them, also say that the editorial strategy of splitting off a new article is actually a bad-faith attempt to make criticisms of Randian Objectivism less prominent on Wikipedia. I am not prepared to draw the inference that anyone is acting in bad faith, though it is clear that some people are quick to assume bad faith in others. It seems to me that either editorial strategy could work and that neither has a complete consensus. However, it can certainly be said that the splitting action has not been taken against any consensus on the talk page of the main article. It was approved by a majority of people discussing it there. I am not prepared to draw the inference from the material available at an AfD that there was an actual consensus to split the articles but nor am I prepared to conclude that the majority view in favour of doing so was a bad-faith attempt by an unprincipled group to railroad a principled minority. I recommend that before any further AfD, which is likely to be just as inconclusive, all involved in the underlying dispute should seek mediation of it as soon as reasonably possible. I also note that the issues are complex and that all involved in the mediation should understand that it will take time and be difficult. Nonetheless, it is the only sensible course of action that I can see. I am not a mediator, but I am prepared to assist informally in any way I can. I have some familiarity with Rand's work, know a lot about legal and political philosophy, and am neither attracted by Rand's ideas nor especially hostile to them. However, I'm sort of on a wikibreak right now, and will be physically away from my computer for most of the next two to three weeks. In that time, the parties should be able to find a competent mediator. I'll see if there's anything I can do when I get back. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 01:39, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is a POV fork from <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29_e3e6.html" title="Objectivism (Ayn Rand)">Objectivism (Ayn Rand)</a>, which was created against consensus. Historically, the last time the criticism was removed from the main article into a fork, the result was that the main was whitewashed while the fork was eventually deleted, with the net effect of censoring the main. This is yet another effort, as demonstrated by the uniform support given by those who are fans of Rand and the uniform protest by everyone else <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 00:22, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Note</b> A survey was taken in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)" rel="nofollow">Talk:Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)</a> under "Survey: Move Criticism section to its own article." The result of the survey was 6 to 2 (a 2/3 majority), in favor of creating this article for the purpose of cutting that section down to a summary. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 18:03, 19 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And it was a biased survey. Only Randists voted in favor, and non-Randists opposed it. There was nothing close to consensus. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 22:03, 20 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>False. I voted in favor and I'm not a "Randist" or "Objectivist." Don't mislead the voters. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:07, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>RJII, I'm not sure why you bother. Many, many people have told him, over and over again, that they're not Objectivists (or "Randists"). He knows this already, and <i>still</i> he asserts, again and again, that everyone who disagrees with his edits is a "Randist". This can only be explained by a willful desire to smear others or misrepresent their views. Reminding him again isn't likely to change anything. I want all admins seeing this to take note of Alienus's history of doing this. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 03:21, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, it's not for him. I'm sure he knows that I'm not an Objectivist. I just don't want the voters to continue to be manipulated by the dishonesty from Al and him. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:25, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>With all due respect, I do not believe RJII claims about his Objectivist status. His edits speak louder than his words. He is either an Objectivist outright or a fellow traveler whose views are not meaningfully different from those of Objectivists. Good faith does not trump godo sense. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 04:44, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've been curious about the philosophy, because people seem to get really uptight about it, and have purchased some books to read (now that I have some free time (since the completion of the RJII Project)). In my opinion, the Objectivists or whoever else is responsible for the horrid article haven't represented that philosophy in a coherent or understandable manner, so I'm reading about it and editing the article myself to reflect the explanations of the philosophy that I'm reading. That doesn't make me an Objectivist. Get over your Randophobia. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 04:48, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. For the reasons stated above. I want to mention two more things. First, there was already a vote to sniff out a possible consensus to create this article. What we found was a lack of consensus, because all the Randists voted to hide the criticism in a new article, but noboody else agreed with them. Despite this lack, Crazynas made the error of copying and pasting to create this article. In short, it should never have existed. The second thing I want to mention is that there has been a recent influx of pro-Rand sock puppets, so I expect them to come here and stack the vote. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 01:01, 17 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> First I would remind Alienus that AfD is not a vote. Second, consensus was reached, with six editors agreeing to the move and two disenting, Alienus tried to improperly close the staw poll after less then two hours after it was put up. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazynas_0564.html" title="User:Crazynas">Crazynas</a> 01:09, 17 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Sigh</b>. The consensus-seeking straw poll was not a vote, either, but an attempt to determine whether a genuine consensus existed. The result is that no such consensus was found. Putting aside the issue of sock puppets for a moment, the fact is that there are two factions -- the Randists and everyone else -- and there was absolutely no overlap between the votes of these two groups. (This remains the case thus far on the AFD). There was no consensus to create this page and no hope of ever gaining such a consensus, which is why I declared the effort futile. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 01:23, 17 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>mmmmmm</b> that doesn't change the fact that you declared the straw poll closed in less then two hours, when it normally takes days (or weeks) before it is determined that consensus is reached(or not). I agree that consensus hasn't been reached in <b>that</b> straw poll, however it dosn't require consensus to create an article. Note that it wasn't a <i>Randist</i> that nominated this artice for AfD, nor was it a POV fork (as you claim), it is adminstrative, and that is all. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazynas_0564.html" title="User:Crazynas">Crazynas</a> 01:34, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Duh</b>. It was immediately obvious that the poll would not result in a true consensus. Creating an article doesn't require a consensus, but forking one does, and the sole purpose of this article is to be a fork. Since there was no consensus for forking, this article has no reason to exist. Of course, you'd like to pretend that we need a consensus to delete, but that's not true in this case: we need a consensus in order to keep. Oh, and as for it being administrative, the fact that all Randists voted pro and the rest of us voted con shows that this is not the case. Remember: <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> is not a suicide pact, and the presence of sock puppets dispell any hint of good faith. Now, let's shut up and let other people weigh in. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 01:47, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a> says that what happened there was not a consensus. What happened was that one side gathered their numbers together to outnumber the opposition and create a tyranny of the majority. Nobody agreed on the fork except for the Randists. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 02:21, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As I am the creator of this article, I should explain my reasoning. The current article is copied from <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29_e3e6.html#Responses_to_Objectivist_philosophy" title="Objectivism (Ayn Rand)">Objectivism (Ayn Rand)#Responses to Objectivist philosophy</a>. This is not a POV fork, rather it is a stylistic change, and it is not without precedent, there are four other sub articles <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivist_metaphysics.html" title="Objectivist metaphysics">Objectivist metaphysics</a> <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivist_epistemology.html" title="Objectivist epistemology">Objectivist epistemology</a> <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivist_ethics.html" title="Objectivist ethics">Objectivist ethics</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism_and_Objectivism_48c4.html" title="Libertarianism and Objectivism">Libertarianism and Objectivism</a>.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> All the bickering over whether Objectivism is a "cult," over who is a "randroid" or not is distracting editors from working on improving the main article portion of <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29_e3e6.html" title="Objectivism (Ayn Rand)">Objectivism (Ayn Rand)</a>. If we can keep all this stuff in its own article, then I think people will be better frame of mind to work on improving that article. Also, it's way too large in comparison to the rest of the article. The focus of the <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29_e3e6.html" title="Objectivism (Ayn Rand)">Objectivism (Ayn Rand)</a> should be the philosophy itself. Right now that article is horrible at explaining Objectivism. Criticism is meaningless if no one can understand the philosophy in the first place.

<li><b>Huh</b>. That doesn't actually follow. See, "Responses to Objectivism" is intended as a place to hide away criticism, since so many of the responses are critical. In contrast, the child articles for the Objectivist take on various general categories of philosophy are much more legitimate. There is no hidden agenda behind their existence, nor is their existence inherently POV.

<li>Regarding you being an admin, I thought you did... at some point on the talk page, if you didn't and/or your not, sorry. Well I did not create this article to <i>hide away</i> criticism, I created it because of <b>balance</b> go look at the main article, half of the entire thing is criticism, although I do agree that there should be a section about responses, criticism or not, I don't think that it should domanate the article. Although I agree with many of the points of Objectivism, that's not why I'm here, I'm here to make a better encyclopedia, and I work on this article because I know somthing about it. Whatever you think, I'm not pushing Pov like you said at one point, one dosn't have to be netural about an article to edit neturally, and thats what I'm trying to do. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazynas_0564.html" title="User:Crazynas">Crazynas</a> 06:04, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Must have been some sort of misunderstanding. In any case, regardless of your intent, the others who have signed on to the bandwagon have hearts that are not quite so pure. You see, the reason the main article has so much criticism is that there's so much out there. Balance isn't about forcing a specific ratio of positive to negative, but rather to accurately match what's happening in the real world. Consider that <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> is likely to be heavy on criticsm, not because the article is POV, but because the truth is that there's much to criticize. The appropriate rule is the one about "undue weight". <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 06:13, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Other than Nandesuka, who just so happens to have a history with me and no interest in Objectivism, every vote to keep has thus far come from acknowledged and obvious Objectivists.

But if that's the case, it should be located at <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Objectivism_e0e2.html" title="Criticism of Objectivism">Criticism of Objectivism</a>, not <a href="../../../r/e/s/Responses_to_Objectivism_ff84.html" title="Responses to Objectivism">Responses to Objectivism</a>, IMO. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 15:58, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>You're right about the title, but not the content. Due to the overwhelming negative responses, any article listing all responses is going to contain primarily criticism. Isolated into a fork, it becomes POV. Only when taken as a balanced part of the main article can it be NPOV. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 19:05, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>As per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, Wikipedia isn't required to give equal attention to minority opinions.

</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm not disagreeing with you on this point. Certainly, if the majority is negative, then we should not give undo weight to those who are positive. Having said that, the net effect of moving the responses to Objectivism here is to purge the main article of negativity, thus destroying the neutrality of it.

<dd>But, it hasn't been eliminated. You say there should be no "splitting" without a consensus, but HERE is where it's determined whether there is a consensus to allow this article to continue existing. You're vote counts as part of the consensus or lack thereof. Voting because you think there's no consensus makes no sense. Also, note that a survey was taken on the Objectivism discussion page whether to create this article for the purpose of cutting that very large section down to a paragraph or two with a link to here. The vote was 6 to create, and 2 not to create (Alenius and Gagnon). I would say that's a consensus. What Al is saying below is innaccurate. See for yourself in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)" rel="nofollow">Talk:Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)</a> under "Survey: Move Criticism section to its own article."

<dd>You misunderstoond me. This article is an anomaly that had no justification for existence unless and until a consensus had been reached <i>on the Objectivism page</i> to split it. Although there was a vote, and a majority, no consensus was reached. Rather, a separate page was created -- as it turns out, redundantly. Hence, the page is both redundant, and is a violation of process. It would indeed be irrational for me to vote (here or elsewhere) on something if it were because of hearing the way the wind is blowing. However, again, the item which changed my mind had to do with the other wiki, and the violations of process involved in it.</dd>
<dd>In my opinion, the 6-2 vote indicates a lack of consensus, not by the numbers, but by the existence of bad faith editing. Unfortunately, the bad faith influence seems to be on both sides, i.e., from LGagnon and The Fading Light. The fact that the arguments are dominated by these remarks, and that reasonable argument and discussion was explicitly truncated at the outset ("Please just say "Agree" or "Disagree" with an optional short explanation. Any further attempts to disrupt this vote will be reported as vandalism"), are not what I'd call "consensus-building". <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a> 01:35, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So, you think that the "Please just say "Agree" or "Disagree" with an optional short explanation. Any further attempts to disrupt this vote will be reported as vandalism" was disruptive? Wow. Ok, you just don't know the events. That was just placed there for two reasons. One was to keep the voting in one place, because people were arguing in between the votes from each individual (A space was placed below for discussion). But the second reason was Alenius's attempt to disrupt the survey. He tried to end the vote less than 2 hours into it (only two people had voted so far). He crossed out the survey question by drawing a line through it and declared the survey over. I reverted it, and he did it again. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AObjectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29&amp;diff=58964270&amp;oldid=58963971" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AObjectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29&amp;diff=58964270&amp;oldid=58963971" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AObjectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29&amp;diff=58968935&amp;oldid=58968878" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AObjectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29&amp;diff=58968935&amp;oldid=58968878" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) That's that "vandalism" that it was referring to. Admittedly, it's a bit complicated to follow --a mess. But hopefully, you can see what's going on now. The bad faith is coming from Gagnon and Alenius who is trying to delete his article, after being unsuccessful at sabatoging the survey. And, he's been misleading people here about what's going on. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 01:44, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think that sentence was "disruptive"; rather, it's <i>abortive</i>. Warding off dialogue makes consensus-building all the more impossible. Anyway, as you indicate, there seems to be bad faith on all sides. I'm not especially impressed with any of this. Perhaps an RfA on the Objectivism page will be more productive. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a> 19:03, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't think you understand the history of Rand's followers on Wikipedia. They did this before to delete cited info. First, a criticism article was created, and then they forced it into deletion to get rid of the criticism permanently. This seems to be a second try at that. If we keep it in the main article, they won't delete the article.

<li>Can you point us to the diffs of the earlier AfD?

<li><b>Comment</b>. A point of order. Given that the issue of creating this article was brought up on the parent article's talk page and failed to gain a genuine consensus, the burden is on those who support its existence to explain why it should continue to exist. In other words, we don't need a consensus to delete, we need a consensus to keep, and no such consensus exists.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If this article is allowed to remain, the POV of the main article will be hugely shifted pro-Rand, which is why the Randists <i>uniformly</i> support keeping this article. It is also why this article must go. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 00:39, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At this time, Nandesuka is the <i>only</i> non-Objectivist to offer even tepid support for keeping the article, and even he says "or merge" and admits that, as a stand-alone article, it's terrible. I think that this makes it entirely fair to say that the <i>only</i> people who support the existence of the article are Objectivists, which further supports my concerns that the goal of doing so is to shift the POV strongly towards Objectivism by isolating (and later destroying) all criticism, just like last time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also want to clarify one thing: while the creation of this page was out of order, I don't believe that Crazynas acted in bad faith. However, he did act in error and that error has since been coopted by the other Objectivists to further their stated goal of making Rand look as good as possible. Crazynas was just trying to be bold, and while I respect his intent, I cannot abide by the results.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I want to add that it is entirely reasonable to be concerned about article size, and I support fair measures to trim the main article down. It's just that I don't see this as a fair measure. Once this matter is settled, I will be glad to work with other editors to see how we can break out portions of the main to shrink it down, without shifting away from neutrality.

<li><b>Comment</b>. What Alienius is saying above is false. There was a vote on the Objectivism talk page. The result was 6 to 2 to do this. Only 2 voted against. Those two were Alenius and Gagnon. 6 to 2 represents a conensus. It's not just a majority, but 2/3 in favor. See for yourself in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)" rel="nofollow">Talk:Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)</a> under "Survey: Move Criticism section to its own article." <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 17:52, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The poll to determine whether <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29_e3e6.html" title="Objectivism (Ayn Rand)">Objectivism (Ayn Rand)</a> should be split failed to gain consensus because it was uniformly supported by Objectivists and uniformly objected to by by non-Objectivists. The fact that people voted right down the party lines, so to speak, showed that there was no meeting of minds. It's clear that any temporary majority was no more than an artifact of greater participation by Objectivists, which is a fine example of why voting is evil. Moreover, speaking of fractions is meaningless when dealing with small numbers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fundamentally, we are <i>not</i> discussing whether a new article should be kept. This is not a new article; it is a fork of an old one. Moreover, it has been seen by almost all non-Objectivists as a POV fork, which is good reason in itself to remove it. Not a single non-Objectivist has fully endorsed keeping this article, while <i>all</i> Objectivists have done so. Remember, consensus can never trump the rules and cannot exist when there is strong factionalism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Consider the parallel case of the cult labels. Multiple reliable sources have been put forth to show that there are articles and even books which call Objectivism a cult and Rand a cult leader. True or false, it's verifiable and notable, so we should report it. Once again, however, all of the Randists oppose this and all of the non-Randists support it. The result: party-line voting and no consensus to remove the tags.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We have to get past this partisanship if we're going to get anywhere. The first step is to burn this POV fork to the ground and salt the earth. The second is to require that everyone vote based on the rules, not merely what result they'd like.

<dd>You're really confused, then. Being a libertarian doesn't make someone an Objectivist (I'm sure the vast majority are not). But, I don't identify as a libertarian either. I'm simply a person who believes in maximizing individual rights. Believing in individual rights does not make one an Objectivist. You have a tendency to associate everyone who seems to share <i>any</i> similarity with <i>any</i> ideas found in Objectivism to be an Objectivist. But, that's not the case. Support for individual liberty has been around long before Objectivism: ""rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others." -Thomas Jefferson. Everyone who supports individual liberty is not an Objectivist. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 20:29, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I follow my own political beliefs. I have some views in common with Libertarianism, but sharing some views doesn't make me one (you want an example of where I disagree?

<dd>I'm sure you do follow your own political beliefs. However, they happen to sound pretty much like libertarianism. After all, "maximizing individual rights' is the rallying call of the libertarian. Not all libertarians are Objectivists, but all Objectivists are (despite their dislike for the term) libertarians, and the two have many issues that they agree entirely on. Rand herself was highly important in the formation of the American libertarian movement, again despite her hatred for it. The bottom line is that the only people supporting this fork are Objectivists, closet Objectivists, libertarians and fellow travelers. Or, for short, Objectivists. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 21:25, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Al, You are still in the rather odd position of promoting a deletion to avoid a deletion. Anyway, your earlier statement was that only Objectivists opposed this Afd. Now that I've helped scotch that notion, you are saying that those who oppose fall into the much much broader category of "anarchists and minarchists". So Bakunin and Rothbard and Rand are all virtually the same, eh? Of course they are, because they all disagree with you, and only people who disagree with you, disagree with you. The world's most important tautology. My only interest in saving this article is the good of wikipedia. I think in this case a fork is the best way to produce two decent articles, rather than one perpetual battleground mishmash. What is still more obvious, though, is that you don't have a pro-delete consensus. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristofurio_ba82.html" title="User:Christofurio">Christofurio</a> 19:12, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The good news is that you have done a nice job of removing its spam-like qualities. The bad news is that the article's still low on content. Also as <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> pointed out, you have a very low number of Google hits. Just to make sure I covered all the bases, I searched Usenet and Google News and came up with zero hits. We use search engine results as a rule of thumb to determine notability, and you seem to be lacking in that department. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedRollerskate_20f6.html" title="User:RedRollerskate">RedRollerskate</a> 12:08, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. While google search comes up short, the article does link to 5 articles, at least 2 of which are from what I consider to be reputable websites (not saying the others aren't, I just aren't familiar with them).

<p>As the merge proposal points out, this duplicates an existing article. However, there is no info here not already in the other article and a google search for movicast only gets 70 hits.

<li><b>Keep</b>, there is enough information about George R. Binks to create an entire article for him. He is just as significant as any other Star Wars character.

I have read <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Tales_20_1b1b.html" title="Star Wars Tales 20">Star Wars Tales 20</a> and I can attest that he is a very important and integral character to the Star Wars universe.

<dd>Thank you for your support, Bromyne. I was looking around for a good Star Wars character article to compare my article on George R. Binks to and I came across the entry for <a href="../../../y/a/d/Yaddle.html" title="Yaddle">Yaddle</a>. In all my 28 years as a Star Wars fan I have never come across someone who has as vigorously and valiantly been a fan of <a href="../../../y/a/d/Yaddle.html" title="Yaddle">Yaddle</a>. On the flip side, my friends and I regularly discuss George R. Binks. We have had discussion about just how he overcame the typical xenophobia most <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gungans.html" title="Gungans">Gungans</a> display and set out to sail the seas on the surface of <a href="../../../n/a/b/Naboo.html" title="Naboo">Naboo</a>. We have also discussed what it must be like to father a child like <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jar_Jar_Binks_a0d2.html" title="Jar Jar Binks">Jar Jar Binks</a>. Was he initially proud of his young son and endeared by his goofy antics? How must he have felt when Jar Jar never grew out of these childish displays? He must have been crushed. All this debate has been sparked from a single story in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Tales_150b.html" title="Star Wars Tales">Star Wars Tales</a>, and there is still so much we do not know about Binks. How did he escape the island him, his wife, and his son were trapped on?

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm going to state a preference that maybe isn't Wiki-policy. I think this page could be quite useful and is about Diseny, something certainly notable. Rather than delete, I'd favor putting a {citation-needed}} tag on it. It really isn't original research but is a collection (still not yet in proper Wiki-form, I admit) of info from secondary sources. Am I going to get jumped on for this? <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 05:38, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep to Strong Keep</b> I don't follow any of the arguments of the nominator. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is about verifiability not verifiedness (is that a word?). I tried a few and had no problems verifying any of them. Also none of the entries are strictly <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?donald%20duck" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?donald%20duck" rel="nofollow">dicdefs</a>. I don't even see the need to tag it with a {citation-needed}} tag, since the info is not controversial and probably frequently patroled by international editors anyway. (See recurring <i>What nonsense</i> interjections which should probably be removed.) I think the list is too unwieldy and also believe that all lists should eventually be outsourced to Wikilistmania, but these are not AfD issues. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 07:00, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. With (until now) 237 editors contributing to the article, this is probably one of the most verified articles on Wikipedia. It is also quite useful for, say, a Finnish user, who wants to read up on her favourite character <b>Pikku Apulainen</b>. Just enter it in the search box and bingo.

<li><b>Comment</b>: on the contrary; though there are a lot of editors on this page, I found very few that actually came BACK to the page after another editor had edited the page.

<dd>I think the argument that when information is deleted from Wikipedia you can get the information by doing research outside Wikipedia does not work at all in favour of deletion. The number of editors that the page has attracted shows this topic is notable enough. The criteria for inclusion are quite obviously not arbitrary, and the information collected here is not at all indiscriminate. So why should this not belong in an encyclopedia? I've said before that I can't see verifiability as an issue. Finally, I do maintain that the usefulness of the information <i>is</i> an argument. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 07:36, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Where is the line in your opinion, then? If we have this, should we have, for every fictional universe, a "list of names in other languages" for that universe? What about places? Or real people? Or ordinary nouns, verbs... this starts to sound like a translation dictionary very quickly: do you think all of this is okay? If not, where do we draw the line? I think the place to draw the line is where we can write ABOUT the translation and actually say something; to me, that's the equivalent standard that differentiates a dictionary definition from an encyclopedia entry. Most of these, there's nothing to say. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 13:17, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Although many interesting things <i>can</i> be said about the translations, that would mostly be OR. Among the "recognized" main purposes of lists (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a>) are information and navigation, both of which are provided by the present list. It's nice if you can create an annotated list (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a>), but this is only one of several recognized formats, and the fact is that the majority of present non-controversial lists, like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Maine_rivers_4001.html" title="List of Maine rivers">List of Maine rivers</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_U.S._Army_installations_in_Kuwait_4d5c.html" title="List of U.S. Army installations in Kuwait">List of U.S. Army installations in Kuwait</a>, is not annotated. Should there be a list of names in other languages for the fictional universe of, say, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Pride_and_Prejudice_c5b8.html" title="Pride and Prejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a>? Well, the fact is that Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy also in translations in other languages. So, no. <i>This is the case for almost all notable fictional universes.</i> But there are a few exceptions. I'm also in favour of having a list of of Harry Potter characters in other languages, so that a reader can find who Severus Rogue is, or Petter Pittelpytt. Such lists are not going to overwhelm Wikipedia, and unlike for names of nouns etcetera it is not something you learn when learning English as a second language and not something you can look up in a dictionary.

<p>I have several reasons for nominating this.</p>
<ol>
<li>First of all, most Harry Potter books have articles in many other wikis, so the titles of the books in other languages can be obtained there.</li>
<li>Second, I don't think Wikipedia should be in the business of having articles like this -- WP isn't babelfish.com and it isn't a dictionary either; I think this is unencyclopedic... I know Harry Potter is popular, but if we keep this it's a slippery slope. Occasionally, the translation of a book title is interesting, for instance, the German title of "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" is translated as "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Fear", but (1) the article isn't about the interesting alternate titles, and (2) in any case, we have a good article on the translation of Harry Potter: <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_in_translation_3067.html" title="Harry Potter in translation">Harry Potter in translation</a>.</li>
<li>Third, this article suffers from a complete lack of sources; it's been a month since I added the {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} tag, and 3 since the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_titles_of_Harry_Potter_books_in_other_languages_7ff1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of titles of Harry Potter books in other languages">first nomination</a>, and no referencing has happened, nor any cleaning up.</li>
<li>Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, if the article <i>were</i> properly sourced, it would look suspiciously like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, I think: unless someone ELSE has ever written an article or book about the translation of Harry Potter, we're going to be using entirely primary sources.</li>
</ol>
<p>For all these reasons, <b>delete.</b> <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 04:31, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, there is nothing against creating an article based on primary sources <i>per se</i>. What it talks about that's not allowed is a Wikipedia article actually <i>being</i> a primary source. Of course, creating an article based <i>entirely</i> on primary sources causes some OR problems with some people. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a> 04:35, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>This is true, and a good point. WP:OR says that in the case of an article that makes only descriptive claims that can be easily verified by any adult without specialist knowledge, an article <i>can</i> be based only on primary sources, implying that otherwise, articles should not be based only on primary sources. I think the other-language titles are probably okay, but most of the interest in the article is the translation back to English, and I certainly don't think, for instance, that someone could verify the back-translation of, say, a Chinese book title without knowing at least some Chinese. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 04:42, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Although I argued for keeping the list of names of Disney characters, I think this one should go. This functions much more as a dictionary entry (not encyclopedia) and, as pointed out above, the titles are readily available by clicking on the side bar.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm inclined to follow Interlingua's argument here too, but it turns out that there isn't a Greek entry for the first book, whatever it's called, and if there were I take it there wouldn't be a Latin transliteration of the title.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Is it necessary for books to sell in order for someone to count as notable enough for Wikpedia? The charge in the archived articles that the book on Macros was from a subsidy press diminished the claims of notability for that volume, but what about the others? Standards for professors is that their publication exceeds that of the average prof at a university, right? There's no real requirement that people read the books they publish. This man isn't a prof, but he seems to have published a number of books in Tamil fiction. I'm not familiar with either him or his books and haven't read any Tamil literature in 15 years, but just judging in terms of the article, it seems NPOV and sufficiently notable for a keep. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 06:33, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> mindful of systemic bias, maybe the lack of google hits is due to searching using the Roman alphabet and/or searching with one of several possible spellings.

But another user with a similar userid, <a href="../../../s/_/k/User%7ES_kollur_5f78.html" title="User:S kollur">user:S_kollur</a> started a malicious campaign alleging that I am none other than Babu Gogineni himself.

<li><b>Delete.</b> This is an auto-bio. Many claims are nowhere except in his own controversial interview. The claim that he is a rationalist intellectual is based only on a degree in microbiology (in his own words in the newsletter that he edited later -"after a first degree in biology, I took a break from college and have not returned ever since!")-, some gossip articles in a quarterly newsletter that he edited, and a single small contribution in the Encarta on M.N.Roy.</li>
</ul>
<p>This article as well as an interview in the newsletter that he edited later, it is claimed that he is the Founder-General Secretary of Rationalist Association of India. Is this correct? In the web site of IHEU where he was employed for nearly 10 years, there are announcements about the 75th anniversary of Rationalist Association of India at Thiruvananthapuram in the year 2006. See links <a href="http://www.iheu.org/node/1748" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iheu.org/node/1748" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> <a href="http://www.iheu.org/node/1742" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iheu.org/node/1742" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>
<p>That means Rationalist Association of India was founded somewhere near the year 1930. How did he become the founder general secretary of it decades before his own birth?</p>
<p>I am a rationalist. Still I vote for deleting this article.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hello all. I am an admin of the BS01 Wiki (Or Utopia as noted on this page). Personally I think that this page should be deleted. The maker of this page, a co-worker of mine, has done nothing to this page. All it consists of is the wiki itself. So I, an admin of the wiki, thinks it should be deleted. Obviously this should be enough to get the job done. But now, I must give some other comments... Bionicle Sector 01 is the most trustworthy and reliable database of Bionicle knowledge for the storyline itself. Quite frankly, I find is funny that you guys take hits on google as a criteria for a website. BS01 does not need to explain what Bionicle is, because all fans that use the site know what the heck it is. It is a database for storyline information. As for the wiki, that is entirely different. The wiki is an add-on of the site and has grown considerably: It it now the biggest database for Bionicle storyline information. <b>Consumed Crustacean</b>, sure you guys have a page called Bionicle, but your pages on Bionicle are very inaccurate. In fact, it is a running joke on BZPower, the largest forum site for Bionicle, that Wikipedia is very inaccurate. Even the writer of Bionicle himself deems it false. XD. ~Utopia from BS01 Wiki</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Well, considering that Wikipedia gets over forty <i>billion</i> hits a day, and that your "Bionicle" site isn't even in the Alexa top hundred <i>thousand</i> sites for hits, one would think that if you were serious about this subject and found the information on Wikipedia lacking, you'd improve the article. Surely there are devoted fans of these toys somewhere who consider it more productive to get the message out than to jeer. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 05:16, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Oh, believe me, we don't just jeer. We majorly help changed Wikipedia's pages on Bionicle. We almost made everything accurate, but then some other nutcase (as some member once called them) edited in pure speculation. So we actually do both. As for hits, I wouldn't doubt it. Bionicle isn't exactly your greatest of subjects. Besides, Wikipedia is huge: Just about everything is here and everyone over the entire nation, and sometimes elsewhere use it. So I find it highly unfair to compare both sites. I mean, let's look at the facts. Our wiki has 9 sysop users, only 5 or them are true staff. You guys have almost 1000 admins. Now, the ratio of admins to members is about the same for both of our sites (last time I checked) so if you compare that... 6/1000 is a pretty big difference. Not enough to minimize the gap in hits, but oh well. And also, why do you quote Bionicle? You guys can't exactly compare any wiki to BS01 Wiki because there is a much smaller population going at it. ~Utopia</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I would like to apologise. I was busy that day and I could only complete the wiki part of it since that's the place I know the best. I will go and update it as soon as I can. (which is not now) Again, I am deeply sorry. (And Utopia, you are a Moderator, like me, not admin. Swert is admin...) - <a href="http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:Bioran23" class="external text" title="http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:Bioran23" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#ff9900;">Bioran23</span></a> <sup><a href="http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Bioran23" class="external text" title="http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Bioran23" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#ff9900;">Quick-Speak</span></a></sup></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Also, it is NOT a non-notable site. As I stated already, it is supported by the site BZPower, and of which does shows up within the top five of BIONICLE on Google. May I also say that the BS01 members is actually BZPower members. BS01 does not have it's own forums, meaning that it's forums are supported by BZPower. The admin CM has left of which is correct, but it has been passed down to administrator Swert. And also, although there are approx. 600 and more members, they have many unregistered members who read it without signing in. As far as I and Utopia knows, information of the wiki has been quoted more than once on BZPower as proof to many things. As Utopia stated already, Wikipedia's BIONICLE page is being laughed about for it's strong inaccuaracy and lack of information, unlike BS01 Wiki, which has many DETAILED pages on different objects and Locations (Of which I tend to) plus detailed entries on the characters. I found it rather rude to comment on a site which you know nothing about by just "Looking it up on Google as if it is the best source in the world" while your pages are being joked by 30000 people around the globe. And also, Wikipedia is huge, yes it is, but you can not just comment on something which is smaller and seems to be less important in your eyes. You and I are all humans, and you and I are all living organisms, there is no difference. - <a href="http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:Bioran23" class="external text" title="http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:Bioran23" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#ff9900;">Bioran23</span></a> <sup><a href="http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Bioran23" class="external text" title="http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Bioran23" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#ff9900;">Quick-Speak</span></a></sup></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Bioran, technically, we are all admins. Saying admins is for simplicity sake here because they don't have "moderators." They have different terms, we have different terms, so I'm just speaking in their language. And also Bioran, I see some problems with your comment. You see, we are talking on WP now, and must play by their rules. Now they say we have to be seen by google, for us to have our own page. Although I think it is unfair as well, that is the way things work. But now, using humans and wikis in metaphor? I have to say that there is a difference. But in the end, this duscussion is just a train derailing: It can't be stopped from its doom.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I'd say the topic certainly is notable and that the author does a good job of mentioning many of the sub-topics important in the ongoing debate/disilusionment with education and its reform. Having said that, I must agree that it's a POV op-ed piece and not an encyclopedia entry:mere mentioning isn't enough to be a Wiki-worthy article. The style is jaunting and chatty in a way that works well for a newspaper or blog, but encyclopedias need to aim for something drier and more neutral. I'd like to the author (or others) produce something on this topic but to save it from being deleted as either POV or OR (original research), it'd need more citations from the beginning. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 14:56, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>this is not a fanfic. reading the article would have shown you would know this.</p>
<p>As per the fact that the author doesnt' have an Isbn number, there are articles on this site that I have read that have not been flagged about things as irrelevant as FORUM THREADS. this led me to believe this site was something it is not.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> I myself wish the article to be removed. And I doubt Wikipedia.com will hold as much cred with me in the future as it used to.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also suggest if articles like this are irrelevant, and editing is so reversible, to hold higher standards as per who gets to edit and who gets to create articles.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I tend to be strongly inclusionist and even for lists am willing to consider 1) utility and 2) possibility of future growth as extenuating criteria. But this really fails for utility, as others have mentioned. If the author wants to work on this topic, I'd suggest working inside a main artile. Hmmm...I just searched for a main article on the tropics or tropical zone/climate and had no luck. For the author, I'd suggest going to <a href="../../../c/l/i/Climate.html" title="Climate">Climate</a> and working from the list of climate zones that are given there. Don't just put this list on that page! But start with tropical climate and start writing there using sections breaks when you edit: == Tropical ==. And then summarize important features of a tropical climate. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 15:03, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Keep</b>. No one wants this deleted, thank goodness. As it is, we have a 60% vote for merge, but I'm going to exercise a bit of discretion here -- the Chairman is a very important person, and a frequent spokesperson for the US military. In my view, Jayzel's points are well-taken, so I'll keep outright. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 14:52, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>merge</b> tags added. This AfD has inadequately addressed the question of whether an article on a "film" distributed via the Internet with no third-party sources and no assertion of notability belongs anywhere in an encyclopaedia, and I am not prepared to call this a 'keep somewhere' consensus. We'll see if someone actually cares enough to merge the material, and whether it sticks. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 09:51, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> this page as this subject will grow quickly. I am the author of this page "islamic flag". I am new to wiki and this is my first project. There are lot of information such as islamic rules and regulation in relation flags they will come in near future. I don't think merging will be good idea as it is specific project and unique project will serve people who intersted in the evolution of Islamic flag. there isn't much information available in wiki. I am more then will to share your ideas in relation to this project. This is by no means of just a flag article. this not an article seperate religion by flag rather it focusing no the how islamic flag began and what is its status at present. it will improve in time.</li>

<ul>
<li><strike><b>Weak merge or delete</b>.</strike> The discussion of Islamic flag rules is interesting, but without citations, it comes across as original research. The tone of the article is not encyclopedic. If it's going to be kept, it needs an <i>immediate</i> cleanup and wikifying effort, since any religion-based article that appears to violate Wikipedia standards will inevitably generate a lot of controversy and divisiveness. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 15:36, 17 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>After reading the recent edits made to the article, I would say <b>Weak keep</b> instead. The page still needs a great deal of additional sourcing, and the tone of the article still needs work; but the improvements thus far show enough potential to justify encouraging the editors to proceed further. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 00:22, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Withdraw</b> My suggestion is to withdraw the nomination &amp; let the author know that you will give it a couple of weeks to include some sources. I cannot judge if the topic can be saved, but a new editor should be given some leeway to work on it. I also don't see this as a case of vanity or an obvious attack article. It may be somewhat controversial, but even so, it seems to be a good-faith attempt to improve Wikipedia. I believe we can let it mature a little. As for POV, that will have to be worked out if it can be cleaned up with some sources. To the original editor, regardless of what happens, try to gather some sources (in English) that support the topic.<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedE_dbe1.html" title="User:TedE">Ted</a> 16:05, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><s><b>keep</b></s><b>Comment</b>: in response to Maix. First of all there are no symbols in Islam. However, <b>A symbol may be adopted if there is need</b> but the symbol should be the most simplest form. example a single colour flag meets the need to have unique flag. There are other rules which govern what can be incorporated in a flag. symbols that identify muslim nation doesn't constitute an Islamic act. People need know these issues for better understanding.

<li><b>Keep</b>, though it needs a massive cleanup. I've added a section on the pan-Arab colours (how could an article on Islamic flags not deal with that topic?). There's quite a bit that's dodgy in there, though - talking about the difference betwen "Muslim flags" and "Islamic flags", which reeksa of OR. And the title should be "Islamic flags" or "Flags of Islamic nations", not "Islamic Flag" - theer is no one "Islamic Flag". <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 23:42, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>(Alleged) terrorist that was assasinated by Israel by involvement in the Munich attacks. There are so few English results on google for him though, that I think that is his only claim to notability. There were plenty of terrorists who attacked Israel - I think including all of them if they are not otherwise notable would be glorifying them. -- <a href="../../../w/h/e/User_talk%7EWhere_05e5.html" title="User talk:Where">Where is</a> <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where">Where?</a> 14:53, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, he is featured in the move Munich by Stephen Spielberg, and no real reason for deletion given: "there were plenty of terrorists"?? There has never been any proof that he was a terrorist, just because he was killed by Mossad doesn't automatically mean he was a criminal, take the example of <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmed_Bouchiki_5db1.html" title="Ahmed Bouchiki">Ahmed Bouchiki</a>. What's interesting about Boukichi is that he was killed by Mossad and not whether or not he was a terrorist. Deleting this article smells strongly of POV itself and can be interpreted as an attempt of cleaning up (i.e. censoring) Mossad's dirty act, no matter if that is the nominator's actual motive or not. Also, I see no reason to merge, what does Wikipedia lose on having a separate article on him? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 18:35, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b>. Article reeks of POV but subject is clearly notable per Spielberg connection and attendant <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/11/20/60II/main318655.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/11/20/60II/main318655.shtml" rel="nofollow">media coverage</a>.

<li><b>Merge</b>, as per trialsanderrors. The connection with Spielberg's <i>Munich</i> gives it clear, immediate notability, but it would have had that even in the absence of the film. As for POV, I think we can guess the political sympathies of the author, but the language is still generally NPOV. For example, he's described as a spokesman, not a liberator; there's the word "claim" about his being a terrorist, but it's not qualified by any POV adjective. Balancing that, the article clearly talks of the "killing" of the athletes. The number of bullet shots and number of athletes killed are both given in an objective form without any editorializing. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 03:07, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself. This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This company had significant coverage by multiple published works which do not tout the company in itself.

<dd><a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> is a good guideline, and vanity articles <i>tend</i> to have significant problems of NPOV and verifiability. However, I don't think articles should be deleted on the basis of WP:AUTO when those problems have been resolved, and the subject of the article is worth including. The difference, I think, is that vanity articles that no one has bothered to verify or make neutral can be deleted because of the concerns in WP:AUTO, but non-vanity articles with these same problems, we should keep around and hope they get fixed up. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:07, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Prod, deprodded by me; prod concern was for notability of the song.

<li><b>Comment</b>: seems notable, as an editor of the National Herald for thirty years. The Publications Division of the Government of India seems to describe him as a scholar of note, and that may be true. However, I have noticed over the past couple of days that the references sections of certain articles are being bombed with Chalapathi Rau - authored references. <a href="../../../j/a/w/Jawaharlal_Nehru_c40c.html" title="Jawaharlal Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> is one example. That makes me suspicious. <b>No vote.</b> <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 05:24, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>No need for concern over recent activity on Chalapathi rau M. I have been trying to refer his work at all relavant places in Wikipedia. Chalapthi Rau M was close associate and friend of Jawaharlal Nehru and an expert on Nehuruvian thought. The books added in <a href="../../../j/a/w/Jawaharlal_Nehru_c40c.html" title="Jawaharlal Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> are commonly referred works on this topic.Manikond@gmail.com 06:06, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per the last link added by me just now in the external links of the article; Mention in a reputed academic article is something. Also, being regarded as <a href="../../../n/e/h/Nehru.html" title="Nehru">Nehru</a>'s unoffical media advisor is notable, imo. I guess the problem with Ghits is due to various transliterations possible. Also, suggest that it be moved to Chalapathi Rau or Chalapati Rau. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 05:28, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I doubt this is a true vanity page; I have been to the school at which he teaches and know the man. While I cannot comment on the validity of the stated reasons for notability (i.e. presenting on a famous TV channel), I doubt that he himself has written the article. I am almost certain, in fact, that the page (and the associated user account) was created by a pupil of the school; a pupil who probably thought he was being undoubtedly witty and hilarious. And finally, it is not entirely unreasonable that he had, in fact, presented a television programme. As many have stated, however, this is not enough for an article, and he is as famous as several other teachers from said school. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasudr_aaac.html" title="User:Masudr">Masud</a> 01:46, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The company is defunct (or at least its name was abandoned in 1987 after which its stores were under the new owner's name), but significant as part of the history of retailing in the U.S. Because it's an article on an historical company, not one that is currently active, the comparatively few Google hits are still consistent with the store chain being notable. Besides, it was a significant employer in Indianapolis for many years.

<li><b>Keep</b>—This retail company was the second largest retailer in Indiana with a long history and brand recognition. Limited information available on the Internet supports the need for Wikipedia entry. A void exists for historical tracking of the currently most volatile significant 20-year history U.S. retailing, set in motion by the activities Campeau. The results being the destruction of companies, loss of civic pride as mid-sized American cities saw their downtown retail districts disappear, and now witness similar results as suburban malls have four major department store anchors become one company: Federated Department Stores. Published literature on this matter is limited. This is American retail history, local history, and economic development. EssEff 20:20, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b>[], and thank your lucky stars that research of this quality is showing up in Wikipedia at all. This person has done his homework, and is obviously a professional writer. Comments to delete above say more about those writers than anything they had to add. Imagine saying that the work "Block" was used too many times as it is the name of the business being discussed! Also the infrequent mentions in Google are to be expected when considering regional commercial history--it is well-researched articles like this that make the best case for Wikipedia existing at all. I intend to read all future articles by this author. Also, do the people recommending deletion HAVE any interest in commercial history? Do they even know what it IS? --RogerCBT 23:16, 22 June 2006 (UTC)RogerCBT</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>[[]]Although it might seem to some of limited experience that William H Block was a minor company in a minor market, it is just clear that they have no understanding of how important individual approaches to retailing used to be. Nowadays all houses are built alike, most malls look alike, and the character of any given retailer is diluted though focus groups, boards of directors, bean counters, and souless executives, and are we any better for it? This is a particularly well written article and there cannot be any question as to it's value to us all. --TopMark 23:33, 22 June 2006 (UTC)TopMark</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> If you guys want it gone so badly, then what's taking so long? And also, what can I write that won't be voted for deletion in three microseconds, be honest, I'm still NEW?! I would like to give this webpage a second shot as long as I'm not voted off the island as soon as I arrive. I'm sorry for my tone, but I just got here and everything I wrote, that was factual, has been voted for deletion, including the pictures! I support majority rule, but what about minority rights? -Gategoer</li>
<li>'<i>By the Way</i>-Just to ask because I really don't know, who put "Zoe" incharge of everything, is this Zoeipeida.org? If it was, then by all means I understand, but it's not. Was she voted in by everyone, did she appoint herself? Is she really the administrator? Does she hold majority share in Wikipeida, is she the president of the company? Just asking because she seems prettty angry at me when I only been here for 2 days and I didn't know all the rules. All I ask is a decent response explaining what the heck is going on and why some articles stay and others go, that's it. Please Repsond. I offer peace and regretfor something I had no idea offended others here. I'm sorry.</li>

<li>This release was the basis for a commercial remix that was later put out on a compilation. For completion it has been included. There may be more than one copy, but they haven't been uncovered yet. What is the minimum for it to be useful? Sometimes only a handful of copies of a release are made. Fans want to know about these release regardless of how many known copies exist. Also its a part of Darren Emerson remix history, and is notable for that also.

<li><b>Comment</b> As I am the owner of this said record, i would like to set some records straight on it, i won it from ebay from a genuine source, there, are as far as i know, only TWO copies in existence, one owned by me and one owned by the remixer (Darren Emerson). There has never been any ebay 'pimping' of the record as far as i know (i've never put it on ebay). The track itself appeared as a remix on a compilation album and the 2 acetates were prodced by Darren to promote the mix on the compilation and also the album from which the original came. It is a genuine release, and as such should be considered in the Underworld page. Would Beatles fans dismiss a rare one off recording of their songs?? As such to remove it from the discography side of the Wiki would be like saying this track doesn't exist - which of course it does.--Mattval1 17:18, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>After reading this, I go with <b>Delete</b> simply on verifiability grounds. There also seems be a problem with the meaning of "release". Since the track was <i>widely, commercially</i> released on a different medium and not as a 7" this makes this a test pressing. And I'm sorry, Underground are not the Beatles. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 17:30, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Under<b>world</b> is not the Beatles, no. However, in the electronic music world, they're arguably top 5 in terms of importance to the genre. Test pressing or not, it's a definite, genuine release and I see nothing to indicate why this shouldn't be included. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:45, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Based on what? In any case, the term "release" has a meaning, namely made available to the public at large. The originator gives up control over who gets the item.

<p>While the subject appears to have a claim to notability, none of the content can be cleaned-up nor can any of the content be verified due to the original article being written in broken English (mixed in German words). After attempting to clean the document twice, I have come to the conclusion that it cannot be salvaged without being forced to <i>guess</i> as to the actual meaning.

<p>A list of very minor characters in the Animal Crossing series.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would like the nominator to expand upon his reasoning for the deletion of this article. So far you have highlighted some minor problems with the article that can be easily fixed, such as game guide content. But there is plenty of information on the characters that isn't "You can do this, you can do that". I so far fail to see how it meets criteria on <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a>. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammer_Raccoon_9cb4.html" title="User:Hammer Raccoon">Hammer Raccoon</a> 14:49, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's plot summary of a game that doesn't actually have a story. Wikipedia isn't the place to describe, in detail, the backstory of every single minor character, and most of these characters serve little other purpose than "<i>Foo</i> sells/gives away <i>bar</i>." - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 22:37, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> seems to contradict your statement that Wikipedia isn't the place for this. However lacking in plot the game is, these characters are integral parts of it. There is enough non-game guide information for an article to themselves, yet too much information to fit into the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Animal_Crossing%7E_Wild_World_490b.html" title="Animal Crossing: Wild World">main article</a>. <b>Strong Keep</b>, Wikipedia guidelines support the inclusion of these types of articles. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammer_Raccoon_9cb4.html" title="User:Hammer Raccoon">Hammer Raccoon</a> 17:10, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Animal Crossing is a popular enough video game for its characters to have separate pages. This article should be about villagers, and the other characters should have separate pages. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadoman_5a39.html" title="User:Shadoman">Shadoman</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShadoman_18c7.html" title="User talk:Shadoman">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Shadoman_d1e1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Shadoman">contribs</a>) 18:39, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b>. There is no POV or cruft in describing, say, Tom Nook's store, his personality, etc. I think it's silly to try and delete a list of characters - especially considering the series is massively popular. And to Shadoman, they are not notable enough of characters to warrant their own article. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 01:46, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Don't delete, but rather expand on. It's a good solid list and as others have said, better than giving each character their own page, which would be even *more* wasteful of space because there's not much on all of the characters. It's better just to put them all on one page like that.</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> While Alexa ranking is not one of the WP:WEB criteria, the rank of <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/main?q=drmcninja.com&amp;url=drmcninja.com" class="external text" title="http://alexa.com/data/details/main?q=drmcninja.com&amp;url=drmcninja.com" rel="nofollow">42,000</a> (trend seems to be increasing, today it is ~21,000) suggests we should take a close look at whether the comic does meet the criteria. Googling "Dr. McNinja" currently yields 140,000 results. Besides being in the major directories, the comic has been reviewed in many, many personal blogs and forums, which together, in my opinion, is as significant as being mentioned in a single "leading" publication about webcomics (this is not something I'd put into WP:WEB as such, but I think as an argument it has merit on a case by case basis). One could argue that the comic is somewhat borderline between Internet meme and traditional web comic.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 17:47, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

I certainly don't see any "new interpretation, analysis, or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts, or arguments that appears to advance a position or, in the words of Wikipedia's co-founder Jimbo Wales, would amount to a 'novel narrative or historical interpretation.'" as stated on <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a>

<li>For example, the idea that this webcomic uses "high contrast Black-and-white, similar to the style used in Frank Miller's Sin City" seems to be the opinion of a wikipedia editor, not the opinion of a reliable, reputable third-party source.

<li>And with all things on the internet as time passes they can gain notability. A 21,000 page rank on Alexa is nothing to scoff at.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm going to side with Eloquence on this one. McNinja was deleted so many times because its fans jumped the gun and made an article for it long before it should have had one. Then it kept getting recreated. At first I thought it was because it just had some very persistent fans, which is why I locked the article down as a {{<a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDeletedpage_0567.html" title="Template:Deletedpage">deletedpage</a>}}, but as I looked over its history, I noticed the recreations were all by different people and the text was dissimilar. There's also been a fair amount of buzz about it in the blogosphere, which, of course, is frustratingly difficult to quantify. I guess what's deciding me, though, was its membership in <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayfree_Press_6295.html" title="Dayfree Press">Dayfree Press</a>. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 18:22, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Addendum</b> I would have preferred that this come up a few months from now, when I think all the questions of notability will have been settled. Probably in McNinja's favor. The buzz just feels a lot like what's happened with other big name comics. Don't bother quoting guidelines and policy to me (I know them all by heart) because I am aware I'm venturing dangerously close to crystalballism. The eventualist in me says the references will come soon enough, and I'd rather not waste cycles on more trips to AfD and DRV. If I'm wrong and McNinja withers away without ever becoming anything, maybe I'll change my tune, but right now I'm standing firm on my decision. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 06:02, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as currently lacking reliable, reputable third-party source. I defer in most cases to Adashiel's knowledge of web comics, but in this instance I must demur. We have standards with regards to verification, and testimony of wikipedia editors in not enough of a reason to cast these standards aside. With regards to the Dayfree Press quasi-syndication, I look back to many previous discussions in the history of <i>talk WP:WEB</i> where consensus is that syndications does not allow inclusion "by marriage" as it were. There are several other webcomics in Dayfree press' stable that are notable, but we know this <b>because of third party sources.</b> I'd urge those who are recomending keep to instead go and find some sources. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="#000000" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 02:31, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b> as this is a respectable foundation of an article for a significant webcomic which has consistently been increasing in notability and popularity since its founding, and further since its affiliation with Dayfree. Some bias exists against the article because of its past deletions but, as mentioned before, previous versions were premature and this iteration deserves a fair, objective look regardless of how it has fared in the past.
