<li>As the originator of this Wiki entry, I can tell you that although I've read the book, I have no interest whatsoever in promoting it; asserting as much without the slightest scintilla of evidence is reprehensible - a genuinely gutter act. Also, as anyone who has read their <b>Aristotle</b> will tell you, sortition explicity (as a theory) deals with partisanship, and Mueller, Tollison &amp; Willet's 1972 article (<i>Representative Democracy via Random Selection</i>) in <b>Public Choice</b> embeds it in economic doctrine.Geoffrey Transom</li>

<dd>comment: I got it. The crew are members of Wu-Tang. It looked for all the world to me like another name for part of the band. I.e. a way for them to jokingly refer to their beats unit. Thus, it wouldn't be a separate band at all and therefore not one with records, etc. Do you have any recordings by them that aren't Wu-tang? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 8 July 2005 15:29 (UTC)

<dd>That's the problem, and the one reason I suppose that they don't meet WP:MUSIC... Brooklyn Zu, as with many other groups affiliated with Wu-Tang (Streetlife, for one), have yet to put out a solo recording. They <i>have</i> made guest appearances on ODB's LP's (and are known as his "other" rap crwe), and - I believe - have been working on a solo mixtape. I dunno: to me, they're notable, but others may feel that they are not. I honestly feel, though, that they deserve an encyclopaedic entry (i.e. brief, to-the-point, but informative). <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 8 July 2005 15:36 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Question</b></s><b>Comment</b>: The article as it stood was a copyvio. However, I would take it upon myself to create a better article outlining who <b>Brooklyn Zu</b> are. In fact, I think, the best proposal is to create an article Wu-affiliates, with all the groups like <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell_Razah_6df8.html" title="Hell Razah">Hell Razah</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn_Zu_9190.html" title="Brooklyn Zu">Brooklyn Zu</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killah_Priest_1ed2.html" title="Killah Priest">Killah Priest</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streetlife.html" title="Streetlife">Streetlife</a>, &amp;c. contained therein. On their own, these rappers may not have the clout to be encyclopaedic, but I feel that a mention of the <a href="../../../w/u/-/Wu-tang_Clan_f302.html" title="Wu-tang Clan">Wu-tang Clan</a> should not go without some sort of companion article on their many colourful side projects and affiliates. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 01:50, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>People do tend to jump on artices to delete them, that is true. However, the VfD process lasts a full 5 days from the time of nomination. Voters can, and often do, change their vote in that period if an article is significantly revised. In practise, a VfD is often not closed for about 10 days and most admins will count all good-faith votes cast in that time — this should give the author ample time to make their case and their article. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 8 July 2005 14:48 (UTC)</li>

<p>The GNAA site is seen by many as not notable, and not a suitable topic for Wikipedia. There have been numerous VfDs submitted, however each one has had irregularities. In a final effort to put the whole thing to rest, I am submitting this article to VfD one last time. I am dividing up the page into 5 sections: <b>Delete</b>, <b>Keep</b>, <b>Redirect</b>, <b>Comments</b> and <b>Disqualified votes</b>. Usually we do not place these into sections due to limitations of VfD, however an exception will be made for this article, mainly due to its controversial nature.</p>
<p>No sock-puppets, anonymous users or <i>very</i> new users will have their votes counted in this VfD. To make this the final GNAA VfD, if you had less than 100 edits as of the time you submit your vote then your vote will not be counted. This is to stop people from gaming the system and to stop <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppets_376f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppets">sock puppets</a> from voting. Further, comments that are seen to be personal attacks will be deleted immediately by any admin not participating in the vote. <b>However as per VFD policy, all logged in users are able to cast their vote, even if they do not meet our desired 100 edit limit.</b> Please note that though the users may cast their vote, if they do not fulfill the criteria they will be moved to disqualified votes and their vote will not be counted.</p>
<p>One last comment. VfD is decided by consensus to delete. The vote is not counted by a straight 50/50 split, where the side who gets greater than 50% of the vote "wins" (I shudder at this term). Deletion will only occur if there are around 70% of the votes to delete.</p>

<li>Er... how is disqualification any less of a term than discounting? Disqualification means that their vote is not valid also. Just a point. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 04:35, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>'Disqualification' makes reference to a set of rules, whereas 'discounting' denotes a disbelief or disregard of the vote (or opinion) entirely, as innacurate or irrelevant, detracts from it? <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeeaxid_b28b.html" title="User:Seeaxid">Seeaxid</a> 05:07, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Perhaps I didn't express myself clearly enough. What I meant to say is that they are of interest only because they are trolling here for the purpose of calling attention to themselves. (Besides, encouraging destructive assholes is not necessarily in the best interest of Wikipedia.) --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 9 July 2005 01:59 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wish to point out that this is not correct: the GNAA are not just of interest because they are trolling Wikipedia. Firstly, considering their entire purpose for existence, the GNAA have been remarkably restrained when it comes to this site (I have seen what they do to other website). Though they have vandalised the odd article, they have mostly focussed their attention on the Gay Nigger Association of America article. The GNAA are notable because they faked OS X screenshots, have been a significant subculture on Slashdot, and have crapflooded, trolled and generally been malevolent on many websites and community forums. They also have their own IRC server, have a radio show (TrollTalk), a website, a crapflooding script and a growing user base. I don't like them, but they are notable for things other than what they do on Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 9 July 2005 02:10 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Glad to at least clear things up that you are not biased. BTW, in what other case has having a website, an IRC server, or having written a script been considered notable? None. (And if they have a "radio show", it isn't even important enough to list in their own article.) If this were any other group other than these guys you seem to admire, you would laugh them right off of the site. I would not be having such a problem with this if it wasn't so blatently ridiculous and two-faced. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarvin01_3da7.html" title="User:Marvin01">Marvin01</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarvin01_56aa.html" title="User talk:Marvin01"><small>talk</small></a> 9 July 2005 03:54 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I do try. Would argue that all those things establishes that they are an organised group and that this <i>helps</i> to establish their notability. The fact that they are a well-know and organised group that performs trolling and crapflooding make them notable. This is disputed, and one of the reasons for the VfD. In fact, it was established in the previous 5 VfDs that this is a notable enough reason to keep the article, but something has always happened to make someone object. Do not wish to say any more as I am administering this vote and as such not actually voting. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 9 July 2005 04:13 (UTC)</li>
<li>Quick note: It's the l0de Radio Hour, and I *did* add it to the article, but it got removed at some point; not sure why. As soon as it was linked from the GNAA article, it was added to VfD (kept, I might add; don't bother trying it again). It's produced by a member and is *not* an official GNAA project.

<dd>That's not true. Our most fundamental policy is NPOV. Information has to be written about neutrally. In order to do that it has to be verifyable, it has to be able to be written about by anyone.

<dd>But if it's deleted it has no chance of being verified. Does Wikipedia rely on the use of ex. Google when verifying it's articles? Who are anyone to decide what type of information is worthy being keept or not? All information is worthy collection, isn't that what Wikipedia is all about, collection and sharing all information in existence. I feel deleting something because of notes like "Vanity", "Non noteable" is wrong on all accounts. Even if YOU don't like it, or you find the information to be stupid, that does NOT mean that someone won't find a use for it. Even if only one person finds anything informational, that one person should be taken into account.

<dd>Sarcasm is unnecessary. One difference you might note is that Adolph Hitler and the KKK are both entities of historic significance. A clan of Internet trolls, on the other hand, exists solely as a kind of memetic cancer. Their purpose is to incite a reaction and make an impression, and giving them a "legacy" on Wikipedia is like feeding them. They feed on attention. Their presence on this Wiki is the only reason most people here know about them, and the very controversy that has brought a lot of new voters to the deletion page paradoxically is the reason why a lot of people are voting in favor of its notability. That is unfortunate reasoning, since agitation about a group devoted to creating agitation is only to be expected. I've also noticed somebody soliciting "Keep" votes in Wikipedia Chat, and that is also unfortunate. --<a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Billion_29e9.html" title="User:Mr. Billion">Mr. Billion</a> 07:18, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

What you fail to realise is that the vociferous and continual opposition (and thus attention) displayed by some towards the existence of this article contributes more to "giving them a "legacy" on Wikipedia", than leaving it forgotten in a corner, such that your own vote, and manner of doing so, one could say, did more harm for your cause than good. <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeeaxid_b28b.html" title="User:Seeaxid">Seeaxid</a> 08:30, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

I am always in favor of supporting merges, where two smaller articles can reasonable become one very good larger article, but that would not be the appropriate case here. GNAA is a larger article, filled with verifiable information. I don't like rewarding these <i><b>pathetic childish idiots</b></i> any more than anyone else, but the encyclopedic worthiness of the article is entirely in line with Wikipedia standards. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func"><tt>func</tt></a><a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func"><tt>(talk)</tt></a> 04:12, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. They're obviously notable if they attract this much attention. The article is quite lengthy, quite detailed, and is not in and of itself a troll.

Seriously now, is this going to be the last attempt to delete this article? Continually calling for deletion of this article is sadly reminiscent of a corrupt government attempting to retry an individual until the jury returns a verdict of guilty, justifications of "irregularities" notwithstanding.

<dd>Ah, but I, for example, was attracted to this vfd for the rather odd name of the article.

<li>I need to look at the sources some more, since some of them either do not say what they really are or they do not work. Some of the <s>Slashdot</s> Something Awful links did not work, since I do not have membership to the website. I will try to fix up the sources so I can see how much it is true deal or much of it just promo. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 8 July 2005 03:28 (UTC)

<li>Since I can visit that Something Awful subforum (via someone else's account: uh oh, account sharing!) I can confirm that moot does indeed say in the first post of that thread, "It was not the GNAA who killed 4chan (I quite like them actually), or really the moronic users, it was a man named Chris, who goes by the name TheRowan and runs a business that shuts you down if you fail to play along.", a few paragraphs after the picture of BarnacleEd. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacj_756e.html" title="User:Jacj">Jacj</a> 23:42, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I voted last time <b>delete,</b> because in my view, I do not think they are notable. Now, I am trying to see how famous these guys even are. That is why I am doing the source check. Also, for those who can read French, I would look at <a href="../../../../fr/g/a/y/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America_7009.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America">fr:Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America</a> and see how they managed to pull the article off. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 8 July 2005 04:16 (UTC)

<li>The article exists on the French Wikipedia because I translated it (and a few other contributors fixed it). As for why it is still here, it's probably because no one there ever imagined it was not a suitable article. But in fact I think the main reason is that the GNAA has never been disrupting the French Wikipedia (TTBOMK; we have had Autofellatio attacks but I don't know if they were from the GNAA), hence no one VfDed the article <i>as an attempt to retaliate over the GNAA</i>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Hocevar_dccf.html" title="User:Sam Hocevar">Sam Hocevar</a> 8 July 2005 08:54 (UTC)</li>

<li>Though I am administering this vote, I can answer your questions briefly: 1) They exist (I have talked to them on their IRC server/channel; 2) StuartH has stated he has checked the article to find out who they are; and 3) The present text has been looked over with a fine tooth comb by many parties. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 8 July 2005 07:02 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just because it happens online does not mean it is important. Just because it happens on SlashDot does not make it important. Google hit counts are strongly inflated for this stuff. Nobody is talking about this offline.</li>
<li>Anybody can make webpages or flood weblogs and chat rooms. It is easy to make a nuisance of yourself online to a lot of people at once. Lacking the decency not to does NOT make you notable. Trolling does not make you notable. Not even if you and your buds think you are really good at it.</li>
<li>"[GNAA] was rumored to be mentioned on CNN" Is this really the level of reporting that you want to have in your encyclopedia? Do you think WP could ever be taken seriously with this content included?</li>
<li>"Interesting phenomenon"? Are you kidding? Two or three of these kiddies spring up every week. There is nothing interesting, unique, or even mildly surprising about a group of annoying teenagers or college dorks.</li>
<li>"Precedent has been set"? So what. Unset it. Get rid of all of this crap. Make a WP:AYBABTU rule or something. If you are not bigger than AYBABTU, you don't get in. Forget it. Or go troll some more message boards and hold your breath for that CNN story.

<li>Would suggest to you that it would be bad faith of an administrator to remove those votes if the editor has previously voted keep with a specific reason relating to why the article should be kept. Also, I suspect that if we apply this we would need to apply it to the delete votes also. I can see at least one vote that states that "I don't think trolls deserve that much server space, if at all.", which is clearly invalid because this has nothing to do with notability, and is merely a vote for deletion based on the fact they are trolls. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 12:44, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I actually expected this, seeing as I don't have many edits. But I've been here for a long time, and its not like I've made 49 quick edits just to vote here. My first edit in this account (I used to edit anon for a while) was 22 November 2004. So please don't treat my vote as if it doesn't matter. Evidently I have a voice, and I wish to express it as I see fit. Finally, if you can provide me with a link to indicate that one shouldn't partake in a VfD until x amount of posts, then I'll agree that my vote can waste away here. But as <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a> stated in his comment, votes shoudn't really be discounted unless you can *prove* Bad Faith. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoThermic_6d72.html" title="User:NeoThermic">NeoThermic</a> 9 July 2005 03:35 (UTC)

<dd>Because of the nature of this vote, it is not what I would class as an ordinary VfD. Our voting criteria for an article that has been submitted <i>six</i> times is now a lot stricter. This has been necessary, if unfortunately so, because IMHO there has been considerable bad faith edits on both sides (keep and delete). Keep because they refuse to accept the vote after 5 times, and delete because of sock puppets and harassment. I am running this vote with some very clear, set rules. Regrettably, any user who is very new might be deemed to be a ring-in of either camp or perhaps a sock-puppet of an existing member. Thus, I must discount votes of all people who have had less than 100 edits. I'm sorry that this includes you, but I can't show you any favour on this. If you would like, it is perfectly valid for you to add a comment to the <a href="#Comments" title="">#Comments</a> section. I would also suggest you refer to Theresa Knott's comment above. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 9 July 2005 03:41 (UTC)

<dd>I just feel that concentrating on <i>just</i> edits is a bit, lacking any better words at 4:50am, shallow. Shy wikipedians (those who have few edits, but have been here for a while) have opinions, and they shouldn't be squashed due to their shyness to edit articles. I'm (very) sure that discounting my vote isn't personal, since you've outlined a simple policy, but it has to be said, this is its sixth VfD, its survived (possibly with conterversy) them all so far. I just felt that, despite my lack of editcount, that my time registerd here would hold more weight, allowing me to have a say in ending this (increasing) set of VfD's&#160;:) <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoThermic_6d72.html" title="User:NeoThermic">NeoThermic</a> 9 July 2005 03:51 (UTC)

<dd>The requirement is a common one. Admins routinlely ignore users with only a few edits, they just don't normally spell it out in advance. Note that delete votes are also being removed. I understand that it is frustrating for you. You are clearly not a sockpuppet. But remember that the purpose of the vote is to gauge consensus. The voting among editors with &gt;100 edits is likey to be similar to that among all editors, and the 100 edit minimum does rule out an awful lot of sockpuppets.

<li><b>Keep</b> all of them (or else <b>merge</b> them together to some some list of Nokia phones). Individual models of mobile phones are notable enough. The fact that these stubs are unlikely to be expanded is not a valid criterion for deletion. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 8 July 2005 08:43 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> all. Never seen the 'articles that will never be expanded' argument before, most of the articles have been edited in the last couple of months. <a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModster_b6f4.html" title="User:Modster">RustyCale</a> 8 July 2005 08:52 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. It is my opinion that having an article for every Nokia model is a bit excessive and unencyclopedic. However, this is not a uniform series of stubs (and several have been expanded beyond stub status) so it doesn't seem appropriate to delete them all with a single vote. - <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatdog_313b.html" title="User:Thatdog">Thatdog</a> 8 July 2005 08:57 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I apologise if I gave the impression that this was a list of stubs. If it were, and if there was a <i>chance</i> that they could have been expanded into articles that warrented inclusion, I would not have nominated them for deletion. But <i>despite</i> the fact that these have information in them and <i>despite</i> the fact that they are being updated, they are simply not notable. If someone famous kills someone else famous by bashing them with the <a href="../../../n/o/k/Nokia_3310.html" title="Nokia 3310">Nokia 3310</a> then it becomes notable. I'll even withdraw the <a href="../../../n/o/k/Nokia_6600.html" title="Nokia 6600">6600</a> because it was the most exciting actor in <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cellular_%28movie%29.html" title="Cellular (movie)">Cellular</a>. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">Aaron Brenneman</a> 8 July 2005 10:47 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> some of them. A lot of these phones are nothing special like the 3510i and 3205 for example, they are just ordinary series 40 phones but the 1100 is probably the most "basic" one they have made yet and is very popular in third-world countries

<li><b>Keep</b> Nokia is the worlds most well known mobile phone manufacutrer. Anyway there is a demand to have neutral resource such as Wikipedia for finding out about mobile phones, most searches on google for mobile phones are spam for ringtones and the like. <b><a href="../../../n/s/r/User%7ENSR_897d.html" title="User:NSR">NSR</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/s/r/User_talk%7ENSR_af2c.html" title="User talk:NSR">talk</a>) 8 July 2005 11:33 (UTC)</li>

<li>Can't all of this be <b>Merged</b>? How likely is it that anyone will want to know the features of one individual phone as opposed to comparing two or more anyway.

Just because someone who works for Nokia decided to make an article for every one of their products doesn't mean we have to give them the free advertizing. Articles for some consumer products should have articles, but this is ridiculous. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Daniels_d071.html" title="Jack Daniels">Jack Daniels</a> deserves an article because people know it and ask for it by name.

<li>I wouldn't consider these articles advertising, since most of these phones are no longer in production.

<li><b>Delete</b> per R. fiend. Also note that claims in the article may be original research if no references are supplied. These sorts of individual articles for dozens of items that are nearly identical are a bad idea, and even worse when you consider how quickly these sorts of consumer products become obsolete and replaced with new models. This is the equivalent of having 40 different articles for the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Mustang_816d.html" title="Ford Mustang">Ford Mustang</a> automobile, one for every model year since it was introduced in 1965. How about doing something useful? Merge into product lines and provide redirects making it easier to compare features by having all the info someone might want in a single place, rather than scattering it all over wikipedia in dozens of little articles with repetitive, nearly identical content. <a href="../../../1/6/5/User%7E165.189.91.148.html" title="User:165.189.91.148">165.189.91.148</a> 8 July 2005 18:39 (UTC) Sorry, got logged out before I saved.

<li><b>Merge</b>. Having this many pages for exact phone models is craziness. For the sake of simplifying maintenance, merge these into one page.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> -- cell phones may be trivial now, but just like the Ford Thunderbird or the Studebaker to the auto industry, in a few decades these devices will be talked about as classics of the information age. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> | <a href="../../../f/u/z/User_talk%7EFuzheado_fba0.html" title="User talk:Fuzheado">Talk</a> 9 July 2005 01:36 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b>. This is just what WP is for: each of these phones has waaaaay outsold all today's teen-band listings and Nokia is so huge it imparts parental notability.

<li>Perhaps a split of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Nokia_products_e980.html" title="List of Nokia products">List of Nokia products</a> can be done, with Nokia Original Series, Nokia Basic series (1xxx and 2xxx, even though the 1xxx series are ultrabasic), Nokia Expression Series (3xxx), Nokia Active Series (5xxx), Nokia Classic Series (6xxx), Nokia Fashion Series (7xxx), Nokia Premium Series (8xxx), Nokia Smartphone Series (9xxx), and <a href="../../../n/o/k/Nokia_NSeries_7811.html" title="Nokia NSeries">Nokia NSeries</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I wrote this article and just updated it. I'm adding as I learn things. There's nothing 'vanity' about the article. Just because you don't know who she is, doesn't mean she isn't historically important. It's true that I can't find out very much information on her yet, but that could be because she doesn't engage in anything that results in internet posting or traffic. However, if google hits were the basis of inclusion in Wikipedia, we wouldn't need wikipedia, we could just google. I know that she's important in Denmark and relevant to several other articles I'm working on which is why I made one for her. On the other hand, I suppose she could be just listed on the other articles and have no listing and then people couldn't find out more about her.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The album has been announced with a specific release date and general details. It's not a matter of being a crystal ball and t.A.T.u. is a notable band.

The first line states "This page gives some rough guidelines which we might use to decide if a musical topic is <i>notable</i>," (emphasis mine).

<li><b>Comment</b> So - you guys just delete my last request for help - and still don't help by offering any advice? I am sorry, but I find that really rude! You even deleted my apology so no-one else can see it and my offer to remove the page and my statment asking what I can and can not do - may I ask why? So no-one else can see that I am a newcomer just trying to add content and aking for help? I have just read you're not even suppossed to delete without justifying. The company has nothing to do with camping stuff and is called Nalpeiron - PRO-Tector is just their technology. Are you in the IT business?, but what's that got to do with it - is no-one going to help a new comer here? Do you want new editors to help here? Is anyone going to give any advice that may actually help me and move forward Wikipedia?</li>

<dd>Hi there. No, I did not delete your comment, only the cut-and-paste of your previous comment from the article page (which anyone voting here should be looking at, anyway). You should read the comments that I left you at <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User_talk%7E80.176.204.162.html" title="User talk:80.176.204.162">User talk:80.176.204.162</a>, though creating a real user account would surely help out in our conducting this discussion.</dd>
<dd>As for the "camping stuff", what I was saying was that, if anything, the name "PRO-Tector" is notable only as a camping equipment brand, and no notability could be established for the software you reference. You see, Wikipedia doesn't just list anything, and there is a specific list of those things that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is <i>not</i> for</a>, that you should probably read.</dd>
<dd>Thank you for contributing. I know VfDs can seem rude and impersonal, but this is the kind of process that WP needs to have in place to keep the encyclopedic nature of the site thriving. I hope you understand and choose to contribute more in the future!

<li><b>Comment</b> Forgive my Wailing - are you all American by the way? Is this just a US based encyclopedia? I don't want to go to any listings, I just want to inform of new technology that I thought was relevant - obviously I have completely the wrong end of the stick. I see I have also had my entry on the main copy protection page deleted even though that had no advertising in it. Why - will someone tell me why? There's even still an advertisiment in their for Macrovision - so how does that stack up then? Why is this that you take such offence to outsiders trying to join in and add to this encyclopedia? Why is it instead of adding constructice advise to others you insist on continiung to say the same old thing - delete because of advertisng - when I'm only trying to find out what I can and can not do. Sorry if I have invaded your own private domain and you think I'm wailing. Neither are you in actual fact helping in anyway by sending me to a listing - why would that be of interest to me? I will remove all my listings and go elsewhere - meanwhile, this section on Digital Rights Management will remain woefully out of date and will not be of use to anyone. -(unsigned by 80.176.204.162)</li>

<p>This is a copy&amp;paste of the original, unrewritten, version of <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tea-sucking.html" title="Tea-sucking">tea-sucking</a>, with the picture (Image:Tea Sucking.png) removed, that was heading directly for deletion the last time around, before it was completely rewritten to be about <i>tea</i> sucking rather than about <i>teabag</i> sucking. As I said before about the original, this article doesn't cite any sources at all, its proponents (the author and 1 other) have proferred no sources (despite the fact that this lack of verifiability was mentioned the last time around, moreover), and there are no sources to be found documenting the practice of teabag sucking; all of which make this article <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>.

<li>This is very frustrating. The <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tea-sucking.html" title="Tea-sucking">tea-sucking</a> VfD became a heated argument, and led to an excellent re-writing of the article to conform to WP standards. Now, someone just blithely puts the old article back up as if that argument, consensus, and re-writing never occurred?

<li>That is correct, the above Keep was written by me, the author of the article. I am working on a history of a particular art movement over the last decade in Portland, Oregon and the artists who were involved. This article is an artist who was part of this movement. This movement and the artists have been repoted about on CNN, written about in Art Forum, ArtNews, Art in America, The Oregonian, The Organ, The Portland Tribune and more. It has been discussed by Jerry Salz art critic for the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Village_Voice_bbe7.html" title="Village Voice">Village Voice</a> (he called it intimidating), as well as Larry Rinder, former curator of the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitney_Museum_of_American_Art_4e48.html" title="Whitney Museum of American Art">Whitney Museum of American Art</a>. The following keep was NOT written by me, but rather by a user who shares the same wireless internet connection as I do, as does an entire building and possibly more.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This sort of article is the kind of rare bit of information on a relatively obscure contemporary artist that is SO helpful and one of the reasons I always check wiki when I can't find something elsewhere. If Wiki just had what you can find everywhere it wouldn't be useful. Having said that, the article is in shambles, it needs a re-write desperately. 151.202.8.52 04:43, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Interesting thing - I realized while editing this that I throw the word vanity around a lot but haven't read the definition for a while. For example - wiki definition of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_page.html" title="Vanity page">vanity page</a> says: "vanity by itself is not a basis for deletion, but lack of importance is". This is a tough one - what establishes importance? For example, I just noticed Richard Tuttle doesn't even have a page, he's having a retrospective at the SFMOMA right now and is probably one of the most influential artists at the moment. Just my few cents. 151.202.8.52 05:41, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not Clear vanity. Just because I've taken the time to add information which may be of value to those using Wikipedia as an expert in my given field does not make it vanity. It's called generosity. I've been an established magician for thirty years in Idaho, California, and Texas, and a past president of the Idaho Magician's Guild, member of the Society of American Magician's, Texas Association of Magicians, The International Brotherhood of Magicians and The Magic Castle. Recently a friend of mine and I have opened The Magical Arts Centre in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY. My escape pictures from the burning rope are highly regarded as some of the best in escapology. As far as being an advertisment for my novel, nothing could be farther from the truth. <i>THE MAGIC LIFE</i> was ranked #72 on Amazon.com <b>during the year of it's release</b>, six years ago, right next to <i>THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE</i>. It was a top ten finalist in the Hemmingway first novel competition and has been recommended by Classbrain.com as one of the most motivational novels for students. It was also published in Japanese by a major publisher Fuso Publishing. Noting it's current ranking and adding "I can see why he's advertising, is a personal smere. Not only am I not interested in selling books through your site, I know that it is something that wouldn't happen. Checking Amazon, the previous voter should have been noticed that it is unavailable. However used copies are from which I wouldn't make a red cent. And as for my informative links being reverted, the information I provided is for the reader not self promotion. I've been out of the escape business for over 15 years, simply because I'm too old and out of shape. However, I my escapes have been included in the Houdini Museum, honored by the Escape Artist Industy and those thousands of people that have visited my my escape web pages have written to me telling me how much they enjoy them. - Ace Starry

I am sure Scimitar's comment was not intended as a personal smear; at first blush, it <i>does</i> look like you're using this article for self-promotion, and Amazon's sales rankings are a bit confusing, to me anyway, and have probably been misinterpreted here.

<li><b>Comment</b> Re Amazon sales listings - I <i>think</i> the number indicates where the book is on the sales popularity list, so the new Harry Potter is probably in the top ten, and no. 52,849 means 52,848 books sell better than no. 52,849. I think. --<a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMothperson_66a8.html" title="User:Mothperson">Mothperson</a> 8 July 2005 17:33 (UTC)</li>
<li>My apologies if my comment was taken as a personal smear, it was certainly not intended that way. I just have a little bit of knowledge about the publishing industry from personal experience, and understand how hard it can be to market a book; I also know what some people try. As for your contention that it's unavailable, I just tried to order a new one and had no problems, so I'm not sure what you mean. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> 8 July 2005 18:12 (UTC)

<li><b>Wow, this certainly sounds like a personal attack.</b> Though I'm not certain that he realized that I'm something of a newcomer to this, let me enlighten us as to what I discovered by reading some of the guidelines in Wikipedia:</li>
<li><b>Please do not bite the newcomers</b>
<ul>
<li>Understand that newcomers are both needed by and of value to the community. By empowering newcomers, we improve the diversity of knowledge, opinions and ideals on Wikipedia, enhance its value and preserve its neutrality and integrity as a resource.</li>
<li>Assume good faith is a fundamental principle on any wiki, including Wikipedia. As we allow anyone to edit, it follows that we assume that most people who edit are trying to help the project, not hurt it. If this weren't true, a project like Wikipedia would be doomed from the beginning.</li>
<li>So, when you can reasonably assume that something is a well-intentioned error, correct it without just reverting it or labeling it as vandalism. When you disagree with someone, remember that they probably believe that they are helping the project. Consider using talk pages to explain yourself, and give others the opportunity to do the same. This can avoid misunderstandings and prevent problems from escalating. Especially, remember to be patient with newcomers, who will be unfamiliar with Wikipedia's culture and rules.</li>
<li>Assume good faith on the part of the newcomer. They most likely want to help out. Give them a chance!</li>
<li>Remember Hanlon's Razor. Behavior that appears malicious to experienced Wikipedians is more likely due to ignorance of our expectations and rules. Even if you're 100% sure that someone is a worthless, no-good, low-down scum-sucking Internet troll, vandal, or worse, conduct yourself as if they're not. By being calm, interested, and respectful, your dignity is uplifted, and you further our project.</li>
<li>Remember that you were once a newcomer also. Treat others as (if possible, better than) you would be treated if you had just arrived at Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. A notable performing magician would make it into the news media reasonably often, for reviews, show listings, and the like. <a href="../../../l/e/x/LexisNexis_2d15.html" title="LexisNexis">LexisNexis</a> finds basically nothing for "ace starry", aside from some 1999 listings for book signings and shows at local bookstores in Texas and Louisiana. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdc_936f.html" title="User:Cdc"><small>CDC</small></a> <a href="../../../c/d/c/User_talk%7ECdc_878d.html" title="User talk:Cdc"><small>(talk)</small></a> 8 July 2005 21:49 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> - I'm not familiar with the extent of LexisNexis coverage. I've had numerous articles written about my appearances over the years: book reviews, reviews of appearances from comedy clubs and bookstores, mentions in the magic trade journals, Magic Magazine and Genii Magazine, One article in the mainstream that I can point you to references me as an expert escape artist in Maxim Magazine Article, Escape From Restraints - November, 1998. page 34. I'm mentioned in two doctoral papers that I know of, Florida State University, 2003 - The Secret Lives of Adults: Stories, By Ryan Walsh, <i>"I found my feather in The Karate Kid, and he found his in escape artists like Houdini and Ace Starry."</i>The other is called Literature at Lightspeed found at <a href="http://www.lespagesauxfolles.ca/Academic/chap02.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.lespagesauxfolles.ca/Academic/chap02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lespagesauxfolles.ca/Academic/chap02.htm</a> which mentions the earliest literature on the web.User:astarry 12 July 2005</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. I have only a passing familiarity with performance magic, so I'm not an authority; however a Google search for "'Ace Starry + magician" turns up only 356 hits, most of those small blurbs about his apparently semi-notable book. I'm leaning towards delete if only because he wrote the EnWiki article himself, but if it stays I won't rend my clothes in grief. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> 8 July 2005 22:39 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> - I wasn't really trying to "toot my own horn" when I added to your page. However, you've created a situation in which I feel the necessity to "<b>be bold</b>" as the guidelines suggest. While a search on Google using search terms "Ace Starry" and "magician" turns up "only 356" hits, (the guidelines suggest that 100 hits is reasonable) a search under "Ace Starry" brought up 722 hits. Almost half are referenced to the novel, but as is suggested in the guidelines an author who demostrates sales of over 5000 demonstrates sufficient public interest for inclusion. Though I have no way to demostrate exactly how many copies I've sold, my Japanese publisher alone may have sold that many copies. Note that many of the pages that come up are quotations and reviews in Japanese. Many are mentions from professional escape artist's pages. Some are fan linking pages.</li>
<li>It should also be of note that many of the pages include quotations from my book, done outside the US. User:astarry 12 July 2005</li>

<li>Those links are all to Wikipedia mirrors, or translations of the original Wikipedia article. That's the problem when you leave stuff around on Wikipedia for so long, it propagates. As for the link to to the article on Karaism, the Karaite movement has been around for at least 1300 years, so Karaism is indeed verifiable. However, that has nothing to do with "Talmidaism", which was apparently invented in the last 5 years by a couple of former Christians who met on the Internet, and who do not consider themselves to be Karaites. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 8 July 2005 20:17 (UTC)

<li>I meant the connection the article made when it stated a more conservative form of Karaism or Talmidaism. Another question what about their claim to Sefer Yeshua? <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalphin_2def.html" title="User:Falphin">Falphin</a> 8 July 2005 20:29 (UTC)</li>

<li>They can claim a connection to anything they want; they've added information about their movement to a number of articles.

<li><b>Comment</b> I began this article because I was asked to do so; when I saw how many people disliked its existence I tried to delete it; the article was restored within days. People around Wikipedia (in other articles) have made comments like, "It is not clear what Talmidaism stands for," or "Talmidaism has no clearly defined beliefs." So, I responded in those articles by giving clear, detailed, information. These were objected to, and the information promptly deleted. If people here consider that an article about a faith which teaches others to love one another, and to practice one's religion with humility and compassion, is an eyesore, then it might as well be deleted. As for myself, I would like to practice our faith in peace. Spirituality is not about persecuting and saying hateful things about those who wish to do good; it is about trying to get in touch with something greater than ourselves....PS the majority of the assumptions made here about us and our movement (even my personal biography) are incorrect. However, I have no inclination or desire to correct those assumptions, since they will probably be amended or deleted. This is the last post I will make anywhere on Wikipedia - but please do not think I harbour any bitterness; it is not our way. I wish you all long, prosperous and fulfilled lives. May God bless you all. Shalom and farewell to you all. Shmu'el ben Naftali, 20:58 13 July 2005 GMT</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not an individual's vanity fantasy. If the movement actually exists and uses this title, it belongs at Wikipedia, no matter how much we may disapprove of them.

<dd>Please don't confuse my calling the "Nazarene Karaites" stuff "rubbish" with my comments regarding the so-called Talmidi Jews. The Nazarene Karaites stuff was similar to this stuff, but <i>completely</i> unverifiable, since no such group ever existed except as a single person's concept, relayed through 2 other people into a WP article. Literally, "from my mind to another person's WP article". This group at least happens to exist. Be that as it may, however, the group is <i>not</i> noteworthy, for a number of reasons, including:
<ol>
<li>Their approach to scripture is not innovative</li>
<li>Their membership is miniscule</li>
<li>They're brand new</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>etc. As a little test (perhaps someone should take this up as a project somewhere), they have fewer than 1000 adherents and they're historically non-notable. Take the Samaritans on the other hand. There are only perhaps as many as 500 of them, but their sect has been around for 2500 years. There are whole libraries of material written about them, and museums dedicated to them. They're noteworthy. As of yet, these "Talmidi Jews" are not sufficiently notable <i>to warrant a Wikipedia article</i>. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 20:34, July 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The Talmidi approach to scripture is not innovative. It is based on Ebionite traditions going back to the 1st century. That relates back to my earlier point about why the article was contributed. It seems to me that the criteria for being "noteworthy" is highly POV here. --<a href="../../../o/v/a/User%7EOvadyah_f264.html" title="User:Ovadyah">Ovadyah</a> 21:50, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The sect is still small, that is true enough. Maybe you can relate to what it's like to be a despised minority. Perhaps the most noteworthy thing about the group is that modern-day Ebionites are finally standing up to discrimination. This article is the proof. --<a href="../../../o/v/a/User%7EOvadyah_f264.html" title="User:Ovadyah">Ovadyah</a> 13:33, 14 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Who despises or discriminates against these people? This article is not proof that anyone is "standing up", the more I look into it, the more it appears to be little more than sheer conjecture. There <i>are</i>, to be sure, modern groups of Ebionites, but no evidence that there exists any "loose grouping" called Talmidaism, nor "Talmidi Jews" as the article was first named.

<li>No, VFD is seeking community consensus. It can be taken out at any time on any article (unless obviously frivolous). Go VFD some of Jayjg and my contributions, and see how you fare.

<li>The issue is not in verifying their theological claims, but in verifying they exist, have a history, believe the things they say they do, are organized in a certain way, use specific holy books, have various rites, etc. from credible sources.

<dd>No, of course not. Anyone can put up a website claiming anything. The key here is to have independent confirmation of these claims, so that they can be verified.

I have no issue with the POV of this article; it seems written in a reasonably NPOV way, in that it attributes all beliefs to those who hold them. However, the majority of the article appears to be <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, that is, proposing a novel view of history.

<li>You seem to be negating yourself, Jayjg. If the article is "written in a reasonably NPOV way," why did you claim in your introduction that "most of the article is a POV re-write of Christian history?" When it comes to religion, it's kind of hard to verify your material. The only difference I can see between this article and the one on your religion is the popularity of the sect. --<a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZephram_Stark_ae5d.html" title="User:Zephram Stark">Zephram Stark</a> 21:08, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That's not a contradiction at all - the problem with the POV is not that it violates NPOV, but rather that it violates NOR. That is, the article itself admits its a POV re-write of Christian history, and since it cites that, it does not fall afoul of the NPOV policy.

As to your other point, I'm not sure what you mean when you say "<i>your religion</i>", but as I said above, it's easy enough to verify that most religions exist, have a history, believe the things they say they do, are organized in a certain way, use specific holy books, have various rites, etc. from credible sources. You can't do that here, because there are no verifiable sources on this. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:26, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> My name is Shemayah Phillips (Ebionite COmmunity) and I'd like to say that "Talmidaism" is not a large phenomenon, and a splinter group from my own. An addition to the Ebionite wiki page might be enough with a link. But I wish some more time was spent, and had been sent doing more research on both ancient and modern Yeshuine groups, and a more honest analysis of ancient Judaisms. Yes, JudaismS. Talmidaism should be mentioned for the simple reason that is part of a growing attitude taking place among people of Jewish background (often removed by generations due to forced baptism, cultural pressures, persecution, etc.) who are rediscovering their family's past (as I have, and many of the Ebionites, including many of Latin America of Marrano and Crypto-Jewish families). Additionally, gentiles are also seeking conversion to some form of Yahwism. Gentiles have always done so, even before the predominance of Judah or rabbinic Judaism. Symmachus was a Ebionite convert to Yahwism (since we have to be careful not to use the word Jew when not referring to the modern monopoly on Judaism). Not only this but the same people may be attending rabbinic synagogues, assisting missionized Jews to rejoin rabbinic communities, and various groups who "Judaize." The reason we know so little and must do the research today concerning Yeshuine groups, and Christianity is because of censorship and control of history by single POV people. So the notability of this small group may not be there, but the trend it is a part of certainly is, and Wiki has an opportunity in recording this. How, on what page/article, etc. is the question. Also some comments have been made concerning this group's relationship to "official" Judaism (i.e., Orthodox Judaism whose importance may also be a matter of non-objective POV). I do not know the Talmidi relationship with the Orthodox community other than some mention in these comments about hatred. The Ebionites are not recognized by the Orthodox community---officially. But rabbinic Jews have been present at b'rit milah for Ebionites as witnesses and to read blessings, and even people of Jewish background go through hatafat dam b'rit or milah. Ebionites have been assisted by Chabadniks against Christian missionaries, most recently collaborating in Latin America; Ebionites gladly take the grief from the Christian community for converting Christians to Judaism whether these become Ebionite, Qaraite (Karaite, if you prefer), or rabbinic Jews---while the rabbinic authorities can still maintain dialogue with the Christian community. Muslims have even helped Ebionites in combating Christian missionaries. I do not know how much of this could be true of the Talmidis, but know they take the same view concerning Christian missionaries. Now we are the most extreme of such groups (one missionary group called our site the most blasphemous ---to the Christian view-- on the Internet!&#160;;-)) Add to the phenomenon "Jewish Roots" groups and other Christian and former Christian Judaizing groups. As part of all this, Talmidaism is notable as one of the components. I think the short section on Modern Ebionites in "Ebionites" is appropriate. It says that there are people still practicing a form of Evyonut, and allows them to follow links. Maybe something similar, in an article discussing the modern Judaizing phenomenon would provide notice of Talmidaism, and other similar groups. But it is a disservice to vote them out of existence on Wiki because of more a censorship type response than objective expression. Also there is a problem concerning the difference between Nazarenes and Ebionites. Let me suggest a better way of looking at the problem than calling people Jewish-Christians, etc. Yeshuines (who were not Christians at all) were concerned with the man Yeshua (Jesus) as known from his life example and teaching. Paulines, and related groups like the Gnostics (Paulines or Pneumatics) were/are concerned with the resurrected Jesus (the Risen Christ) as revealed in visions and spiritual/mystical communication to Paul of Tarsus and others. Of course, I think the Pneumatics are full of it---but that doesn't matter because they sincerely believe in these revelations as much as we seek more rationally derived infomation. Ancient Nazarenes came to compromise to certain Pneumatic, Pauline doctrines. Some Ebionite later took up Gnostic/Pneumatic beliefs. I hve an article from a Christian biographical dictionary that makes this distinction (Ebionites Proper vs. Essene type Ebionites) well.</li>

<dd>For whatever it might be worth, I agree with you. There are indeed modern-day followers of the belief system espoused (according to Christian polemicists, at the very least) by the 3rd and early 4th-century Ebionites. This is a noteworthy phenomenon <i>in the context of the Ebionites article</i>. The terms "Talmidi Judaism" and "Talmidaism", however, have never, as far as I can find, ever been applied to such groups, collectively or otherwise, except for by one specific group of claimants to this tradition, who use the term gratuitously to describe everyone with whom they think they agree on theological and eschatological issues. Such sheer conjecture is <i>not</i> encyclopedic, hence my opposition to the continued inclusion of this article in WP. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 07:44, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I would just like to clarify something about the expression Talmidaism. This label was created by <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> because he could not bear to use the terms Talmidi Judaism and Talmidi Jews. I let it stand as a compromise with him in the course of editing the article. It's all explained on the Talk page. As far as the origin of the term Talmidi, it's a modern designation. It's inception and purpose are also explained on the Talk page, as an umbrella term to include more Yahwistic groups than the Ebionites. --<a href="../../../o/v/a/User%7EOvadyah_f264.html" title="User:Ovadyah">Ovadyah</a> 13:36, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>KEEP</b>The ebionites really did exist. Why would you want to do away with the truth that the Ebionites were Jews not worshippers of Jesus? The early church fathers speak of them and in a quite negative way. My guess is that the church attempted to erase them from history being that their writings no longer exist. What little we know about the movement 2000 years ago shows that they didn't accept the virgin birth, trinity, or the writings of Paul. Early followers of Yahshua were Jews. They weren't looking for a new religion but reform within their own. Any true studier of the scriptures will eventually come to realize that most of the church doctrines are nothing more than tales of pagan dieties transferred over to a man named Jesus/Yahshua. Those that birthed the religion known as Christianity voted these pagan stories in example: Council of Nicea. Gentiles find themselves extracted from the churches as they begin to question as they learn. This is a great article to show them that they are not the only ones out there. Many go on to convert to Judaism or to be Noachides. I think it would be ashame for this article to be removed. Bethany

<li><b>KEEP.</b> Bethany is an Ebionite from our group. She is giving her two cents, which looks to be one cent more than some. I think some editors take themselves a little too seriously. The one notable difference is from a few (Loremaster, Wetman?) who recognize that an attempt should be made to chronicle rather than suppress things they may not understand or have the scholarly background to tackle--like some of the Users. I vote Keep to make a point that some folks voting Delete are fabricating excuses based on something other than editorial issues. Also it is apparent to me that while a good number of written sources Ebionites were consulted, contemporary information was not checked. I had to make corrections as to the year we started, and a claim that I was a Baptist minister (!!!! Never&#160;!!!!) and this incorrect information is still mirrored and cached all over the internet. The way to improve Wiki is to research the information from actual living sources, rather than delete everything outside your experience. Loremaster (if he is responsible for Ebionites) took corrections I placed, while I tried not to place an ad, and presented them in a responsible way. I think something can be learned. What the hell is a sockpuppet? Sounds like adolescent slang for something derrogatory.

I am a member, but joined only to make a correction concerning the Baptist minister matter. I don't want to participate--not that these comments I have made would prove it--edit articles, etc. It was a means of correcting the info. in the Ebionite article.

Since I'm new here and I can't rename the title of my article just yet, can you please rename my article to <i>Dinosaurs: The Young Earth View and the Critic's Objections of it</i>?

Reading further, the article still has profound POV problems in at least several places.

<dd><b>Keep.</b> The author fixed the opening and has inserted some references. I believe this definately fall under the "don't bite the newbie" rule. Since the author is very willing to work to bring this article to acceptable standards, we should not delete it. The title, though, will have to change. Any suggestions?

<dd>On the contrary, I don't think my comment bites the newbies at all. And it still stands, since there are many parts of the article where the emphasis is clearly that the creationists are wrong, another example would be <i>"When confronted with the true notion, given out by critics, that plants do die after they are eaten, YECs would counter this"</i>. I still think that the article remains essentially POV original research. As for the references, they are so POV they almost need removing on the spot, saying "they don't mix" and calling it a "heresy". It's good that the author wants to improve it, but I think the article should be deleted and the author work on it in their userspace until it it can be made an article again. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 21:53, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree the article still has major POV issues. I recommended to the author that he keep working on the article--especially on the POV issues--even if it is deleted.

<dd>Yes, you're quite right. However, if <i>this</i> article text is deleted and the content recreated on another page, it would qualify for speedy deletion as reposted content. Hence my suggestion to copy it to the author's userspace, where this kind of thing is ok.

<dd>In that case, I believe the article should not be deleted. Why not give the author and others a chance to finish rewriting the piece, to achieve NPOV and so on? --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 14:05, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I disagree. It is an alphabetical list, and can be searched or tabbed easily; if one wishes to view all drugs songs, then one will simply have to confront the fact that there are many songs about drugs. Distinctions based on drug type seem arbitrary to me (other than, perhaps a distinction of legality to exclude alcohol, caffiene, and nicotine, which are widely legal, and substantially different in their level of social acceptability.) <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 02:29, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's already a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_about_drinking.html" title="List of songs about drinking">list of songs about drinking</a> to cover alcohol. Every list of songs about drugs I've ever seen, going back to the original Rock Source Book in the late 1970s, divided it by type of drug if it was specific.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 04:25, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>And that doesn't change the fact that it would still be way too long and unwieldy. Combine it into one list of songs about drugs, and I guarantee you that within a week the edit page will warn that it's getting too long and people on the Talk page will be talking about organizing separate lists for cocaine, marijuana, heroin etc.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 04:28, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, if you are arguing that a merged "drug" list wouldn't survive because of complaints from editors about its length, I'll defer to your judgment, because you have more experience with those editors. I'm afraid, though, that this will leave you with a harder case for VfD in the future.
