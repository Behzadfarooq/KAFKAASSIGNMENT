<li><b>Question/comment</b>. Why is it that profs have a "bar of notability" but pocket monsters, ingredients of <i>Wars Trek</i>, televangelists, people who run around after balls, etc., do not? I don't know Nick at all, but advances in steganography seem much more significant than the preceding stuff. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:33, 2005 May 15 (UTC)

<li>There are guidelines for most of these things you mention. The <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia%7EPok%C3%A9prosal_bd0f.html" title="Wikipedia:Poképrosal">Pokemon</a> issue is undergoing discussion right now.

People who run around after balls: typically, I've only seen well-known pro athletes get kept, though I haven't seen many athletes up for VfD, I must admit. There are a <i>lot</i> of professors out there, and Nick's only been one for a year or so. In the grand scheme of things, he's an obscure Pokemon. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 04:26, May 15, 2005 (UTC)

<li>True, but I think the real problem is not just the potential for articles on all living non-notable professors.

<li>Yep, and you can see how wonderful the article has become with the advantage of 2 years development. It's 3 sentences -- still barely a stub after 2 years.

<li><b>Delete</b> Non-notable, vanity page.

<li><b>Delete</b>. An associate professor with a few publications is not notable. There are thousands of these people--and yes, thousands more who are deceased. Also, since obscure academic publication is a requirement for an academic job, using publication as a "reason" for "notability" is a tautalogical argument. It's like saying a dog is notable for barking. C W Merchant 18:50, 16 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Question just how much input did Ahn and Hopper have in the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captcha.html" title="Captcha">captcha</a> project? I note at the Carnegie Mellon captcha project <a href="http://www.captcha.net/people/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.captcha.net/people/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> page they are listed as PI's along with <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manuel_Blum_e13f.html" title="Manuel Blum">Manuel Blum</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Langford_08f1.html" title="John Langford">John Langford</a> (It is strange that grad students would be listed with PI status). There are a lot of collaborators on this project too <a href="http://www.captcha.net/people/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.captcha.net/people/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, should they all be listed too (<a href="../../../u/d/i/Udi_Manber_e104.html" title="Udi Manber">Udi Manber</a> Nancy Chan Scott Crosby <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Fateman_840f.html" title="Richard Fateman">Richard Fateman</a> Brighten Godfrey Bartosz Przydetek Roni Rosenfeld Ke Yang)? There is a fine line between participating in a project and conceiving of the project. Conceiving the project does seem to be worthy of a wikipedia entry. Did Hopper and Ahn have imput with the conception of this project? <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> 17:40, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> for the same reason I'd vote to delete my parents if articles were created on them.

<li><b>Delete</b>. His website lists one journal paper that has merely been submitted, rather than accepted. Being published isn't adequate, being significantly published with papers that are attracting a high number of citations is the requirement. If you're judging on journal publications, I'd require a fairly hefty number of papers or citations - say 50 journal papers or one (as first author) with 100 citations as a minimum to consider being published (note, this is from a physics viewpoint, other subject areas may vary). Although even this can be well surpassed - one professor I've co-authored papers with has over 3000 papers to his name. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 20:55, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
