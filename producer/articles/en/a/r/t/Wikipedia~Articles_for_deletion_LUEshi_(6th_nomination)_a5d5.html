If you do <i>anything</i> other than examine the merits of the page in question, you are doing yourelf and the encyclopedia a serious diservice. GNAA is an excellent example of something that should be deleted but that people have allowed themselves to be led down the garden path to keeping.<br />

<li>Please try to assume good faith. I've reviewed the article and believe the content to be more than suitable enough for a project which aims to be the sum of all human knowledge.

<ul>
<li>Doesn't this project rather aim to be "an effort to create and distribute a multilingual free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language", to quote Jimbo, rather than the sum of all human knowledge? If it was to be the sum of all human knowledge then personal blogs would be allowable as entries, covering, as they do, aspects of human knowledge. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and an encyclopedia summarises primary <b>and</b> secondary sources. There are no secondary sources on this subject. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> doesn't get to be contradicted by a consensus in an afd. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 13:23, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Don't you think it's just as annoying to say "delete" a bunch of times? My point is <i>not</i> that you shouldn't say "keep" six times, just that saying "keep <b>because</b> we've done this six times" doesn't address the actual issue. If something is of a certain quality, looking at it a bunch of times won't change that. Deletion debates should be about the actual <i>article</i> not about the process. Saying "delete because I'm sick of this" would be equally bad. For myself, I think that repeated nominations are harmful, and that this venue isn't the way to discuss what to do with contentious articles. But when it's here, I'll speak my heart about what I think should be done. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000">brenneman</font></a><span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="#000000" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 06:05, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Outside of GameFAQs itself, how much attention has LUEshi gotten?

<li><b>Delete</b> There are a few questions to answer. Is this notable? I can say I have seen it on multiple internet forums, but it has never taken on a life of its own on them. Thus, it is merely the work of some LUEser(s) that need <a href="../../../l/a/r/LART_c186.html" title="LART">LARTing</a>. It is notable in the context of LUE, but not otherwise. In the previous AFDs people have compared it to other memes, so I will try to address them. <a href="../../../o/_/r/O_RLY_cbc4.html" title="O RLY">O RLY</a> has an article from a college newspaper and I remember seeing another article recently. It also was (or still is) a staple on many forums, be it 4chan, fark, slashdot, etc. Others compare it with the <a href="../../../o/s/-/OS-tan_f23e.html" title="OS-tan">OS-tans</a>. While I do not know of any sources for the phenomena, it spans many boards (in different counties and languages thanks to the kawaii! sugoi! people) along with a decent number of people cosplaying as them. I would say that it is certainly more notable, but without sources it should be deleted. People also mentioned the list of memes in <a href="../../../4/c/h/4chan.html" title="4chan">4chan</a>. It has since been removed (several times) from the article and I think <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_YTMND_fads_cae3.html" title="List of YTMND fads">List of YTMND fads</a> should also be deleted. Now to the topic at hand. We have an article on a subject of questionable notability with no sources. The answer is obvious, throw it out. Kotepho 20:33, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
