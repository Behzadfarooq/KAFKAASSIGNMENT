<p><b>Delete</b> This article was added by an anon with IP address 212.21.138.161 which is registered in Bulgaria, and cites a cranky web page in Bulgaria. The article evidently concerns the authors cranky personal views; certainly there is no "time relativity" known in physics.

<li>That's exactly it, and why I didn't vote - I do not fully understand the topic; however a quick search for "5 minutes explanation of Relativity" does bring up stuff that, to the untrained eye, certainly does look connected.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. As an aside: the essay does not even deliver what it promises. It <i>concludes</i> by saying "Is a 5 minutes explanation of Relativity possible? Yes, it is, if we use the time relativity." But "the time relativity" is never defined or explained. As nearly as I can tell, this is an <i>introduction</i> to a 5-minute explanation that is never actually delivered. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:12, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> I applaud the effort at an easy to understand introduction to relativity. This might qualify as a "trampoline" article, designed to introduce novices to advanced concepts, similar to <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity_for_beginners.html" title="Special relativity for beginners">Special relativity for beginners</a>. See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_General_Audience_b9fe.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject General Audience">Wikipedia:WikiProject General Audience</a>. As such, any flaws should be fixed and the article improved upon, rather than deleted. As for the time relativity line at the end, I believe that was meant as a joke. It can certainly be taken out. As for whether it was written by an anonymous I/P from Sophia, Bulgaria, I don't see how that disqualifies a contribution. As far as I know, Wikipedia has no policy excluding contibutions from certain locations or from anonymous contributors. If they are referencing themself, those refs should be taken out. In short, we may just be dealing with a newbie who doesn't know the rules, so let's show a little patience, please. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 22:39, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Stu, please keep your shirt on. The location information was simply to support my presumption that the anonymous edits were made by Marinchev. That is relevant because I was invoking <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> in nominating the article for deletion. I am about to add another comment further down which I hope you will take to heart.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 16:14, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If we assume that the last line is a joke, I still have to say I don't see the article as useful. It similar to stating Euclid's axioms and calling it a "5 minute explanation of geometry." Unless you happen to <b>be</b> a Euclid—or an Einstein—it doesn't really "explain" anything. So, yes, I applaud the effort, but I reject the article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:53, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>That's the issue, there's not much here we can use. So we have an article <i>idea</i> that might be fine, with content that has to be wholly rewritten and a title that has to be changed.

<dd>Stu, about <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_General_Audience_b9fe.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject General Audience">Wikipedia:WikiProject General Audience</a>, I am certainly one of those who has been raising the technical bar with my own contributions to the Wikipedia, but I don't disagree with the goals of that project unless your goals statment means "every article in Wikipedia should remain accessible <i>in its entirety</i> to a general audience". Actually, even then I might not disagree, since I am beginning to think that there may be case for Wikimedia forking the Wikipedia into a <i>populist general audience encyclopedia which anyone can edit</i>, as in the current Wikipedia model, and a <i>controlled content scholarly/scientific encyclopedia</i> which is <i>much less up-to-the-minute but much more reliable</i>, as in the Britannica model. However, in the short term, statistics seem to show that many of the most active and knowledgeable editors of the Wikipedia are involved in creating articles on highly technical topics, including physics topics, and in such articles, I advocate (following accepted encyclopedic practice) that the articles should <i>begin with a nontechnical summary accessible to a general audience</i>, and <i>subsequently introduce technical material as needed</i>, if possible with <i>monotonically increasingly technical demands</i>, after the Baez model of exposition.</dd>
<dd>In any case, while it might be beneficial to discuss such policy issues elsewhere (maybe on my talk page?), in the case at hand, the key point about why this particular article has been nominated for deletion was succinctly expressed by SCZenz: <i>there's not much here we can use</i>. Don't forget one of Einstein's own favorite sayings: a (theory, explanation) should be <i>as simple as possible, but no simpler</i>. What we have in this article is something so simplified it doesn't even make sense, not just to a physicist but even to a general audience member. Bearing this in mind, I hope you will reread the article and change your vote.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 16:14, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I would characterize the goal of the project as "every article in Wikipedia should be accessible <i>in its entirety</i> to a general audience, inasmuch as it is possible to do so without deleteing technical content. Introductions to articles which the general audience is likely to encounter should be accessible to a general audience, even if movement of technical content from the intro to the body is required." <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 17:21, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In other words, if the article is deleted, I won't revert it, not because I agree with the action, but because I respect the consensus. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 17:21, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It goes without saying that we all respect consensus, and I think more generally-accesible introductions are good. (Even my physics writing is designed to be generally readable.)

The <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity_for_beginners.html" title="Special relativity for beginners">Special relativity for beginners</a> article is decent, but lacks some of the historical references, such as to Newton and Galileo, which have been added to the new article.

I.e., put the general concept and historical information that covers the topic as a whole at "Theory of," and start getting down and dirty in the more specific articles (while, naturally, still providing the General Audiences versions in the introductions).

<dd>I don't think <i>simple</i> is the right place for this stuff, because it's a site for simple <i>language</i>, not necessarily simple ideas. (Actually it's pretty difficult to figure out what it's for, but I've already voted with my feet by not writing there.) However, I still don't understand your stance, StuRat; nobody's attacking the concept of a simple introduction, nobody's voting against the concept of a simple introduction, and deleting this article isn't getting rid of the concept of a simple introduction. Hell, I might work on a simple introduction to GR myself, if you like. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 02:06, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not just advocating a general audience intro, but an entire general audience article, in cases like this with a seemingly complex topic which has a name recognizable by the general public.
