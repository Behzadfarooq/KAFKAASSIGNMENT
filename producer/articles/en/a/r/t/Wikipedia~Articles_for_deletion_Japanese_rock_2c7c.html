<li><b>Keep</b> Is "stubbiness" really a valid reason to delete an article? Japanese rock has a history. It is distinct from rock music from other countries.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Well, some people say that the subject is notable (<i>contra</i> what it says at the moment), but without saying why.

<dd>I am not an expert on Japanese rock, but there are other aspects to consider beyond its stylistic differences. The history is unique to its country; for instance, how did rock develop in Japan and how was it received (both as a domestic and "imported" cultural aspect)? Rock in Japan is likely to have impacts on the country's culture that are unique. 206.213.209.31 19:01, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is a good point. We should also consider that there is a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Japan_9d4f.html" title="Music of Japan">Music of Japan</a> article, which has a rock section (longer than this stub) which links to this stub as the "main article." It briefly touches on rock music in Japan. I'm not sure what should be done to straighten it all out, but I wanted to bring that article <s>into consideration</s> to everyone's attention.

<li><b>Keep</b>, this is not a "Rock music in Japan" topic, this is about what has been called J-Rock for many years and what is often instantaneously recognizable as different from American or European rock.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> And it seems that this deletion was brought about by an unfortunate choice of words from an overzealous stubbification. There are a lot of articles in this group with no sources what-so-ever.

There are no qualities that mark any of the various national rock grops as a destinctive genre. But I'll quit my whining about why we're here.</li>

It's arrangements is also different from other genre of music", said Moon....JRock is unique among other genres of music, mostly due to its darktone in composition and the musical arrangements, while being quite melodious to sing.

<p>Aside from creating technological innovations in consumer electronics and automobiles, the Japanese are exceptionally good at packaging, said Salinee Panyarachun, the leader of the JPop Japanese club and a representative for Sony here. "This Japanese uniqueness adds an element of happiness and cheerfulness [to their products] that no other country could ever copy." .... Salinee of JPop club agreed. "Japanese pop culture does have some tendency towards violence, especially in comic books," she said, adding that Japanese rock bands are also quite violent.</p>

Did you read the quotes? They were comments on J-rock from places outside of Japan. This phenom is global in nature. "Rock in Japan" is an oversimplification of the topic.
