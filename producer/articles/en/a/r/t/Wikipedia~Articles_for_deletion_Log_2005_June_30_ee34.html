<li><b>Keep</b>. I've just rewritten the article - please re-read it. She is well above the notability bar for a college professor and historian. She currently holds an endowed chair at a major university (U. of Michigan) and was used to be a dean at another (U. Cal. Davis). Her book 'A Concise History of India' is well known and widely read in the field. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESheldrake_c777.html" title="User:Sheldrake">Sheldrake</a> 30 June 2005 20:28 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> based on the rewrite. Good job. By the way, the test for professors at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says "If the individual is more well known and more published than an average college professor, they can and should be included." At most American universities (if not all), far fewer than half of the professors occupy an endowed chair. By definition, virtually any professor in an endowed chair "is more well known and more published than an average college professor" because the professors who are less well known and less published than an average professor are not typically going to get the plum appointment. That doesn't mean that the author of the article shouldn't do his or her homework, however, just that it is likely that if you look into it, a professor with a named professorship does meet the test for inclusion. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 30 June 2005 20:54 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Cleanup</b>. In recent years, "quagmire" has become virtually synonymous with "failed war", and there should definitely be something in Wikiworld reflecting that usage. Since that's probably not appropriate for a dictionary because it's not the technical definition of the word, Wikipedia seems like the place to do that. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 30 June 2005 18:57 (UTC)

<li><s><b>No vote</b></s> I'm not sure outright deletion is called for since the political usage of the term is quite common, but the article has little potential to be more than a dicdef.

<li><b>Delete</b> This is dicdef for sure. I have yet to see how this article adds to the usefullness of the WP other than a dicdef which is grounds for deletion. Perhaps if the authors could create a list of quagmires, with the history of the term, and perhaps a VfD argument here to keep it; there might be a case.

<dd>a lot of people have been putting vfd tags on articles before they put cleanup tags on them, or post to the article's talk page. generally, if someone starts a bogus article in the namespace of a valid topic, i thinkwe should try to fix it before we move to delete it--especially now that we're expected to argue a case for recreating an article with the same name as a deleted article.</dd>

<li><b>Keep Weak</b> It rests on the fringe between dictdef and a genuine article. It needs expansion to move my <b>Keep Weak</b> to a general <b>Keep</b>. A suggestion would be to relate the article to other retirement articles. Retirement-related articles will probably get more popular as American and UK baby boomers start to retire, and this is an appropriate stub article until then. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">Inigmatus</a> July 1, 2005 22:29 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. There is apparently some substance here although the date of the Washington Post article is incorrect. A search of the Washington Post archives for "craig spence" in 1989 turns up an article on Nov. 12, 1989 titled "Craig Spence, Figure in D.C. Sex Case, Found Dead in Boston" and other news coverage earlier in the year. (Search at <a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/advancedsearch.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/advancedsearch.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.)

<p>I believe the Craig Spence story was "broken" in the Washington Times. This was also of interest as the Washington Times had always been a "conservative" paper. Many believe it was a way for Rev. Moon to get the attention of the Republicans in the White House at the time and gain support for the Unification Church.

<li>This may divert from the topic under immediate discussion but Who's Who long ago removed their prohibition on those with serious criminal convictions from appearing, on the explicit basis that the criminal are often no less distinguished than the law-abiding. The old DNB had one or two articles, which included the famous example of Eugene Aram whose article began "Eugene Aram, criminal, born 17..". The new Oxford DNB has many more notorious figures in it including some semi-fictional and others such as Jack the Ripper whose identity is unknown. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> <a href="../../../a/r/m/Image%7EArms-westminster-lb.jpg_d0e3.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/2/21/Arms-westminster-lb.jpg/25px-Arms-westminster-lb.jpg" alt="" width="25" height="19" longdesc="../../../a/r/m/Image%7EArms-westminster-lb.jpg_d0e3.html" /></a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 30 June 2005 19:21 (UTC)</li>

<li>As far as I am aware no-one has a written a proposal on the extent and form of the overlap of 'pedia and 'news.

<li>Wikinews relies upon Wikipedia for what, in other news services, would have to be explicitly supplied <i>background</i> articles. It's one of the strengths of Wikinews that it has an encyclopaedia, a dictionary, a list of quotations, and so forth ready to hand to call upon, which other news services do not.

<li><b>No vote.</b> The original text of this article before its first deletion read "I want to find out the names of the Presidents of England." A case can be made that if one user was trying to look up the names of the presidents of England, then others might. It's a plausible mistake by someone poorly informed or U.S.-centric or both, and arguably it's useful to have some kind of dab or redirect in place, much as we do for frequent or plausible typos. It's not a very strong case. The biggest problem is I'm not sure why they would be likely to type "President of the United Kingdom" rather than "President of England" (or, given assumptions about the kind of user doing the typing, "Prezident of Ingland.") I don't care whether the article is deleted or not, so no vote. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 30 June 2005 16:40 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd be concerned if we started accepting all articles for all possible mis-spellings, misconceptions and mispronounciations. That would open up an infinite, and unhelpful, article space.

<li><b>Merge</b> per Carnildo, to keep the school inclusionists happy... though truthfully, a separate wiki for schools would be a whole lot more useful than turning Wikipedia into a <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html" title="WP:WWIN">web directory of schools</a>. If a school isn't well-known out of state, or at the center of a national news story, it's not notable enough to receive its own article. Universities are notable because in the job market and academia, they receive much more recognition than schools below them do. Schools below university level should just be mentioned in passing with their city, just as shopping malls, libraries, etc., are.

<li>"Inclusionist" is Wikipedia slang for those bent on including every possible scrap of trivia under the heading "knowledge" (as opposed to "deletionists", who are intent on slash-and-burn censorship throughout Wikipedia to leave ignorance and darkness in their wake). Or something like that.</li>
<li>Schools seem to touch a particular nerve, whereby people who might argue strenuously against inclusion of people who lack strong evidence of fame, accomplishment, and/or notoriety suddenly , when it comes to schools, confuse Wikipedia with the Special Olympics, where EVERY school is special regardless of its fame, accomplishment, and/or notoriety. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 1 July 2005 05:37 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Jessamyn is noted in the library world primarily as a blogger, and also as an ALA Councilor (she just finished her three year term). I am in the library world, and I have never heard of Michael Lorenzen. If you want to use a Google test, I think you will find there is no comparison between Jessamyn West and Michael Lorenzen on that basis. (You might check my results as well - "rory litwin" - and you will see the kind of results a non-notable can get in the library world.) Michael Lorenzen is one of thousands in the library world in terms of notability. Lots of people write articles. If you look at Jessamyn's articles for deletion discussion, you'll see that it was close, and a deciding fact seems to have been that she was selected as one of a dozen or so bloggers invited to attend the 2004 Democratic National Convention as bloggers in the press corps. So, it seems to me that Jessamyn survived the articles for deletion vote mainly because of her notability as a blogger. She was one of the earliest bloggeres and is very well known in the profession for that. There aren't any other Wikipedia articles on contemporary librarians who are as non-notable as Lorenzen; his article is really an exception, in my opinion. The others are either actual professors, ALA past-presidents, historical figures, etc. <a href="../../../r/l/i/User%7ERlitwin_4943.html" title="User:Rlitwin">Rlitwin</a> 13:22, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, I don't think 64 hits in Google Scholar meets the professor test. Compare professor <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathleen_McCook_a337.html" title="Kathleen McCook">Kathleen McCook</a>, who I think is notable in the library world. (kathleen mccook library gets 292 hits in google scholar.) <a href="../../../r/l/i/User%7ERlitwin_4943.html" title="User:Rlitwin">Rlitwin</a> 13:57, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, most of Lorenzen's articles were published in state and local publications, not national publications. He is probably very well known locally and somewhat known nationally, but notability requires a little more in an encyclopedia, IMO. <a href="../../../r/l/i/User%7ERlitwin_4943.html" title="User:Rlitwin">Rlitwin</a> 14:06, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Keep</i>, sort of. Focus on the Family radio productions are widely syndicated, sold in Christian bookstores, and series such as "Adventures in Odyssey," which already has its own page, have many fans outside of religion, merely because of the stories and voice acting. And many of their productions, like "Anne of Green Gables," are non-religious (though family oriented), and I seem to recall the latter being syndicated outside of Christian radio stations as well. Speaking as a radio fan/scholar and how few radio dramas are produced in the US these days, it's probably notable enough for an article. One might argue that it be merged with the general <a href="../../../f/o/c/Focus_on_the_Family_c475.html" title="Focus on the Family">Focus on the Family</a> page, but that focuses on the organization's religious agenda and history, so I think a seperation is not uncalled for. However, I agree, it would *definitely* need strong cleanup to avoid the vanity, the POV religious statements, provide more actual information and history, and of course, the lower-case. Sorry for going on, so, I guess keep if someone actually volunteers or is able to fix it within a short period; otherwise delete and let someone start a new page with the proper title and info. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAleal_7f5c.html" title="User:Aleal">Aleal</a> 30 June 2005 21:08 (UTC)</li>

<p>Consensus is obviously to keep. Let me point out, though, that Wikipedia is still too young (at 4 years old) to have created a policy on articles about contributors who are somewhat well-known outside of Wikipedia. I only know of 2 or 3 other notable people who have contributed, like that guy who started <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disinfopedia.html" title="Disinfopedia">Disinfopedia</a> and some minor gay celebrity.

<li>NB. The nominator of the previous VfD didn't actually vote, so there were only 4 votes, of which 3 were "keeps" which <i>would</i> be a consensus (and <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> should not have edited the closer's conclusion in the archive to change it to "no consensus"). However, I would feel the same way if it survived a 3:2 vote that was called no consensus.

<li>Just to show my good will, here are some hints: was he elected to lead some organizations/committees, etc? Are his articles frequently quoted (as opposed, to plain graphomaniacs)?

<li>Its not "someones" POV. Its my POV, of course. Its a direct quote from me, hence entirely appropriate in the article. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 2005-07-03 21:00:42 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am really bothered by the fact that Connolley has contributed to the article. He really shouldn't, and it weakens his position here in voting on this VfD, as it brings with it the suggestion of vanity. Secondly, I read over the link Dunc provided, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia_talk%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_Academics_ec11.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Criteria for inclusion of biographies/Academics">Wikipedia_talk:Criteria for inclusion of biographies/Academics</a>. It is not an official policy nor an official guideline, indeed, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a> merely describes it as an alternative test that has been proposed. VfDs like this one always confuse me. Jimbo states that the 2 primary rules are <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Connolley appears to be entirely verifiable, and the article does not actually read like vanity, per se. I really wish WP had a stronger set of <i>official</i> guidelines for situations like this. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func"><tt>func</tt></a><a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func"><tt>(talk)</tt></a> 1 July 2005 17:24 (UTC)

<li>What makes it worse is that, as Wm Connolley has admitted to me, Ed Poor created the article in order to bolster his position in a Wikipedia edit war somewhere on <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_environment_change.html" title="Global environment change">global environment change</a>. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 2 July 2005 10:51 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - for involvement in "Real Climate" alone he is more notable than a minor Pokemon character or an episode of DS9. His pubs make him (look) more notable than the "average" colllege professor (since this is based on American standards, and third author on a <i>Science</i> paper blows most of them out of the water). <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 1 July 2005 22:18 (UTC)</li>

I think WMC is notable for his position as a scientist involved in public advocacy (e.g. <a href="../../../r/e/a/RealClimate_de5a.html" title="RealClimate">RealClimate</a>), but I would really appreciate seeing something more tangible than a list of publications for the purpose of establishing notability as a scientist.

This article is supported by a book, a movie, a nonprofit organization, and provides a well known example for new Wikipedia general categories of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monetary_reform.html" title="Monetary reform">monetary reform</a>, and <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_reform.html" title="Tax reform">tax reform</a>. Modeled after the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_tax.html" title="Fair tax">Fair tax</a> article, it could be submitted that this article on NESARA be split into two articles: one about the NESARA internet hoax, with a reference to the legitimate version; and then a seperate article about the legitimate NESARA bill itself as currently under review by the Presiden't Commission for Tax Reform at www.taxreformpanel.gov; and presented to many congress persons over the last decade. I am currently not aware of any Wikipedia litmus test for legislative proposals as being limited only to proposals that are submitted to congress and have a bill number. Though some NPOV issues are raised due to the lack of arguments against NESARA, that can easily be addressed by expanding the appropriate section.--<a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">Inigmatus</a> 30 June 2005 22:28 (UTC).</li>

<dl>
<dd>The article is now split into two</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I split the article into two, one for the conspiracy theory, one for the legislative proposal. I was uncomfortable with this information being mushed together in one article from the onset, and this makes so much more sense. Especially now that it's being considered for deletion, and the reasons for or against deleting one are so much more different from the arguments for and against deleting the other. So this discussion is on deleting the article containing information on the legislative proposal. I vote AGAINST deleting it, but I do think it really needs to be compressed to about 20 percent of its current size, and needs more balance. - <a href="../../../s/e/d/User%7ESednar_f2f1.html" title="User:Sednar">sednar</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/d/User_talk%7ESednar_585c.html" title="User talk:Sednar">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_sednar_f708.html" title="Special:Contributions/sednar">contribs</a>)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> both articles -- this, so that there is a "fair comment" NPOV articel on NESARA, for those who want to know about it; and the <i>conspiracy/hoax</i> page so that people who hear about it can find out the (relatively NPOV, though Ms.Goodwin would not agree) objective view of NESARA-the-patent-nostrum --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 1 July 2005 07:08 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete both</b>, not significant enough for more than a brief mention in an article about social engineering projects proposed by minor non-governmental organisations. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 1 July 2005 07:16 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> both, especially after the split. In the legislative sense, NESARA does seem to one of the thousands of proposals. Regardless of one's opinions about the viability of the proposal, it is now very <i>famous</i> proposal in some circles, connected to <a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">hoaxes</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraud.html" title="Fraud">fraud</a>, etc. If somebody would come to WP looking for information about it, these articles can really clear things up. No doubt there is the usual risk that pro-NESARA folks will try to vandalize them to adovacate their POV, but it has not lead to deletion of even more controversial places. - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 1 July 2005 10:06 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Cleanup</b>, MASSIVELY.

<li>Some random person drafting a bill and publishing it on the Internet does not mean Congress has ever considered or will ever consider it, any more than if you or I did the same. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 1 July 2005 19:34 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First NESARA was drafted in 1991 before the internet. It's in a published book called "Draining the Swamp", a movie is being made of the hoax version of it, and it is under official review by the <a href="../../../p/r/e/President%27s_Advisory_Panel_for_Federal_Tax_Reform_add2.html" title="President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform">President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform</a> at <a href="http://www.taxreformpanel.gov" class="external free" title="http://www.taxreformpanel.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.taxreformpanel.gov</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Second, I was not aware that entry on the offical <a href="../../../t/h/o/THOMAS_c2a4.html" title="THOMAS">THOMAS</a> Congressional record was a WP requirement for a legislative proposal, let alone a litmus test for such an article's removal. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">Inigmatus</a> July 1, 2005 20:18 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trolling accusations are inappropriate; <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. The thing is that I don't believe there <b>is</b> any "legitimate" NESARA bill. Sure, a few private citizens in a country of 250 million people might support such a bill, but that doesn't make it a bill "under consideration by Congress." Therefore, there should only be one article, discussing the conspiracy theory surrounding this phantom bill, and it should be under the <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_bc4d.html" title="NESARA">NESARA</a> label. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 1 July 2005 19:30 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good faith assumed, if not trolling, then certainly the reasons for VfD seem to be a matter of POV regarding the article's validity. One only need check out the references to be convined the validity of the article and its necessity in a public encyclopedia. If you wish to propose a change to VfD guidelines, feel free to do so. Currently, there is no rule limiting articles on proposed legislation to only articles submitted in the Congressional <a href="../../../t/h/o/THOMAS_c2a4.html" title="THOMAS">THOMAS</a> record. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">Inigmatus</a> July 1, 2005 20:40 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please demonstrate that the President is actually reviewing this bill, beyond simply linking me to a generic government agency website. Otherwise, a legislative proposal that has never been, and most likely will never be, actually considered by a legislative body is not notable. The conspiracy theory, however, is. Article should reflect that. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 1 July 2005 20:30 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In an email received by Dr. Harvey F. Barnard on May 2, 2005, he told me he has spoken with the Vice-Chair of the panel, former US Senator <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Breaux_0c48.html" title="John Breaux">John Breaux</a> from his home state of Louisianna, and sent him a copy of the book "Draining the Swamp" at John's request. I can provide this email, if necessary.<a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">Inigmatus</a> July 1, 2005 20:41 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay; reasonable minds may differ at this point. I suspect Mr. Breaux was simply being polite&#160;;-) However, I cannot prove a negative and prove that Congress will <i>never</i> consider it; that would be impossible. Still, evaluating how truly radical the bill is and what little solid evidence there is IMO that it truly is a "legislative proposal" in the sense of anyone in the legislature actually caring about it, I still maintain that the proposal itself is not notable, and that the <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_bc4d.html" title="NESARA">NESARA</a> article need discuss the proposal only in the context of the notable conspiracy theory. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 1 July 2005 20:50 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you can explain what makes the bill any more radical than the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, or the FairTax Act of 2005, and therefore not worthy of inclusion in WP; if not only to serve as an article of reference from which a large internet hoax was based from? At this point, I am sure you can agree we are merely discussing a POV difference on the merits of the bill. We are really not talking about its legitimacy, or validity, or about any particularly applicable VfD WP deletion rule. Splitting this article was the most appropriate solution to the debate between text overload, and I agree that the <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_bc4d.html" title="NESARA">NESARA</a> article could use some better summarization, but no more I would expect than to see in <a href="../../../f/a/i/FairTax_e056.html" title="FairTax">FairTax</a>. Because there is no real VfD rule infringed here that can not be addressed by its splitting, I would appeal to the community to consider this VfD irrelevant and closed. Of course, in the spirit of the community, I'd still like to hear of any recommendations for cleanup of these split articles, if you feel they need it. After all, this is wiki.&#160;:)<a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">Inigmatus</a> July 1, 2005 20:58 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agree that article "to serve as an article of reference from which a large internet hoax was based" is appropriate; see my "cleanup" vote above. Disagree that we're not discussing applicable VfD WP deletion rules when, IMO, one of the subjects of the two NESARA-related articles is not notable.

<li>Put as briefly as possible, and listing only the most obvious reasons, the proposal is crackpottery because: it is written by one individual, an autodidact, and promoted through an organization that is purely web-based; it has been around for years and has not found a single legislative sponsor; the bill and its promotional literature uses the lingo of fringe groups such as tax protesters, survivalists, and marginal populists.

<li>First, may I remind you that it is the reason the hoaxters coopted the draft that it has a hard time finding Congressional support, and second the "lingo" is used by supporters of the FairTax and other tax reform proposals that have Congressional sponsorship. I think you present a weak case on it being "crackpot" so far. Besides being crackpot, I still don't see how it yet has to violate a Wikipedia deletion rule.

</ul>
</li>
<li>I'll also offer the following as further support for the proposition that the NESARA proposal is crackpottery, on the related principles of "the company they keep" or "by their fruits shall ye know them." It was posted on a NESARA discussion board <a href="http://www.thewordfiles.com/nesara/index.php/topic,19.0.html" class="external text" title="http://www.thewordfiles.com/nesara/index.php/topic,19.0.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> by a supporter of the NESARA proposal, and it pertains to the Terri Schiavo (or Terri Schindler Schiavo, depending on your POV) fuss of a few months ago:</li>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><i>An innocent woman has been publically executed after 13 days of court-ordered torture. Our judicial system has failed the higher law. The other two branches of government should have followed the higher law, just as people disobeyed the Nazi order to not harbor Jews during WWII. At the very least, if NESARA was law, it would have helped foster a culture of governmental honesty and openness that could have shed the light on the conflict-of-interests so rampant in this case - and maybe even prevented her murder by court-ordered dehydration. May she become a martyr for real change.</i></p>

<li>I think you're getting desperate, and still have yet to prove its crackpottery. You've gone to fishing on my message board and all you can find is some obscure quote I wrote on my own message board months ago. Besides, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that in a government were honesty is fostered as a culture, that it would also permeate its judicial system, and that in principle, had such honesty been more forthcomming in the Shiavo case, the judge would have been pressured to recuse himself from it due to his conflicts of interests in the case. And no one will say it's "crackpot" to believe government should try to be more honest with its citizens. If you think this is a crackpot comment, well, ... I let your beliefs stand for what they are. You make the case against yourself, and fail to align your previous statement as having anything remotely to do with this VfD - and I might add, your statements about my own quote are way off this topic. Besides, I have yet to meet another NESARA supporter who shared my particular view in that quote anyways, so you have yet to make a case that even NESARA supporters in general are crackpots (or even myself for that matter).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On a related note, just because you deem maybe one supporter of the bill a crackpot (which you still can't prove), doesn't mean the bill itself is crackpot, which is what you have yet to prove - and is the point of this VfD discussion - and is what I'm still waiting to hear. You should judge the idea on its own merit, and let it stand by itself, for the article is not about me, nor about you, but about an NPOV on a bill responsible for one of the most well-known internet hoaxes still ongoing. I'm still waiting, and I'm sure those following this conversation are still waiting to hear a valid case too. We're at day 5 of this VfD and still you have not presented a valid case for deletion. If you have no further response in regards to the merits of this bill, and can't produce valid arguments in favor for its deletion according to the WP Deletion Guideliens, then I rest my case. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">Inigmatus</a> July 5, 2005 18:55 (UTC)

<li>As I've stated repeatedly, I haven't taken a position on whether this article should be deleted or kept, so it's not really accurate to say I'm "desperate" one way or the other. I've only posted a bit of information and commentary and it's all seeming to take on a life of its own. Based on Inigmatus' last post immediately above, I'm more convinced than ever that NESARA is one of the crackier pots around.

<li>And back to something that does actually have to do with this VfD discussion: <i>NESARA is not a bill</i>. Until it gets introduced in Congress by an actual member of that august body, and thereby becomes a <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_%28proposed_law%29.html" title="Bill (proposed law)">bill</a> and acquires some notability, NESARA is simply somebody's idea (good or bad).

</ul>
</li>
<li>Just a note on notability - I posted this to the other vfd page too - I did a lexis/nexis search for the word "nesara" -- fulltext, not just titles -- for all dates available and found only one use of the word, in a letter to the editor from 2001 written by some guy in denver. That seems to be very non-notable. And the creator of this page keeps insisting that this is one of the "most popular internet hoaxes" which first should have no bearing on the page about the economic theory but second is simply not true; there is nothing about it in the Snopes urban legends database. So I am even more convinced now that this article and the other one refer to items that are not yet notable in any significant way.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 5 July 2005 20:09 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think there is some confusion in terminology that it would be as well to make an effort to clear up, involving the three distinct concepts of (1) Internet hoax; (2) Internet scam; (3) <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tin-foil_hat.html" title="Tin-foil hat">tin-foil hat</a> delusions. Concept (1) is the kind of thing you find on snopes, like the tourist on the World Trade Center with the airplane heading at him. Those are spoofs deliberately manufactured to amuse or deceive. Neither NESARA item ("Dr." Barnard's idea nor the "secret bill to be announced imminently which will pay off all our mortgages with space alien currency") is that. The NESARA item in this VfD—Inigmatus' NESARA, found at <a href="http://www.nesara.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nesara.org" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>—is very marginally concept (3) and does not appear at all to be concept (2). The "other" NESARA item—Dove of Oneness's ravings at <a href="http://www.nesara.us" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nesara.us" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>—is very heavily concept (3) with a bit of concept (2) showing up as well. If either one is notable, or delete-worthy, it's for different reasons.</li>

<li>It's just a bill, not a law. There are many thousands of bills every year. We neither need nor want articles on every one of them. Worse, it's not even a bill yet. It's an unsponsored "draft proposed bill" which, if the article is to be believed, espouses a fundamentally flawed theory about money. Unless someone can show much better evidence that this proposed bill is getting considerable public discussion or that NESARA has entered the public discourse, I have to vote "delete". <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 6 July 2005 00:32 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you can back up your statement that the article espouses a "fundamentally flawed theory of money"? The hoax about serves as the appropriate level of public discourse. The purpose of this ariticle re-make was to make it clear to seperate the two since it would be in the public's best interest in investigating the hoax/scam or the proposed bill.168.103.83.38 6 July 2005 04:37 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can but it's not relevant to the discussion because being a "fundamentally flawed theory" is not a deletion criterion. My comment was an opinion that I probably should have reserved to the article's page. The only relevant question to the deletion debate is whether or not this theory (flawed or not) is sufficiently in the public debate or historical record to justify an encyclopedia article. So far, I have seen insufficient evidence.

<li>Comment: If this article is deleted, the related articles Harvey F. Barnard, <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_Institute_416c.html" title="NESARA Institute">NESARA Institute</a> and the incorrectly named [[[Dr. Harvey F.

<li>I agree these should be deleted too. I looked on lexis/nexis again and "Harvey F. Barnard" gets 0 hits; "Harvey Barnard" gets two but neither are relevant (a name in a long list of names). I also note that Inigmatus is the user who uploaded that photo and there is no copyright information on it; I wonder if it is from a private collection and this is some sort of vanity page? The page says he died in May so Inigmatus probably is not Dr. Barnard himself though. I'm curious to see how Inigmatus responds next.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 6 July 2005 00:59 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The information taken from the NESARA Institute website is public domain, and I did post verbatim the bill description since it did a better job than I could have. Thanks for cleaning the article up. Guys, look, I'm not out to defend the thing to the death, I'm just pointing out that there is relevant information that this article, and now the split article also addresses in full what I think is perfectly within the public information scope of this wikipedia. This article was originally about the <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_conspiracy_theory_ff93.html" title="NESARA conspiracy theory">NESARA conspiracy theory</a> and I thought I was doing a public service by pointing out that it was based from an original bill proposal that does have merit, and it would serve the public interest to know the difference.</dd>
<dd>Unfortunately, I can't motivate hoax and urban legend websites to update their information as easily as I can wikipedia. If you advocate for the deletion of this article, then you're advocating for something that goes against the founding idea of this wiki: namely the suppression of relevant information. It doesn't matter who or what I am, (but I'm not with the NESARA Institute, and I'm not Dr. Barnard). I like the NESARA proposal, and I spent three days pouring over the information after first hearing about it from WorldNetDaily to see if this guys was legit or crackpot. I found he was legit. Moreover, when I spoke and corresponded with him just weeks before he died, the more I realized this guy has faced an uphill battle since the hoax came out in force 5 years ago. After taking the time to read his recently published book, which was also requested by members of the <a href="../../../p/r/e/President%27s_Advisory_Panel_for_Federal_Tax_Reform_add2.html" title="President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform">President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform</a>, I offered to do what I could to set the public record straight wherever I found it, so when people start looking for it they don't see only info about some hoax, but also info about the legit bill. Now I see just how fustrating his own work was in this regard as I find people here in WP who without researching the issue simply now want to delete an article I modified with info about the legit bill, and so also now delete an entire article that has stood uncontested for over a year.</dd>
<dd>Granted, this is wiki, and mercilessly information is modded and changed. However, I will do what I can to keep this relevant public information up in respect to a dying man's wish, and available to the pitifully duped uninformed NESARA community that has sprung up around the hoax version, and available to the public and Congress persons that NESARA is more than just a lame hoax, but is based off of something that is legit, and the public would like to be informed if they too knew there was a difference. There, I've said my two cents. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">Inigmatus</a> July 6, 2005 04:38 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think there is enough substance and bare notability to the NESARA proposal to warrant an article of about two paragraphs, but certainly not more. If the article is slashed to that length (a task I may undertake, though not imminently) my vote would be <b>keep</b>. But as others have pointed out, the decision is bound up with the decision on the <i>other</i> NESARA article, the one dealing with the conspiracy-theory version of this proposal, which I personally don't have the will to deal with as just reading it makes me ill. -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 6 July 2005 05:05 (UTC)

<dd>I agree and re-iterate my vote to keep. I expect the possibility of a minor editing war that might settle on something slightly longer eventually (which I won't take part in, my interest is with the <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_conspiracy_theory_ff93.html" title="NESARA conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a>), but it accomplishes Inigmatus's apparent goal of distinguishing the proposal from the conspiracy theory and providing some background on the legislative proposal that originated the whole thing. -- <a href="../../../s/e/d/User%7ESednar_f2f1.html" title="User:Sednar">sednar</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/d/User_talk%7ESednar_585c.html" title="User talk:Sednar">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_sednar_f708.html" title="Special:Contributions/sednar">contribs</a>)</dd>
<dd><b>Consensus Reached</b> I like the changes too. My edits would be to only add about two or three NESARA bill specific terms to the paragaphs. Otherwise, EDM go ahead and update the page with the changes, as it appears now there is a consensus. If no one else objects, I consider this VfD resolved in favor of Keep with EDM's revision.

<p>The current article is awful, not listing any sources whatever and just presenting a list as a fait accompli. That in itself is not sufficient reason to delete. However, the <i>impossibility</i> of creating an accurate list (let alone keeping it up to date) precludes this from ever becoming a useful article. Please refer to the Biggest-selling female musician article, and you will find that it is not even clear who should be number one on any such list, with at least five possible contenders! Compiling an accurate list of the top 10 bestsellers while it is so contentious as to who should occupy the number one slot (and this is not a dispute that is easy to resolve, depending greatly on both the definitions and sources being used) is simply impossible. If anything, the article ought to be replaced with a redirect to Biggest-selling female musician. I do not see that an accurate and verifiable list can ever be produced. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 30 June 2005 23:11 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Well, the reason why there is a double jeopardy provision in real life is because if you commit a crime, the nature of the crime cannot be changed in the future. However, an entry <b>can</b> be changed for the worse, and/or an initial VfD may have been so inundated with sockpuppets or abusive behaviour as to be useless. So I see nothing inherently wrong with multiple VfDs. There's a six month gap between this VfD and the last.

<li><b>Weak delete - but bordering on weak keep</b> - the linked website indicates that he's had an awful lot of small things published <a href="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/Publications/" class="external text" title="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/Publications/" rel="nofollow">(listed here)</a>, including book chapters, but no books. Still, that strikes me as a more significant body of work than the average prof.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> based on article, but probably a clearer keep if it would be expanded. His name gets 8,860 Google hits, at least the first few of which all appear to concern the correct SR, and he is a professor at a German university, which automatically puts him a few pinholes above the "average college professor" level. Also: "In 1999 Rahmstorf was awarded the $ 1 million Centennial Fellowship Award of the US-based James S. McDonnell foundation."<a href="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/cv.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/cv.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> Is that award something they give to anyone? <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 1 July 2005 08:22 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - obviously. Mikka, is there some malice in these VFDs? [Also: added some pubs. 9 pubs in Nature/Science is fairly good going]. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 2005-07-01 09:07:11 (UTC).

<li>I think there must have been some discussion concerning the criteria for keeping a particular professor, but I can't find it on the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Policy_consensus_Conclusions_efa6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Policy consensus/Conclusions">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Policy consensus/Conclusions</a> page. Nor can I find any criteria concerning notability on the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> or the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> pages. So I can't locate a clear policy regarding whether a particular professor should be kept or not. Personally I'm in favor of keeping any pages that are of good quality and have a decent and interesting information content.
