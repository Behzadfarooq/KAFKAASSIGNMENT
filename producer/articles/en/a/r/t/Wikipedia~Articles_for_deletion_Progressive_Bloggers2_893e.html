<li><b>Comment - The 'Inaccurate Comment' Above is Inaccurate, + other information</b> The Progressive Bloggers represents all types of political stripes - not just socialists. There are Liberal blogs in the group, NDP (or socialist) blogs, Green Party Blogs. The majority of the affiliates however, are unaffiliated with any Party in Canada and have joined because they consider themselves to be progressive thinkers or progressive in their politics. Progressive Bloggers is a group aggregate of the centre-left blogs in Canada. The group was started on May 1 and already has 100+ members (111 to be precise as of this writing). I would assert that the fast growth alone would show that the group has growing influence in the Canadian blogosphere. The site was also mentioned by The Toronto Star's media watcher/critic Antonia Zerbasias in a web-log she wrote online here: <a href="http://thestar.blogs.com/azerb/2005/05/blogarrhea.html" class="external text" title="http://thestar.blogs.com/azerb/2005/05/blogarrhea.html" rel="nofollow">Blogarrhea</a>. I will note that as I'm one of the founding members of the site's concept and creation, I've got an obvious conflict of interest and will not vote 1 way or the other on whether to keep or kick the entry... just providing some additional information to the Wilkpedia Community - Scott Tribe</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In Canada the Conservative Party is left of center politically, The Liberal Party is deemed socialist/fascist, the NDP is considered outright communist and the Greens are the same socialist/fascist mix as the Liberals with the exception of a stronger affinity for the environment and a special somkable herb. All three of the parties mentioned above fall into the "socialist" category. This conservative is showing interest only because of the posts on this site: <a href="http://www.simonpole.ca/" class="external free" title="http://www.simonpole.ca/" rel="nofollow">http://www.simonpole.ca/</a> where the author is begging his readers to support his submission. In order to be fair and balanced I'm providing a different point of view. I believe that the submission should stand or fall on it's merits and not stand solely because it was voted on by members of the aforementioned "socialist" group.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> To verify the character and importance of Progressive Bloggers, examine how Jim Elve, publisher of <a href="http://www.blogscanada.ca/default.aspx" class="external text" title="http://www.blogscanada.ca/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">BlogsCanada</a> and an authority on citizen journalism, treats the group. (BlogsCanada awards the annual Top Blogs award that is recognized by such pre-eminent Canadian journalists as <a href="../../../m/a/c/Maclean%27s.html" title="Maclean's">Maclean's</a> columnist <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Wells_02ba.html" title="Paul Wells">Paul Wells</a>, who shows it prominently on his <a href="http://weblogs.macleans.ca/paulwells/" class="external text" title="http://weblogs.macleans.ca/paulwells/" rel="nofollow">website</a>. Jim Elve is considered an expert on blogging by the national media.

The 80+ commentors that participated in the ensuing discussion also accept Elve's understanding, and so show the community accepts the status of the Progressive Bloggers, as described in the Wikipedia article.--<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon.Pole_8471.html" title="User:Simon.Pole">Simon.Pole</a> 8 July 2005 04:54 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> Progressive Bloggers is an effort at free speech, something which is guaranteed in Canada's Constitution in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. What we are seeing is an attempt to stifle free speech, and this should not be allowed to suceed. There is a place for both sides of the argument, both left and right, this is fundemental to to the political dialectic. - Scott Robarts</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - but as sockpuppet votes approach the RickK Limit, my vote is subject to change. I remind the article's author that drumming up "new user" keep votes from the audience of <a href="http://www.simonpole.ca" class="external text" title="http://www.simonpole.ca" rel="nofollow">SimonPole.ca</a> may be considered sock/meatpuppetry by other Wikipedia users and admins. These votes are frowned upon on Wikipedia, may be discarded at the option of administrators - and, most importantly, may result in many <i>delete</i> votes on the grounds that if a site has to use sockpuppets to win a vote, it's inherently non-notable. Just a reminder. --<a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 8 July 2005 05:25 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Few bloggers are notable. To quote Gary Trudeau, isn't blogging basically for angry, semi-employed losers who are too untalented to get real jobs in journalism? If the market really valued what they have to say, wouldn't someone pay them for it? Wikipedia is full enough of blogger articles as it is. I don't see why they're the exception to the no self-published authors rule. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 8 July 2005 05:29 (UTC)

<li>To an extent, yes. I imagine if any wikipedian could be paid by Britannica to write/edit an encyclopedia they would take it. Unfortunately, 99% of wikipedia contributors are not qualified to do so. Wikipedia editors do not have their own articles in wikipedia or any other encyclopedia (at least, not for being editors of wikipedia). Bloggers are in much the same boat. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 8 July 2005 05:47 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The importance of the political orientation of the Progressive Bloggers is stressed much in the argument to keep this article. Yet, any Canadian-themed blog can join. The site itself appears to be a listing of blogs rather than a community, per se. Seems strange that such a looseknit group has an cohesive political agenda. I'm not trying to suppress anyone's political ideas here, I'm just trying to explain my personal opinon that this article is not encyclopedic. I wholeheartedly support freedom of speech, but Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia, not a soapbox. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 8 July 2005 06:17 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> misrepresents the nature of Progressive Bloggers. It states clearly in the Progressive Bloggers entry that any Canadian-themed blog can <b>apply</b> for membership. Moderators then review the applying blog to see if it meets the criteria for membership (as spelled out in the entry). As also stated in the entry, membership has been revoked if blogs deviate from the stated goals of the group.</li>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> claims Progressive Bloggers is a listing of blogs. Again the opposite of this is explictly spelled out in the entry. Progressive Bloggers has <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_kos.html" title="Daily kos">Daily Kos</a> style user diaries directly on its site. The community also votes directly on which member contributions are the best. Member content is dynamically brought to the website directly upon publication by RSS feed. These are all features shared by similar collective websites listed in the Wikipedia <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online_communities.html" title="Online communities">Online Communities</a> entry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I should also state that in no way is Wikipedia being hijacked for a soapbox. It is necessary on this page to make a case to prevent deletion. Like other political parties and organizations around the world that have Wikipedia entries, the political mission of Progressive Bloggers must be stated clearly. However, in keeping with the Wikipedia entries of other political organizations, the actual Progressive Bloggers article does not in any denouce opposing views or attempt to convert others to its views. Like the entries for parties and other organizations, a concise mission statement is given.--<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon.Pole_8471.html" title="User:Simon.Pole">Simon.Pole</a> 8 July 2005 06:51 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm sure all political blogs are considered important by those who read and write them, but who outside the blogosphere knows or cares? This particular blog is less than three months old, and if the most recent entry at <a href="http://www.simonpole.ca" class="external text" title="http://www.simonpole.ca" rel="nofollow">SimonPole.ca</a> is any indication, they're a bit insecure.

<li><b>Comment</b> Is using the phrase "some American gun nut" outside Wikipedia grounds for deletion?

<ul>
<li>No, of course it's not grounds for deletion. I favor deletion because Wikipedia is not an internet directory, and I'm not convinced that the site warrants an encyclopedia article. The gun nut comment, and the ones following it, were funny because apparently you can't imagine why anyone would argue for deletion unless they disagreed with your politics. It couldn't possibly have anything to do with Wikipedia policies. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 8 July 2005 09:00 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> No disrespect to Americans, you're a fine people, but I just don't think an American is capable of passing judgement on a Canadian political website and its relationship to Canadian politics.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am a member of Progressive Bloggers and the article is an accurate depiction of what this political weblog is all about -- we aren't trying to sell anyone anything and we have a broad membership, so PB is neither dubious or unverifiable. As far as whether we meet the "website" criteria, PB is already having an impact in Canadian political discussion. It provides a valuable new support for Canada's progressive blogs -- we just finished a bruising fight for the gay marriage bill, and the decriminatlization of marijuana posession will be coming up in the fall, not to mention the Gomery inquiry, the impact of the Liberal/NDP budget ammendments, and whether the government will fall over the corporate tax cut vote. I note that the Wikipedia has entries for a number of American Political Weblogs like Daily Kos and MyDD, but there are no Canadian sites on your list. And yes, this is my first vote here -- I didn't realize that the Wikipedia had such a thing as a "delete" vote procedure nor did I know that the Progressive Bloggers article was being considered for deletion until I logged onto the PB site and saw the notice about this. But if my vote in favour of this article is not welcome, just because it is my first vote, then OK -- though I would hope that you would consider the merits of the points I have made. --Fornssler 8 July 2005 09:10 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, non-notable, vanity, promotional. My first post to Wikipedia. I'm a regular reader of many of the blogs listed on the <a href="http://www.progressivebloggers.ca" class="external text" title="http://www.progressivebloggers.ca" rel="nofollow">Progressive Bloggers</a> site and consider myself a progressive Canadian (voting NDP or Liberal in all previous elections). While (most of) the blogs published on the site are coherent contributions to political discourse, Progressive Bloggers is really nothing more than a blogroll (contrary to Simon Pole's claim that it is a political organization). It cannot be compared to the likes of Daily Kos which is a site whose impact is felt outside the blogosphere. Blogging in Canada is booming, but still has negligible impact on the overall political public discourse. The recent Gurmant Grewal tapes fiasco was really the first time a blog-driven story was given much prominence in the mainstream media. When you consider that Canadian publications like the Hill Times and Bourque's online newswatch don't yet have Wikipedia entries after years as players on the political scene, it's a bit presumptuous to think Progressive Bloggers is ready to make the cut.

<li><b>Comment</b> The assertion that blogging "has negligible impact on the overall political public discourse" is challenged. A recent Ipso-Reid <a href="http://www.boundbygravity.com/2005_07_01_bbgarchive.aspx#112084638101312113" class="external text" title="http://www.boundbygravity.com/2005_07_01_bbgarchive.aspx#112084638101312113" rel="nofollow">poll</a> revealed 42% of Canadian internet users have read blogs. (42% is a significant number, as Canadians have one of the highest internet penetration <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/am/ca.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.internetworldstats.com/am/ca.htm" rel="nofollow">rates</a> in the world). Of that number, roughly 50% are university graduates and between the ages 18-34 -- an influential and computer-savy part of the population.</li>

<li>The idea "blog-driven story was given much prominence in the mainstream media" is a red herring. Blogs themselves are part of the mainstrea media in Canada.

<li>Maybe you're a victim of the Vast Right Wing Conspiricy... Please keep in mind that, out in the real world, things work differently than here in Canada. In the real world those on the political left can't expect to put ideas out and have them universially accepted as happens in Canada. If you continually expect folks to accept you and your ideas because you simply exist you're going to be continually disappointed...</li>
<li>Nope, there's no conspiracy--it's out in the open. Your post gives the game away. Americans are calling the shots on Wikipedia. And the above comment indicates, typically, that the mere existence of a left-wing site (sort of) is an attempt to have our ideas "universally accepted," rather than simply expressed. So much for free speech. Go back to Faux News, which is obviously what you'd like Wikipedia to be. By the way, this is my third post. Do I get to vote now?

<li>Sorry to disappoint you. I'm Canadian and you should very well know that we don't get fox news up here unless it's part of a satelite package. Oh, please bear in mind that wikipedia is an encyclopedia and not a soapbox as is noted with your desire to "simply express" your views.

<ul>
<li>You haven't disappointed me in the least. Your agenda, judging from your blog, is clear: you simply want to shut down a political POV that differs from yours. Will Wikipedia get into the censorship game? Stay tuned--lots of right-whingers afraid of views other than their own here.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Why, why, why are some people pretending this is a political issue? This is so not about right v left, America v Canada, or any of that. I would like to ask everyone to vote and discuss on the merits of the article, not on your opinion of the political beliefs involved. I like progressive politics, and IMO America is quite backward compared to Canada, but that's not the issue. It looks like certain supporters of the article (and apparently, the website itself) are determined to take any criticism of the article as a slam on their beliefs. We're not trying to decide which political opinions are correct, we're trying to decide if this article is right for Wikipedia. <b>Simple facts to help you vote:</b> the site in question has only 100 members, and its traffic ranking is very, very low. Wikipedia is not a web directory. Other articles about websites with similiar membership and traffic are routinely deleted without all the fuss. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 8 July 2005 21:33 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not pretending anything. ProgBlog has over 100 affiliate blogs, and is a kind of meeting-place for progressive commentary--not just a list of blogs. The article seemed reasonable enough to me, and offered an intelligent way into a thoughtful part of the blogosphere. The reaction to it, on the other hand, seems a little off to me. First, regulars hurrying to point out that some of the posts are from first-timers. Then the sheer inanity of some of the comments themselves, such as the one claiming that our support was based upon wanting "universal acceptance for our ideas" (which often conflict, incidentally), and contrasting Canada with "the real world" (by which I take it s/he means the Red States). Admit it, Friday--there *is* a political dimension. How often do you get people actively trying to censor a point of view here? DrDawg 8 July 2005 18:00 (DST)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Simon, I don't think you're understanding me. I will attempt to be clear. My point is that the VFD discussion should not revolve around politics, it should revolve around the appropriateness of the article. However, you do have a point: my comment casting asparagus on the notion that "Progressive Bloggers" have an identifiable ideology was ill-informed and irrelevant. I'm admittedly unfamiliar with how your blogmates feel. I'm not trying to dispute the accuracy of what you say about the political leanings of certain segments of the Canadian blogosphere. I'm merely saying that this article is not Wikipedia material. People who're voting <b>Delete</b> here are expressing disapproval of the article, not the Progressive Bloggers themselves. You should try to see that distinction. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 8 July 2005 23:31 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Friday, I would go for that distinction if your rightist acolytes here did. You know, and I know, that this is a political discussion, and the "Nay" votes are votes against the POV, not the article. Otherwise, how can you explain the presence in Wikipedia of Mike Brock?</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Why would you assume that deletion of Wikipedia's Progressive Bloggers article would not harm politics in Canada? The USA has 300 million people, Canada 30 million. Such an entry might seem insignificant to you in your country, but in Canada, it makes a difference. In our country, many more people have the internet, many more people vote and are involved in politics and belong to political parties. Because of this, they turn to the internet for information about politics and to be involved in politics. Wikipedia is a part of that, as are the Progressive Bloggers. As stated above, blogs and groups of blogs, have a much greater role in Canadian politics than they may have in your country. Again, I'd like to point out I don't think it is appropriate for someone who is not Canadian to make decisions about what is appropriate to Canadian politics.--<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon.Pole_8471.html" title="User:Simon.Pole">Simon.Pole</a> 9 July 2005 00:50 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> As the actual owner and creator of the site, I just wanted to comment that I really have no position on this matter, that I didn't create the article and had no knowledge of it until a friend pointed out to me that the article exists. There were some inacuracies in the article that I have edited and fixed, however, I want to reassure those conspiracy minded that there is no orchestrated attempt to have the article approved. To the issue at hand I shall point out that there is a growing trend in the Canadian blogosphere, at least, for blogs to converge around blogging groups or "planets" (e.g. <a href="http://planet.gnome.org/" class="external free" title="http://planet.gnome.org/" rel="nofollow">http://planet.gnome.org/</a>) and that in Canada, the Blogging Tories and the Progressive Bloggers seem to be the major ones. However the community decides to reflect this trend is up to you, but I do ask that the community remain consistent. If the article is approved, then a Blogging Tories article should be allowed. Otherwise, no articles on blogging groups should be allowed. -waynechu</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Demonstrating that some blogs have been relevant to Canadian politics doesn't help much. Some individuals are relevant to politics too; this doesn't mean everyone who is an individual is relevant. If someone wants to make an article on the Canadian Blogosphere, maybe some of the arguments here would help that. But, we must remember, such a thing needs to be verifiable by other sources, Wikipedia is not the place for original research. This article contains plenty of claims of importance, but I still see nothing verifiable. As it stands, this article is about one particular group, evidenced by one particular website. I could make a website called "Democratic Americans", and claim that my site is very important because of the large numbers of Americans who consider themselves Democratic. However such a claim would be spurious, and I would hope the Wikipedia community would see through it. It doesn't seem to me that most of the folks arguing to keep have read and understood <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 20:59, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It has been established that blogs are more important in Canadian political life than they are elsewhere, to the extent that such politically notable individuals as the current <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Martin_629b.html" title="Paul Martin">Prime Minister</a> use them. It has also been established that there are politically notable individuals in the Progressive Blogger membership. I believe, in the context of Canadian political life, this is enough to make Progressive Bloggers notable in and of itself. If a higher standard of proof is required, however, the Progressive Bloggers would appear to be politically notable enough to be recognized in the following sources:

<p>Oh, for gawd's sake. This is getting completely fucking out of control. Votes should address <b>only</b> the following points:</p>

<p><i>No</i> other criterion, including ideology, should be a factor on either side.</p>
<p>Now, speaking as a Canadian who has <i>no</i> personal connection to Progressive Bloggers and is therefore entirely objective about it, I can assure you that the answer to both of these questions is yes; <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon.Pole_8471.html" title="User:Simon.Pole">Simon.Pole</a> <i>is</i> correct in pointing out that the group has a significant role in Canadian political discussion (although admittedly trolling for sockpuppets in his own blog wasn't the smartest move in terms of demonstrating that.)

<li><b>Comment</b> Also, re: the Daily Kos traffic rankings. I don't think its fair to compare the traffic rankings of an American site to a Canadian site. The US has ten times the population of Canada. Compensating for the difference in population (i.e. dividing by 10) brings the Blogging Tories traffic ranking to 36,405 -- into the ballpark of sites like Kos. Again, I don't want to harp on the issue of inherent <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">US bias</a> in Wikipedia, but comparisons between US and Canadian traffic levels would seem to fall into this category.--<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon.Pole_8471.html" title="User:Simon.Pole">Simon.Pole</a> 06:03, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Alexa is not a reliable barometer to judge a Canadian site (with a much smaller potential viewership) against an American one like Daily Kos. Oh, and further - is it even a reliable barometer, period? Even their own page admits 1) they collect data from those with Alexa's toolbar; 2) they only collect from IE users and Windows users; 3) this data can be affected by other means (it closes on https pages, it uses automated procedures and may close on real "sites" - read for yourself at <a href="http://pages.alexa.com/prod_serv/traffic_learn_more.html" class="external free" title="http://pages.alexa.com/prod_serv/traffic_learn_more.html" rel="nofollow">http://pages.alexa.com/prod_serv/traffic_learn_more.html</a>). As far as 1 and 2, if I were a progressive with "liberal" values, doncha think I might be more likely to 1) avoid all spyware collecting personal data on moi, such as Alexa's toolbar ... and 2) utilize non-MS software and material like Firefox, Netscape, Opera, etc - which would preclude me from being counted by Alexa? And one more time, whether it's "notable" IS tied to what country and culture it's coming from... That's why the RFD showed up on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias</a>. This group is not notable by "American" standards (EG everyone keeps comparing it to Daily Kos, and act as if political blogs are a dime a dozen... yes, in the US!), but it is notable by Canadian standards. Are we to think that only American standards rule the day? 67.10.131.229 11:34, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

But I expect PB's will play a role in the next elecition and as such, it seems silly in my mind to be eager to delete the article so quickly. If after the next election the status of PB's has not been elevated deletion should be considered.</li>
