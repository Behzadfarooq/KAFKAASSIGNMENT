<li><b>Keep</b>,I believe we are notable considering we are the biggest successful DS Online Clan as well as one of the first(not the first). -ptfreak</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,I think 600 members is considered notable. We would just like to get the recognition we deserve as possibly the largest Nintendo DS clan on the internet. -N64BOY39</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,I personally see the Blue Diamond Clan as one of the best video game clans and most succesful of all time. There should be no reason for deleting an article on one of the the greatest and most successful clans.If you do not belief us check us out. bdc.clan.pro</li>
</ul>
<p>- golferwerd</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>,I personally believe that there is no point in having this article here, as it was purely created to advertise their clan. Also, it is just a Wifi DS Clan. Maybe the best (in golferwerd's opinion [but not mine]), it's just a Wifi DS Clan. You could hardly get a clan to be any smaller and specific yet be of any importance.</li>
</ul>
<p>- James Vanderbilt</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>,The Blue Diamond Clan may seem unimportant to those people who do not play DS Wifi games, but the importance of articles is relative. To people involved in the Nintendo gaming community, this article holds value. Therefore, it should not be deleted. - Lynn</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,I dare you to find another DS Wifi Clan that is:</li>
</ul>
<p>1. More Populated and 2. More Successful than the BDC. This Webpage should stay on because the BDC is the best DS Wifi clan out there. The BDC has a unique arengement of people and each and very visit to the BDC is always fun. There is always something to do there be it games or talk about random stuff. All the other DS Wifi clans have already collapsed but the BDC is as strong as ever. Also, commiting suicide does not make a clan notable. Just.....dangerous. Again, digg.com must have found the BDC notable because the gave the BDC a 10, but its just only the perfect score right? ~Crazyforkillua[BDC's Sheik Smasher Expert]</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>,The clan is large, and still growing, showing great potential. I can see why one may not want every single clan to write an article, but this clan is very successful. As for it not being notable, like was said, if you personally don't care about online gaming, then you probably wouldn't think is was noteworthy, but that's an opinion. Anyone interested in online gaming may find it interesting. Also, I didn't find this article to be an advertisement any more than any other Wiki article that has a link to the source. Anyway, why would one advertise on Wikipedia instead of a site more heavily frequented by video gamers? -Thorn</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,BDC is the biggest WiFi clan on the internet. Period. Also the most successful. And quote from the top of this page "Your continued donations keep Wikipedia running!" So, how does it hurt Wiki to have MORE information? Explain that to me. -Nintendofankid</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,BDC is one of the best clans I have ever been in. I have been in tons of clans before for different reasons, but this clan actually... How you say it touched me. (Not like that pervs &lt;_&lt;) Anyway without this clan... I don't know maybe I wouldn't be here. This clan is just more than a ds clan to some, but a part of some peoples lives. Before some other person comes and flames that last sentence I just said I would like to say... I know it may seem nerdish or whatever you people say is wierd and not common to you. Just remeber that a person is a person no matter what. Plus I'm going off topic and just probably blabbing stuff out, so I would like you to remeber that BDC is more than a clan, but more like a family - Zuto</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I agree with Nintendofankid and Zuto - Bacon&amp;Eggs</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,the Blue Diamond Clan is the most successful and most notable Wi-fi clan out there. We have 600 members and if you call that unnotable then your opinion on here shouldn't matter, as you wouldn't know much about a wi-fi clan. You can go on the BDC to play games, or to just hang out and chat. And as Zuto said to some people the BDC is more then just a clan, to some it's family. It will be a serious injustice if you delete the Blue Diamond Clan article. After all, more articles mean more visitors for Wikipedia, which means more success. And that's what is wanted, right? ~ Joe, a.k.a JoeWise6</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,this clan is great. I joined the day I got Mario Kart DS. I came across this clan on gamefaqs. Someone was advertising so I joined. I expected it to be one of those "other clans" that usually dies because of non-active members. I thought to myself, "I'll just use this clan to make wi-fi friends to play on Mario Kart." Little did I know that this clan would take a piece of my heart with it. I am now very active and the clan is thriving is ways I didnt imagine. I love it so much I sneak on at school (shh). If you were to chose a wi-fi clan, chose BDC. I promise you that you WILL make friends and that you WILL have a great time. - abc123</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,as Lynn has stated, this article holds value to those involved. The Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection community is a relatively new community, with plenty of clans being created each day. The Blue Diamond Clan is among the oldest and is currently the most populated clan of this type. This article holds valuable information. If an article about the most popular clan of a certain online service is not valuable, then what is? This clan deserves an article, especially for being a quintessential Nintendo Wi-Fi Clan, and for being the apex of these clans in general. - Katie, a.k.a. "Valkyrie"</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,BDC is a threshold in Nintendo's growing online community. It has brought hundreds of Nintendo's fans together to meet and share everything from memories to funny videos. It's an online community where everyone knows everyone and where we stick together like a family. The goal of the article is not to advertise, but to inform, as does every other article on Wikipedia. BDC has pioneered and helped shape Nintendo's WiFi community, and is guaranteed to only expand and become more notable, especially when Nintendo Wii is released. I really hope BDC can keep its article, it means a lot to me. -Nick a.k.a. phoenix</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,I was SO bored until I found BDC. I always have someone to talk to or play against. And I'm sure people will appreciate this page as much as I appreciated the article on Digg. This shouldnt be deleted just because noone commited suicide or noone in this clan is famous. You guys call this an encyclpedia right? I think an article like this should be included in an encyclopedia. What harm did this article cause? I dont see anything wrong with this being here. -KopyKat I can see you</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,BDC is a clan I have become a part of. I didn't know anything about clans at the time I joined. But the friendly community sucked me right in. This is probably the NICEST, ONE OF THE MOST THRIVING, and SUCCESFUL clans I have seen compared to many others. I made so much friends in BDC and if you decided to delete this article you might be preventing many other people to have new good friends. And so what if no one commited suicide in the clan? What if Arnold effin Swartchinager isn't in here? That is not what makes a clan notable. What makes a clan notable (Preferably a wifi clan) is the community, challenge, and relationships. This clan ain't some clan that has any boundaries to join either unlike some clans. We came right from the start of DS wifi with a good history and you know what? That seems like a pretty long time for it to deserve an article. Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>-metroixer the metroid mod N_N</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>,I don't have many friends at school... no good friends are in my class. I get picked on occasionally. What does this have to do with the BDC? I know that when I log on here I won't be picked on. I will be accepted for the person I am. The BDC is a part of me, and I'm sure others feel the same way. Please don't delete this article. - WiiMonkey</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,I agree with all you guys-Naruto</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>,the Blue Diamond Clan should stay up because without it, the DarkSnipers Clan would have no real competitors! The Blue Diamond Clan is the inspiration that makes other clans want to try harder to be successful! The BDC (Blue Diamond Clan) is the root reason for other clans to exist... If the Blue Diamonds go down, then the entire Nintendo Wi-Fi clan community will have nothing to work towards unless another Clan is good enough to match the popularity of the BDC.</li>
</ul>
<p>BDC is to Nintendo, as E3 is to the Gaming Community in general! -Kurayamiblack(DSC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, this shouldn't be deleted. It is in no way an advertisement but a way for fellow gamers to come together and accomplish something greater. If we were advertising we would have only included our positives. We are a group of dedicated gamers who care a lot about each other and want a way to be able to remember ourselves for what we have done for each other. -Jermtastic</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, the fact that more than 600 people have registered makes it somewhat noticeable. That so many members are protesting deletion proves just as much.</li>
</ul>
<p>Video games are considered "of note". Otherwhise, there wouldn't be nearly as many articles on them as presently exist. Small to medium sized communities are considered "of note". So is the internet. This is all three combined into one confusing myriad of a microcosm.</p>
<p>Personal value doesn't matter, but numbers do. And teacher tells me that 600 is a large one. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuper_Genus_33f8.html" title="User:Super Genus">Genus</a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> This clan has helped me a LOT of times of when I was in need. So I would want to keep this site, even in times of trouble, we still were able to help ourselves. And for that, I would really appreciate it if you guys can keep this.- LJkaRma</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The clan seems to be growing at an alarming rate. Why take it off a growing website? It has become a part of my life, not just because of the games, but because you grow along with the site, and everyone on it. -Cyeo</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: By far the most of the above "keep" votes were added by users who have only ever edited the Blue Diamond Clan article itself and this AfD discussion (as if you couldn't guess). <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 11:21, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
