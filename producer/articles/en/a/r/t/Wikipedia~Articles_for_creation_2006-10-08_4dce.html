<p>Dulwich Hill FC recently came 2nd on the club championship ladder in the NSW super youth league. This is quite amazing as they finished last on the ladder in 2005. They have now been promoted to NSW Premier Youth League for 2007 which is the highest level of football for youth in NSW. They are offering scholarships to young players in an attempt to further football in the local area. Their web site has all the links and some great action photos from the season. Well worth a look and the effort. <a href="http://www.dulwich-hill.com" class="external free" title="http://www.dulwich-hill.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dulwich-hill.com</a></p>

Sounds like an excellent article to have.

<p>Rajinder Goel, the reference may not strike a cord with an average Indian cricket follower, let alone the worldwide audience. But the fact remains that he is the most successfull first class bowler(in terms of scalps) the country has produced till date(2006).</p>
<p>A bag of 640 wickets in the domestic circuit at an impressive average of 17.15, as claimed by this left arm spinner is bound to generate awe among the peers and the audience. He played for the states of Punjab,Haryana and Delhi at different times in Ranji matches, India's domestic first class cricket competition. He figures among the 31 "idols" of Sunil Gavaskar in world cricket described by India's most successfull test opener in his book by the same name. But as fate would have it, it is only due to another of those "31", Bishen Singh Bedi, that Goel could not see his dream of winning a test cap for India materialise. Bishen bedi was also a slow left arm spinner and bagged 266 test wickets for India, one time highest for his country by a bowler. They both played their cricket in the same era and the presence of other great spinners of the caliber of Prasanna, Chandra and Venkat meant there was no scope for another left arm spinner in the team.</p>
<p>Currently, Goel is the head coach at the Satpriya Cricket Academy in Rohtak, a city in the state of Haryana in India.</p>

<p>Poor Man's Ooty, as it is called, the Udumalpet town is one of the famous summer resorts of Tamil Nadu, surrounded by Mountains on three sides. Its name in the ancient days was "UDUMALAI" and due to its rural atmosphere, it was also named as Pettai. In latter period it was changed as "UDUMALAIPETTAI" in Tamil. This selection grade Municipal town which has got a population of about one lakh, gets water for drinking purpose from the THIRUMURTHI Reservoir. Both the Thirumurthi and Amaravathy Dams situated south of Udumalpet add beauty to its location. This is an industrial town, since a number of textile, paper and variety of industries have been established here and in the agricultural field too.</p>
<p>A recent spurt in the windmill industry has taken the town to new heights in the power sector. Quite a number of windmills are being erected in and around the town providing a breathtaking view throught the lush green fields with the western ghats in the background.</p>

<p>Howard Clinton Zahniser (1906-1964) was born on February 25, 1906, in Franklin, Pennsylvania, and grew up in nearby Tionesta, Pennsylvania along the banks of the Allegheny River close to the Allegheny National Forest. He attended college at Greenville College in Greenville, Illinois, where he graduated with a B.A. in 1928.</p>
<p>Zahniser went on to become executive secretary of The Wilderness Society from 1945 through 1964. In his capacity with The Wilderness Society, Zahniser drafted the federal Wilderness Act in 1956, which was introduced in the United States Congress that same year -- in the House of Representatives by Congressman John P. Saylor of Pennsylvania, and in the Senate by Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota. Zahniser was the main proponent of the Wilderness Act over the subsequent eight years that it took to pass the legislation, including overseeing numerous rewrites and attending all 18 public hearings on the bill.</p>
<p>Zahniser died of heart failure on May 5, 1964, just a few months before President Lyndon Johnson signed the Wilderness Act into law in September of that year. The Wilderness Act established America's National Wilderness Preservation System, which today permanently protects more than 106 million acres of federal public land for the benefit of future generations of people and wildlife alike. Wilderness areas must be designated by act of Congress under the framework of the Wilderness Act that Zahniser created on Forest Service, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Land Management lands. There have been more than 100 seperate wilderness bills signed into law since 1964. Every United States President since 1964 has signed substantial wilderness legislation during his time in office.</p>
<p>Zahniser is buried in the Tionesta Riverside Cemetary, his rough-hewn marker, taken from the surrounding forest, facing his beloved Allegheny River.</p>

<p><b>Zentropa</b>, also called Zentropa Production and Zentropa Entertainments, is a Danish film production company, one of the largest in Scandinavia. It was founded in 1992 by director <a href="../../../l/a/r/Lars_von_Trier_d20e.html" title="Lars von Trier">Lars von Trier</a> and producer Peter Aalbæk Jensen. Zentropa owns many subsidiary companies and a huge studio complex, Filmbyen, where many of Denmark's other leading film companies are located. Zentropa is known for going aggressively against conventional thinking. In 1995, it launched <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogme95.html" title="Dogme95">Dogme95</a>, at set of rules designed to challenge the conventional film language. Though initially ridiculed, Dogme95 resulted in such critically praised films as Thomas Vinterberg's <i>Festen</i> (later also a play). In 1998, through its subsidiary company Puzzy Power, Zentropa became the first manstream studio to produce hardcore porn videos. In 2003, Zentropa produced Lars von Trier's <i>Dogville</i>, starring <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicole_Kidman_310b.html" title="Nicole Kidman">Nicole Kidman</a> and filmed on an empty soundstage with the set merely indicated by chalk marks on the floor. Most of the company's radical experiments spring from Zentropa's co-owner Las von Trier. The company was named after Lars von Trier's film <i>Zentropa</i>.</p>

<p>Dumbolf is a new craze sweeping the nation people are going crazy for access to Dumbolf clubs, clubs set up purely to play Dumbolf, the leading world player in dumbolf i s a mr Duncan Brown an illusive fellow thought to be aged around 15-16. The dumbolf number 2 is thomas cooper a young teddy bear from Bradwell he has nothing of the vague charm of Duncan but has the talent enough to become second best. Duncans coach Angus Kohlhardt released a staement with insight into Duncan's success. "Duncan trains hard don't get me wrong but a lot of it is down to natural dumbolfing talent oh yes this boy has skill". If you would like to begin your dumbolf adventure you can find it on any good search engine. There are many off shots of Dumbolf there is the university of Dumbolf which specializes in Dumbology the study of Dumbolf which goes hand in hand with twaddle. There is the new town of Dumville a town built entirely on profits made from Dumbolf where there "is never a frown" Recent studies show that people who play dumbolf are 23% more likely to be happy and non stressed also those who participate in twaddle are more likely to be mad and therefore hilarious. for example Jake Milne a regular twaddlr and he is renowned for his hilarity.

UNITED STATES</span></h2>
<p>Commodore John W. Anderson was the longest serving captain of the S.S. UNITED STATES, the fastest ocean liner in history. In 1952, he relieved Commodore Harry Manning as master of the superliner after the recordbreaking voyage on which she broke the translantic speed record previously held by the QUEEN MARY and captured the Blue Riband for America.</p>
<p>Commodore Anderson was born in 1899 in Jersey City, New Jersey to parents of Norwegian and English descent. His grandfather spent twenty-five years at sea in Norwegian sailing ships. He entered the New York Nautical School (which later became the SUNY Maritime College)in 1915, and served as a cadet aboard the schoolship NEWPORT, formerly a gunboat in the Spanish-American War. After graduation he went to sea as a quartermaster and junior officer on several famous old liners like the MANCHURIA and NEW YORK. He later sailed to Australia, India and China on freight ships and tankers as chief mate and obtained his first command in 1921. In 1934 he was appointed to command the AMERICAN IMPORTER, his first passenger ship for United States Lines, trading to the British Isles. One notable voyage took place in 1935, when he transported Colonel and Mrs. Charles A. Lindberg and their son Jon to England after the kidnapping of their younger child.</p>
<p>Following the outbreak of World War II, the Swedish motor liner KUNGSHOLM was seized at New York, placed under the American flag and purchased by the U.S. government. The United States Lines were appointed agents by the War Shipping Administration to run the ship as a troop transport and Commodore Anderson was selected to command her. The ship, renamed JOHN ERICSSON, left New York at the end of January 1942 in convoy with a full complement of 6,000 U.S. soldiers for Australia and Noumea. Their ultimate mission was to garrison the island of New Caledonia. Returning to the Atlantic, the JOHN ERICSSON resumed her mission and by the close of the war had safely transported some 300,000 troops to various theaters of war, despite frequent attacks by enemy submarines and aircraft.</p>
<p>In 1940 Commodore Anderson took command of the S.S. WASHINGTON, the second largest U.S. passenger liner of the time, and in 1949 he was named master of the 34,000-ton luxury liner AMERICA, then the nation's largest and finest passenger liner. While in command of the AMERICA, Commodore Anderson gained a reputation for outstanding seamanship, unfailing good nature and insistence on crew discipline and courteous service that helped dispel the myth that American passenger ships were inferior to European liners.</p>
<p>At the end of World War II, the nation's leading naval architect, William Francis Gibbs, was asked to design a supership of great size and speed that would not only be the finest luxury liner afloat, but would also be capable of carrying a full division of troops in wartime. The result was the 53,000-ton superliner UNITED STATES, built in close cooperation with the Maritime Administration and the U.S. Navy. In September 1952, following the voyage on which she broke the speed record previously held by the QUEEN MARY, crossing the Atlantic in just 3 days, 10 hours and forty minutes at an average speed of nearly 36 knots, Commodore Anderson assumed command of the UNITED STATES. One year later he was appointed Commodore of the entire United States Lines' fleet of 55 passenger and cargo vessels.</p>
<p>The passenger lists of the UNITED STATES overflowed with the names of the social, artistic and political luminaries of the era. Among the passengers who crossed the ocean with Commodore Anderson were former Presidents Eisenhower and Truman, Senator and Mrs. John F. Kennedy, Eleanor Roosevelt, Emperor Haile Selassie, Prince Rainer of Monaco and his bride, Grace Kelly, Greta Garbo, Cary Grant, John Wayne, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, Sir Laurence Olivier, Marlon Brando, Sean Connery, Walt Disney, Tennessee Williams, Leopold Stokowski, Leonard Bernstein, Salvidor Dali, and even the Mona Lisa, travelling in a tightly guarded suite enroute to the Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition in 1963. Perhaps the most celebrated couple were the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who made their first trip in 1952 and never crossed the Atlantic on another liner.</p>
<p>In 1956 the UNITES STATES began to experience labor problems that would eventually lead to her layup. One of the most serious came in February 1957. A tugboat strike had been in progress for a week and when the ship arrived in New York the port was at a standstill and there were no tugs to help her dock. Described by the New York Times as "the loneliest merchant mariner in the port" that day, Commodore Anderson successfully docked the huge 990-foot, $78 million dollar liner without tug assistance and without mishap, a navigational feat he would have to perform again on several occasions, including the final voyage before his retirement.</p>
<p>Commodore Anderson ended his career in 1964, having served as master of the UNITED STATES for 12 years. During his long career he received many honors. In 1957 he was presented with the Merchant Marine Achievement Award by the American Legion, and in 1958 he was cited by the Council of American Master Mariners for outstanding maritime achievement.</p>
<p>Commodore Anderson died on February 15, 1976 and his uniform and other S.S. UNITED STATES memorabilia are on display at the Maritime Industry Museum at Fort Schuyler.</p>

<p>The first europeans who touched Tanzania’s coasts were the Portuguese, in the late XVth century, but they all fled the country before the end of the XVII century.</p>
<p>The first permanent european settlers there were Germans. During all the XIXth century hundred thousands of german peasants emigrated to the Americas to find land to cultivate. German authorities, when they reached control of Tanzania, tried to re-direct there that flow of emigrants. The government gave to the settlers the land which would be touched by the railway. Until 1914, about 3,000 people had arrived in Tanganyika from Germany to settle down. With the WW1, german immigration stopped, and the english one started (the english themselves got the mandate for the territory from the League of Nations). In the Mandate Legislative Council, established in 1926, twelve members were english officials chosen by the governor, while ten members were chosen by and between the white settlers. In 1935 they were 8230 counting both eglish and german settlers, with an overall population of 5 mil.; Dar-es-Salam, the biggest town of the country at that time, got 700 europeans (mainly germans) on 33,000 inhabitants. From 1945, white people increasingly lose their influence in Tanzania’s politics. From the independence (1961) power went almost completely in the hands of black natives. Tanzania’s citizens of european descent were estimated to be a little less than 17,000 in the early ‘90s, and they were estimated to be 10,000 in 2006.</p>
<p>European people occupies mainly the proximities of mounts Meru and Kilimanjaro. They cultivates tobacco, tea, coffee, cocoa, banana trees, cotton, sugar cane and a few other crops. Enrico</p>

<p>Tha Ganapati Upanishad is a blessing relating to the Hindu God Ganesh (also Ganessa and Ganesha.) It is part of the text of the Atharvaveda, one of the four Vedas (sacred Texts.)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>"Om ! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;</p>
<p>May we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !</p>
<p>May we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,</p>
<p>Praising them with our body and limbs steady !</p>
<p>May the glorious Indra bless us !</p>
<p>May the all-knowing Sun bless us !</p>
<p>May Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !</p>
<p>May Brihaspati grant us well-being !</p>
<p>Om ! Let there be Peace in me !</p>
<p>Let there be Peace in my environment !</p>
<p>Let there be Peace in the forces that act on me !</p>
<p>Auspiciousness to those who hear ---- thus the Santi.</p>
<p>1. Om Gam. I bow to Ganapati.</p>
<p>2. You clearly are the tattva. You alone are the creator. You alone are the maintainer. You alone are the destroyer. Of all this you certainly are Brahman. You plainly are the essence.</p>
<p>3. Always I speak amrta. The truth I speak.</p>
<p>4. Protect me. Protect the speakers. Protect the hearers. Protect the givers. Protect the holders. Protect the disciple that repeats. Protect that in the east. Protect that in the south. Protect that in the west. Protect that in the north. Protect that above. Protect that below. Everywhere protect! Protect me everywhere!</p>
<p>5. You are speech. You are consciousness. You are bliss. You are Brahman. You are being-consciousness-bliss. You are the non-dual. You are plainly Brahman. You are knowledge. You are intelligence.</p>
<p>6. You create all this world. You maintain all this world. All this world is seen in you. You are earth, water, air, fire, ether. You are beyond the four measures of speech. You are beyond the three gunas. You are beyond the three bodies. You are beyond the three times. You are always situated in the muladhara. You are the being of the three Saktis. You are always meditated on by yogins. You are Brahma, you are Visnu, you are Rudra, you are Agni, you are Vayu, you are the sun, you are the moon, you are Brahma, bhur-bhuvah-svar.</p>
<p>7 Ga is the first syllable, after that the first letter, beyond that m, then the half-moon all together. Joined with m, this is the mantra form.</p>
<p>8 The letter ga is the first form, letter a the middle form, m the last form. Bindu the higher form, nada the joining together, samhita the junction. This is the vidya of Lord Ganesa.</p>
<p>9 Ganaka is the seer, nricad-gayatri the metre, Sri Mahaganapati the devata. Om ganapataye namah.</p>
<p>10 Let us think of the one-toothed, let us meditate on the crooked trunk, may that tusk direct us.</p>
<p>11. One tusk, four arms, carrying noose and goad, with his hands dispelling fear and granting boons, with a mouse as his banner.</p>
<p>12. Red, with a big belly, with ears like winnowing baskets, wearing red, with limbs smeared with red scent, truly worshipped with red flowers.</p>
<p>13. To the devoted a merciful deva, the maker of the world, the prime cause, who at the beginning of creation was greater than nature and man.</p>
<p>14. He who always meditates thus is a yogin above yogins.</p>
<p>15. Hail to the lord of vows, hail to Ganapati, hail to the first lord, hail unto you, to the big-bellied, one-tusked, obstacle-destroyer, the son of Siva, to the boon-giver, hail, hail!</p>
<p>16. He who studies this atharva text moves towards Brahma. He is always blissful. He is not bound by any obstacles. He is liberated from the five greater and the five lesser sins. Evening meditation destroys the unmeritorious actions of the night. At both evening and morning he is liberated from the bad and he attains dharma, artha, kama and moksa.</p>
<p>17. This atharva text should not be given to those not pupils. If from delusion a person so gives, he is a bad person.</p>
<p>18. He who wants something may accomplish it by 1,000 recitations of this. He who sprinkles Ganapati with this becomes eloquent. He who recites this on a fourth day becomes a knower of vidya. This is an artharva saying: ‘‘He who moves towards Brahmavidya is never afraid.’’ He who worships with fried grains becomes famous and becomes intelligent. He who worships with sweet-meat (modaka) gains the desired fruit. He who worships with samit and ghee by him all is attained, all is gained by him. He who makes eight brahmËnas understand this becomes like the sun’s rays. In a solar eclipse, in a great river, or in front of an image having recited (this) he gets accomplished in the mantra. He becomes liberated from great obstacles. He is freed from great misfortunes.</p>
<p>Om ! O Devas, may we hear with our ears what is auspicious;</p>
<p>May we see with our eyes what is auspicious, O ye worthy of worship !</p>
<p>May we enjoy the term of life allotted by the Devas,</p>
<p>Praising them with our body and limbs steady !</p>
<p>May the glorious Indra bless us !</p>
<p>May the all-knowing Sun bless us !</p>
<p>May Garuda, the thunderbolt for evil, bless us !</p>
<p>May Brihaspati grant us well-being !</p>
<p>Om ! Let there be Peace in me !</p>
<p>Let there be Peace in my environment !</p>
<p>Let there be Peace in the forces that act on me !</p>
<p>Here ends the Ganapati Upanishad, as contained in the Atharva-Veda.</p>

<p>American painter <b>Michael Schultheis</b> has a background in mathematics and economics and is inspired by the incredible beauty and elegance in the world of analytics. His work explores the visual models that most effectively communicate the essence of math. By allowing the paintings to operate like a chalkboard, gradually filling up with notations and illustrations, he shows the progression of ideas on a topic. In this way, he translates the intricate world of numbers and relationships into something everyone can see, and invites the viewer to consider the often-unseen relationship between math and human experience.</p>
<p>Michael received a B.A. in Economics from Washington State University, studied Math at the University of Washington, and received an M.S. in Labor Economics from Cornell University. He also studied Italian and History in Siena, Italy. He currently lives and works in Seattle, WA. A recent body of his work was exhibted in 2006 at the National Academy of Science in Washington, DC.</p>

<p>Fractal Design Corporation was a 1990s software company that created, and/or developed, a variety of artistic software products that have outlived the company itself. Notably these were Painter 3D, Ray Dream Studio (today Carrara), Expression (today Microsoft Expression). These products tended to be cross-platform for MacIntosh and Windows.</p>
<p>Ray Dream Studio was a 3d modeller/animator with an unusual user interface whereby objects hovering inside the corner of a cube could be manipluated by dragging their shadows on any of the 3 visible walls of their container. Ray Dream was cross-platform for MacIntosh and Windows, fairly easy for a non-expert to use, and cheap ($200 in 1994). Ray Dream eventually became Carrara <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrara_%28software%29.html" title="Carrara (software)">Carrara_(software)</a> and is now sold by Eovia Corporation.</p>
<p>Expression was a 2-dimensional image editor with the unusual feature of combining a bitmap editor and a vector graphics editor in the same layout. It was written by <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_Lou_6ec9.html" title="Water Lou">Water_Lou</a>. This software was originally supported on MacIntosh and Windows, but changed hands several times becoming <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creature_House_Expression_2f03.html" title="Creature House Expression">Creature_House_Expression</a> and is now Microsoft Expression.</p>
<p>Painter 3D was for digitally "painting" bitmapped images onto the surface of computerized 3d models. It was purchased by Corel and evolved to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corel_Painter_1af7.html" title="Corel Painter">Corel Painter</a> IX until it was discontinued.</p>
<p>Fractal Design Corporation was founded by Tom Hedges and Mark Zimmer in 1991, merged with MetaCreations in 1997, and divested itself of all its graphics software products in 1999. Today what is left of MetaCreations is ViewPoint Corporation<a href="http://www.metacreations.com/products/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.metacreations.com/products/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which appears to no longer sell graphics software.</p>

<p>American painter Susan Dory creates abstract paintings, which investigate issues of repetition variation, time and precarious balance. Her most recent body of work is rooted in nature and combines intuitive and unusual color combinations, which allow the compositions to grow and evolve organically.</p>
<p>From her artist's statement:</p>
<p>"I am interested in creating complexity in my work through the repetition of a single element and pay particular attention to the geometry created within the negative spaces of my mark making.</p>
<p>I embrace and celebrate the modernist tenants of minimalism, which champion the ideas of repetition, sparseness and restraint. I employ these notions as a starting point when composing my paintings, however during the creative process I yield to my desires and end up creating physical depth through the plasticity of paint. In the end, I actualize a more maximalist approach to painting.</p>
<p>The layers of paint in my work encapsulate moments of time, creating visual documents of my daily practice of painting. In the finished work, there is a notable topography on the painting's surface, which is due to the thick applications of paint and multiple layering.</p>
<p>The palette reflects my fascination with psychological responses created by color, specifically how it can evoke personal memories akin to the effects of olfactory memory. Through color, I continue to investigate memory, the history of private life, and the notion of sentimentality."</p>
<p>Susan Dory has received numerous awards and recognition for her work including the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant, the Willard R. Espy Foundation Artist-in-Residence Fellowship and the Behnke Foundation’s Neddy Artist Fellowship.</p>

<p>American painter Betsy Eby’s work emerges from her love of material, surface and the attraction that is created when boundaries are pushed. Her mixed-media material consists of molten beeswax, pigment and damar varnish. She manipulates the viscosity then engages in torching, spattering, dripping and layering her material. Not only is Eby addressing the formal structure of composition and color, she must balance this with the dimension of the wax itself, the way the wax obfuscates color, all the while building to a finished surface that glistens like poured resin. It is a process of constant push and pull. The result is paintings uniquely transparent, with lush and active surfaces, which are simultaneously sensual and contemplative.</p>

<p>Created in January 2002, Holland Symfonia is the merging of the Nederlands Balletorkest and the Noordhollands Philharmonisch Orkest. Both orchestras with their own rich cultural history in the Netherlands. This combined expertise ensured the creation of a dynamic orchestra which can be used in a wide variety of musical settings. Holland Symfonia has three main tasks: performing symphonic concerts, accompanying ballet-, opera- and theatre groups and providing the public with ‘specials' and educational projects. The Philharmonie concert hall in Haarlem is the orchestra's home while the Muziektheater in Amsterdam is used for its musical accompaniments. In the 2006/2007 season Holland Symfonia will celebrate its fifth anniversary.</p>
<p>Since the creation of the orchestra, Holland Symfonia has been the permanent partner of Het Nationale Ballet and it regularly works in unison with the Nationale Reisopera and the Nederlands Dans Theater. In addition, Holland Symfonia accompanies a number of choirs including the Toonkunstkoor Amsterdam.</p>

<p>"Zivilcourage", a German word, expresses the concept of engaged social responsibility. In its usage in the 20th Century, it refers to the courage to oppose fascism. Because this term has no exact correlative in the English lexicon, it should be adopted and cross referenced to the entry in the Wikipedia German edition: <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zivilcourage" class="external free" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zivilcourage" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zivilcourage</a> . In order to place the concept in a proper context for the reader of the English Wikipedia, the entry , Zivilcourage, should be extended beyond a translation of the German entry to include references to Martin King, Malcolm X., Nelson Mandela, M.K. Ghandi and similar figures in the English speaking world.</p>
