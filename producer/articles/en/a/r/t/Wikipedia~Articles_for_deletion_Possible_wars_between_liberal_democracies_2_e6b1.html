<dd><i>For the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a> critics have argued that the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Empire_13a8.html" title="German Empire">German Empire</a> was a democracy, (the <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reichstag.html" title="Reichstag">Reichstag</a> was elected by universal male suffrage and it did vote overwhelmingly to fund the war), or that Britain was not a democracy (only three-fifths of British males could vote, to say nothing of the Empire beyond the Seas, the majority of which had no say in the decision at all). Supporters respond that the German <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kaiser.html" title="Kaiser">Kaiser</a> had the executive power. He appointed and dismissed the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chancellor.html" title="Chancellor">Chancellor</a>, the Imperial officials, and the officers. He could and did declare war together with the not democratically elected <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bundesrat.html" title="Bundesrat">Bundesrat</a>, 30% of which was appointed by the Emperor, and most of the rest by the German princes. The Reichstag had little control over the executive power and its legislative power was greatly limited by the Bundesrat. The Emperor's appointees in the Bundesrat could themselves veto amendments to the <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_German_Empire" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Constitution_of_the_German_Empire">German constitution</a>. In 1913 the Chancellor ignored a <a href="../../../v/o/t/Vote_of_no_confidence.html" title="Vote of no confidence">vote of no confidence</a> and there were often threats of a military <a href="../../../c/o/u/Coup_d%27etat.html" title="Coup d'etat">coup d'etat</a> if the Reichstag should ignore the Emperor on important issues. In effect, therefore, especially in foreign and military affairs, there was little democratic control. The Emperor was also the King of <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prussia.html" title="Prussia">Prussia</a> which had 3/5 of the German population and the Prussian constitution gave him even greater power there. The landed <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristocracy.html" title="Aristocracy">aristocracy</a> of the <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junker.html" title="Junker">Junkers</a> formed the officer corps of the army, dominated Prussia, and had strong influence on national politics as well.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_WW2-1"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Possible_wars_between_liberal_democracies_2_e6b1.html#endnote_WW2-1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Possible_wars_between_liberal_democracies_2_e6b1.html#endnote_WW2-1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></span><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_WW2-2"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Possible_wars_between_liberal_democracies_2_e6b1.html#endnote_WW2-2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Possible_wars_between_liberal_democracies_2_e6b1.html#endnote_WW2-2" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></sup></span><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_WW2-3"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Possible_wars_between_liberal_democracies_2_e6b1.html#endnote_WW2-3" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Possible_wars_between_liberal_democracies_2_e6b1.html#endnote_WW2-3" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></sup></span><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_WW2-4"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Possible_wars_between_liberal_democracies_2_e6b1.html#endnote_WW2-4" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Possible_wars_between_liberal_democracies_2_e6b1.html#endnote_WW2-4" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></sup></span><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_1913"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Possible_wars_between_liberal_democracies_2_e6b1.html#endnote_1913" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Possible_wars_between_liberal_democracies_2_e6b1.html#endnote_1913" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></sup></span> If Britain was not a liberal democracy, then this is another reason why WWI was not a war between democracies.</i></dd>

<dd>This is just two conflcits, there are many other changes. I also added many new conflicts not mentioned in the earlier article. So I do not think that speedy apply. People are already starting to ask questions about the conflicts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Democratic_peace_theory&amp;diff=56287921&amp;oldid=56283739" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Democratic_peace_theory&amp;diff=56287921&amp;oldid=56283739" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, so the information is needed.<a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> 07:36, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Personal essay/research. Being interesting and provoking questions does not make it an encyclopedia article - every newspaper editorial is intended to do that. <a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthenaeum_9647.html" title="User:Athenaeum">Athenaeum</a> 11:48, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I think claims of POV are unsubstanted, the article is not a fork, it is an important appendix which would not be suitable for the main article, which is already too long. The article also stands in its own right as a partial history of war and democracy. Perhaphs more worring is that I think many of the delete votes are actually more to do with the main editor than the article itself and this people would instinctively vote against anything which his name is attached to. While he may be headstrong, ultramarine does have a far better grasp of the DPT litrature than most other editors (myself included)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>To address the POV claim in more detail first some history on the article, this was worked on in my user space and it was my idea to present the data as a table, precicely so that opposing views of the different conflicts could be clearly illustrated, and thrus better address claims of bias.</dd>
<dd>On my talk page <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Pmanderson/Septentrionalis</a> nicely outlined the different views of authors working on DPT:
<ol>
<li>Gowa and other Realists deny that there is an actual democratic peace altogether.</li>
<li>Are democracies at peace only among themselves, or are they more peaceful in general;
<ol>
<li>Peaceful among themselves only: Doyle, Russett, Weart, Gleditsch, Owen, Singer and Small, Mansfield and Snyder, Mueller, Wolff in fact, almost everybody.</li>
<li>Peaceable with non-democracies: Rummel, Ray and half-a-dozen other papers listed above in Mueller and Wolff</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Is the democratic peace an automatic and mechanical thing, or is it a strong statistical tendency?
<ol>
<li>Automatic (and so without exceptions): Rummel, Ray and Weart (as far as I can tell nobody else)</li>
<li>Statistical tendency:Wayman, Bremer, Chan, Cederman, Doyle, Russett, Owen, MW, Gleditisch, Mansfield and Snyder</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Now, this article only adresses point 2.1 whether democracies tend not to go to war with each other, the more contentious issue 2.2 is not addressed (this is also why the <i>Why Rummel is always right</i> name for the article was always off the mark, it is not primarily about Rummels more extreme theory).</dd>
<dd>So we are basically left with a debate between those who study DTP and the Realists, notably Gowa. Gowa gets appropriate coverage in the article. Also note the comment from Pmanderson at the end of 2.1 <i>in fact, almost everybody</i> so there really is little debate on the central thrust of the article. From talking with a friend who has reciently completed a PhD in International Relations is that the field is split into Realists, DTP and a couple of other camps, each groups tends to work in its own camp and there is little cross fertilisation, hence lack of much Realist critique.</dd>
<dd>So why the lack of references to group 3.2, (Russet gets 4 citations). Basically this is not a question adressed here, further most of the studies have been from analysis of the same set of data (compiled by Weart?) which is basically presented here.</dd>
<dd>To conclude, what we have here is the basic set of data used by all those studing DPT, as such it is a useful and interesting resource. The DPT field has in recient times moved on from the binary discussion on the DPT-hypothesis, which is now largely accepted by all in the field (with a lot a cavearts about statistical tendancies etc.) The study has now moved on to other questions examining the Why? question and more sophsticated modeling involving other factors. POV claims are a strawman not reflecing the litrature. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 14:42, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I thank Salix for his kindness.</li>
<li>The basic problem with this article is that it is an argument for a corollary of position 3.1, which is only regarded as important by the three who hold it (and by Ultramarine). This does not reflect the literature. The three involve themselves in a narrow definition of democracy, and peculiar views of history, precisely to prove that two real democracies have never, ever, gone to war; which the rants here are designed to prove. A good article on this could be written, and Matthew White has approached it; but this is not it. This is at best a pile of raw material. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 18:57, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

(For the record, I do not fully support the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Peace_Theory_865b.html" title="Democratic Peace Theory">Democratic Peace Theory</a>, which is completly opposite of <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> position). Unlike these other users, I personally think I could debate <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> on the merits alone. Some of these users, unable to debate <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> on the merits, appear to be using wikipedia policy to silent a contrary opinion.<br />
This vote for deletion is a primae facia example (the evidence speaks for itself) why "democracy" for the wikipedia "<a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Lippmann_4d20.html" title="Walter Lippmann">braying herd</a>" can sometimes be detrimental.<br />
<a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> has done exhastive research on the topic. I was so impressed by this article, last week I e-mailed this article to my <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Relations_9ca1.html" title="International Relations">International Relations</a> professor who talked about <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Peace_Theory_865b.html" title="Democratic Peace Theory">Democratic Peace Theory</a> in our masters degree class last semester.<br />
As per <a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">User talk:Salix alba</a> above: <i>"I think many of the delete votes are actually more to do with the main editor than the article itself and this people would instinctively vote against anything which his name is attached to."</i> Please take up an <a href="../../../r/f/c/RfC_1260.html" title="RfC">RfC</a> against <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a>'s if you disagree with him personally, deleting hundreds of hours of <b>exhaustively researched</b> work for personal reasons is terribly, terribly wrong and against everything that wikipedia stands for.

<li>Travb, you seem to misunderstand the role of Wikipeida. Whether or not the other editors agree with Ultramarine is irrelevant, whether or not they want to "take on Ultramarine on the merits alone" is irrrelvant. Wikipedia is not an ideological battleground. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_battleground" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_battleground" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Wikipedia is not a soapbox. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 21:31, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I can quote wikipolicy too: <i>WIKIPEDIA IS AN ENCYCLOPEDIA: An encyclopedia is a written compendium aiming to convey information on all branches of knowledge.</i> I won't debate you 172, especially when you seemed to miss my entire point.

<li>'<b>Keep!'</b> It is a well-researched and informative article. It needs some clean-up, and a better name would help (who's going to look for it under "Possible wars between liberal democracies"?), but I think it could become a valuable resource. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> (<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Nobody has actually criticized the article except for its being POV.

<li>It's a POV fork of an existing article and the author is merely rephrasing his speculative original research (see previous AfDs above) in the hopes of keeping it after it was previously deleted (a classic POV push, in other words).
