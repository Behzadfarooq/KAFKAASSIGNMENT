But if Lostpedia were not even worthy about being mentioned as a link in an article about the subject it relates to, how could that justify making it a separate Wikipedia article of its own? There should be a compromise in which Lostpedia gets mentioned in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost (TV series)</a>, because the Lostpedia wiki would mainly be of interest or use to people who are looking for more information and/or speculation about the series. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 16:18, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

This is because of neutrality and point-of-view concerns; neutrality is an important objective at Wikipedia, and a difficult one. If it is relevant and informative, mention it on the talk page and let other — neutral — Wikipedia editors decide whether to add the link.” – Blatant fail; their sysops and owner have been trying for several months to spam articles relating to Lost when their neutrality is practically a big problem, if they were notable would not someone independent link them?</li>
<li>“Links that are added to promote a site, that primarily exist to sell products or services, with objectionable amounts of advertising, or that require payment to view the relevant content, colloquially known as external link spamming.” – 3 adverts are pretty objectionable, imho, (left, under content, both Google, and bottom selling hosting.)</li>

<dd>The behaviour of their sysops attempting to get a link to articles and even creating spam articles does not settle well with me, furthermore the “if lostpedia cant get an article, no one can” approach by filling retaliatory AfDs, Prods and Speedy Delete requests was just patently pathetic imo (see history for <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memory_Alpha_f337.html" title="Memory Alpha">Memory Alpha</a>). <small><font face="Tahoma"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></font></small> 16:29, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Sorry, but I don't see why Lostpedia should be deleted and Wookiepedia and Memory Alpha, for examples, shouldn't be kept. Besides, the extensive attempts to find problem with Lostpedia seem more like reaching than genuine concerns. Really, these kinds of frivolous complaints do not improve your arguments. CSS incompatible?? Where? What pages? Copyrights of others? Are you kidding? Lostpedia isn't a site about software piracy (<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astalavista.html" title="Astalavista">Astalavista</a>) or movies (<a href="../../../i/s/o/IsoHunt_1aa2.html" title="IsoHunt">IsoHunt</a>). 3 Advertisements objectionable? CNN.com has just as many. The nytimes.com page has even more. I don't know about the behavior of the sysops there, but there is certainly plenty of verifiable information on the site, and even if there is fan speculation, it is often identified as such, so it's not a problem. Besides, it's not like there isn't published works on Lost(Amazon for example, has at least 3 Unofficial Guides that I could find without looking hard), and it's not a no-name unknown show. So, there are sources for it as well. But seriously, it seems to me that there is some serious personal animus here. That's a concern that tends to make me doubt the fairness of this proposal. Seems to me that this is a conflic that needs to be resolved more than this article needs to be deleted. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:42, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The reason the editors at <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost (TV series)</a> delete links to Lostpedia is, according to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Talk%7ELost_%28TV_series%29_Fansites_e01d.html" title="Talk:Lost (TV series)/Fansites">this discussion</a>, because of all the fancruft. In a straw-poll-like discussion, the consensus seems to have been that Lostpedia does not deserve its own article, and possibly does not even deserve a link from the main Lost article. In that case, why keep? Wouldn't it make more sense to say delete? --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 18:43, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> All the fancruft is hardly an argument. Fancruft is not suitable for wikipedia, yes. But lostpedia is not wikipedia and fancruft should not withhold wikipedia from recognising lostpedia as a notable website. --<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 18:48, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't mean it as an argument to delete. I meant it, in fact, as the opposite: the "gatekeepers" of the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost (TV series)</a> article are probably making a mistake by not including a link. Therefore, merge and redirect could be a viable option. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 18:56, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. As MatthewFenton notes above, there is a long history here (largely by people who otherwise participate either very little or not at all in WP) of trying to get a link to Lostpedia on WP, in any way, shape, or form, including bad faith edits and behavior. Especially given the economic aspects (i.e., WP-driven traffic boosting a site's ad revenue, probably by thousands of dollars a year), we have to be very careful about providing such links. There are dozens of <i>Lost</i>-related fansites, too, so this is a slippery slope. See, for example, the LostCasts AfD at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_LostCasts_5016.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/LostCasts">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/LostCasts</a>. -- <a href="../../../p/k/t/User%7EPKtm_9f50.html" title="User:PKtm">PKtm</a> 18:33, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> According to that reasoning we should delete the links to all sites with ads and not link to any sites because it might increase visitors or leads to a "slippery slope". Lostpedia is an honest attempt at building a Lost encyclopedia, not a money making scheme and it certainly doesn't need wikipedia to get visitors. Also, the comments about editors who support inclusion of lostpedia on wikipedia are bordering on personal attacks. I'd suggest you would withold from making such comments.--<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 19:03, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nope. Sorry, I won't accept that. The facts (specifically, the WP edit non-history of many of the people voting here for Lostpedia inclusion) speak for themselves, and are well documented in the very lengthy discussion at <a href="../../../l/o/s/Talk%7ELost_%28TV_series%29_Fansites_e01d.html" title="Talk:Lost (TV series)/Fansites">Talk:Lost (TV series)/Fansites</a>, which this discussion is threatening to repeat once again, with the same people voting in the same way. And sure, revenue considerations have to be brought into this mix. WP is a powerful traffic driver. The bar of notability has to be kept high; we can't have a site considered notable merely because it has 7000 users, especially when there are very considerable quality concerns about its information and approaches. -- <a href="../../../p/k/t/User%7EPKtm_9f50.html" title="User:PKtm">PKtm</a> 23:09, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Whilst users critique the argument that Wookieepedia and Memory Alpha both have articles, it is a valid point to make, as these articles supposedly passed WP:WEB on the virtue of an article in Sci-fi.com - which Lostpedia has along with much more media coverage to boot. Having been officially recognised by the show producers and company itself on numerous occassions also gives Lostpedia strong notability, as does the response by ABC to set up their own Lost Wiki (undoubtedly in response to the exponential growth the site Lostpedia has experienced in but a year). Thus, Lostpedia deserves to have its own article. And in response to "the slippery slope" I see no real precedence for this, as not to reiterate using the old examples, but allowing other Wikis to have articles did not for instance cause a huge precedent for Star Wars and Star Trek sites being allowed to <i>stay</i> articles on the WP database to my knowledge --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickb123_3rd_b4c7.html" title="User:Nickb123 3rd">Nickb123 3rd</a> 18:36, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

It is also stated that "It is believed that the use of <i>low-resolution</i> images of promotional material ...

<dd>The first "Strong Delete" vote above is made by a user with a long-time history against Lostpedia, and was <i>banned</i> from Lostpedia for making bad-faith edits-- his opinion is clearly biased from reasons external to WP.

<li><b>Delete</b> I see a whole lot of hand waving about "we have other wikis, so we should have this one too." Wrong. A lot of those articles are kind of crappy upon review, and I'd probably express an opinion to delete those if they were to come to AfD; however, that said, the existence of some uncited messes doesn't justify the existence of other uncited messes. We shouldn't lower our standards for inclusion just because some articles inexplicably get kept.

<li><b>STRONG Keep</b> Why this had a listing on AfD to begin with is puzzling to me...it's a verifiable internet webpage that's growing exponentially. I think several people have some biases towards wiki's and want this one to not exist. All of the information can't be on Wikipedia, because it would be deemed non-notable or an indiscriminate collection of information...so Lostpedia is a perfect place for it...and it deserves its own article on here, as this is a general purpose encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonkBirdDuke_b901.html" title="User:MonkBirdDuke">MonkBirdDuke</a> 09:54, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - i somehow get an overwhelming impression just from reading the upper part of this AfD that some users seem to be simply holding some kind of grudge against it. I don't see Lostpedia as obviously failing either <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, and i especially don't see how lostpedia fails them any worse than Wookiepedia or Memory Alpha. Talking about which, i don't see how "unverified fancruft" has anything to do with this. Do people even realize what fancruft means? The opening line of <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a> explains it quite well "<i>Fancruft is a term sometimes used in Wikipedia to imply that a selection of content is of importance only to a small population of enthusiastic fans of the subject in question.</i>". There's nothing wrong with Fancruft, it's not bad. It's just not fit for an encyclopedia. But fansites by definition exist to serve the 'small population of enthusiastic fans'. So-called "Fancruft" is exactly the kind of external sites are supposed to provide, since it's information that's not appropriate on our own encyclopedia. Arguments like this "<i>Blatant fail; their sysops and owner have been trying for several months to spam articles relating to Lost when their neutrality is practically a big problem, if they were notable would not someone independent link them?</i>" is circular. Because even if someone independant added links to lostpedia in wikipedia articles, there is no way to prove who is adding links because they think it's a good idea, and who is adding links because they're affiliated with lostpedia. At the end, it just comes down to the bad faith assumption of "you're adding links to lostpedia, you must be from lospedia and trying to advertise". --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 13:33, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"So far they’ve only really been able to post 'blogs'" Untrue as shown by lostpedia's media coverage page [<a href="http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Lostpedia_media_coverage" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Lostpedia_media_coverage" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>]. References include businessweek, newsday, and wired news (those aren't "trivial" sources, are they?). It is true that there are blogs listed as well, these include ones hosted by sources like the Chicago Tribune, USA today, and the guardian, in most cases written by the TV critic or pop culture columnist for that publication.<br /></dd>
<dd>"No awards cited" SciFi weekly site of the week[<a href="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/sites/sfw13095.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/sites/sfw13095.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>]. For comparison, this is the only reference provided by <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wookieepedia.html" title="Wookieepedia">Wookieepedia</a>, which has its own page. It should be noted that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> says that only one of the three criteria needs to be met to merit inclusion.<br /></dd>
<dd><a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a><br /></dd>
<dd>"Site provides nothing unique, except of course unverifiable fan cruft"<br /></dd>
<dd>A comparison of the two sites shows this to be wrong. For a specific example, compare the wikipedia page <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_Experience_b649.html" title="Lost Experience">Lost Experience</a> with the Lostpedia page for the same topic [<a href="http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Lost_experience" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Lost_experience" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>]. The wikipedia page is fairly detailed, but it is mostly highlights, while the lostpedia version (as far as I can tell) documents it in enough detail that a reader could access every bit of content in the lost experience. This was particularly significant during the online game, as people trying to figure out the puzzles were able to use Lostpedia as a repository of game information while someone referring only to wikipedia wouldn't have sufficient information to solve the puzzles.<br /></dd>
<dd>Trying to write off Lostpedia as "unverifiable fan cruft" seems like a circular argument to me. It's not a legit site because it has nothing unique beyond fancruft, but the info that goes beyond what wikipedia has is defined as fancruft because it is on a site that's not legit. The info that is on Lostpedia generally isn't any less verifiable than the info on the wikipedia lost pages - the primary source is the show itself in the vast majority of cases. And while "cruft" is generally frowned upon on wikipedia (while there's still a fair amount on wiki's Lost pages), wiki policy doesn't list it as a reason for excluding links to external sites.<br /></dd>
<dd>“Any site that contains factually inaccurate material or unverified original research, as detailed in Wikipedia:Reliable sources.” I'm not sure what you consider factually inaccurate or unverified. The info that is on Lostpedia generally isn't any less verifiable or inaccurate than the info on the wikipedia lost pages - the primary source is the show itself in the vast majority of cases, and the information can be verified by watching the show. Obviously, the information on a site operated using wiki principles will never be 100% correct or verified, as I'm sure wikipedia editors will readily admit, but I'd argue the vast majority of information on Lostpedia is accurate, and as inaccurate info is found, it is corrected. Lostpedia does contain fan speculation, but it is clearly marked and kept separate from the factual information. Such speculation is certainly not inappropriate for a show that actively encourages it, and as long as it as it is presented as opinion and not fact, I don't consider it unverified or original research, not any more than a movie data site would be disqualified for containing user reviews in addition to factual info.<br /></dd>
<dd>"their sysops and owner have been trying for several months to spam articles relating to Lost when their neutrality is practically a big problem, if they were notable would not someone independent link them?" In fact, independent parties have added links to lostpedia, here's an example from a user who is a longtime wikipedia editor, doesn't mainly edit Lost articles, and as far as I can tell, isn't a lostpedia participant [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Madison_%28dog%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66242554" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Madison_%28dog%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66242554" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>]. This link was deleted with the reason given being "rm spam" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Madison_%28dog%29&amp;diff=82172252&amp;oldid=80507712" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Madison_%28dog%29&amp;diff=82172252&amp;oldid=80507712" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>] even though that was clearly not the intent when it was posted, evidence of bad faith editing on the part of MatthewFenton. From what I've seen (and obviously, I admit it's difficult if even possible to find every instance where links to lostpedia have been added) it's entirely possible that links to lostpedia are automatically assumed to be bad faith "spam" edits, whether they are or not. Above is certainly one example of that happening.<br /></dd>
<dd>I'd also like to see a reference to where the owner of Lostpedia has added a link to it. If this has happened, I'd agree that this is a neutrality violation. However, in the case of a site that is open to public contribution, it seems likely that many people who would find the site notable could choose to participate in it themselves, thus disqualifying themselves from writing about the site.</dd>
<dd>Also on the topic of neutrality, if it is a conflict of interest for those participating in Lostpedia to add links to it, I'd argue that it's also a conflict of interest for those participating in Lostpedia to delete links to it as well. Specifically in the case of MatthewFenton, he declared his bad faith intentions on Lostpedia [<a href="http://www.lostpedia.com/index.php?title=User:MatthewFenton&amp;oldid=103470" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lostpedia.com/index.php?title=User:MatthewFenton&amp;oldid=103470" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>], immediately began a major edit that would have had an effect on the entire site, without getting any input from other users [<a href="http://www.lostpedia.com/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=MatthewFenton" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lostpedia.com/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=MatthewFenton" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>], and as a result was banned from the site. If the opinions and edits of those involved with Lostpedia are to be ignored (not that I necessarily agree with it, but it has been argued), I'd suggest that MatthewFenton should be included in that group. And after all, if Lostpedia is truly not notable as some argue, wouldn't someone independent remove the link?<br /></dd>
<dd>"adverts are pretty objectionable, imho" Your opinion. There are quite a few similar sites that have pages on wikipedia that have quite a bit more advertising. And lostpedia certainly doesn't "primarily exist to sell products or services", especially since the site doesn't sell things at all - looking at the site, I don't find a way to send lostpedia money if I wanted to.<br /></dd>
<dd>"Website uses CSS incompatible with MSIE." I just looked at lostpedia and was able to access it just fine with MSIE. If you're talking about a cosmetic feature not being supported, that doesn't make the site "inaccessible". If you weren't able to access the site, how were you able to create a user account and edit the site, much less read the site to determine whether it's deserving of inclusion on wikipedia?</dd>
<dd>"Unwilling to fix their blatant violations of GFDL and US copyright even when assistance is rendered." Simply not true. Since MatthewFenton was at lostpedia and edited there, his recommendations for GDFL and copyright notices were taken, and the images he referenced in his comments there now have GDFL and other copyright notices. "Unwilling to fix" isn't the same as unwilling to let a brand new user singlehandedly implement a copyright notice policy with no input from the community (particularly one who had made a public declaration of bad faith).<br /></dd>
<dd>“if lostpedia cant get an article, no one can” While I frown upon Lostpedia users creating AfDs for other articles in "retaliation", I think an argument can be made for doing that in good faith. Articles like Memory Alpha and Wookieepedia have been referenced in comparison, and those arguing that Lostpedia doesn't meet WP:WEB or WP:EL have made arguments that, when applied to those other pages, those pages fail as well. In each of these discussions, there have also been wiki editors who have spoken in favor of deleting Lostpedia references, and have favored deleting the two above articles for the same reasons. If a Lostpedia reference is deleted, and criteria given for the deletion, shouldn't other articles that fall under the same criteria be considered for deletion as well? The question is simply, should a set of standards be applied to one article but not another?<br /></dd>
<dd>"it is pretty obvious to me by the way their sysops have behaved in attempting to get links and an article here that they generally require the traffic Wikipedia would generate (hence a bigger income from the Google ad words et cetera)"</dd>
<dd>Lostpedia sysops don't make money from lostpedia, if any profit is made at all (since obviously hosting a site costs money, and income has to cover expenses first), it would only go to the owner of the site. Such an accusation seems ad hominem and unfounded. A similar accusation could be made of the editors of the Lost pages on wikipedia - that they have been removing links to Lostpedia because they're worried that traffic there would decrease traffic to wikipedia. MatthewFenton has also made accusations that Lostpedia engages in google bombing. Are there facts to back up that accusation?<br /></dd>
<dd>Sorry for the length of this, but I don't want to see a decision like this made based on incorrect (if not intentionally misleading) information. Thanks to all of you who have participated in this discussion - and for those of you have have voted "per MatthewFenton" to be aware that a number of his statements are factually incorrect and that he has shown bias and bad faith in regards to Lostpedia.

<dd>[disclosure: I have participated heavily in the Lost article's discussion on this topic. I am in no way affiliated with Lostpedia, as some have implied. I have occasionally read Lostpedia as a resource, and have been impressed with its scope. In particular, its unfounded speculation has been a source of some entertainment and insight to me. If competing sites meet or exceed Lostpedia in value and/or notoriety, I'd be prepared to support them in addition to, or instead of, Lostpedia.]</dd>
<dd>In the ongoing side discussion of the Lost article <a href="../../../l/o/s/Talk%7ELost_%28TV_series%29_Fansites_e01d.html" title="Talk:Lost (TV series)/Fansites">found here</a>, the bulk of the arguments against a link to Lostpedia have been around claims that Wikipedia policy prohibits an external link to Lostpedia in any context. That is, according to some, a mere line item in the External Links section of the Lost article pointing to Lostpedia, would be a prima facie violation of Wikipedia policy. The comments on this AfD page expose such claims as misguided at best.</dd>
<dd>Since this is a discussion on whether to delete an article about Lostpedia, and not about whether to link Lostpedia in the Lost article, I am forced to support keeping the Lostpedia article, if only as a means of notifying Wikipedia readers about a valuable Lost resource. A single link from Wikipedia:Lost(tv) to Lostpedia would satisfy all my concerns about offering potentially valuable outside resources to our readers. Failing that, I'll have to support a separate Lostpedia article, since an internal link could not be so mis-objected to, by some Lost article editors.</dd>
<dd>P.S. Lostpedia does not appear to be hurting for findability. The Google terms <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=lost+wiki&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=lost+wiki&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">"lost wiki"</a> currently turn up these results: Lostpedia, Wikipedia's Lost article, Wikia's Lost section, ABC's Lost wiki offering, and finally a large number of obscure Lost-related sites. --<a href="../../../l/o/q/User%7ELoqi_T._3d37.html" title="User:Loqi T.">Loqi T.</a> 00:32, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><s><b>Keep.</b></s> Well, what can I say? If it's good enough for Matthew Fenton, it's good enough for me. I'm switching my recommendation to an unambiguous <i>keep.</i> In general, I'd rather we include a page that no-one much is interested in, than to exclude a page that someone might be looking for. Not everyone shares this philosophy, or uses the same threshold of notability, but when in doubt, I tend to go with inclusion. Lostpedia seems to meet the notability threshold of more than a few people who know the ropes around here, and this has influenced my evaluation. In addition, if it doesn't get its page this time, we're likely to be right back here the next time it shows up as a news item somewhere; or worse, we might be too sick of the topic to give it another fair consideration for a while. --<a href="../../../l/o/q/User%7ELoqi_T._3d37.html" title="User:Loqi T.">Loqi T.</a> 02:37, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He attempts to imply that he's participated in other AfD discussions, when this is actually the only one in which he's ever been involved.

We want to eliminate a bizarre hypocracy where nearly every other TV show lists notable fansites, while a few self-proclaimed "gatekeepers" insist that the Lost entry be free of fansites. As for the complaints that hardcore Lostpedians do not spend time editing Lost entries at WP, that seems pretty ridiculous - we have our own site to update &amp; maintain, and we've gotten the clear sense from many that we're not welcome. --<a href="../../../j/a/j/User%7EJajasoon_7c7a.html" title="User:Jajasoon">Jajasoon</a> 02:35, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What a long and torturous discussion this is already. My condolences to the admin who finally volunteers to sort this discussion out.

A few allegations were made above and some links provided but none which convince me that this website really qualifies under our generally accepted inclusion criteria. While this site has been mentioned in some reputable sources, not enough of the coverage was <i>primarily</i> about this website. The ones I reviewed were casual mentions in an article on a related but different topic. Being scifi.com's website of the week is a very low standard - not in keeping with my understanding of the intent of that clause of WP:WEB. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 02:46, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

The 1570-word, 3 page comments of Milo H Minderbender were trimmed to his "abstention" introduction about inaccuracies, and the continuation moved to the discussion page; they were exclusively a reply to (and about) MatthewFenton, and did not deal with any actual Wikipedia policy-- instead discussed personal, off-site disagreements that would likely be classified under <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>.

<li>I can't disagree strongly enough with your assertion "These comments were appropriate to move to the discussion page, as they were exclusively a reply to (and about) MatthewFenton, and did not deal with any actual Wikipedia policy-- instead discuss personal disagreements that would likely be classified under <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>." These comments directly deal with Wikipedia policy and more specifically to this AfD. How is disputing the claim that an article cited for notability is a blog (a link to one of the articles in question: [<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_30/b3994072.htm?chan=tc&amp;chan=technology_technology+index+page_more+of+today's+top+stories" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_30/b3994072.htm?chan=tc&amp;chan=technology_technology+index+page_more+of+today's+top+stories" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>]) a personal attack, much less irrelevant to the topic? From WP:NPA let me quote: "<b>Disagreements about content such as "Your statement about X is wrong" or "Your statement is a point of view, not fact" are not personal attacks.</b>" I also made accusations of bad faith, and backed up those accusations with examples and evidence. You obviously feel that the posting record of people voting here and their credibility is relevant because you have made accusations of SPA and conflict of interest. I believe I have made no personal attacks in my comments here; if you feel that something I've said falls under NPA, the more appropriate response is to single it out so that I may either clarify my remark, or withdraw it and apologize for it. In addition, WP:ARCHIVE (assuming I understand it correctly) applies to archiving an entire page, not selectively removing comments, so it doesn't apply here. (not to mention that it applies to talk pages, which I don't believe this is) I'm not sure that archiving an AfD while it is still in progress is even allowed by wikipedia policy. In addition, WP:REFACTOR says; "<b>refactoring of talk pages must preserve the full intentions of the original authors</b>", which you certainly didn't do in regards to my comments. In regard to length, I was unaware that there was a word or page limit on AfD comments, could you point me to the WP policy that spells it out? --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 19:11, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I don't see any evidence that the Sci-Fi site of the week award is well-known, but I would still consider the "review", as it's described there, as non-trivial coverage. Footnote 4 of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> seems to support using reviews in this fashion. The <a href="http://miva.sctimes.com/miva/cgi-bin/miva?publicus/blogs.mv+blogAction=post&amp;blogid=LKohman&amp;postid=205" class="external text" title="http://miva.sctimes.com/miva/cgi-bin/miva?publicus/blogs.mv+blogAction=post&amp;blogid=LKohman&amp;postid=205" rel="nofollow">St. Cloud Times write-up</a> is marginal, but coverage of Lostpedia is about half of the seven paragraphs, so I'd also consider that non-trivial coverage. Having about 1.5 media coverages gives it just more than one, and "more than one" was the definition of multiple in three of the four dictionaries I checked. Ergo, weak keep. (Though I considered it, the Guardian article strikes me as trivial.)--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 17:14, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: If a web site being reviewed anywhere constitutes notability enough for a WP article, then there are probably thousands of web sites that would get articles, which doesn't seem like the answer. There's a whole publishing industry out there covering new web sites, so a couple of citations (particularly one from a pretty minor publication like the St. Cloud Times) aren't exactly a rare commodity, and don't constitute true notability. -- <a href="../../../p/k/t/User%7EPKtm_9f50.html" title="User:PKtm">PKtm</a> 17:42, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> WP:WEB says <i>"the subject of multiple non-trivial published works"</i>. If you feel that the wikipedia policy sets the bar too low, the solution is to try and change the policy, not to ignore the policy. There's a more complete list of references at [<a href="http://lostpedia.com/wiki/Lostpedia:Media_Coverage" class="external autonumber" title="http://lostpedia.com/wiki/Lostpedia:Media_Coverage" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>], some of which have been included in previous versions of the article. There are a decent number, although not many are the main point of the article; I certainly feel like there are enough references to qualify as "multiple", especially considered along with the fact that LP was inluded in <i>The Lost Experience</i>. Feel free to add appropriate ones back in. And if you feel that LP doesn't meet WP:WEB, how do you feel about the inclusion of <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wookieepedia.html" title="Wookieepedia">Wookieepedia</a>? --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 19:21, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. As per Milo H Minderbinder, Lostpedia meets WP:WEB, WP:EL and the arguments against its layout, wiki nature or text adverts are spurious. As per Angela and others, the site has a significant number of users, outstripping Wookiepedia and Memory Alpha, and is gaining increasing media coverage. The amount of media coverage it has already attained is enough to be notable. There are many Wikipedia editors who have formed either an outdated or inaccurate opinion about Lostpedia's verifiability and notability, I hope the facts revealed by this discussion convinces them to rethink. 195.173.23.111 10:28, 30 October 2006 (UTC) (if you have a problem with me being an IP address, have a look at my contribs - I have edited under this address since February and edit both LOST and non-LOST topics regularly.

<dd>I think accusing Wikipedia of being afraid of competition is a bit much, I think its more to do with the quite young keepers of the LOST article (I won't say moderators, as none of them are) feeling this fierce pride in their work, and a wish on their behalf not to link to other sites that also cover this content, arguably with better information. Many sites are like this. <a href="http://www.digitalspy.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.digitalspy.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Digital Spy</a> won't let you do this, and <a href="http://www.lost-media.com" class="external text" title="http://www.lost-media.com" rel="nofollow">Lost Media</a> won't either. Its a shame that something like Wikipedia, and the web in general, which are supposed to be for sharing knowledge and information, can be hijacked by people who are fiercely competitive, rather than collaborative. --217.65.158.91 12:34, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
