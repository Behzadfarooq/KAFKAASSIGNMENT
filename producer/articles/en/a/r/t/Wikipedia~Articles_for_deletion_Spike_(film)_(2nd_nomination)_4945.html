"All articles about anticipated events must be verifiable"? Check. "The subject matter must be of sufficiently wide interest that it would merit an article if the event had already occurred"? Check. "Provided that discussion is properly referenced"? Check. "If preparation for the event isn't already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented"? Check. Wikipedia policy does not forbid articles about anticipated events, as long as that anticipated event is held to the same standards of verifiability and notability that other articles are held to. — <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhedonette_62db.html" title="User:Whedonette">Whedonette</a> <small>(<a href="../../../w/h/e/User_talk%7EWhedonette_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Whedonette">ping</a>)</small> 02:52, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Of the 12 sources listed for the article, six of them are from Whedonesque.com which <a href="http://whedonesque.com/?read=about" class="external text" title="http://whedonesque.com/?read=about" rel="nofollow">is</a> "a community weblog discussing the work of TV maker Joss Whedon. Anyone can post a story or comment to this site, as long as it pertains to Joss Whedon's work." These are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Another is claimed to be from TV Guide but is in fact another post from Whedonesque.com. The Wizarduniverse.com source doesn't mention this project specifically, merely that "certain [unnamed] characters" are being "saved." The TVguide.com source is apparently dead. The few remaining sources all say in one way or another that this film will not be made. This isn't well-documented, this isn't properly referenced and it's not expected ever to happen by the people who would be directly involved so it's not legitimately an "anticipated" event. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 05:51, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - If all the references out there were secondary and there was no primary source to be had, this would merely be speculation, and mere speculation is deletable. That the Whedonesque.com sources are secondary, quoting primary sources, knocks them down a notch in reliable source standards. It does not, however, prevent one from traversing out to the primary sources and verifying that a movie, of this topic and proposed name, has been in discussion and planning by Whedon and crew. This clearly and easily passes the "Is it real or not?" credibility test once those sources are reviewed, which is the most important part of the speculation / crystal ball policies. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 01:06, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>"Posts to bulletin boards, Usenet, and wikis, or <b>messages left on blogs</b>, should not be used as sources." Pretty clear-cut. A message on a blog to the effect of "I heard Amy Acker say this at a con" is worthless as a source. Stripped of the material that's sourced with non-sources and the speculation, the article would read that there was a movie suggested about Spike, that James Marsters said in passing in an interview he'd play it if it happened within five years and that no one who would be primarily involved in the film thinks it's going to be made. Not even remotely close to meeting basic standards of inclusion. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:22, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. While it would be better to source some of those Whedonesque posts (where Joss and company are known to post and comment anyway) to their actual sources, this doesn't meet the crystal ball standard. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:16, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree. Part of the crystal ball policy says "notable and almost certain to take place" the article itself says the project now will not get made, and speculation is not notable. Thousands of projects "alomost" get done, only ones in process or complete should be noted. <a href="../../../w/e/b/User%7EWebwarlock_0a2d.html" title="User:Webwarlock">Web Warlock</a> 16:33, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It doesn't meet the crytal ball standard not because it likely won't get made, but rather because it was a well-reported film that never quite took off, and has a fairly important addition to the larger Buffyverse because of that. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 02:42, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
