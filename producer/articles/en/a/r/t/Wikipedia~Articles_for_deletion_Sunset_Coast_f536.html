<dd><b>Comment</b> - not one of the responses so far have addressed the actual reasons for deletion. The simplest google search would find the commercial promotional web page most of the information initially came from. Which begs the question of plagiarism from a website. The term is not commonly used by local news media, it is a commercial construct. It is not a major geographic region - it is a narrow coastline - a mere small component of the <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swan_Coastal_Plain_1e4b.html" title="Swan Coastal Plain">Swan Coastal Plain</a>. On the basis of possible plagiarism, and lack of addressing the actual reason for deletion - from my perspecctive the keep comments carry no weight whatsoever. <a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatuSuro_2646.html" title="User talk:SatuSuro">SatuSuro</a> 02:32, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>One possibility is to change it to a redirect - but to what I'm not exactly sure (possibly Perth, Western Australia). If it survives as an article, it should be purely about a name and campaign devised by the WA Government's tourism department and its success or failure based on a range of sources, rather than about the region - the fact is that as you said, very few people in Western Australia use the name. I might see what I can find and propose an alternative article. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 02:41, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> You haven't established that it is self-publicity. I don't think the Sunset Coast is a Wikipedia editor. The article is a stub, and doesn't seem to have enough information sources to verify your second point. However, please give me a link to the exact guideline which says that the article should be deleted for this reason, and I will look it over and repsond. <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_climbing.html" title="Rock climbing">Rock climbing</a> sucked as an article, but no one thought it should be deleted because of that.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Pretty much most of the content there now is irrelevant. As for the name - It's a bit of a weird one, in that it is an official (tourist) name that is not used extensively locally, that seems to have been "sub-let" by the Tourism Department of the WA Government to a private tourism association who promote their own members. So it's not WP:CORP, but the current article verges on it. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 02:51, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Certainly exists and is verifiable, but noteworthy? Maybe. Very few locals use the term and I suspect it was designed as part of a minor but now largely defunct marketing campaign. The article needs some more focus on that campaign.

When the article was created a number of <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarborough%2C_Western_Australia_47d9.html" title="Scarborough, Western Australia">"It's part of Sunset Coast."</a> sentences were scattered(spammed) through various WA articles with no apparent attempt to inculde into the prose of the articles.

<dd><b>Response to</b> <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> - Please cite any wording if that has been used to promote the tourist company in the Sunset Coast article! Please note that it has been linked up to various WA relevant articles, because those coastlines or beaches are in fact part of Sunset Coast, as a Wikipedia editor, this is my responsibility and right to make supplement based on <a href="../../../t/e/x/Text_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License_eaec.html" title="Text of the GNU Free Documentation License">GFDL</a>. In practice, most significant places used to attract tourists that locals are always seldom go even don't know it exists. For example, the Pinnacle Desert in WA, the peak in Hong Kong, the Hollywood Boulevard (Hollywood Walk of Fame )in Los Angeles etc. Those all usually ignored by locals. But it doesn’t mean they don’t exist or not important. Again, this is one of evidences show that Sunset Coast is an official name used in the current Website of Department of Planning and infrastructure Government of Western Australia (designed for locals) - <a href="http://www.dpi.wa.gov.au/cycling/1926.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.dpi.wa.gov.au/cycling/1926.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpi.wa.gov.au/cycling/1926.asp</a> Widen the sight!--<a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfeewusy_f0de.html" title="User:Alfeewusy">Alfeewusy</a> 16:00, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Response and Question</b> Let me see if I understand you correctly. It's a name coined for the purposes of tourism, so discussing the promotion of tourism in the article is tantamount to advertising for the tourism agency? So, discussing tourism on Wikipedia is not allowed? What about advertising? Is there an article on <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_Commercials_55d1.html" title="Super Bowl Commercials">Super Bowl Commercials</a>? If this mentions a specific commercial, it should be deleted because mentioning a commercial is the equivalent of advertising that commercial?

<li><b>Comment</b> An example of its use - "Promote beaches - expert", <i>The West Australian</i>, <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_25.html" title="November 25">25 November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, p.&#160;11. "Mills said that WA's politicians, planners, developers and the community had to decide whether they wanted WA's beaches, particularly the Sunset Coast, promoted as tourism destination, and if so, how that could be achieved. Sunset Coast Tourism Association vice-president, Andrew Slomp, said the Sunset coastal strip had to develop its own identity, like Fremantle and the Swan Valley. However, Slomp added that the association was not interested in development similar to the Gold Coast." In a real estate writeup in September 2002 from the Sunday Times: "WITH land prices booming along the Sunset Coast, the shack at 40 Branksome Gardens must be one of Perth's hottest properties." So as you can see, it's not used in the same way as one would use the Gold Coast as a location, or Perth as an area (any Perth person would just say "Perth" or "northern suburbs" or "Scarborough") - but does exist from a tourism promotion point of view. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 04:37, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
