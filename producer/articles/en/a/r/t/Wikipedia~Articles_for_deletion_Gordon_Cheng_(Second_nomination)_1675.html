<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Looking at his entry at Matthias Media <a href="http://www.matthiasmedia.com.au/about/people.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.matthiasmedia.com.au/about/people.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, it seems clear that he's a church worker of long standing, but he doesn't seem to meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 13:10, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - he is more than just a church worker of good standing. He is a senior editor of the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Briefing_d6e8.html" title="The Briefing">The Briefing</a></i>. According to the notability guideline, he fulfills the "published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more". <i>The Briefing</i> is circulated to way more readers than that. He has a great deal of influence over the readership as he writes a great deal of editorial content. Gordon has also created several evangelistic aids. Basically, Gordon is extremely notable in his sphere of influence, that is, <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Anglicanism_9432.html" title="Sydney Anglicanism">Sydney Anglicanism</a>. He was quoted in the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> on a spat and defamation case between Dr Belinda Goodenough and South Coogee Anglican church (see <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/blog-sparks-talk-of-womens-subordination-in-church/2006/03/29/1143441215880.html" class="external text" title="http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/blog-sparks-talk-of-womens-subordination-in-church/2006/03/29/1143441215880.html" rel="nofollow">article</a>). Evidently the SMH believes he is a notable spokesperson for the Anglican church in Sydney. Gordon was also the former Pastor of St Matthias Centennial Park, the church that basically sets the agenda for conservative evanglical Sydney Anglicanism. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 13:26, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I looked at that link when researching my vote. Nowhere in the article does the Herald give the impression it thinks he is "he is a notable spokesperson for the Anglican church in Sydney". It quotes him because on the forum debate the article discusses, his was the lone dissenting voice. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 13:30, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The <i>Herald</i> is not in the habit of just quoting non-notable bloggers and chat posters. The only time I have ever seen them do this was when a sport scandal erupted, and a riot happened in Cronulla. In those cases they <i>certainly</i> didn't call the posters and ask for their confirmation of their comments! Therefore, I stand by all my statements. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 13:32, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know whether the Herald quotes unnotable bloggers as a matter of course, but it does so three times (apart from Mr Cheng) during the course of the article you cited. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 13:36, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, you can believe that he isn't notable if you'd like. However, you haven't addressed any of my other points. Out of interest, are you familiar with Sydney Anglicanism? - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 13:38, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your other points aren't backed up with proof. In this process, the onus is on editors who want to keep an article to provide proof of their claims. If you can provide a source for the statement that The Briefing generates sales of more than 5,000 (freesheets don't count), then I will change my vote. Otherwise, it sounds as though this person merits a mention in the article on Sydney Anglicanism, but not his own biography.<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 13:48, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Briefing costs $55 for a years subscription. I'm afraid I don't have exact figures on circulation, but I have been informed by Matthias Media themselves (the publishers of this monthly magazine) that they have figures of about 6,000 subscribers. They are not a free newspaper. The Briefing is one of the main publications of the Sydney Anglican church, and is published by <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthias_Media_7157.html" title="Matthias Media">Matthias Media</a>. As I have said, the <i>Herald</i> quoted Gordon because he is quite outspoken and is a senior editor of the <i>The Briefing</i>. I'm sure if you would like to verify the circulation figures that they would be quite happy to confirm. Their email address is thebriefing at matthiasmedia.com.au (kept non email address format to reduce spam). - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 14:00, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - He is clearly borderline, but the article is not a PR instrument, and he's published, and quoted. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 13:45, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have no intention of letting it become a P.R. instrument&#160;:-) I don't agree with all Gordon's views, or the way he goes about everything, though I have quite a great deal of respect for the man. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 14:02, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Excuse me, but notability arguments really should be discussed on AFD. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 14:34, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agreed: <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> and myself have been discussing this civilly and have both put forward resources to help other editors decide a position.

<li>Excuse me? How long has there been a "no debating" rule on AfD, and how may we convince the lunatics to relinquish control of this asylum? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 15:04, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I normally don't like to add 'me too' comments, but why would a discussion of notability re an article nominated for deletion on the basis of non-notability not be discussed / debated on the relevant AfD page? <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Colon</a><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_Esperanza_bb00.html" title="User:Col tom/Esperanza"><font color="green">el</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Tom</a> 15:18, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This guy meets notability in my book. Whether it is among a particular community or not, the Anglican Church is rather large in Australia. No, I've never heard of him, but regardless. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastique_e135.html" title="User:Bastique"><b>B</b>astique</a><span class="Unicode" style="color:#FF72E3;">▼</span><b><sup><a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBastique_d47c.html" title="User talk:Bastique">parler</a></sup></b> <sub><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bastique_7452.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bastique">voir</a></b></sub> 14:42, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Seems to be an author of some minor publications only, and we typically do not have articles on people with editorial positions in comparable companies. In what way does this person rise above the common herd? <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:01, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I agree with TBSDY here. He is very notable within the Anglican community, which is, let me tell you, a <i>pretty freaking large one</i>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 15:04, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless significantly expanded to explain his notability. If I had stumbled across this article and it hadn't had an AFD tag on it, I would have speedied it for having no assertion of notability. Maybe he's notable enough for an encyclopedia article, but if so, <i>this</i> article doesn't show it. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">c</a>) 18:09, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In that case, if that was a valid speedy deletion then I think that our speedy deletion is broken and I would have undeleted and listed on AFD. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 10:17, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Ta bu shi da yu, fulfilling the "published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more" portion of WP:BIO. <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F_6995.html" title="User:Yamaguchi先生">Yamaguchi先生</a> 22:35, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. A search of an Australia/New Zealand database came up with 26 hits for "Gordon Cheng" in relation to his role in the Sydney Anglican Church. This makes him notable enough for mine as well as verifiable. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 00:51, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I seem to recall recommending on DRV that this article should simply be undeleted, and shouldn't be listed for deletion again, because it obviously passed the guidelines and wasn't going to be deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> as per Ta bu shi da yu and what I have said on the first deletion debate. Although I would add that if Gordon Cheng is worthy of inclusion, some other notable Christian authors in the Sydney Diocese (like Tony Payne and John Dickson (especially the latter)) deserve articles too. Thanks to everyone for the sensible deletion debate though - some good points have been made and it hasn't been an indiscriminate deletion for the point of it.
