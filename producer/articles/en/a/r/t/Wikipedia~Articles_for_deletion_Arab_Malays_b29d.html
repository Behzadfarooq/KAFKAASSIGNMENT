<dd>I have observed that there are categories such as <a href="../../../e/u/r/Category%7EEurasians_5815.html" title="Category:Eurasians">Category:Eurasians</a> and so on--categories and articles of people like this describing people of mixed descent. Malays with Arab, European and other racial blood lines are abundant throughout Malaysia and Singapore, and Arab-Malays means people of these two races stated above.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>People with Arab bloodlines, and in fact there are a significant number of Malays with Arab bloodlines (see Category:Arab-Malays, of which many have made it up to the top ranks of society. Also, check out the article of <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Singaporeans_6631.html" title="Arab Singaporeans">Arab Singaporeans</a>. Arab contribution to the SE Asian region is very significant. This fact should not be belittled.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, much of the content here are provided with proper references. And unless there are policies and guidelines that explicitely point that such articles are prohibited, I see that there is no point in deleting these categories. I have noted that all of you people are of American or European background who lacked the understanding of Southeast-asian topics. Please read more about the Arab history of Singapore and Malaysia before reconsidering their notability. I believe that the Arab and European prescence in Malay Muslim SE Asia is as notable, if not more that the notability of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_Hongkongers_a23b.html" title="Category:British Hongkongers">Category:British Hongkongers</a> and the Japanese <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halvsie.html" title="Halvsie">Halvsie</a>. Why didn't you all vote for deletion of that cat then? If you still think so otheriwse, please explain why. All of you might also want to take a look of my opinion at <a href="../../../f/a/n/User_talk%7EFantastic4boy_418e.html" title="User talk:Fantastic4boy">User talk:Fantastic4boy</a>.</dd>

<dd>Still, I feel that it's best to ask the opinions of the Malays themselves. Being a non-Malay myself, I think it is the best that such issues are up to the Malays to decide. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Tan_d5d8.html" title="User:Mr Tan">Mr Tan</a> 06:57, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Mr Tan, who exactly are the Malay? There are a multitude of varying definitions ranging from everyone in South East Asia (the definition used by these articles), to more precise and academically correct definitions. The use of term Malay as a race was a misnomer first proposed in British colonial times. Its use is no longer relevant and it is factually incorrect. As others have mentioned above, any ethnic group articles which are created need to be supported by reliable sources. When one racial or ethnic group breeds with another this does not necessarily constitute a new ethnic group. Please supply <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that the ethnic group <i>Arab Malays</i> exists and is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">notable</a>.

<p>Look up books on the general history of Singapore/Malaysia, and take note of notabel Arab-Malay families like Alsagoff, Alkaff and so on. Some books include <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Singapore-Pictorial-1819-2000-Gretchen-Liu/dp/981301881X" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Singapore-Pictorial-1819-2000-Gretchen-Liu/dp/981301881X" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Check the internet, or your library for the books on the history of these two countries. <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Kuan_Yew_c963.html" title="Lee Kuan Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a>'s biography also noted that <a href="../../../s/y/e/Syed_Jaafar_Albar_5d4c.html" title="Syed Jaafar Albar">Syed Jaafar Albar</a> is part Arab. I can't list out all now, and use your mental flexibility to find these sources, everyone involved. I have given the starting hints. (See also <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_European_Malays_110f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/European Malays">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/European Malays</a>. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Tan_d5d8.html" title="User:Mr Tan">Mr Tan</a> 07:47, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll repeat again. These articles are about <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_groups.html" title="Ethnic groups">ethnic groups</a>, as defined <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnologists.html" title="Ethnologists">ethnologists</a>. Just because one ethnic groups mates with another does not mean a new independent ethnic group is formed. Please supply <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that the ethnic group <i>Arab Malays</i> exists and is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">notable</a>.

(<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelJLowe_6191.html" title="User:MichaelJLowe">MichaelJLowe</a> 07:54, 19 January 2007 (UTC))
<dl>
<dd>BTW, I put the term <i>"arab malays" -wikipedia</i> into Google and got <i>45 hits</i>. This article certainly seems like <a href="../../../o/r/i/WP%7Eoriginal_research_5fb4.html" title="WP:original research">original research</a> to me.

</dd>
<dd>For your information, this article is edited in parallel to <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurasian_%28mixed_ancestry%29.html" title="Eurasian (mixed ancestry)">Eurasian (mixed ancestry)</a>, <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristang_people.html" title="Kristang people">Kristang people</a> and Halvise. Both Eurasian and Arab-Malays are not ethnic groups. There is no rule that we cannot write about articles of terminologies on interracial affairs. And if you want to know the notablity of arab malays in SE Asia, check out the Syed Alsagoff family in Singapore (Check the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Singapore_eba5.html" title="History of Singapore">History of Singapore</a>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nor is there any original research. The sources are directly found in Arab malays, <a href="http://www.colorq.org/meltingpot/Asia/ArabMalays.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.colorq.org/meltingpot/Asia/ArabMalays.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The references at <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Singaporeans_6631.html" title="Arab Singaporeans">Arab Singaporeans</a> are <b>equally reliable sources</b>. Also, there is no need for you to be so rigid as to type in the exact terminology of "Arab malays". On the contary, there are also a lot of articles on this topic--eg:<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=arab+singapore+yemeni&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=mss&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;vc=&amp;fp_ip=SG" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=arab+singapore+yemeni&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=mss&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;vc=&amp;fp_ip=SG" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Or, otherwise, we could perhaps redirect this article to Arabs in Southeast Asia, Arabs in Malaysia or something like that. I can accept something like <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_Hongkongers_a23b.html" title="Category:British Hongkongers">Category:British Hongkongers</a> instead of category:Arab-Malays where all notable of part or full British decsnet are being classified into here, or <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Singaporeans_6631.html" title="Arab Singaporeans">Arab Singaporeans</a> which people of part or full arab descent are being discussed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, I must note that deleting content totally like this is destabilising the consistency and all of you are contesting the validity of articles on interracial affairs like <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macanese_people.html" title="Macanese people">Macanese people</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halvsie.html" title="Halvsie">Halvsie</a> and so on. I can't get it, if you mean that these content are really deleted. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Tan_d5d8.html" title="User:Mr Tan">Mr Tan</a> 15:04, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would have less of an issue with an article called Arab Malaysians given its more precise focus. However, the article would still have to pass notability requirements. If it doesn't, then any notable information could be rolled into a more general article such as a list of notable Malay people, or notable Malaysian people [[<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelJLowe_6191.html" title="User:MichaelJLowe">MichaelJLowe</a> 20:44, 19 January 2007 (UTC)]]</dd>

This is not a notable reason, only to state one person get married with a Malay person and you then created WP article for that? What about Turkish Malays married with Arab Malays, would you want to create Turkish Arab Malays Malays article? There are thousands of combination if you want to create this similar article.

<li><s><b>Strong Keep</b></s> [change to <b>Delete</b> as per nom, unless adequate sourcing could be provided] although the article needs beefing up in sources, it's a good start. All this business about racial groups and intermarriage is balderdash. Think culture and behavior and whether certain people perceive themselves as part of a group — those are the criteria for whether the group exists or not. This article shows that this distinct ethnic group exists and has particular characteristics. That is an important contribution to understanding Malaysia and therefore an important addition to Wikipedia. The "Malay" part of this refers to the nation or state in which this cultural group is located. Anyone supporting deletion of this article should support deletion of <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_American_4105.html" title="Italian American">Italian American</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_American_b5d5.html" title="Irish American">Irish American</a> (which would be ridiculous because lack of knowledge about these ethnic groups would hobble anyone's understanding of the modern U.S.) or be able to say what the difference is. This article needs improvement with more information and sourcing, but it's the strongest of the three ethnic Malay articles now under discussion for deletion. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShivaDaDestroyer_150a.html" title="User:ShivaDaDestroyer">ShivaDaDestroyer</a> 20:12, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
