<li><b>Oh,well..</b> I just think it should stay beacause even though it is in Alpha stage at the moment,I think it is susposed to come out of Alpha somewhere in October. So,why not keep it for another month,let it improve and such by edits among the players,and save the time of having to redo it once it comes out of Alpha. I'm somewhat asking you guys to "give it a chance" in building up to your expectations and what-not. The original creator can try to make it more less of a guide,and more into a descriptive article about it. Sure it's a small game,but all games take time to grow.. P.S. not sure if you'll be able to tell or not,but this is the guy who said "nuff said"&#160;:-P Sorry for not really explaining my self at first,didn't really think that you guys would respond so fast!Jib Jibo 03:57, 12 September 2006 (UTC)Jake</li>

<li><b>Do not Delete</b> We're running into a number of odd technicalities that can ultimately be ignored. The state of Battledawn has been labeled "Beta Testing." The reasoning behind this label is that the game is updated on a regular basis as bugs and imbalances are discovered, but it has always been the same game. Perhaps saying the game is in Beta Testing because of its regular updates is incorrect by most standards because this would also mean Windows Operating systems never left the Beta stage and most of the biggest PC games released in the past 5 years were still in their beta stages. Regardless of its "Beta" titling, it is being advertised, played and updated as a full game. I believe Micheal, Battledawn's developer, has dubbed it Beta because he feels it gives him the right to make changes as he pleases without feeling totally unprofessional until the game has gotten to a point that he feels is perfectly tuned and he is allowed to move on to a new project. Frankly, I agree with this outlook because the only true testing a game can get is in the hands of the public and at least Micheal is humble enough to realize his game was not totally perfect upon release. I'm insulted when I'm forced to fork out $50 for a game only to find out I'm just another Beta tester until the clean version is around after a number of months or even years. As for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, Battledawn is only required to meet 1 of their criteria to satisfy Wikepedia's standards. In <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, #3 states "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." Any of the game listing sites on which Battledawn has been highly rated qualify as distributors of this type. They are not merely distributing content so trivially as Newgrounds or Geocities are, but instead are listing Battledawn above other notable games in a ranking of quality and popularity. Furthermore, <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> #1 states that "user guides" qualify as the sort of independent publications that may define content as nontrivial. Well, these game listing websites are, above all else, user guides. Their sole purpose is to help game players find other games they may be interested in. The fact of the matter is that Battledawn is a phenemenon on the internet that, though relatively small, has already made its mark. It has sucked up a vast number of players from older games of similar genres and quickly earned their loyalty, not as testers, but players. Yes, Micheal has reserved the right to make drastic changes in the name of improvement whenever he pleases, but if calling a game Beta is the cost of that right, I wish more games did so. I say you leave the article up. Perhaps it could use some work, but no argument here justifies its deletion so if no more information can be brought to the table, this process must be halted. -Rockytastic 08:45, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> all the listing websites you talk about are lists open for anyone to add their game to, and the majority have a very low number of voters, causing significant swings in ratings for only a few votes.

<li><b>Explain Notability</b> From the comments above, it appears notability is granted rather arbitrarily. Could some Wikipedia policy define notability in any way that would exclude the aforementioned 3rd party websites from satisfying the necessary criteria? It has been stated that games can be submitted by their creators and be swung to high rank with only a surge of votes, but how is that any different than a few editors being alerted to a game by its developer and some articles being written on it? In fact, I am connected to much of the game design arena and pay special attention to the indie world of flash development so I can tell you that this is not the first discussion questioning the value of these game list websites. The general rule is that online gamers, especially in flash, are alerted to more games by "Top 100" websites than any other source. How many articles on a specific flash game have you ever read? How many were in "notable" publications? -Rocky 06:44, 13 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>With respect to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a>, you do <i>not</i> pass 3 for being on those listings. The sheer number of them, and their individual non-notability results in a failure to pass. 3 refers to a <i>major</i> distributor, and quite clearly any listing with extreme swings and their #1 listing only having 400 votes is not major. This is confirmed by footnote 7, which finishes with "Although GeoCities and Newgrounds are exceedingly well known, hosting content on them is trivial." This applies quite clearly in this case. Get yourself a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratics.html" title="Stratics">Stratics</a> news mention, and you might have more chance. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 19:09, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> When looking through the policy, I saw nothing excluding those third party mmo sites. Osafune</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Other than being the "first" Flash implementation (note the lack of references for proof), this makes no claims of notability and does nothing to differentiate itself from the glut of browser-based strategy MMOs in the world. It being in beta is beside the point (would a World of Warcraft II beta be nonnotable?) but the lack of demonstrated notability IS the point. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 10:22, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Argument Unfounded</b>. To believe that Battledawn is not the first of its kind or indeed no different from the "glut of browser-based MMOs in the world" evidences your inexperience with the game itself and/or the so-called "glut of browser based MMOs." Furthermore, it is actually impossible to "prove" that something is the first of its kind. You run into the old "proving a negative" problem by attempting to show that no others of its kind exist. It is then up to those that believe Battledawn is not the first of its kind to prove themselves by finding another game like it. There is no lack of demonstrated notability, the argument here is whether or not the demonstrated notability above satisfies the requirements of Wikipedia. Because no Wikipedia policy has yet been referenced to show that the 3rd party sites mentioned previously are excluded from the notability criteria, the article must remain. -Rocky 18:25, 13 September 2006 (UTC)
