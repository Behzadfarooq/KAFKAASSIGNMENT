	    <p>I am declining to vote on this, in the light of <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">user:Starblind</a>'s belief that one must first be an adherent to the arbitration. Having <b>read</b> the arbitration, however, I must say that I do not find it, as it stands at this daydatetime, to represent in any way an attempt to arbitrate a dispute, rather the simple sepulchre-whitewashing which I had believed Wikipaedia above. I do not agree with the highly-POV style of this article, but if the events recounted occurred, then they need recording, so that W~paedia does not become a censored site. In this regard, I should be interested to hear from someone at admin level what I am supposed to do when it is my opinion that the W~paedia controls are being misused, to block any form of discussion over a disputed article.--<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 07:35, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC) <b>Further to the above</b>: on returning to the page (and thank you to whoever categorised it, since it has made "things" a lot clearer), it is now clearly noticeable that one user is systematically matriculating the <i><b>Keep</b></i> votes, identifying each as a sock-puppet. I take it that this is as a means of persuading admins to ignore these votes in the final tally. However, in each case little evidence is offered, other than that this is a user's first edit. Everyone has to start somewhere. I've forgotten where I did, but it was almost certainly egregious pap. Is it surprising that, on an emotive subject, people feel inspired to contribute for the first time&#160;? Yes, I know that this rant will probably get me flamed and banned -- so be it&#160;:: another victory for <i>"Free Speech"</i>. But reflect, those who criticise -- I <i><b>could</b></i> have taken this onto the public pages, rather than a VfD that will die in due course. --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 07:22, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This rant won't get you banned, nor will disagreeing with anyone in here. What can get you banned is vandalism, and judging from your contributions, you are nowhere near a vandal. What could you get banned as well is sockpuppetry, and you don't seem to have any sockpuppets, nor do you seem to be someone's sockpuppet. You therefore have nothing to fear. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> 22:43, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I might agree with you if it wasn't for the fact that (1) something very similar has happened on other VfDs on articles created by Argyrosargyrou (see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Argyrosargyrou_Evidence_9e64.html#26_May_-_14_June_2005" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Argyrosargyrou/Evidence">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Argyrosargyrou/Evidence#26 May - 14 June 2005</a>) and (2) the user in question has a track record of abusing open proxies to evade temporary blocks on his account (see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Argyrosargyrou_Evidence_9e64.html#2_June_2005" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Argyrosargyrou/Evidence">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Argyrosargyrou/Evidence#2 June 2005</a>). I should note that one of the votes above came from an open proxy in Colombia. Given this, I think it's reasonable for Kiand and others to treat the votes from anonymous and new users with scepticism. Of course, this shouldn't be a factor in making up your own mind which way to vote (or to vote at all), but it's something that needs to be born in mind when tallying the votes. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 07:38, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thank you, and I note what you say. However I also note that you are a ... shall we say vociferous ... opponent of User:Argyrosargyrou (apologies to him if I have mis-spelled this), and that <b>both</b> of your references above are to allegations coming from your own mouth. I decline to take part in what I increasingly believe not just to be a "flame war" but in fact a "troll war"&#160;:: that is, a dispute being run to draw in the unwary passer-by, so that they are being obliged to ... let us say, entertain ... one or both sides.<br />
However, perhaps you can advise me whether it is possible to VfD a VfD, that is, to cause a vote to remove a VfD prior to any voting or decision, on the gound of <i>mala fides</i> --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 09:26, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>As far as I know, it is not possible to VfD a VfD. Once an article has been nominated for VfD, the voting needs to take its course. Perhaps it is possible for admins to undo a nomination if they have good reason to believe that the nomination is an act of sheer vandalism, but I am not sure. By the way, your referring to <i>mala fides</i> almost makes it seem as though Chris is the culprit here and Argyros the victim. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> 09:52, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thank you (honestly) for your advice. As a newbie, I need guidance through the labyrinthine corridros of wiki-politicks.

<li>On the other hand, let us assume for a moment that what ChrisO alleges is true... Shall we have one user manipulate VfDs so that his own POV is spread (which even his countrymen do not share to this extense)? See the RfAr, see the evidence presented, especially the Cyprus_dispute history, and compare to the alleged actions of the user during the blocks. We do have a user here who wants to go to all lengths to push through his POV, even violating wikipedia rules and manipulating VfDs. I would prefer however to have the votes in two <i>numbered</i> lists, with the sockpuppet comments in a separate section, relating to the number in the list. And maybe some day we make up a stricter rule on who can vote (excluding anonymous users and registered ones who registered after the VfD came up); this might sound a bit exaggerated, but I think it will prevent sockpuppeting for vote manipulation, and thus an endless discussion like this. - <a href="../../../s/n/c/User%7ESnchduer_7137.html" title="User:Snchduer">Snchduer</a> 11:00, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Now, come on, if you're going to accuse me of something, at least use my name/handle will you, and not refer to me as 'one user'.</p>
<p>The article author has had a number of other rants up on VFD, where there have been lots of single-edit users from open proxies voting. To me, and to many others, this is a clear case of vote manipulation. They are either direct sockpuppets, or are being garnered in from an external source.</p>
<p>Administrators are allowed disregard anonymous votes and those from very new users - the rules state so. They have to disregard known sock-puppet votes. I am assisting the administrators in this regard by providing details on how many/generally few votes anyone who has voted Keep so far (other than the article author) has.</p>
<p>A previous article deleted despite huge numbers of anon-votes went to Votes for Undeletion, where the rules are far stricter - something like 25 non-minor edits to the main article space and having been a member for over 7 days at the time of nomination. Here, NO votes were obtained to support reinstating the article. This shows, to me at least, that the anon-votes and new users are nothing but sockpuppets - couldn't meet the requirements as they have no intention of making worthwhile contributions.</p>

<dd>Oh, and has just been pointed out to me by <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">User:ChrisO</a>, -all- these seperate 'people' voting have usernames which happen to match characters in the new series of <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_d5fc.html" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a> in the UK. This is far too much of a coincidence. Hence, its obviously one person. --<a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 13:02, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You are clearly a liar. Only one of these names is a character from the new series of Doctor Who that that's me, the Jagrafes. Who are the others&#160;? You are deliberately trying to sway the vote by making unsubstantiated allegations against the people voting to keep this page and therefore this vote and RfD should be declared invalid. --Jagrafes 16:29, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Big Brother, Captain Jack, and The Slitheen User:TheSlitheen (not yet contributed here, but making similar style reverts) are all characters in the current Doctor Who series. Thats 4, minimum. Theres other obvious cultural referneces to the UK - Chaucher, and Neil Kinnock. So we've got a Doctor Who-liking, UK resident who's vote spamming.</dd>
<dd>The original author uses a <a href="../../../2E/c/o/.co.uk.html" title=".co.uk">.co.uk</a> homepage. We've got enough proof to show that its one person. We've got enough proof to show they're in the UK. We've got enough proof to show that the original author is the UK.

Somebody got the definition of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">sockpuppetry</a> quite wrong here, havent you, Argyro? I voted personally for this VfD because of the ridiculous POV style beyond redemption, and now I could add maniacal sockpuppetry (no really, READ the definition!) as well.

<dd>Scimitar citing RfAr as the sole reason for the RfD is a clear abuse of Wikipedia rules. Its an admission of a conspiracy to prevent someone contributing, and since nearly all of the votes for deletion cited that unfounded RfAr the delete votes have clearly been influenced by campaigning, and they are not genuine objections to the content of the page, they should not be counted.--Yorik 19:06, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What does a Redirect for Deletion have to do with this, Argyros? By the way, did you know that Stormfront.org has mentioned your homepage as a credible site worthy of visiting? And your reasoning is very funny: if someone has objections to the contents of the article, he or she is a pro-Turkish propagandist/apologist Holocaust denier (and we don't count votes of pro-Turkish propagandist/apologist Holocaust deniers, do we?), and when someone has objections because of the RfAr (even though noone has mentioned the RfAr as the reason to delete this article, but nevermind that), those are not genuine objections to the content, so they shouldn't be counted either? So in fact, only votes you agree with should be counted? <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> 19:15, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</p>
<p>September 9, 1997 Mrs. MALONEY of New York (for herself, Mr. SHERMAN, and Mr. BILIRAKIS) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on International Relations</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p><br />
CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Commemorating the 75th anniversary of the burning of Smyrna and honoring the memory of its civilian victims, and for other purposes.</p>
<p>Whereas in 1914 the Turkish Nationalist regime initiated a systematic campaign to eradicate the ethnic Greek population in Asia Minor, consigning and killing thousands of male conscripts in forced labor battalions and destroying Greek towns and villages and slaughtering additional hundreds of thousands of civilians in areas where Greeks composed a majority, as on the Black Sea coast, Pontus, and areas around Smyrna;</p>
<p>Whereas in 1922, Smyrna, the largest city in Asia Minor, a cosmopolitan hub populated by a highly educated Greek community and flourishing commercial and middle classes, was sacked and burned and its inhabitants massacred by the Turkish forces of Kemal Attaturk;</p>
<p>Whereas Turkish forces turned on the Greek population, whose numbers had swelled to 400,000 with the influx of refugees from Greek villages destroyed in the countryside, after first slaughtering the Armenians of Smyrna in their quarters;</p>
<p>Whereas on September 9, 1922, Turkish soldiers, led by their officers, set fire to Smyrna and razed most of the city under the gaze of United States, British, and French ships and foreign diplomats and journalists stationed offshore;</p>
<p>Whereas Metropolitan Chrysostomos, the spiritual leader of the Orthodox Christians in Smyrna who refused to abandon the city, was seized from religious services he was conducting in the cathedral by Turkish police forces and given over to be dismembered by a mob in the streets;</p>
<p>Whereas 3 other Orthodox metropolitans were brutally tortured to death in 1921 and 1922, as were 37 Armenian clerics and thousands of priests in the broader period from 1894 to 1923;</p>
<p>Whereas in 1923 more than 1,200,000 Greeks were expelled from Turkey; and</p>
<p>Whereas persecutions of Greeks in Turkey were repeated in a pogrom in Istanbul in 1955 whereby Orthodox churches and Greek businesses were burned and vandalized, again in 1964 with the expulsions of Greeks, and continues today with restrictions on press and religious freedoms and harassment of the Ecumenical Patriarchate: Now, therefore, be it</p>
<p><br />
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That--</p>
<p>(1) the Congress joins the Hellenic and the Armenian American communities in honoring the memory of the victims of Smyrna in 1922 and the millions of Orthodox Christians who perished in the genocidal campaign in Asia Minor from 1894 to 1923;</p>
<p>(2) the United States should encourage the Republic of Turkey to take all appropriate steps to acknowledge these crimes against humanity and commemorate the victims at Smyrna; and</p>
<p>(3) the American people should never forget these events, and an accurate history thereof should be restored and preserved so that such atrocities may never be repeated. --Yorik 17:58, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Once again, I don't have, never have had, and never will have sockpuppets.</p>
<p>Secondly, I have not and do not intend to participate in the RfAr. However, if the sockpuppeting and POV-pushing doesn't stop, I probably will.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I have absolutely no point of view over what went on or is going on in that area of the world. I'm going to make this clear - I'm not pro Turkish. I'm not pro Greek. I really couldn't care less. I do, however, care about VFD hijacking, which is whats going on here. --<a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 00:37, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Those mentions of the RfAr were done because we'd previously endorsed a summary of an earlier RfC against that user who's name I'm not even going to try and spell.

<dd>The majority of Delete voters here voted Delete the LAST time Argy posted his pov-fest under a different title. And then when he duplicated it under at least 3 more titles. And started attacking us by name. So, there was a Request for Comment taken out, and most of us endorsed it. When the RfC became an RfAr, we were all asked if we wanted to contribute to it. This is the way the Wikipedia works. Either accept it, or go away.</dd>
<dd>It has nothing to do with 'unfounded campaigns' or the like. Most of us accept there should be an article on this topic. Just not at this title, and not by this author, or any of the other "people" (as most are just him) who have come on to support him. --<a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 18:41, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Exactly. Obviously, I'm closely watching all of Argy's edits, as probably are doing many other contributors. I have no problem with NPOV edits, but blatant POV always rings a bell. The sad fact about this thing is that the topics behind this user's apparently childish behaviour are valid. And instead of finding someone who knows enough about the events to write a NPOV version of them, Argy makes us all waste our time.

<dd>That is not true. There is ample evidence to show that Feco, E.A, Snchduer, RickK and of course ChrisO were all involved in a content war with Argyrosargyrou in order to prevent him from contributing and countering their pro-Turkish point of view. RickK and ChrisO have both made personal threats against him and abused their powers by placing unfounded 24 hour blocks on him to prevent him from contributing to pages which they and their cohorts have repeatedly reverted to versions with a pro-Turkish bias. This is the evidence I found of this on Saint Jerome's talk page.</dd>
