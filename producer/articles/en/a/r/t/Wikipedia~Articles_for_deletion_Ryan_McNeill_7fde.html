<p><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable person, appears to be a singer in a garage band. Only reference I could find on him in a google search was to his myspace profile. <a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 16:00, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, This is the guitarist/singer that used to be in The Danes (who used to tour with Tripping Daisy) he may not be Neil Diamond but us Danes fans like to keep track of the Danes off shoots and reminisce about that night in Altamont, 128.206.119.146 19:09, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b>. I believe this information regarding Mr. McNeill is possibly the result of a project my eight year old son was doing for school. The project was on the unsung heroes of the entertainment industry. My son contacted the Discovery Channel with questions and they forwarded them to several of their producers, camera men, make-up artists, etc. Mr. McNeill was one of the individuals who received my son's questions and Mr. McNeill was more than willing to help him out with his report by providing his personal experiences and stories, not to mention some pictures and memorabilia from the Discovery Channel (my son is a big fan). The outlook that my son, with Mr. McNeill’s assistance, was able to give to his classmates challenged what many minors view as a glamorous entertainment industry. I believe information for Ryan McNeill is important for children who are aspiring members of the entertainment industry so they will not have a false impression of what TV/Movies/Magazines has given us, but also as a testament to never give up. --Abbryan 19:22, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm curious, what challenges did this person overcome which have been mentioned in this article? Fame too large for Oklahoma and free lance visionary don't seem particularly challenging, to me. <b>Delete</b>, vanity. Followup: artistdirect and allmusic never heard of him (though allmusic has basically-empty pages on Ryan McNeil and Ryan MacNeill), nor do they know The Danes. And we don't have an article on them, either. Ten Google hits for '"Ryan McNeill" "the danes"' Two Google hits for '"Ryan McNeill" "Debate Team"', both myspace pages. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:29, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In the article he stated that "..his growing level of discontent took him on a dark path. One that would lead him to seedier parts of Dallas, TX and eventually land him in a minimum security detention center for advanced learners." He had not mentioned this to my son, but he told my son of some struggles with alcohol, drugs and sexual deviance. I was monitoring their correspondence out of protection for my son, but I did not get involved because I wanted him to grow through the experience. Mr. McNeill did not go into much detail regarding the alcohol, drugs and sexual deviances, which I appriciate due to the age of my son. At no time did I question the credibility of Mr. McNeill until this "Articles for deletion" was brought to my attention by his second grade teacher, who was so impressed by my son's report that she wanted to get more information on his sources. I assume it is possible that my son, not to mention his teacher and I, have been "Oprah-ed" by a possible James Frey wannabe. Possible, but not likely. Mr. McNeill was pleasant and helpful to my son. He did not have anything to gain, nor did he appear to have motives other than sharing his experiences to assist my son in earning an 'A', not to mention growing in knowledge. Has anyone attempted to contact Mr. McNeill personally? I prefer to honor his privacy due to his willingness to assist my son, but it is odd to me that the jury was quick to convict without a statement from the suspect.--Abbryan 01:10, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, I recognize the name and his history from his days with The Danes. The Danes toured the country and thousands and thousands have seen Mr. McNeil play - remember that the rule regarding the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> test is the following: "The fact an article doesn't meet guidelines on [the WP:MUSIC Page], does not necessarily mean it qualifies for deletion, as a mere claim of notability (even if contested) may avoid deletion under A7. Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted; likewise, the meeting of any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept. These are merely rules of thumb which some editors choose to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to keep an article that is on articles for deletion." Obviously, it looks like Mr. McNeil has several other fans besides me that recognize his success and contribution to the music and entertainment scene. Don't punish his achievements because they happened before such achievements were published on the Internet - today, with the Internet the way it is, the Danes would be all over it. 207.218.180.163 22:50, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> unless someone can actually prove that the tours were at all significant. Wikipedia isn't here to create notability, no matter how deserved that may be, it's here to reflect it. If there isn't any success or influence, there is nothing to reflect. A band that is only ever heard live by a thousand people total, but they all go out and form bands may well be notable. A band that plays to hundreds of thousands in total, but does it by being 'live music' in a range of local bars night after night for years isn't. It's like comparing a three-Michelin starred chef to a burger flipper and saying the flipper is more notable through sheer numbers fed. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 23:13, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm the MidWest editor for my magazine (can't legally say its name on this site). It's a well known music publication. And these guys are legit. The Danes were really significant in the MidWest music scene back in the post-Grunge 90s. Why else would I be looking him up by name? HuskyB 01:38, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
