<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a directory or a database dump site. Not every building that is listed deserves an article. There are 500,000 listed buildings in England (just one part of the UK) alone<a href="http://www.heritage.co.uk/apavilions/glstb.html#d" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.heritage.co.uk/apavilions/glstb.html#d" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. My family home in London is a Grade II (the lowest grade) listed building. There is nothing special about our (extensively modernized/remodelled) home (my father went and researched this in order to value the property, which dates from the 18th century) except some "period" architectural features on the house's front and top (the house is not recognizable as a "old" house and there is no special history attached). ~94% of England's listed buildings are Grade II. The higher grades - Grade II* (4% of buildings) and Grade I (2% of buildings) - are conferred on buildings with some kind of enhanced or exceptional interest and are eligible for grants towards preservation (Grade II are not eligible). Grade I buildings are likely to be worthy of articles. Grade II* buildings - <i>maybe</i>. Anyway, applying these average England percentages, 94% of the buildings on the Liverpool list - which has just been dumped from a database - will be quite unremarkable in encyclopedic terms. I have nothing against a recreation of the article along the more sensible lines of the Birmingham version, but the current content is not viable <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:17, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Bwithh, can anyone address his points? There are hundreds of thousands of such buildings throughout the UK, and this precedent would open the gates for lists of similar buildings in <i>every city of every country in the world</i> which would literally translate into millions of buildings. This is unnecessary minutiae which amounts to a directory which violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 08:39, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, cleanup</b>. Bwithh is correct, the current list <i>is</i> too much information, but this is an argument to cleanup, not delete. I would suggest restricting the list to Grades I and II*, plus those Grade II buildings that are notable for other reasons. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEludium-q36_1333.html" title="User:Eludium-q36">Eludium-q36</a> 18:17, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>No, it's an argument for deletion; the criteria for inclusion on the list is simply too wide, it is unmaintainable. At the very least, if we restricted the list to the first two grades we would need to rename the article as the contents would then disagree with the title. I still believe that even that would violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a directory.

<dd>While I am currently neutral in this debate, I am having trouble understanding how this list meets the definition of a directory, which, according to the OED, is a list of people and businesses in a certain area with their addresses or a list of people in a particular trade, profession or occupation. This is a list of places of interest, which is a list, not a directory. And <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html#Purpose_of_lists" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">lists are perfectly acceptable on Wikipedia</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 19:14, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It may not list the owner's of each building, but if you look at the article you'll see it lists the addresses of all of them. Virtually none of the <i>thousands</i> of addresses listed are linked to articles and never will be as they appear to be addresses of houses and other small buildings. They are accompanied, apparently, by the date of their creation. There entire list consists solely of addresses and the date they were built; no context is provided, not notability is established. There probably is copywrite issues because someone most likely ripped this list wholesale from somewhere else. Sure, lists can be fine on Wikipedia but they should provide context, notability and should be easily maintainable; lists that have well over two thousand entries consisting primarily of items that will never have their own articles are almost, if ever, acceptable. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 19:23, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>However, it is not a directory, and therefore does not meet the criteria on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOT" class="extiw" title="w:NOT">W:NOT</a>! Of course it lists their addresses, since buildings tend to be known by their addresses! That doesn't make it a directory. Since I'm not for or against this article, my only concern is that policies and guidelines are not incorrectly cited. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 19:42, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It is a directory, at least as far as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIRECTORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIRECTORY</a> is concerned. A list of addresses or names or a combination thereof constitutes a directory. Furthermore, you haven't addressed the fact that 99% of these buildings are non-notable and will never have articles, that the article itself provides no context, that the information is unencyclopedic and can be found elsewhere more appropriately and that it likely is a copyright violation. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 20:19, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Really? Where in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIRECTORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIRECTORY</a> does it say that this is a directory? It doesn't appear to meet the criteria for any of the three categories listed there. It is not a list of "loosely associated topics" since it focuses on a single narrowly defined topic. It is not a genealogical entry or a phonebook entry. It is not a directory (as already established according to the pre-eminent dictionary of the English language), TV/radio guide or resource for conducting business. Unless there is a hidden category which I am unable to see, it is not therefore a directory in Wikipedia terms. Furthermore, maybe you should read both my previous posts where I said I was not trying to address anything other than your incorrect citing of a policy and note that I have not said "keep" anywhere. My concern is simply that people are getting rather too fond of citing policies and guidelines which they claim back up their arguments but which in fact do not. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 20:47, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Now that I checked a little more closely, <a href="../../../l/i/s/Listed_buildings_in_Merseyside_d730.html" title="Listed buildings in Merseyside">Listed buildings in Merseyside</a> already contains a section for Liverpool, but in a more concise format. And, apparently, every building within a particular district is listed separately, as in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Sunlight_f16f.html" title="Port Sunlight">Port Sunlight</a> which has 900 listed buildings. In contrast, United States NRHP properties often group buildings together if they're in a single district or if they're submitted as part of a historic district. Often, they're part of a <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiple_Property_Submission_9eef.html" title="Multiple Property Submission">Multiple Property Submission</a>.
