<li><b>Comment</b>: This is an excellent example of failure to even attempt <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>. The article title displays a definite POV, and the body displays a different POV. If it were <i>entirely</i> up to me, I would rename the article to something like <b>Historical Metrology</b>, and set out both sides of the debate, being careful to maintain a balance between the sides.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>For those just tuning in, the debate is, basically, whether all current systems of weights and measures can be traced directly back to a set of African or Middle Eastern measurements of antiquity. Part of this is whether the source society knew enough about geometry to base their measurements on something as arcane as a <a href="../../../d/e/g/Degree_%28angle%29.html" title="Degree (angle)">degree</a>, one 360th part of a circle. There are reasoned arguments on both sides. Side questions include accuracy of the ancient measurements, which ancient society was the theoretical donor, and a bunch of things I'm leaving out intentionally.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> This page <b>Pseudoscientific metrology</b> is full of original research, ie; it consists entirely of opinion and speculation, and is full of phrases like ("seems to have been"). What it has for cites or references do not support that any of its allegations are true.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The article is a polemic against the anti metric movement which is attacked at least three times in the course of a page because it "spurred further activity".</dd>
<dd>It doesn't say what the activity was, but then goes off on a tangent to allege "many different" unspecified "theories" have a "common theme" and attempts to associate the anti metric movement with the French Acadamie of Sciences, Jean-Adolphe Decourdemanche, August Oxé, Livo C. Stecchini, John F. Neal, Alexander Thom and his ideas about a Megalithic yard.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I originally wrote this, and I will thus not cast a vote. I can easily see much room for improvment in POV bias in the wording. It is also a problem, like for other areas of pseudoscience, that the ideas of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stecchini.html" title="Stecchini">Stecchini</a> et al has largely been ignored by the scientific community. But the real issue is how Wikipedia should treat claims like:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The ancient units of measure of Mesopotamia and Egypt (dating from several thousand years BC) are directly defined by the circumference of the Earth.</li>
<li>All ancient systems of measurement were built on each other, and exact definitions existed that related them</li>
<li>There exists a <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megalithic_Yard_fe8f.html" title="Megalithic Yard">Megalithic Yard</a>. It can be directly linked to the Mesopotamian measures</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Etc. I guess if this is to be accepted and described as bona fide science then Wikipedia is not what I though it was. -- <a href="../../../e/g/i/User%7EEgil_938c.html" title="User:Egil">Egil</a> 03:22, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Is the Megalithic Yard truly pseudoscience? Or is it just controversial? The article makes it seem "weakly controversial". In physics there is a pretty clear delineation between controversial and pseudoscience, and the wiki articles reflects that in phrases like "widely considered psuedoscience" or "considered controversial" etc. etc. You might want to retitle the article here however. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 03:30, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The problem is that it '<i><b>doesn't'</b></i> cite good authority as to why these theories are wrong. It speculates, opines and expects you to agree that well obviously they must be wrong without any proof. That is what makes a thing pseudo science in the first place.<a href="../../../r/k/t/User%7ERktect_7070.html" title="User:Rktect">Rktect</a> 16:07, August 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep,</b> probably rename, rewrite to NPOV. Interesting and valid topic. Rename to what? I don't like "historical metrology," that's <i>too</i> nonspecific and neutral, i.e. there could be and I expect there is a valid "historical metrology" but this isn't it. This would seem to be closely related to <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramidology.html" title="Pyramidology">Pyramidology</a>. More so than to metrology, I'd say, but of course that's my own POV showing. Maybe the title could reflect this somehow. (Actually our articles on <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramidology.html" title="Pyramidology">Pyramidology</a> and <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramid_power.html" title="Pyramid power">Pyramid power</a> seem to be very thin, don't they?) <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:29, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>How could you rewrite this to NPOV without deleting everything it says? As an architect I consider measuring, weighing and judging based on the evidence to be the very essence of science</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>so labeling what people have learned about measurement "pseudoscience" or "pyramidology" seems pretty weird.<a href="../../../r/k/t/User%7ERktect_7070.html" title="User:Rktect">Rktect</a></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I beg to differ on two accounts:
<ul>
<li>Over-use of terms like <i>metrologist</i> and <i>geometer</i> are typical indicators of <i>bs</i>.</li>
<li>The Megalithic-Yard-believers are just one fraction. There are many others. What about <a href="http://www.sonic.net/bernard/saturn.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sonic.net/bernard/saturn.html" rel="nofollow">this beauty</a>? So I think merging with MY is not good. I would also hate seeing this stuff merged with <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrology.html" title="Metrology">metrology</a>. Also, <i>historic meterology</i> is plain misleading. This <b>is</b> pseudoscience, but a more NPOV term can be found, like <i>alternative</i>. I'd rather call a spade a spade, however.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and possibly rename. It is useful to synthesize the various more-or-less heterodox theories positing hidden uniformities in ancient measures. The article could of course use more work, but every article can.

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Call a spade a spade. Calling pseudoscience what it is not POV ladened, it's simply being honest. Changing it to <i>Historical</i> or <i>Alternative</i> is misleading. This stuff is what it is: pseudoscience. If we are renaming it, let's at least keep it honest and not wishy-washy.

<li>As Egil says, the megalithic yard is just part of the story so we can't move it there. We could, of course, move MY here but I don't think this is a good idea. There is enough content in MY to warrant a seperate article.</li>
<li>It is little surprise at all that the nomination for deletion comes from our friend Rktect. Please take no offence, Rktect, I mean no personal attack. I'm sure you fully believe in what you're claiming and think what you're doing is the right thing.</li>
<li>For those unfamiliar with what's going on: Rktect has been avidly working on many measurement articles. His contributions generally promote this one-and-the-same-system-throughout-history theory.

<p>Inspired by some of the last few weeks incidents, I've collected various material on Pseudoscientific metrology. I'd appreciate it if you would review it. -- Egil 12:17, 7 August 2005 (UTC) I've also posted this request: Wikipedia:AMA_Requests_for_Assistance#Pseudoscientific_attack. -- Egil 14:43, 8 August 2005 (UTC) A pseudoscientific attack: that's exactly what seems to be happening here. I'll have a look at your page. Splitting Ancient weights and measures article was a good idea. I'd been thinking of doing that myself.

<p><b>Comment</b> This is not an article, it's a stub attached to lists. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_designers" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_designers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_designers</a> The list also includes links to various other lists all the way down the food chain to lists of fonts not created in major foundries; i.e. freeware type designers who are listed alphabetically. I intend to be somewhat of a watchdog in this realm of the database and can see where improvements and better organization can improve the integrity within this category. Respectfully, It would be my hope that those that are not trained in this particular discipline can abstain from being too critical. You can trust that the community for which this information serves will be deliberate and expedient in maintaining the quality of the data as typophiles become increasingly aware of this expanding database.

Per the article, their touring has been limited to a relatively small region, and they have only made one album, which was self-released.

However, if the article was about the band from the neroland.com external link then I say weak keep.

<li>I seem to recall that Wikipedia strongly discourages people from writing articles about themselves, no matter how notable they may or may not be. On the other hand, current precedent is that anybody who's run as a candidate in any election can be included in a collated "list of X Party's candidates in Foo election" article. (I can't say I <i>like</i> it, but it <i>is</i> the currently-established practice.) Either <b>userfy</b> or, <i>if</i> somebody's feeling <i>really</i> ambitious, merge into a List of New Democratic Party candidates in the Prince Edward Island election, 2003. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:08, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The only link to the Circular_Album page on Wikipedia is, in fact, on the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Song_cycle.html" title="Song cycle">Song cycle</a> page. However, the original author of the Circular Album page placed it there, and it was a simple replacement of the words "song cycle" in the final paragraph and rendered nearly all text after the link incorrect. To be specific, the paragraph talks about song cycles in popular music, then the inserted text reads "Other circular albums in popular music include: ..." It suddenly jumps to an unrelated (an incorrect) concept. Albums like this really do exist, and info about them could be added to the song cycle page, possibly by saying something like "certain albums take the concept of a song cycle even further, by allowing seamless looping of the entire album." Obviously, the term "circular album" shouldn't appear anywhere. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStatic3d_8fc0.html" title="User:Static3d">Static3d</a> 02:56, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

It could have stayed up for a long time without detection as a glaring example of WP's shortcomings. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBantman_f0a0.html" title="User:Bantman">Bantman</a> 21:13, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

baBlonde:I can understand that you gentle beings would think that its an advertisement. My aim is not to advertise, but merely to create an awareness to wikipedians that there is a festival out there that showcases some of these elements. For instance, would you ever be able to see an 'orang asli' or experience an authentic 'kampong' lifestyle if you were in Malaysia? I'm merely suggesting where we can find these elements. My rationale is this: you can search for 'orang asli', 'kampong' and 'hulu langat' in the wikipedia, and I can tell you one place where you can experience or see for yourselves these elements in a most authentic state, ie not in a museum or shopping mall. To point a place on a map, so to speak. I would sincerely appreciate if you'd re-consider. And like I mentioned, is a place that bridges the gap between urban and kampong lifestyles in Malaysia. Thanks!</p>

<li>I see only four clear keeps. I see a <i>bunch</i> of comments with some version of "keep only if notable".

While much of the article is only of interest to <a href="../../../r/m/s/Image%7ERms.jpg_d3f5.html" title="Image:Rms.jpg">K5/Slashdot/Adequacy weenies</a>, I think we could all benefit from a good study of the psychology of well-executed trolling. It is possible to hold a good-faith opinion on both sides of the deletionism/inclusionism debate. Certain items undoubtedly do not belong on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>. As Americans of faith, we should oppose attempts to infiltrate this encyclopedia with the witchcraft and homoeroticism of <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pottery.html" title="Pottery">Harry Potter</a>, for example. How do we objectively decide what to delete and what to keep? "Erring on the side of caution" dictates that we keep an article in the absence of a compelling argument for deletion (such as godlessness). With that heuristic in mind, I see no reason to delete the article in question. FYI, Localroger has also written an excellent treatise on post-singularity zombie rape <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/prime-intellect" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kuro5hin.org/prime-intellect" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.

Even if it were re-written to be NPOV, this "style" of trolling is certainly not uniquely characteristic to Adequacy, but is instinctively childish behaviour that has been used in unproductive discourse since before any of us were born.

If an article covers a subject which has never been written about in published sources, or which has only been written about in sources of doubtful credibility, it is difficult to verify the information. To do so would require original research, and it has been agreed that Wikipedia is not a place to publish original research.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It's a very poorly written article. As it stands, it is a two-paragraph summary of the company's alleged business dealings. Complete contravention of the NPOV policy: everything written about it is from the company's point of view. What do its competitors think of the company? How do its customers feel about it? Any studies on customer satisfaction? If so, how well has it done? Who do the governments, local and national, think about it? Has it had legal troubles? What is its economic history? What role has it played in its industry? Is it merely one of several players? Are those claims about its finances accurate? Why is it <i>notable</i>, aside from having a lot of customers, which is something millions and millions of companies around the world have? What particular notability has it a claim to that warrants mention in an encyclopedia? The fact that it introduced ring tones (I don't know, I'm just asking, as that seems to be the only claim of uniqueness I can see)? These questions pertain to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Next, we have questions pertaining to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. To write a good encyclopedia article, the subject must be eminently verifiable from multiple reputable, independent sources. What sources were used to write this article? I see links to the company website. What primary or secondary sources were used to write this work? Or <i>can</i> be used by us if we wish to expand it? Do any exist? WP articles cannot be products of original research, they must be based on multiple reputable primary or secondary sources. See <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Like thousands of other articles currently on WP, this one seems to contravene some major WP policies and guidelines. Problem is what to do with articles that <i>may</i> indeed be about a notable subject (and this one may well be, I don't know; not enough is said about it for one to know), but which are in their present state really weak (and will likely always be weak)? After studying the policies, it seems to me this conundrum is open to interpretation, and is in fact the source of much dispute on AfD. My vote here is to <b>delete</b> (mainly because I think it will be near impossible for WP editors to source the material (what exists, that is) to write a good article per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>), but equally many well-meaning editors will vote the other way.

<p>Personal essay. Original research. Non-neutral point of view. Article itself notes that there "is no authoritative list." So, where did the list come from? The personal authority of contributors, I suppose. It also notes that the term is "misleading."

<li>I don't especially think we need one. It means, effectively, small, old, private liberal arts schools in the Northeast United States. What schools exactly should be included is a matter of content for editors to determine. I'm taking the liberty of removing Davidson, which was added by an anon and for which I can find zero relevant hits on Google, and which is by location alone questionable. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 00:57, 2005 August 24 (UTC)

<li>Well (I know this is OT here but we have a group discussing it here) if the article is kept, as seems likely, I'm thinking it should be revised drastically. Your above definition sounds plausible, anyone got an external source for that definition or anything like it? I'd add "academically distinguished" to the list of adjectives. And apparently only colleges that were historically men's college count are included, right? No Wellesley or Smith, which otherwise would meet your criteria. I'm thinking that the article should say it is a <i>vague,</i> generic term for: small old liberal arts colleges that are academically distinguished, located in the Northeast U.S., and historically were men's colleges, as exemplified by <a href="../../../a/m/h/Amherst_College_b06a.html" title="Amherst College">Amherst</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/Williams_College_d6ab.html" title="Williams College">Williams</a>. With a note on the Talk page strongly discouraging listmaking, because, <i>unlike</i> the Ivy League or the Five Colleges or the Public Ivies, there is no definitive list or objective criterion for inclusion. Any such list is subject to the same objections as the "list of notable colleges" which was VfDed years ago. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:22, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

Pick the most illuminating quote out of the usage examples and incorporate it there. (Note that the "Associate Justice Kennedy" link doesn't actually include the phrase "little ivies", saying instead "Little Ivy League". It illustrates the general concept, but not the specific term.)

<li><b>Keep</b> Unlike Midwestern Ivy League, this is <i>not</i> an invented term and actually has currency. That's reason enough to keep it. Individual contibutors are then free to quibble over what schools to include and support their arguments accordingly. I think incorporating "Little Ivies" into the <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a> article is a particularly bad idea. That league is defined as only 8 schools, and an elaboration of the "Little Ivies" beyond their present (brief) mention there opens the door for every other other college wanting to be mentioned as some kind of "Ivy." If there are "Rust Belt Ivies," "Pacific Rim Ivies," "Middle Eastern Ivies" etc, let the contributor create a new article where the legitimacy of the term can be discussed and decided on. -18.95.1.22 20:04, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems notable (though obviously not a hugely popular term.) Google isn't the end-all be-all of determining notability. Since it was nominated, some good work has been put into this article to provide sources and expand the article. I think this is a good entry that has some potential. ~ <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrae_1e20.html" title="User:Syrae">Syrae Faileas</a> 20:36, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Some aspects of this article probably require discussion, but there is no question that this term is in common usage. The list is ill-defined by it's nature, but that isn't reason to delete the article. However, pointing out how arbitrary the inclusion of some schools (after Amherst/Williams), is essential to understanding the usage of the term. Also, the 2003 Wall Street Journal ranking of "Feeder schools" used this term in reference to Williams.</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b>. Term is common. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">Neutrality</a><sup><a href="../../../n/e/u/User_talk%7ENeutrality_6997.html" title="User talk:Neutrality">talk</a></sup> 01:56, August 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b>.The "real" Ivy League was similarly an informal grouping of colleges until it was formally organized. However, in that time period "Ivy League" was an accepted and used term. The lackof a formal organization for the "little Ivies" is not grounds to deny the concept its own page.

By Benjamin Urrutia. Of primordial importance in the contemporary novelist J. R. R.

The story bears a slight resemblance to that of Genesis, Chapter 3, which also tells of a land of Paradise, which was lost because of the intrigue of an enemy, the Serpent. Two trees, the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life, also appear in the Genesis account, but otherwise the similarity is small indeed: there is no hint that these trees produced light, or that they were injured in any way at the Fall. Surprisingly, a much closer parallel to the Tolkienian narrative can be found in ancient Mexican mythology-the story of Tamoanchán.</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>From the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_California_County_Routes_b00b.html" title="List of California County Routes">List of California County Routes</a> it looks that a typical California county is served by maybe six County Routes and that many of these routes do serve more than one county. When comparing this with <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_road_numbering_scheme_69aa.html" title="Great Britain road numbering scheme">Great_Britain_road_numbering_scheme</a>, the equivalent to a US county route seems a three-digit A-road. B-roads are short roads (typically 10 km or less) connecting one village to the next, never a main throughfare. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 19:53, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"Highway" in the UK refers to <b>any</b> road or even footpath (see <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highway.html#Nomenclature" title="Highway">Highway#Nomenclature</a>). I doubt even the most ardent inclusionist would want to keep all UK highways. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_wub_6388.html" title="User:The wub">the wub</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_wub_1807.html" title="User talk:The wub"><font color="green">"?/!"</font></a> 07:50, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Firstly, it's absolutely correct to point out that "highway" is a generic term in the UK, and really this is just a country road that runs through a few minor English towns, mainly Caterham.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't count myself an "ardent inclusionist" but since the current article is completely encyclopedic I don't see why we should consider deleting it. It does no harm by existing and the information it provides is correct. I'm certainly in favor of deleting nonsense, vanity and whatnot from Wikipedia, but this road and most roads in England have been around for centuries.</dd>
<dd>Look at <i>any</i> road atlas of the British Isles. A general road atlas that omitted a single B road would not be worth buying. If an atlas purporting to represent driving conditions in England misses out roads like the B2031 then it's not going to sell very well, because it's a small country and that's what you're going to be driving on once you get off the trunk roads.</dd>
<dd>Here we track geography down to footpaths and bridleways, and <b>yes</b>, those are also considered notable. All public footpaths and bridleways are recorded in the UK. Every single public thoroughfare is recorded, and therefore intrinsically notable. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 01:19, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not a road atlas. All title deeds are officially recorded in the U.S. Does that mean that every private house and plot of land is notable and should have an article? I don't think so. And I certianly don't think we ought to include articles on every bridle path in the UK, and by extension, everywhere else in the world. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 02:42, 26 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Title deeds are primary sources. If you used those to write an encyclopedia article about a private residence, it would fall under "original research" and be deleted. On the other hand, with highways, there are plenty of secondary sources that can be used to write an article on them. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 23:19, 26 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's not what <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> means. If I go to the county records and see that the state bought a road from the county on some date, that's not original research. Original research is drawing conclusions from that, such as the assumption that the state bought the road because of a bribe. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 04:46, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Regarding Tony Sidaway's thoughts, I too believe that long distance footpaths are notable, however, B roads are not. Some long distance footpaths are nationally maintained by <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Trails_35cb.html" title="National Trails">National Trails</a>, and are of interest to both tourists and ramblers, covering many areas of natural beauty.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. This is a commonly discussed concept (using this exact name, and the abbreviation of MDT) among those at the <a href="http://www.arn.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.arn.org/" rel="nofollow">ARN</a> forums (an ID website). Unsurprisingly, it is ignored by those who espouse Intelligent Design because it is counter to their creationist viewpoint. As such, it is something I am familiar with on a day-to-day basis. Whether it is applicable as an article on Wikipedia is perhaps more debateable. Its principal application is potentially in diagnosing multiple authors for documents (which may include programming code). From this it should be translatable into a useful tool for those interested in researching ID. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoisy_bc7b.html" title="User:Noisy">Noisy</a> | <a href="../../../n/o/i/User_talk%7ENoisy_7db1.html" title="User talk:Noisy">Talk</a> 17:58, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Let me make this clear. This is not a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory.html" title="Theory">theory</a> as in <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_theory.html" title="Scientific theory">scientific theory</a>. No research into <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design_creationism.html" title="Intelligent design creationism">intelligent design creationism</a> has <i>ever</i> been done, and nor will there be, because there is no evidence to support it. Now, if it were really about identifing authors of documents from their style of writing, I would consider. As it is, it's unreferenced pseudo-philosophical bollocks. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 20:37, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Update</b> - Noisy has rewritten the article, although a good summary, IMHO it just shows up its major deficiency - it is simply not notable. It is not recognised as science, philosophy or theology by those academic communites or found favour as a popular religious belief. The idea I think can be better discussed as a short sentence or two in <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_designer.html" title="Intelligent designer">intelligent designer</a>. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 15:29, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> MDT is a clever approach to pointing out some of the flaws in ID, a combination of reductio ad absurdum and parody.

<p>This article was previously marked for speedy deletion, but I decided to post it here on VFD to get more opinions. This article is about a group of fans who organized a <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_football.html" title="College football">college football</a> bowl game to entice the country's best football teams into playing to determine who is the real national champion. Of course, no school has accepted a Tom Bowl invite. I have cleaned up the article to erase the portions of what looked more like a press release.

<p>Previously marked for speedy deletion as not asserting how this person is important or significant.

<li>No, Zzyzx11 was right to list it for deletion since it had been speedy tagged implying someone thought it ought to be deleted under a specific criterion. Since the admin was unsure of the application of that phrase, and one of VfDs jobs is determining notability, the correct course of action was the one followed.

<li>I have just read through the vanity article guidelines and this doesnt even come close to being a vanity article. Some of the things it would have to be:</li>
</ul>
<p>completely uninteresting (which it isnt) using many outlinks (it has no links outside of Wiki at ALL)</p>
<p>your main claim that this is a vanity article is that the subject is quite obscure. If you look in the guidelines for determining whether or not an article is a vanity article, you will see that they SPECIFICALLY state that the obscurity of an article does NOT make it a vanity article.</p>
<p>So if you people want it deleted soo badly i advise you find another reason. <small>(Unsigned comment by 69.17.120.143 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.17.120.143_c066.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.17.120.143">contribs</a>))</small></p>

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> - As someone who frequents many classical music forums, I feel that I am in a position to note that the originality of the SDC as a concept and its influence on music culture on the internet is such that it is worthy of a Wikipedia article.

And the Wikipedia is for showing everybody the meaning of strange perculiar words.If anybody had to find out what this obscure word meant then they come to the Wikipedia.

<li>Comment: There's nothing wrong with making an article about a rare but existing word. However, I find <i>no</i> evidence that this word exists at all. Not in dictionaries, and not a single English-language Google hit. Provide a good citation and I'm sure it'll be kept.

<li>Now before you post you need to know a few things:1.I saw the word Unonym ages ago.I don't know how long as I am very bad at timekeeping but probably about a year.Now I have a bad memory so I can't be compeletely sure where i saw it.2.I only just saw the Wikipedia a few days ago and because it was so great I wanted to put an article in to say thank you.The one word I remember in the corner of my brain was unonym-so I checked the Wikipedia and it didn't appear so I decided to enter it.Now I might be wrong here but I think I remember seeing it in a puzzle in a newspaper. (Can't remmeber which one,probably T2 though) Now I wouldn't try to put in a random thing a low-IQ freind or chatboard said so wherever I saw this,it must of been a valid source. (J.Sagnella)2005-08-23</li>
<li>For information, Chambers 21st Century dictionary comes up blank as well, Sorry, "J.Sagnella" (please sign your edits as Lomn asks, with ~~~~), but there seem to be no valid sources that confirm this word as existing. I <i>really wish</i> there were, as it's a good word. However if I coined, say, the word 'splontish' as meaning "sharp and spiky" my coining it wouldn't make it a valid source, nor would someone having seen it here a while ago make it any more valid. <b>Delete</b> unless author can find some verifiable sources. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> <a href="../../../p/e/n/Image%7EPentacle.svg_e6ae.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b6/Pentacle.svg/15px-Pentacle.svg.png" alt="" width="15" height="15" longdesc="../../../p/e/n/Image%7EPentacle.svg_e6ae.html" /></a>&#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 20:54, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> The ressources section is pretty long in the Armenian genocide section, and many others will be added. As well, there are various cathegory of studies regarding the Armenian genocide, and their relevant books, which will be added. As it is, including this in the Armenian Genocide section, would make of it way too long, only for the ressources. Besides the footnoting is still pending, and once added, it'll increase its size even more. The <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> has its section for ressources too, and the only reason I can't work on the ressources section, is because being it included with the Armenian genocide, make of it very limitative. I agree that Wikipedia is not a list, but what do you propose? Fadix 19:17, 23 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the resources listed are sources for the armenian genocide article they belong in that article's sources section. It's not a problem if it gets long, wikipedia is not paper. The resources that aren't needed as references there, you shouldn't put a list of them on wikipedia, wikipedia is not an indiscriminate information repository, just an encyclopaedia. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 19:22, August 23, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I can't disagree, but if you think you can go and delete sites and references not mentioned in the article in question, go ahead, you'll get a revert war by some that will add them back even when those resources have nothing to do with the article in question. Right now, all I know is that I want to expend the article, and because of it, adding in the resources section the references, which will increase the size of that section, without considering that footnoting will probably take over 1/3 of the articles size.

<li>What if, I add it in a sub-page of the article?

<li>Hi, I know Diamondancer. Although she is very young, she's a genuine contribution to Great Lakes fashion and culture. She is an organizer of region-wide events, and she travels internationally in pursuit of cultural exchange. The person who posted her biography didn't understand the rules of Wikification, so I will Wikify the record. 208.54.15.129 21:33, 15 August 2005 (UTC) <a href="../../../w/m/j/User%7EWmjuntunen_a4ce.html" title="User:Wmjuntunen">Wmjuntunen</a> 21:36, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>After working on her biography, I discover that she edited poetry for Detroit Furnace magazine. This literary magazine is very key in this city; it's the best handle Detroiters have on cultural life in the city. Historians will need this information. She is an exceptional example of a Detroit Diva, an artist who can produce in mulitple art forms, create art events that have real audiences. You could learn the entire art context in Detroit by following her career. <a href="../../../w/m/j/User%7EWmjuntunen_a4ce.html" title="User:Wmjuntunen">Wmjuntunen</a> 03:16, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Strong keep. I recommend googling Vievee,published poet and associate, Detroit Furnance Magazine, which has a web page, Niagara (the Detroit performance artist) who learned her craft by visiting Warhol's Factory, Blair of the Urban Folk Collective, who co-edits poetry with Carolyn Ferrari, the birth name of Diamondancer. BTW: Blair, her associate, brought back the National Poetry Slam Cup to Detroit several years ago, and that's connected to Anne Waldman, poet. Googling Carolyn Ferrari itself will access older articles on her in Detroit's Metro Times. Plus, she has been acknowledged, juried by the CHARLES H. WRIGHT MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY <a href="http://maah-detroit.org/" class="external free" title="http://maah-detroit.org/" rel="nofollow">http://maah-detroit.org/</a>. That's a museum in Detroit's Cultural Center with a multi-million dollar budget, supported by every Detroit-based philathropy, housed in an architectural marvel, a marvel completed in time for the funeral service of Mayor Coleman Young. MAAH is a good touchstone of notability in Africana. I could contact the museum personally because I've written interviews of their emergent artists before. A good sign of an artist's notability is a record of juried appearances in shows in serious galleries. Diamondancer has that.</p>
<p>More, the theatre at the Redd Apple Gallery is authentic African-American theatre. And here's the real reason to keep. This woman is pure American Africana. Her work is collected by notable African Americans in the City of Detroit. She is a model of entrepreneurship and creative career in the city of Detroit. If Henry Louis Gates, Harvard-based author of the Encarta Africana was paying attention to this discussion or Spike Lee was paying attention, I wonder what they would say?</p>
<p>It is possible, gentleman, that googling isn't enough. It is possible, also, the a local wikipedian in Detroit has access to materials and direct site visits that aren't accessible on the web yet? I was there at a fashion show when models wearing Diamondancer designs waltzed onto the runway in white, mythic robes and owl masks <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Fashion_Week_ac0d.html" title="Detroit Fashion Week">Detroit Fashion Week</a>, and I have pictures of this. As an art critic, I was much bestirred.</p>
<p>I agree that the article could use clean-up, and the signficance of her links can be better supported --- but Wikipedia is an interactive process. If we can get this out of the deletion process, I will undertake this rewrite process. <a href="../../../w/m/j/User%7EWmjuntunen_a4ce.html" title="User:Wmjuntunen">Wmjuntunen</a> 15:35, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>A reminder of the Britney Spears' cousin principle:</b> knowing, being related to, or even being friends with notable people does not make you notable. Neither studying Warhol, nor even having work purchased by notable people, is in itself notable. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 20:31, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Britney Spear's Cousin principle is a useful principle. In Diamondancer's case, we are referring to relationships based upon artistic judgement. Ms. Ferrari has numerous relationships based upon artistic judgement. For example, Ms. Ferrari edited poetry with Blair, a position bestowed upon her by an editorial panel. The BSC principle applies to kinship and friendship relations, awarded by birth or casual considerations. A co-editorship is usually awarded as an act of detente, a way of recognizing two equals. I have taken care to define Redd Apple Gallery, Niagara, Arts Beats &amp; Eats, The Furnance, and will continue defining. In two cases, I have defended Detroit cultural resources from deletion successfully --- one of which had an unusual name. I believe the unusual name and the lack of academic institutions, art schools, are false weaknesses of this article. I've had artist stubs with less information readily accepted based upon an ordinary name and art school credentials. <a href="../../../w/m/j/User%7EWmjuntunen_a4ce.html" title="User:Wmjuntunen">Wmjuntunen</a> 21:32, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>Diamondancer is an often juried artist, and an artist stub. Artists are notable once juried. Artists are notable once written about in the arts press, and she's been NOTED by the Detroit Metro Times and the Detroit dailies. That's what jurying confers.</p>
<p>Can anyone who has voted delete come from an art history perspective and prove non-notability? Emergent artists are notable. Look at the record of Durand, who bought the paintings of obscure Monet for a song. If you disagree, please produce your criteria for notability for artists. I'm looking for something more than the Britney Spear's Cousin principle. That's not a principle. That's a smear of Britney Spears, a notable topic for the Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Not one of you are talking criteria, besides the Google hit count. Without a criteria for notability, you're just rendering an opinion. An artist doesn't have to be dead or on the wall of the Tate to be notable. Diamondancer was an juried participant at three to five Detroit galleries: Redd Apple, MAAH, 4731 and Arts, Beats &amp; Eats.&#160;! Her work has featured on the cover of magazines that print 100,000 of weekly issues.</p>
<p>Please recuse yourself if you are unfamiliar with the way the arts community functions. Be honest. You might not see notability if you are unfamiliar. How many of you are familiar with Detroit? You might wish to recuse yourself if this city is unfamiliar to you. And here's the kicker. If you are unfamiliar with African-American art and African - American aesthetics, kindly recuse yourself. <a href="../../../w/m/j/User%7EWmjuntunen_a4ce.html" title="User:Wmjuntunen">Wmjuntunen</a> 00:00, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would agree, but it's so <i>badly</i> written. Perhaps a deletion of everything but the first two sentences (and reworking those sentences into standard English).

<p>Some guy said it to me at a club night in Manchester a couple of years ago. The DJ was playing a different style of music to what was normally played there(he was playing house music at a breakbeat club night). The guy said something along the lines of "I can't believe what this guy's playing. He's off the f*****g Tomp!" When I asked him to explain what he was talking about he said "You know, off the Tompkinson", and then preceded to tell me that his mate read about this theory of a measurement of culture clash based on a comparison of how much of an outsider the priest from Ballykissangel was. He seemed surprised that I hadn't heard of it since he knew a lot of people who used it for all sorts of situations.<small><i>(This unsigned edit by 80.176.80.17)</i></small>80.176.80.17 15:02, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As per one of the earlier posts I recall reading an article on this issue in a magazine while I lived in Manchester. It was a few years ago, so my memory is a little hazy, but I think it the magazine was called 'sub' (or it was at least something extremely similar). I can't confirm that the whole entry is consistent with the original article (for example I don't recall muslim/wider environment refs) but i'm pretty sure it is at least consistent with the general thrust of the article (in terms of the drama/ comedy tradeoff w.r.t. ballykissangel). Rather than delete the whole entry, would it not be preferable, if necessary, to just tidy it up a little? 62.253.64.15 00:13, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It's vanity in the sense of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a>. It means that the article was probably written to promote the band, rather than simply to describe them.

<li>I can't believe this is even up for debate. Yes, I pulled the trigger on this idiocy and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. We play by rules. Rules are for nice people. These are not nice people. We are giving them five days of free advertising. I'm going away before I say what the hell I really think of being reverted on this. - Lucky 6.9 02:32, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>What, exactly, do you mean by "rules are for nice people. These are not nice people"? That disagreeing with their ideology means that it's not encyclopedic?

<li>Actually, I would disagree with Lucky if this were a band which had several releases and showed up in allmusic and artistdirect, but the fact that they don't is why I listed them and argued for their deletion, not their style of music. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 05:11, August 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Lucky, I hope your deletion of this article on sight was an isolated act. By listing this article here, Zoe followed procedure &amp; behaved responsibly so that the fate of this article can be justified. Even if an article is indefensible nonsense, it <b>still</b> must needs to undergo a defined process on Wikipedia: it has to be listed on VfD or at least Speedy Delete first, where the rest of us contributors are given time to offer their input whether the article should be deleted. We do it this way <b>not</b> because Wikipedia is a democracy, but because it is a form of <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer review</a>, the primary rationale for using Wikiwiki software to build an encyclopedia. If you can't understand why we follow this process, maybe you should resign as Admin. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 18:17, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, this isn't a democracy and I believe in the rules. I made a decision on a bit of filth that basically resolves to a few bits of data on which we've already spent entirely too much time discussing. As far as resigning is concerned, I have entirely too much of said time, effort and brain cells invested in this site. Including this article does not further the cause of this site nor can it serve as an object lesson to someone doing honest research on hate crimes. <i>Look at the arguments it's causing right now.</i> - Lucky 6.9 19:03, 24 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What arguments? AFAICS, all of us are discussing this matter very civilly. Commendably, I would venture to say. But if you don't want to participate in discussion over the material &amp; explain your own POV, then I would say you are going to leave Wikipedia out of frustration, &amp; much sooner than you expect. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 20:30, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Zoe hit the nail on the head. We have lots of distasteful articles on other wastes of flesh who, despite the fact they're scum, deserve an article. Using the lovely and talented Chancellor Hitler as an example, it would be patently ridiculous <i>not</i> to have an article on him. I'm not debating the right for distasteful articles like this to exist. Historical figures, living and dead, are fine for inclusion. If, God forbid, these schmucks had a shred of notability, hey...let 'em stay. These schmucks do not...and I'm using a Yiddish term on purpose. I stand by my opinion since they're not only flaunting the rules, we're letting them do so. - Lucky 6.9 05:29, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have noted your attempt at <i>ad hominem</i> objection to this listing, and also the fact that you have failed to provide any acceptable objection! "Outsourcing to India" deals with a topic of far greater inportance than this supposed 'book', and the former produces far more google hits, too. <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.255.html" title="User:80.255">80.255</a> 00:39, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
