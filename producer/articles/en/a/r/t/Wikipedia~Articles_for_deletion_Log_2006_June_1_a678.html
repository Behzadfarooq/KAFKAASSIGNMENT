<p>Novel research and wikipedia is not a platform to discuss these issues, non of the cited references (except for some cited forum discussions) gives convincing evidence that something like this exists.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Rename</b> to <b>Buffyverse canon</b> - A Buffyverse 'canon' is still referred to by people all the time; by the shows' creator, by writers who have written for <i>Buffy/Angel</i>, by people who have written for the Buffyverse <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expanded_Universe_0e61.html" title="Expanded Universe">Expanded Universe</a> (books and comics), and by fans all over the world.

<dd>Is deletion really neccessary just because the article is presently insufficiently referenced. Why not let the article be improved - there are plenty of sources that discuss Buffyverse canon on the web, for example here is Mariotte's take on canon from <a href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=7204" class="external text" title="http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=7204" rel="nofollow"><i>Comicbookresources.com</i></a>:</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Fans should be careful not to treat the comic as the "official" continuation of the franchise, as Mariotte explained. "Typically only what appears on the screen is considered canonical. If the original property's creator writes something -- like Joss writing comics about his own characters -- then I guess you can consider it canon even though it's on page instead of screen.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are plenty of quotes from Pocket Books writers, Dark Horse comics, IDW writers.. who have commented on 'canon', and such quotes can be used to reference the article. I would be willing to improve the referencing over the next few weeks.</dd>

<li>Looks like you spent a lot of time and effort into it. Looks like it hasn’t been explained to you what non-notable and fancruft is, which isn’t fair to you. To he best of my knowledge, it means... that this was created by a fan and goes into too much detail for something that is relatively insignificant to the workings or parts of the game... um well I mean is that if “article may only be understandable by people who play Warcraft 3 or people who solely play the map itself and possibly StarCraft” that is very few people would be interested in unless you directly played the map, and if you did so, you probably know all of that anyway. <a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFledgeling_731d.html" title="User:Fledgeling">Fledgeling</a> 03:09, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

People of warcraft though could possibly use this article for tips on how to play the map. On warcraft though it generally seems though if a person is a noob at the game, and this map being complicated, they may get frustrated and not want to play it and could come to this and learn how to play. I'll put the believing statement in my disclaimer even more so people do not have to accept it as the outright truth. If they wish to truly know that it is correct they will do independent research.

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> <b>Speedy delete</b> CSD A7. NN fancruft. Look up what "cruft" means on a regular dictionary, then attach that to "fan" and "game". Basically, a really really bad article that only fans could appreciate or that pertains to a game.

Wikipedia is not your personal webspace; get a free one such as <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geocities.html" title="Geocities">Geocities</a> or find a friend who will host it for you, or shell out with your own money for it.

<li><b>Reply</b> There are a decent amount of articles which are a specific custom map for Warcraft 3. Look under the popular map section in <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warcraft_3.html" title="Warcraft 3">Warcraft 3</a>And I do not see the ones I have looked at been suggested for deletion. I view this as hypocritical and also you guys are not telling me what <i>exactly</i> is wrong with my article. I have been a wiki-member for less then 2 days and yet you critisize my article without telling me exactly how to change it to make it fit the standards, also if you dislike it enough you will make the edits yourself.

<li><b>Comment</b> But you see, that's the POINT. We CAN'T edit it because we DON'T KNOW ANYTHING about it since it is so non-notable. We <i>are</i> telling you what is exactly wrong with the article. We are deleting it because it's the SUBJECT MATTER that is the problem here, not merely the article itself. Thus, you cannot change anything about it. We understand that you are a new user and we are not criticizing you for this. We want to help you understand this process; however, despite the fact that you are a new member, the article must go. If you want, I can make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and nominate all of the other articles for deletion. Actually, that would not be a bad idea, considering they all probably violate the same principles.

<li><b>ANGRY</b> Ok, seriously I am getting pissed off now. I have been given very little time to make this article acceptable and there is other articles like this. I am starting to find these comments hypocritical. If you wish to see other maps for Warcraft 3 go to <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warcraft_3.html" title="Warcraft 3">Warcraft 3</a> and then on the table of contents thing and go to other maps. There will be a list of maps including the Europa one which I did not put there but added the link to my article. None of these articles since last I checked have been suggested for deletion which makes me think some of the comments said here are hypocritical while the other articles have been there for many weeks/months but this is unknown to me but I know they've been there for awhile. Compared to mine me a noob to Wikipedia have been given very little time to make this article acceptable.

<li><b>Calming</b> I'm sorry you're getting "pissed off." The Wikipedia society is not attacking you. The term <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">fancruft</a> has nothing to do with the quality of the article.

<li><b>Delete</b> as it is fairly consistant practice that mods and maps don't get articles unless they become enormously popular (ala Counterstrike). I also want to second what Coroebus and <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> stated above. Nominating someone's article for deletion is likely going to irritate them from the start.

<li><b>Keep</b> Other articles on video game maps have been kept, and recently (see <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_dust.html" title="De dust">de_dust</a>, etc.) so there is precedent for well-written game map articles here. That being said, THIS article is an unholy mess, but it should have been tagged for cleanup and wikify before being brought here, especially when it was just created yesterday. Most articles are a work in progress and don't get spit out all sparkly on the first iteration. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 20:57, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> I can only find one fallacy for myself - the movie "Heartbreak Ridge" listed TWO people for military tech advisor and military liaison (both uncredited) and neither of them was Scott (see IMDB).

<li><b>Keep</b> <s>current article is poorly written, I'm going to try a fix.

The rename is needed, but I didn't have time for it. Part of the problem is the systemic bias of the internet. The <a href="../../../l/a/h/Lahu.html" title="Lahu">Lahu</a> are a generally rural ethnic group in an area of the world where there is limited internet acces. And, of course, the Christian portion in China would have even less access to the internet than most Chinese do.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Reasons below:
<ol>
<li>Not vanity: all contents are verifiable through the softwares website: <a href="http://www.ulsp.info/" class="external free" title="http://www.ulsp.info/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulsp.info/</a>. Moreover, technology of ULSP is, to some extent, unique among web-based programs. This makes ULSP noting-worthwhile and non-vanity.</li>
<li>ULSP is notable: ULSP website's visit count is 1266810 since November 2005, and currently has 17314 users. It is known by most Xangans in Hong Kong. Previous vandalism content about how to attack the system <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ultimate_Logging_System_Professional&amp;diff=40715033&amp;oldid=38930045" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ultimate_Logging_System_Professional&amp;diff=40715033&amp;oldid=38930045" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> also gives evidence that ULSP is notable.</li>
<li>Non-neutral does not mean should delete. Instead, they should be kept and improved.</li>
<li>Please give evidence (link etc.) to show that you yielded only 231 Google hits. According to my search on Google Hong Kong with the keyword "Ultimate Logging System Professional | ULSP", 25,800 hits were found; whereas a Yahoo Hong Kong search of "ULSP" yielded 3,330 hits and a site category (Yahoo Hong Kong doesn't provide an "inclusive or" searching function between two multi-word keywords). As many articles and reviews about ULSP referenced the program using the initials "ULSP" instead of the full name "Ultimate Logging System Professional" and were written in Chinese, it is necessary for one to turn <i>off</i> the language filter and <i>include</i> the initials "ULSP" in the search in order to yield more balancing results.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, I believe the nominator's argument does not hold owing to his lack of knowledge about the background of the program, and the article should be <b>kept</b>. --<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan"><font color="green">D</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_Esperanza_f5cd.html" title="User:Deryck Chan/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan"><font color="brown">ryc</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDeryck_Chan_4045.html" title="User talk:Deryck Chan"><font color="#007DFF">k C.</font></a> 07:17, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>NN means "non-notable", not "non-neutral". With regard to your google-fu, ULSP is an acronym with a variety of uses (Ultra Low Special Products, University of Louisville Summer Program, Upson-Lee South Primary School, etc). Similarly, the words "ultimate", "logging", "system" and "professional" are, as I'm sure you know, extremely common. The exact query I used to produce the 231 number was <i>"ultimate logging system professional" -wikipedia -answers.com</i>, which now (several days later) yields only 196 results. Similarly, <i>"ultimate logging system professional"</i> alone only yields 251 results. Searching for <i>ULSP xanga</i>, and making the assumption that every single result is a reference to Ultimate Logging System Professional, then we get roughly 9,500 results. My vote - <b>delete</b> - still stands. <a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoe_Aboulkheir_cc7f.html" title="User:Moe Aboulkheir">Moe Aboulkheir</a> 17:01, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> He was an important military figure and a COMMANDER of the 12 SS division during WWII!! A Lieutenant Colonel mentioned in the entry 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend. Also, he is mentioned in Waffen SS Commanders Vol.2 - Mark C. Yerger Pgs.104-106 and he is the author of the definitive history of the 12.SS-Panzerdivision "Hitlerjugend", called 12. SS-Panzerdivision "Hitlerjugend" - (in German). ----<a href="../../../b/o/l/User%7EBolekpolivka_86a5.html" title="User:Bolekpolivka">Bolekpolivka</a> 03:19, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> He was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Division. <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Meyer_eebb.html" title="Karl Meyer">Karl Meyer</a> was commanding officer. (Although Hubert did have operational field command after Karl was captured, per <a href="../../../1/2/t/12th_SS_Panzer_Division_Hitlerjugend_24c0.html" title="12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend">12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend</a>). Nevertheless he is notable because of his high rank in this division, which is notable for two things: (i) first German division drawn from the Hitler Youth and (ii) was in Normandy on D-day. 12th division was under personal command of Hitler, who was in Germany and did not order it into battle to contest the Allied landings until it was too late (for him, anyway). This was one of the classic military blunders of all time. --<a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> 03:43, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think his military rank was high enough to make him notable by itself, and he doesn't get even a one-liner in the 1,200+ pages of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Third_Reich_619a.html" title="The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</a>. However, he <i>did</i> write a multi-volume book in German about the history of the 12th SS division (<i>Kriegsgeschichte der 12. SS-Panzerdivision "Hitlerjugend"</i>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 3921242517</a> and also reprinted in 1996 <a href="http://www.redlightgreen.com/ucwprod/servlet/ucw.servlets.UCWController?ACTION=EDITIONVIEW&amp;EDITIONID=CUBGGLAD151484864-B&amp;WORKID=19171181&amp;MAXRECORDS=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.redlightgreen.com/ucwprod/servlet/ucw.servlets.UCWController?ACTION=EDITIONVIEW&amp;EDITIONID=CUBGGLAD151484864-B&amp;WORKID=19171181&amp;MAXRECORDS=1" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>), which someone found notable enough to translate into English and publish in two separate editions with different publishers (<i>The 12th SS&#160;: the history of the Hitler Youth Panzer Division</i>, 1994 <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0921991185</a>, 2005 <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0811731987</a>). WorldCat finds 22 copies of the first German version (all in libraries from English-speaking countries) and 42 of the 2005 English version.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, An article of good historical value. People who nominate articles , such as this one, for deletion seem to be more and more ridiculous. This officer was an important persona and did win the German Cross - one of the elite German decorations!! By the way, looking at the article's history; <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a> nominated the article for deletion while it was still beeing edited. Maybe next time, he/she should read it more carefully before taking such actions!! 162.84.165.231 00:09, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: If the editor wanted to they could easily have put the {{<a href="../../../i/n/u/Template%7EInuse_2e6a.html" title="Template:Inuse">inuse</a>}} tag on it to show that they were still working on it. Otherwise there is no way of knowing that they are still sitting at their computer working on another edit of the article. Also, one of the biggest arguments thus far for keeping this article is Mr. Meyer's work as an author which was not in the article when I nominated it. <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a>|<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDismas_5419.html" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 05:56, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I had initially prodded this, but the page creator removed the prod. Equendil then re-prodded it, but as this is not allowed, I thought it best to take the matter to AFD. The page in question describes an alleged <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">micronation</a>, housed in the apartment of this micronation's ruler (the article's creator). On the article's talk page, he states, "Rabillia is a micronation that was not fully declared publicly before. This is the first time the principality is being publicly listed anywhere." As such, it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, and should be deleted. It also fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, in that there are no sources cited and I was unable to locate any references to it, on either Google or various news article searches (in light of the creator's comments, this is not surprising, but I thought I should check anyway). -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 03:26, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, isn't that some deep research you done. Farpoint Media isn't A podcast, but an affilation of podcasts. I'm curious to know what your settings were, my Google of the phrase Farpoint Media returns 630 hits. The more popular individual podcasts are Slice of SciFi, Dragon Page Cover to Cover, and Wingin' It, which all have higher rankings than the umbrella site. I found the show notes to the first reference and I'm adding the link to the main article. By the way, just becuase you haven't heard of it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

<dd>You misunderstand. We are a community of editors; that someone has recently arrived and is likely unfamiliar with how Wikipedia works is relevant. It doesn't mean we ignore what they have to say, but knowing that they may have a personal interest in the article helps us understand their point of view. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 01:06, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I apparently didn't save my comment last time, so I'll try it again - I find your comment confusing. Doesn't the fact that someone takes the time to contribute to an article indicate a personal interest (excluding simple vandals, perhaps)? Obviously, a person can't keep every article on their watchlist. While my list continues to grow, it is ultimately going to be limited to articles that I have an interest in and feel that I can make a contribution to. Jossi's notes about how many edits a poster as made come across as flippant efforts to dimiss the poster out of hand, which is the essential definition of Ad Homenim (which has a nice writetup here, btw.) Now, maybe that is not the intent, but that is how it comes across, particularly since jossi has not responded to the points that have been raised. Ultimate ed 03:44, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually, there are nearly forty hits in google for the term, and the hit to the show notes for episode 52 (the source of the word) ranks higher than the wikipedia entry. It's pretty dissapointing to see the herd mentality at work here dogpiling on this article. Does Joe Blow on the street know this word? Probably not. But, part of the power of podcasting is that you can connect with a worldwide audience of people with a common interest. Can I tell you how big the Farpoint audiences are? No, I'm just a subscriber so I do't have that info, but I can tell from fan comments on the blogs and forums that there is a significant listership that is aware of this. Is it enough to warrant inclusion here? I think it is. Ultimate ed 04:01, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> In fact I thought this symptom was totally fallacious until I observed a corresponding "Men in gay Asia" sympathetic response. After doing further research we were able to determine that indeed it was a cultural/linguistic failing. We then asked the original claimants here again to tell us what happened and they said, they indeed do listen to the Wingin It podcast with Michael and Evo and consequently caught "mennengasia" by mp3 file osmosis. In conclusion,in this web 2.0 world we live in we must learn to embrace the longtail, wikis and mennengasian epiphanies, lest life become unbearably dull and overly-serious. Bbluesman</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> While Wingin' It doesn't currently have a Podcast Alley listing (it was part of the Dragon Page Mondo Feed that has since been discontinued in favor of separate feeds) most of the other Farpoint shows that have been around for a bit are ranked in the top 1,000 on Podcast Alley out of over 20,000 podcasts in the directory. Even the defunct Mondo feed is still ranked 545 for last month. We can debate non-notable, but to call the podcast obscure is simply a display of ignorance. When it really comes down to it, <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcasting.html" title="Podcasting">Podcasting</a> in general is an obscure concept that a relatively small portion of the population is aware of, so awareness of any given podcast is going to be a subset of this.

<li>Surely having an award named after you, being recognized as "the literary founder of lesbian feminism" and writing 13 non-self published books does, though? --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERory096_e5c4.html" title="User:Rory096">Rory096</a> 08:16, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Marketers/publicists of events have been known to indulge in hyperbole. Besides, having an award named after you doesn't automatically confer notability; one of my uni friends (RIP David) has an award named after him and was incredibly talented, but I don't think he's quite WP-worthy. If it's enough to establish notability, then why hasn't anyone put it <i>in the article itself</i>?

<p>Getupkid 05:07, 1 June 2006 (UTC)To be honest we may not be able to provide sufficient information regarding this band for the time being. Although my contribution is dubious as I do know the band through professional relationship, I feel that in a matter of months this band will have significant profile and interest to justify such an article.</p>
<p>Although I cannot substantiate this through web resources yet, the band has been commissioned to write and record a 40 second theme song for cable TV show called 'Scattered', produced independently by the presenter of The Punk Rock Show (on <a href="../../../2/n/u/2NUR_d404.html" title="2NUR">2NUR</a> FM). The program will be shown on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_V_6d3d.html" title="Channel V">Channel V</a> Australia. I am assistant music director of the show.</p>
<p>This is my first attempt at a Wikipedia contribution, and I feel this will be a topic that is expandable in the coming months.

<p>Possibly a hoax, but plausible enough to avoid a prod - page links to a real web site that references the same group (Jersey Shore Communications) listed as the owner, which really does exist but whose web site is being re-built, rendering it impossible to substantiate or disprove the claims made on the company's article. <a href="../../../m/r/s/User%7EMrschimpf_855c.html" title="User:Mrschimpf">User:Mrschimpf</a> wrote on my talk page: "I think this guy (<a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncleFloyd_d37d.html" title="User:UncleFloyd">User:UncleFloyd</a>) is trying to pull our chain with a hoax here, he added the affilate to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_CW_affiliates_6e55.html" title="List of CW affiliates">the CW list</a>, but the second result in Google leads to <a href="http://www.wmcn.tv/" class="external text" title="http://www.wmcn.tv/" rel="nofollow">WMCN</a>, a home shopping-infomercial channel with no spare UPN/WB/Fox subchannels, at least looking at the TitanTV schedule page. Jersey Shore Communications also leads to a website with no navigation at all, and the article seems to make claims that are outrageous, a Google search with commas only leads to listings involving a burglar alarm company of the same name. The WWAC article copies the new Fox O&amp;O logo and makes claims about <a href="../../../w/m/g/WMGM_e267.html" title="WMGM">WMGM</a> that seem to be very unsubstanciated. I also suspect that <a href="../../../w/w/a/User%7EWWACArtist_752f.html" title="User:WWACArtist">WWACArtist</a> would be one of his sockpuppets. <b>ETA</b>: It looks like UncleFloyd isn't really heavily involved, he just adjusted articles for readability, but still looking at things, there are a couple of new users trying to create trouble by creating fake TV stations for fun and to delude people into thinking that WWAC is real." <a href="../../../w/w/a/User%7EWWACArtist_752f.html" title="User:WWACArtist">User:WWACArtist</a> is the creator of this page. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a> 04:43, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Strong Keep</b> I am a media professional in the New York/New Jersey area and I have interviewed with the station. Hell, I even managed to Google WWAC and got relevant hits. I know they exist, hell I have even talked to them on the phone. WMCN has no relation, other than having had the same calls at one time. (WMCN was a new digital flash cut operation that was never broadcast in NTSC.) I can give you the phone number if you want it. I would not waste my time sending a demo tape and driving down to South Jersey for an interview at a non-existant station. The station is near Atlantic City, although that may have changed as I they had some sort of ownership change recently. As a media professional I love to see how non-professionals on Wikipedia have no idea even how to do proper research. It is grade school research you are doing not j-school. 05:00, 1 June 2006 (UTC)<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncleFloyd_d37d.html" title="User:UncleFloyd">UncleFloyd</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_UncleFloyd_6f92.html" title="Special:Contributions/UncleFloyd">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>You must not have the same Google I have. The only two results I see on the first two Google pages for WWAC that have anything to do with TV refer to WMCN. A search for WWAC-TV, as far as I can tell, only gets results for WMCN on the first page (there are references to WWAC, but these appear to be old references to the now-WMCN). I find it hard to believe that a station that <i>formerly</i> used the calls could get results over a station that <i>currently</i> uses them. Can you link me to one of these "relevant hits"? PS: <a href="http://www.fox.com/links/region_northeast.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fox.com/links/region_northeast.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> does not show this station as a Fox affiliate, contrary to the claims in the article. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a> 05:27, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<b>Keep</b> I have seen some graphic work for the station on a design group's web portfolio for them and I am kicking myself now for not bookmarking it, but that was a year or two ago and I cannot recall the company. When the weather is right I can get Fox 53, albiet rather fuzzy here in northern Monmouth County. TV is one of the things I know about and there is a WWAC! I suppose that you are going to say that <a href="../../../w/y/d/WYDC-TV_821d.html" title="WYDC-TV">WYDC-TV</a> diesn't exist either as its website on the Fox page you mention <a href="http://www.wydctv.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wydctv.com/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> says it is under development. I have also noticed that there are some errors and ommissions on the Fox site as well with regard to affilaites. You should also go call for some NBC affiliates deletion as there are some pages on their local stations page <a href="http://www.nbc.com/nbc/header/Local_Stations/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nbc.com/nbc/header/Local_Stations/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> that have outdated and/or inaccurate information. I can go there and find the errors and say the respective Wikipedia pages for the stations with the inaccurate information and call for there deletion because they aren't on NBC's list. <a href="../../../t/v/x/User%7ETVXPert_de45.html" title="User:TVXPert">TVXPert</a> 05:43, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> My research doesn't have the resources of a media professional, but the articles for both the station and Jersey Shore Communications popped up only tonight, and from my experience a Fox affiliate established for three years would've been listed on Wikipedia by now. The logo shown for WWAC resembles the <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Television_Stations_Group_06c9.html" title="Fox Television Stations Group">Fox Television Stations Group</a>'s new logo for their O&amp;O stations, and I doubt at this point they would give permission to an affiliate station to use it before all their other stations established the logo.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=pBL&amp;safe=off&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=%22jersey+shore+communications%22&amp;spell=1" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=pBL&amp;safe=off&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=%22jersey+shore+communications%22&amp;spell=1" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> under the parent company name leads to the company's website on top, however, there are more results in the 17 hits for Jersey Shore Communications &amp; Alarm Systems than this company. The Channel 53 frequency <a href="http://broadcastengineering.com/news/broadcasting_fcc_grants_atlantic/" class="external text" title="http://broadcastengineering.com/news/broadcasting_fcc_grants_atlantic/" rel="nofollow">went dark</a> in 2003 as a power saving/cable carriage move and WWAC moved to digital 44, then changed calls to WMCN shortly thereafter. It is highly doubtful at this point that the FCC would allow a new channel to take over 53 as they're going to clear out all the spectrum above 51 after the full conversion for HD and sell it for mobile phone services. Atlantic City is also part of the Philadephia <a href="../../../d/m/a/DMA_33fd.html" title="DMA">DMA</a> and has <a href="../../../w/p/s/WPSG_426c.html" title="WPSG">WPSG</a> already as their CW affiliate, it's a known fact that Philly signals are imported into Atlantic City via cable/dish.</p>
<p>Finally, the fact I cannot find any references to the station in B&amp;C, TVWeek, (community name) Business Journal or CW/Fox PR announcements lead me to believe that this in addition to Jersey Shore Communications are fictional entities and this article should be pulled. <a href="../../../m/r/s/User%7EMrschimpf_855c.html" title="User:Mrschimpf">Nate</a> 06:15, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Also, this line makes no sense: "Jersey Shore Communications owns subsidiary television station groups Empire Media Holdings, LLC and Keystone Media Holdings, LLC, both of which are joint ventures with Kraft Foods and Procter &amp; Gamble Co.". Two <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holding_company.html" title="Holding company">Holding companies</a> which are also <a href="../../../j/o/i/Joint_venture.html" title="Joint venture">joint ventures</a> simply for small scale TV station assets? The idea of Kraft and P&amp;G investing in TV stations is also dubious. btw, I work in the financial industry and have carried out research projects on TV station acquisitions in the US. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 16:35, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - And for the piece de resistance (it's a slow day at work), the only "Jersey Shore Communications" in New Jersey (according to the state Commerce and Recording Services department) is a burglar alarm and telephone hookup outfit in Oceanport. Don't take my word for it; give them a call at (732) 542-5777 and ask whether they own a TV station.

<li><b>Delete</b> as unreferenced, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a> article about a supposed television station. The evidence above overwhelmingly indicates there is no FOX affiliate by this name. I can't find any evidence this station even exists other than as a memory fo what WMCN-TV once was. If someone can post verifiable <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliably sourced</a> information that this station in fact exists, I will reconsider... right now the burden of proof is on the originator though.

<li><b>Comment</b> To clear the air here, I am the creative services director for the station group Jersey Shore Communications, LLC. As such, I am also in charge of creating awareness for the group and its individual stations. We are currently overhauling the station group as a whole in lieu of the major network changes coming this fall season which includes rebuilding the website. Later on today we plan on putting out a press release reguarding these changes. And to reply to RGTraynor, you are reffering and incorporated business not an LLC. So I think you people need to cease this unfounded witch hunt. <a href="../../../w/w/a/User%7EWWACArtist_752f.html" title="User:WWACArtist">WWACArtist</a> 18:31 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd like to say that I am friends with three individuals who work for the station. They started off as interns there. I am often subjected to listening to the music they come up with for the station, to give my opinion. They work hard and personally I think you have issues if you are going to delete them just because the web page is under construction. The web is the highway of communication but even the highway has roadwork being done on it. Also if you go to www.msn.com and search for Jersey Shore Communications, their main site which is currently under construction comes up as link 2/3 depending if you count the sub link under the first hit that comes up. Google doesn't rule the world you know. Jessica or Jes 19:06, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hello I'm Harvey Cox, News Director and Station President of WWAC-TV/DT. I'm here as requested by a few of my employees to get you to stop bothering them about the validity of our business' entry on this site. If you chose not to stop interfering, our legal department will take the nessicary actions to stop it for you. We here at Jersey Shore Communications are not going to tolerate being slandered by a colletion of twelve year olds that have no life whatsoever and whose sole purpose in life is to troll sites such as these and cause trouble. I hope you all will take this warning as serious as we are, because the consequences will be grave.</li>

<dd>ok, now you've decided to escalate the hoax by posing as other real people, and also to threaten to sue 12 year olds while in this new pose. The real Harvey Cox is News Director at <a href="http://www.nbc40.net/contact.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.nbc40.net/contact.asp" rel="nofollow">NBC-40, The South Jersey New Channel</a> (click on the Contact drop down menu) - you know a real website for a real TV station. I'm sure Nick &amp; co have tried or will try to apply for jobs with Mr. Cox. Impersonating Mr. Cox to threaten litigation on undeletable internet forum discussions is not to way to go if you want to impress him. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 19:59, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> So it is the subject of literature, but so what? It is not nearly as notable as some other themes of lit, such as Death or the Afterlife or a bildungsroman etc. The fact is, anyone can make literature out of any theme, and merely the fact that something has a rumor in it does not make it notable. This is a dicdef that is not nearly as notable as a <i>real</i> literary technique. <b><a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHobbeslover_149a.html" title="User:Hobbeslover">Hobbeslover</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../h/o/b/User_talk%7EHobbeslover_fb13.html" title="User talk:Hobbeslover">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hobbeslover_dec5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hobbeslover">contribs</a></sup> 17:30, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The point is that, especially in Roman and Greek literature, Rumour is personified as a god like being (for example, read the Aeneid). I agree if it were simply on the theme of rumour the article would not be notable. <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: Black;">michael</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">Curtis</span> <small style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><sup><a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelrccurtis_4797.html" title="User talk:Michaelrccurtis">talk</a></sup>+<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Michaelrccurtis_b45c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Michaelrccurtis">contributions</a></sub></small> 22:04, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Seriously, I'd say the literature angle is actually of secondary importance -- rumors are a pretty important concept, and to <i>not</i> have an article about it simply makes no sense -- I mean, see <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gossip.html" title="Gossip">gossip</a>, for an example of what I mean. (Gossiping often happens by repetation of rumors, but it's not quite the same thing -- still, it's a comparable phenomenon.) I just expanded the article a little in that direction. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 23:27, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thanks for not immediately deleting the page. For what it is worth I don't work for Ballistic Media and this article isn't astroturfing. As a digital artist I appreciate the CGSociety and would like to encourage the work they have done to promote digital artists. The CGTalk article has been up for quite a long time. (I did not start the entry.) Why would either be an inappropriate?? There are articles on Yahoo! and many other websites and publishing houses, as well as of course art movements. The CGSociety is an important institution for digital artists. This article is most definitely not an advertisement. If you find advertising text within it, please remove it -- not the entire article. The CGSociety to my mind is a modern online version of the Salon des Refuses or similar forum for artists. It has a very real impact upon the art world today and deserves notice in Wikipedia. Please do not delete this article. Thank you. User:Ericmachmer</li>

Really appreciate it that you took the time to send me the useful info on how to improve this...if I just work on the /Temp page would that be okay? It would be great to be able to refer other cg artists to a page they would be also able to enhance. Thanks again for not just refering to my efforts as "CGCrap" or "Delete. And then delete again."

<dd><b>Comment</b> As I have said on badlydrawnjeff's talk page, I was not aware that the song was so big in the US, and the recent changes were after I nominated it for deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm neutral on this. It started as a vanity article, but I put in some negative reviews and they stayed in, so now it's less of a puff piece. Editing out some of the unsourced autobiographical stuff might be a good idea. It's a adequately-written article.

She has appeared 14 times in Score magazine and Voluptuous magazine and once in Mamazon. She has also appeared on the websites of Score and Voluptuous. Score is one of the largest big bust magazines and Voluptuous is one of the largest natural big bust magazines (one or both may be the largest). She has had parts in at least two pornographic movies and has had one movie that is just about her, with her name in the title. Usually only performers with a fair amount of notability and significant name recognition with fans have such movies, at least when the movie is produced by a major studio. If she was not a porn actress and the films and magazines had the same audience in terms of numbers, I suspect that the article would be easily kept. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 15:23, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

It says <i>"Sexual Apartheid is a term used by some <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBT_social_movements_dccb.html" title="LGBT social movements">same-sex rights</a> advocates"</i>, but the references don't back this up, as the three external links all refer to <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Tatchell_6e4b.html" title="Peter Tatchell">Peter Tatchell</a>.

<dd><i>Reductio ad Googlum</i> is the weakest argument possible. In fact, Google Books search does not establish the notability of the term or its meaning; extensive research using reliable sources is required to do either. The books where this phrase is found may use in various meaning, and Google search certainly says nothing as to how widely the term is accepted or whether there is any agreement regarding its meaning.

<dd>I'm not sure that Google says nothing about whether there is any agreement regarding its meaning.

<li><b>Delete, reluctantly</b> For reasons stated by Zeq and Moshe, the obvious motivation behind the creation of this article (i.e. as part of the overall attack on Israel) persuades me that this article should not be kept at this time. "Reluctantly" (or "weakly" if you prefer) because I do not believe the phrase "sexual apartheid" (which to me, would mean a policy to keep gay etc. people separate from straight people) presents nearly the degree of difficulties that "Israeli apartheid" does. For one thing, "Israeli apartheid" is a specific, direct attack on Israel; it says right in the title that "apartheid" is being practiced by Israel. "Sexual apartheid" does not name a culprit. It implies that <i>someone</i> practices "sexual apartheid" but does not say who. Some might believe that "sexual apartheid" is practiced by all those who practice discrimination based on sexuality or those who express anomosity toward others based on their sexuality, though I think a strong argument could be made that they are not synonymous. All this is by way of saying that I do not think "sexual apartheid" is a hateful term, as "Israeli apartheid" obviously is. Sorry for the length of the comment, I just think this one is slightly more complicated. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 16:37, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>You should be judging based on the merits or demerits of the article in question itself, not on what you think of other articles or what you think the motivation in creating the article is. Homey 16:49, 2 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm pretty sure I don't need you to be telling me what I should be doing, especially when you are the one who created these articles (gender/sexual/global apartheid) just so you could justify keeping a "disambiguation" page referring to "Israeli apartheid" and giving the latter equal billing with actual apartheid. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 18:07, 2 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Given that you've admitted you're not calling for deletion based on anything in the article itself but based on external factors I thought it prudent to advise you that you are supposed to be voting on the merits of the article, not because you're opposed to a completely different article. <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Apartheid (disambiguation)">apartheid (disambiguation)</a> will stand or fall on their own merits, what happens to this article will have no bearing on that - so why take out your anger at Israeli apartheid on an innocent little article on a completely different topic? Homey 19:12, 2 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Homey, let me ask <b>you</b> a question. Given that I was, by my count, at least the <b>sixth</b> person to refer to your reasons or motives for creating this article (including those who cited WP:POINT)while voting to delete, why I am the first one you choose to "advise" in this manner? I did not think of the argument myself, I am just agreeing with others. Am I being singled out for attention because I made the foolish mistake of acknowledging that I have reservations about my vote? Maybe the next time I won't be so foolish, but I would think that the expression of second thoughts is something Wikipedia would want to encourage in other to have a full and open discussion. I don't feel very encouraged right now. I probably should have just said "Delete per Zeq and Moshe," and then you wouldn't be bothering me. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 19:29, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Why? Because you express moral qualms about doing the wrong thing and were right to do so. Do you actually have any reason to vote delete based on the content of the article itself? Homey 19:34, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>I deleted this article because it seemed an OR to me, at least the naming part. The author contacted me and stated notability reasons: 1. Used constantly, just not NAMED 2. Somebody has to do it 3. Industrial context 4. Keep reading trade magazines 5. Respect the license and monitor patents issued</p>
<p>So I am putting it here to generate a clearer consensus. The naming part is problematic, the rest seems quite ok.

<dd><i>Reductio ad Googlum</i> is the weakest argument possible. In fact, Google Books search does not establish the notability of the term or its meaning; extensive research is required to do either. The book where this phrase is found may: a) use this phrase in the meaning described in the article, b) use to refer to the global phenomenon of racial discrimination, c) use it in some other meaning, d) reference the book above, e) do something else with this phrase. All the possibilities are open here, and Google search certainly says nothing as to how widely the term is accepted.

<dd>Porn stars, comic book, video game and cartoon characters are at least identifiable people or objects and are thus suitable for an encyclopedia, but random two-word combinations are not, even if used by some academics. Try searching Google Scholar for a completely innocuous phrase, like <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22teaching+experience%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22teaching+experience%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">teaching experience</a>; it gets 33,800 hits among scholarly papers. So, why not start an article on teaching experience? Because it is not useful in political advocacy, I'm afraid.

<dd>Well 'gobal apartheid' does seem to be a term that has been used to refer to this phenomenon, so I would vote keep, but since I'm not sure that it is significantly different as a concept from neocolonialism (and maybe there are other similar articles out there), I have gone for redirect. --Coroebus 17:47, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Secondly, what constitutes 'notable'? He may not be in the David Hockney league in terms of international recognition, but he's been exhibited many times, his work can be found in several public collections and he has received commissions from some significant public bodies. He qualifies as a fairly well known artist in England (in the same way as his Aussie Rules football namesake is presumably fairly well known in Australia, even if not elsewhere). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Adonisz (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adonisz_ea49.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adonisz">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p><br />
Here again I would ask what constitutes 'proof of notability'?</p>
<p>For example, if we speak of the 'Impressionist' school most people will have heard of Renoir, Monet, etc. Yet there were many other impressionists who achieved local notability without gaining global recognition.</p>
<p>It sometimes looks like there were no impressionists other than the French (notwithstanding Sisley - his parents were British, but he was born and spent most of his life in France. Plus being sent to London as a young man 'to improve his English').</p>
<p>Still there were notable impressionists in many other countries (Canada, Nordic countries, Latin America to name just some regions). One renowed artist was Spain's Sorolla (there is a charming museum devoted to him in Madrid), yet how many people (apart from those who have taken the trouble to acquire a deeper knowledge of art history) have heard of him?</p>
<p>I return to the example of the other Julian Rowe whose entry appears in Wikipedia. Now this guy is not someone globally recognisable such as Michael Jordan, David Beckham or Martina Navratilova, but he's known enough in Australia as an Aussie Rules footballer to qualify.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Rowe creates impressive art, but does not yet meet the Wiki standard for notability, "Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse) and who are likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field." The acceptance of work into a gallery does not sufficiently meet the stated test in the Wiki guidelines. Checking 3 standard art resources -- <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/ulan/" class="external text" title="http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/ulan/" rel="nofollow">Union List of Artist Names</a>, <a href="http://authorities.loc.gov/" class="external text" title="http://authorities.loc.gov/" rel="nofollow">Library of Congress Authorities</a>, and <a href="http://www.artnet.com/Artists/ArtistIndex.aspx?alpha=A1" class="external text" title="http://www.artnet.com/Artists/ArtistIndex.aspx?alpha=A1" rel="nofollow">Artnet</a> -- yields no references to Rowe. Google searches also do not yield evidence of wide recognition. Based on the quality of his work, I'm confident that he will achieve notability, but Wiki is not a vehicle for this purpose. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveHopson_68d6.html" title="User:SteveHopson">SteveHopson</a> 21:18, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

DELETE. Unfortunately, I have to concede to the weight of evidence that Steve has accumulated. If Rowe hasn't gained recognition on the objective scales he refers to, then the article should be removed.</p>
<p>But thanks to everyone who voiced an opinion and I hope it will encourage you to follow the work of this artist - check out his website, it's very good. As Steve says, he may not yet make the Wikipedia, but he clearly has the talent to do so one day.</p>

Things that are "close to us" often appear more notable than they actually are. Most of the people who partecipate in AfD discussions spend lot of time on Wikipedia, so Wikipedia-related things appear more important than they actually are (as a recent example, a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Philip_Sandifer_dc6d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Philip Sandifer">wikipedia editor</a> appeared notable to 40 people out of ~150 even if he was only mentioned once in a local newspaper).

<dd>For this reason, I always question the actual notability of things that are so "close" to Wikipedia.

<p>Non-notable term and a POV-fork of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexism.html" title="Sexism">sexism</a>. It is interesting to observe that contrary to Homeontherange's view that "sexual apartheid" refers to LGBT issues, while "gender apartheid" refers to discrimination of women, the sources do not support it. For example, this <i>Washington Post</i> article<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A15193-2001Dec21?language=printer" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A15193-2001Dec21?language=printer" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> refers to discrimination of women in Saudi Arabia as "sexual apartheid". In a nutshell, we have no reliable sources discussing the term and confirming its notability.

<dd>The three linked articles do not provide good evidence of notability. The Guardian UK article only contains a single quote from Dr. Connor -- he is not the article's subject, nor does it claim that he is particularly notable. The article in the Charleston Post and Courier does focus on Dr. Connor (to some extent), but this looks like evidence of his <i>local</i> notability (the Post and Courier's circulation is about 100,000, which puts it roughly in the top 200 US newspapers in terms of circulation, but it's billed as "local news," so this is less than clearcut). Since Dr. Connor is (as far as I can tell) a Baptist, the Baptist Press article is the equivalent of a notice in a trade journal. The other items can't be checked online, so I can't tell whether they're evidence of Dr. Connor's notability. So -- sorry, but I just don't see clear evidence of notability per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> here. If you can add other linked sources to this article, I'd be glad to revise my opinion. On the other hand, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> doesn't list religious figures as a category, which might be something to consider codifying at a later date.

<dd>Please note: there is no requirement to provide online verification. If notability is verified by citing print publication this is perfectly acceptable, unless of course there is evidence to doubt the veracity of the citation. I do not believe that is the case in this instance<s>, particularly with the religious affiliation of the contributors.</s> <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 00:29, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I checked the three linked citations, and they provided at best marginal proof of notability. Therefore, I'm inclined to suspect that the other (nonlinked) citations are probably similar. I encourage any knowledgeable contributors to add linked citations which make a stronger case for notability per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I'm not sure how the religious affiliation of the contributors matters one way or another -- I try to <a href="../../../g/f/_/WP%7EGF_4344.html" title="WP:GF">assume good faith</a> regardless of the contributor's background.

<li>STRONG KEEP*** Dr. Connor is doing God's work. I have known Dr. Connor personally for 10 years. He was the former paster at our church in Mt. Pleasant, SC and is a very spirit-filled minister. God is using him very strongly in spiritural warfare helping oppressed people. I know spiritural warfare exists because my husband and I have experienced it ourselves and we believe in Dr. Connor. Until it happens to someone you love, you don't have any idea it exists. Thank God for Dr. Connor. kellyc...<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.58.234.25 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.58.234.25_f31f.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.58.234.25">contribs</a>).</small> <small>user's first edit</small></li>
<li>STRONG KEEP!!!! I know Dr. Connor personally. Several years ago he gave up a very good pastorate to "go toe to toe with Satan."

He helps others out of love. This is rare today. Please keep this site open so that others may find help. Thanks.

However, I neglected to research to see if an official statement had yet been released. To my knowledge, as of 2 June 2006, it has not. I will continue to research this to find verification, but in the meantime-- if you would like to remove the page, you have my blessing-- as I have saved my work in a .txt file, and can repost and edit when I find the verifiable links. However, I would like to add that what I <i>did</i> find in my research were these two facts:</li>

<li>According to The NPD Group, in 2005, <i>GUN</i> was the #1 best-selling game based on a new intellectual property in the United States<a href="http://investor.activision.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=186718" class="external autonumber" title="http://investor.activision.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=186718" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, and,</li>
<li>Michael Griffith, president and CEO of Activision's publishing group, released a statement saying he considers <i>GUN</i> to be a success and that he is "excited about the future of this property," and that plans are being made<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/gun/news.html?sid=6143738" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/gun/news.html?sid=6143738" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Potentially great...'college player'...i.e., in these U.S....., who has already been a great national figure and basketball player for his Sengalese National Team. Uninformed Wikipedia editors, who seem insenstive to such, have significantly detracted from the original Article of Mouhammad Faye, by deleting such previously included pieces of information. Again, if you don't know college basketball, why are you editing articles on college basketball players?....Is it good content or just good grammar you want? Or, are we simply being lowered to the lowest denominator. --Possepartner 11:36, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

The impact of communicating this accurate knowledge, particularly as the subject's fame increases, is worth another strong, empassioned plea to "Keep" this article in Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Thank you for your consideration. --Possepartner 17:53, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Listen, I know that you want this included, but it just doesn't meet the standards. Right now, the subject is a little under the threshold of notability required by Wikipedia. But I'm sure that given a few years, Faye will become more and more well known and notable in his achievements, and when that day comes, it will be appropriate for him to have an article. I try to be openminded, but when an AFD dispute like this comes along and attracts dozens of sockpuppet votes, I have to be firm in my resolve to stick to Wikipedia policy. I wish you luck in the future. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 22:14, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The information in the article is true, and is of value to anyone that has an interest in college basketball, Georgia Tech especially. Also, there have been numerous online gathering points where the "legend" of Faye was extolled, brought on by a LACK of information about this basketball player from Senegal. Removing information about him, will no doubt again lead to the interested looking for information, and then having to make it up as it will not be widely available. I see no reason why the article should be deleted, except that some have "dug in" to their positions. Is is also, IMO, weak on the part of the editor to infer that the article was written by the subject, as this is an allegation that should have at least the aspect of merit, rather than accusing someone of doing this without any cause. Just because the editor is wrong, he should be willing to leave the page alone to atone for his mistake.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>I said this before and I will say it again, if you people know nothing about sports, please don't talk and please don't decide what should be on here. Faye is a celebrity in Senegal, and actually took part in their NBA camp, and scored very well. If people like Kuzaar are going to sit in front of their computer and discourage people from having profiles on here because they are popular in another country, they have the wrong intentions. Further, there are MANY ncaa athletes on here. A basketball player is a star, and a noteworthy addition to Wikipedia...especially a basketball player at a school that was in the FIANL FOUR two years ago, and holds a lot of sway nationwide. One more thing, to say Kuzaar isn't qualified isn't a personal attack, it just happens to be true that as a non sports fan he's opinion shouldn't be taken as seriously here...this just isn't his realm. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.174.133.128 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.174.133.128.html" title="User talk:68.174.133.128">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.174.133.128_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.174.133.128">contribs</a>).</small>

<p>This Strategic Center appears not to exist. It gets no Google references that are not Wikipedia clones, and the external link given in the article does not mention the center.

<dd>Yeah, it does <a href="http://www.state.gov/t/us/rm/63877.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.state.gov/t/us/rm/63877.htm" rel="nofollow">appear to exist</a>. Just to clarify here, I think the problem here is that the center's official name doesn't actually seem to include the word "Strategic" at all, so if you search with the whole name, all you get is the Wikipedia hits. In fact, "Strategic Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction", that <i>does</i> include the word "stratetic", is just a redirect to the actual article, <a href="../../../u/s/s/USSTRATCOM_Center_for_Combating_Weapons_of_Mass_Destruction_11e0.html" title="USSTRATCOM Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction">USSTRATCOM Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction</a>. Though I guess you're already aware of this. =) No harm done, and frankly, good job on the follow-up, man; I think most people don't really bother to look any further once they've fired off the initial AfD. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 16:59, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I very much doubt that a guitar owned by <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billie_Joe_Armstrong_efb6.html" title="Billie Joe Armstrong">Billie Joe Armstrong</a> is important enough to merit an article of its own. What little information there is here already exists in the article about Armstrong, and a redirect from here strikes me as kind of pointless, since the likelihood of anyone actually specifically typing in "Blue (guitar)" in the hopes of getting information about it, rather than trying "Billie Joe Armstrong" first is ridiculously low. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 16:52, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>On the Longwave frequency: "This range includes the low frequency band, and part of the medium frequency band." Low frequency and Longwave are not the same thing. If deleted, make sure the differences are clear in the Longwave article.</li>
<li>Longwave is not low frequency! <b>PLEASE READ <a href="http://www.vlf.it/frequency/bands.html" class="external text" title="http://www.vlf.it/frequency/bands.html" rel="nofollow">Definition of frequency bands (VLF, ELF... etc.)</a></b> text by: Tomislav Stimac (<a href="http://www.inet.hr/~tstimac/contacts.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.inet.hr/~tstimac/contacts.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.inet.hr/~tstimac/contacts.htm</a>) 134.193.168.236 20:17, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>: <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longwave.html" title="Longwave">longwave</a> is not <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_frequency.html" title="Low frequency">low frequency</a>. Please read the articles, especially <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longwave.html" title="Longwave">longwave</a>, where it clearly says:
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Longwave radio frequencies are those below 500 kHz, which correspond to wavelengths longer than 600 meters. This range includes the low frequency band, and part of the medium frequency band.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Contrast this with <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_frequency.html" title="Low frequency">low frequency</a>, which is again perfectly clear:
<dl>
<dd><i>Low Frequency or LF (sometimes called longwave) refers to Radio Frequencies (RF) in the range of 30–300 kHz.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Obviously, "below 500 kHz" and "30–300 kHz" are not the same thing. In any case, deleting "low frequency" and keeping "longwave" would totally go against the standard for band-related articles, which are almost universally named by frequency. — <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohantheghost_a1e6.html" title="User:Johantheghost">Johan&#160;the&#160;Ghost</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohantheghost_a875.html" title="User talk:Johantheghost"><sub>seance</sub></a> 11:11, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. DotA, EotA and Tolkien-related games all have some importance, as they are litterally being played by thousands of players. Thus, citing sources should not be a problem, as these games have their own specialized community websites. However, it appears that many of the smaller maps could pose a problem, as they contain a lot of unwanted clan talk, and do indeed lack sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> the articles. WP:NOT also states that Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy, and this smells of rules lawyering to me. These articles are relevant to the life of WarCraft III, and reflective of some of the strongest elements of the WCIII fan community. If WCIII is worthy of being noted in Wikipedia, then the major contributions of the fanbase to the series (which is arguably a genre unto itself) are also worth noting.

<li><b>Comment</b> This is the user's first edit. In response to his allegations: the rules lawyering on that he is referring to (<a href="../../../l/a/w/WP%7ELAWYER_7fd4.html" title="WP:LAWYER">WP:LAWYER</a>) deals specifically with ArbCom only. In any case, we are gathering concensus here, which makes Bartender06's arguments invalid. Despite his perception procedural error here, this does not mitigate the fact that many of these articles are using Wikipedia space as a free web host. By Bartender's line of argument, then the contributions of the fanbase are a "genre unto itself" which would elevate it to equal status with its originating work, and then that would spawn more articles on increasingly irrelevant subjects. Also, I have not said that this should be removed <i>entirely</i> from wikipedia. It is, of course, important to note the fan community of WC3. I suggest that we do, in fact, do this. However, we do not need this many articles on what I believe is fancruft. Instead, we should merge them all into one page. I do not have first hand experience with the "more notable" maps in question, so I will let the more informed be the judge of that. Meanwhile, I stand by my vote and let community concensus override me. <b><a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHobbeslover_149a.html" title="User:Hobbeslover">Hobbeslover</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../h/o/b/User_talk%7EHobbeslover_fb13.html" title="User talk:Hobbeslover">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hobbeslover_dec5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hobbeslover">contribs</a></sup> 03:54, 3 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> That it is my first edit does not prevent me from being able to contribute. First let me correct two misunderstandings. First, my reference to a "genre unto itself" is to the series Warcraft III, not the fan contribution. Also, the rules lawyer comment was off base. Rather, knowing nothing about the petitioner, I feel that the reason for submission for deletion here is that no value is placed by the poster on the medium, and therefore it seems to him that the articles are "free webspace" rather than useful contributions. Your suggestion to merge is acceptable, if detail is allowed to be retained. Anyway, I still believe, despite my inexperience posting in WP, that this "fancruft" was intended when Blizzard created its game (mod tools included, "fancruft" development conducted by blizzard programmers), and should have a amount of space dedicated to it, large enough to explain but without rambling on. The current amount does not seem excessive to me. --One more thing: it seems odd to state that WP:NOT bureaucracy only applies to conflict resolution. Unless I'm missing something, it doesn't *say* that. <b>Bartender06</b> 15:34, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Bartender06, you misunderstand. I myself am a gamer and I have played WC3 in the past. However, I can say with certainty that I have never heard of these maps in the past, and I am willing to bet that most casual players (let alone the general population) does not know or care about this. Yes, it is important to know this, but much of this information is/could be convered on official websites. Some of these articles are making Wikipedia into an unnecessarily detailed game guide, as vanity, and free webspace. <b><a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHobbeslover_149a.html" title="User:Hobbeslover">Hobbeslover</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../h/o/b/User_talk%7EHobbeslover_fb13.html" title="User talk:Hobbeslover">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hobbeslover_dec5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hobbeslover">contribs</a></sup> 16:28, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tolkien-based_Warcraft_III_games_ddba.html" title="Tolkien-based Warcraft III games">Tolkien-based Warcraft III games</a> article already lists a brief description of all major custom LOTR maps (a few paragraphs each). Instead of merging it with a huge Warcraft III custom games article, wouldn't it just be suitable to move it to Tolkien-based Warcraft III custom games? The same should be applied to the other maps. I don't think they should ALL be merged into ONE article, but rather, if they are to be merged at all, to have them merged into a few articles with maps of similar concepts: EotA/DotA, LOTR, massing games, etc. --<a href="../../../m/3/t/User%7EM3taphysical_b4c8.html" title="User:M3taphysical">Ludvig</a> 01:03, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep DotA</b> This deserves an article as much as any other computer game, being the predominant custom map played on WC3. Merge some of the lesser ones, but keep this and any others of such significance. 210.18.214.122 01:22, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> 1) DOTA is a very popular game, and as someone else mentioned, DOTA is probably played by more people than the actual Warcraft 3 game itself. 2) When I first heard of DOTA, I only knew about its four letters and therefore typed in 'DOTA' in a search engine to find out what the hype was about. Many sites came up, but if Wikipedia had been one of them, it would have been the first I checked out. So yes, having the keyword DOTA in wikipedia adds to its value.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'm a representative of the most popular Russian site about Dota, and I can prove that Dota Allstars sites attract much more people then Warcraft site. Maybe it's not STRATEGIC decision to keep dota article alive, but you should remember that Wikipedia is CONTEMPORARY information book. As soon as dota becomes unpopular (it can be in 1-2 years, or maybe never), you will be able to delete this article. Skadi (193.238.131.253 18:46, 6 June 2006 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I really hope the nominator will take the time to renominate these maps again seperately. Whereas Defense of the Ancients should be kept due to its use in professional competitions in the <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyberathlete_Professional_League_fea7.html" title="Cyberathlete Professional League">Cyberathlete Professional League</a> tournaments, many other of the custom maps should not. "Swat: aftermath" warcraft gets around 100 links on Google. I bet that its player numbers are nothing compared to the counter-strike maps we have at Wikipedia at all. Three Corridors is a custom map for a custom game for Warcraft? Like wtf? How is that possibly notable, can someone who plays this log into Battle.net right now and give me a solid number on how many people are playing this right now? Vampirism Revolution? 18 Google links?

<p>Apparently Mr. Kidd is a lightning designer, and Google easily confirms as much -- he gets about 110 hits, and most of them seem to be about him. However, I don't really see anything about him that would establish him as any more notable than any other experienced lightning designer; most of the Google hits appear to simply credit him instead of discussing his work. I'm sure he's good at his job, but I don't really think that's enough to merit an encyclopedia article. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 14:48, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>For the record (and just to be fair), let me add that an anon user just popped up on my talk page and <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptain_Disdain_9320.html#David_W_Kidd" title="User talk:Captain Disdain">said</a> that <i>"He is probably in the top 20 UK lighting designers having lit everygthing from major theatre, to stars such as Elton John and Montserrat Caballe. He is one of the 'old school' who came from permanent positions within theatres, moving into lighting design and not having studied the discipline at college. I believe his inclusion in Wikipedia is fair."</i> Personally, however, I don't think even exceptionally skilled industry professionals are necessarily notable unless they are actually, well, <i>noted</i> by the world at large for one reason or another. I don't think Mr. Kidd is, and obviously I don't mean that as a slight on him -- it's just that of the six billion of us on this planet, most of us just don't register on the radar, even if we work with people who do. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 15:30, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>article is barely coherent and full of misinformation. some examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>it gives at least two fundamentally erroneous statements re ergodicity. it confused ergodicity with the a priori equal probability assumption in the first section. and the statement "... (otherwise, we would have ergodicity with respect to particle number). ..." is simply nonsensical.</li>
<li>the derivation is awkward and unilluminating.</li>
<li>the last expression in the first section is precisely the canonical partition partition. yet, immediately below, the article claims " The previous derivation is too restricted..." then apparently proceeds to "derive" canonical ensemble.</li>
<li>the last section proposes to derive the grand canonical ensemble, so why not give the grand partition function explicitly?</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the article is possibly correct information that is at least awkwardly arranged or misarranged (one can probably find pieces of it here and there in some texts), with incorrect statements and no clear understanding demonstrated throughout. <a href="../../../m/c/t/User%7EMct_mht_d584.html" title="User:Mct mht">Mct mht</a> 21:21, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"someone has removed the deletion tag and gave the following edit summary: (rm prod tag. mistakes in content aren't a reason to delete. if the material is irrelevant, double check that it's all covered elsewhere then make it a redirect.) if this kind of incoherence doesn't warrant deletion, then what does. one shouldn't weigh in unless 1. one has the background and is wiliing to rewrite and salvage this article, or 2. has knowledgable rebuttal to the points raised above. furthermore, as stated in the tag added, same material is covered in other relevant pages in much more legible fashion.

<dd>the above seems to be another generic response. again, the article gives bad information, in a technical sense. as long as that's properly noted, doesn't really matter whether it is deleted or not. it's also redudant to have a separate page, esp. a questionable one, on that subject. it is somewhat funny that people enter the discussion for what seems to be purely bureaucratic reasons and give no indication whatsoever that they understand the reasons given (e.g. "There is <i>no way</i> this article is so bad that deleting it would be better than editing it...", then no specific reason.) if that happens to be the policy, fine, as long as the reader is notified the information is unreliable. as noted above, any rebuttal from someone familiar with the subject in question is surely welcome. <a href="../../../m/c/t/User%7EMct_mht_d584.html" title="User:Mct mht">Mct mht</a> 00:17, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>it would be kinda funny if the article is retained and bad information is left out there because people ignorant in the subject matter decide to have their bureaucratic say. seems pretty obvious the only sensible objections are from someone who's competent to judge, and who either disagrees on the specific points raised or on the worthiness of the article. <a href="../../../m/c/t/User%7EMct_mht_d584.html" title="User:Mct mht">Mct mht</a> 00:34, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It's possible that the article is so bad that it should be deleted. If it is wrong, then in AfD language, it would be unverifiable, original research and unencyclopaedic. I also see that it was been around for three years without major improvements. On the other hand, correct information merely being awkwardly arranged is not sufficient reason for deletion. More later. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 07:30, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. If there is incorrect information, simply delete that material and move it to the talk page. If the material is covered elsewhere, remove those bits with {main} tags as appropriate. If we end up with an article that has nothing left to say, we'll delete it then. It's harmful to delete an article that someone's put a lot of time and effort into on such shakey grounds.

<p>shaky in what sense? you even read the article? by "possibly correct" i meant surely pieces of it here and there can be found in various references. as whole, article is incorrect and incoherent. also, i do realize mere awkwardness is far from being sufficient to warrant deletion. <a href="../../../m/c/t/User%7EMct_mht_d584.html" title="User:Mct mht">Mct mht</a> 07:46, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>something should be clarified: is the ability to read the article and the reasons given for deletion at least somewhat intelligently required to enter the discussion (perhaps as an unwritten understanding somewhere)? this seems to be absent in the two votes given so far. if that's not the policy, then my mistake. i'd assumed whatever objections, if any, the proposal is to encounter would be knowledgable and informative. this hasn't been the case so far. <a href="../../../m/c/t/User%7EMct_mht_d584.html" title="User:Mct mht">Mct mht</a> 08:12, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The "ability to read the article ... somewhat intelligently?" I find that insulting. I read the article, and I read your objections, and I understood them and stated my response. If you're so insistent, point by point: 1: there are a couple of errant uses of "ergodic" in the article that, if removed, solves this problem. 2: awkward and unilluminating? this is general criticism, and a good reason to improve the article, but no reason to delete at all. 3: I can't tell if you're objecting to a sentence in the article or the article's structure. If the former, it's easily fixed. If the latter, it's still fixable, but requires more rewriting. 4: The article doesn't have to be written the way you would write it unless you actually work on writing it. My fundamental question for you is, why not just work on the article? Maybe there's a misunderstanding here: you don't have to take it to AfD to erase parts of the article; AfD is for <i>full deletion</i>, which removes the article and its entire edit history from Wikipedia. You don't have to get central approval for editing, even major editing of an article. When other editors object to your edits, you should stop and discuss. I see no reason why this article is unsalvageable; it contains useful introduction text, for instance, and I personally didn't find the derivation that confusing, it seems pretty well-explained from a mathematical perspective. Hence, keep it. My suggestion is, take this to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Physics_630e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Mathematics_7ee9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics</a> to find collaborators to help improve the article.

However, from the title, that shouldn't be the goal. Thus, the last two sections should be cropped out (actually, the last section should maybe be merged into <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_canonical_ensemble.html" title="Grand canonical ensemble">Grand canonical ensemble</a> since the material doesn't seem to be there), and the links to this article put in the proper context.

<dd>No, it is unreasonable to expect people voting on AfD to thoroughly read an article before voting. AfD exists to answer the question: "Is this article so inappropriate or so far beyond hope that it should be nuked?" - any discussion about actually fixing the article should take place on the article's talk page. Could a good article on this topic be written? Does the current article contain some basic information to get a rewrite started? Yes? End of discussion: Keep the article, but remove as much as you need to to the talk page while a rewrite is in progress. Deleting the article itself erases history and won't help a rewrite proceed any faster. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevage_a8b0.html" title="User talk:Stevage">Stevage</a> 11:38, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that voters are only required to read as much as necessary to answer the question "Is this article so inappropriate or so far beyond hope that it should be nuked?" However, you said yourself that the article should be deleted if, after removing incorrect and duplicated bits, "we end up with an article that has nothing left to say". I'd argue this could well be the case here. I also think that redirection is not a good option, since there is also no sensible target to redirect to. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 12:48, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In response to Mct mht's request for clarification: regrettably, such a requirement is not observed here.</dd>
<dd>In response to Stevage: This is not a typical article, because it's a derivation. This means that one cannot simply delete parts of it.</dd>
<dd>I am of the firm opinion that we should look at the technical points before deciding what to do with the article. I numbered the nominator's point above, so that I can easily refer to them.</dd>
<dd>1. is a valid point as far as I can tell, but easily corrected by removing all references to ergodicity. I don't see what it has to do with the derivation anyway. 2. and 4. are not important enough in my opinion to warrant deletion. I'm not sure what is meant with 3. It seems that the article first derives the partition function for a closed system, then notes that interaction with the environment needs to be taken into account ("The previous derivation is too restricted..."), and then proceeds that this does not change the result. However, I cannot square this with the sentence "Because of its assumption of the independence of the molecules, it only really applies to ideal gases." in the article. The discussion that follows does not seems connected with this assumption.</dd>
<dd>I had a look at the talk page and I saw the statement:
<dl>
<dd>"… it would be obvious that there would be a maxima in the distribution (somewhere near total energy of system divided by number of molecules). Yet the derived equation gives an exponetial decay in the relative occupancy of energy states i.e. more molecules would be in the lowest energy state than in any other state."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I can see this point. There must be an assumption being used here which is not made explicit (energy of excited states is large compared with total energy divided by number of particles?). However, on the talk page I also see <a href="../../../v/z/l/User%7EVzlatic_e5a0.html" title="User:Vzlatic">User:Vzlatic</a> defending the derivation, at least up to a point. As far as I can see, the mathematics is okay, except that I'm not sure whether Stirling's approximation can be used (surely, <i>N</i> is large, but what about <span class="texhtml"><i>N</i><sub><i>i</i></sub></span>?). Perhaps this can all be fixed by taking the limit <i>N</i> → ∞.</dd>
<dd>In summary, the four points raised by the nominator are not enough to warrant deletion, but they do indicate a problem, and if there are too many problems then the article should be deleted. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 08:23, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would like to see a more respect for experts in extremely difficult academic subjects, even if they are not fully up-to-speed on the usual comings-and-goings of AfD. If the derivation is no good, and nobody has time to improve it, then I do think it's better than delete than to leave it—or perhaps, to make things more palatable to everyone, we could simply redirect to the partition function article. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 08:47, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b> ok, finally some technically sensible responses. it was getting rather disappointing.</dd>

<dd>reply to Jitse Niesen: yes, Stirling's approx is a common trick in this context. N is typically on the order of 10^(23).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>reply to Jitse Niesen: regarding reason 3 for deletion, clearly there's a problem there. after a long-winded calculation to obtain the partition function for the canonical ensemble, it immediately claims what's been done is too restrictive then "considers the canonical ensemble." this is a fundamental mistake in realizing the two approaches (one by analysing the multiplicities directly and the other by considering a system coupled with a reservoir) are equivalent and both give the canonical ensemble.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>reply to Jitse Niesen, regarding the exponential decay, the result is right. higher energy states are less likely to be occupied.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The majority of the page duplicates the derivation of the partition function given in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canonical_ensemble.html" title="Canonical ensemble">canonical ensemble</a> (I wished I had realized that immediately), except that the derivation on that page is clearer. The other points made on the page can be found in other articles. The usual solution would be to replace the content of derivation of the partition function by a redirect to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canonical_ensemble.html" title="Canonical ensemble">canonical ensemble</a>; this would be correct if the page were titled "derivation of the partition function for the canonical ensemble", but it is not, and in the current situation all possible targets for a redirect are misleading.

<li><b>delete</b> - I'm changing my vote; I don't think the nominator has given much reason why deletion is necessary, but I agree with Jitse Niesen that the contents of this article are included in the encyclopedia elsewhere and are better written.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Most of the content is covered elsewhere in a better manner. I believe that the article is mistake-riddled: such as that {N, 0,0,0,0} is less likely than {N-1, 1,0,0,0} - this would imply that each config is equally likely, irrespective of energy - when the result derived indicates that it is energy dependent. eg, in an infinite energy gap between ground and 1st excitation, the probability of the second state is zero, even though there are N times more configs. IMHO, the extension to the generalizations are written and seem dubious, so the benefit of keeping them together is minimal at this stage.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>. The google hits for "permanent magnet motor" are deceptive as there are other motors, not claiming to be Perp motion, that use permanent magnets. There are 6M patents already granted in the US, we cannot have an article for each one. No evidence of notability has been offered. This is a well formatted article but it's not encyclopedic. I will happily userify it to someone's user space if desired but I think delete is the right outcome, as do all the other commentors other than <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerpetual_motion_machine_b5d1.html" title="User:Perpetual motion machine">User:Perpetual motion machine</a> --<b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:27, 10 June 2006 (UTC) (PS this deletion of the perpetual motion related article is without predjudice to creation of an article about "normal" permag motors...) <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 14:40, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Unfortunately no reliable sources for this amazing perpetual motion device exist. Surprisingly little can be said about its operation.

<dd>Heavens, these Google hits and all you say about brushless motors is because <i>there is significant mainstream use of the term "Permanent magnet motor" which has zilch in common with the device patented by Howard Johnson</i>. So even if this wart has to stay, it must be moved to a more specific lemma like Permanent magnet motor (Howard Johnson) or Non-electric permanent magnet motor. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 15:34, 2 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is more than zilch. Johnson uses <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permanent_magnet.html" title="Permanent magnet">permanent magnets</a> where as others have used primarily <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electromagnet.html" title="Electromagnet">electromagnets</a>. But you would have to know more about such devices to really undestand that.</dd>
<dd>So since this good topic within PMMs has to stay, I think that your suggestion of moving to a more specific lemma like permanent magnet motor (over-unity) (vs permanent magnet motor (electromagnet)) could be good (as others have made similar attempts, such as the "Peregrinus permanent magnet motor", Stephen Walker's "permanent magnet motor", Troy Reed's permanent magnet motor, Robert "Paul" LeBreton's "Millennium Motor", etc.). <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerpetual_motion_machine_b5d1.html" title="User:Perpetual motion machine">Perpetual motion machine</a></dd>

<p>Term gets 567 GHits, and many of those appear to be describing something much different than the core concept of this article. Article seems to be more of an essay than anything else; the majority of it is taken up by an over-elaborate "How it works" example. The remainder is two sentences and a list of 'mediums that allow people to interact', a list which one might suspect exists less to benefit a reader who might not be able to construct such a list themselves and more to allow the external links used as "examples". -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:36, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Of course it is noteworthy that it is a slang in NYC. There are plently of things on Wikipedia that most people in the world have not heard of, yet these things remain on Wikipedia.

<p>Gushtunye is just as worhty of an entry on Wikipedia as anything else mostly unknown is. It is wrong to remove an entry simply because most people have yet to hear about it. I'm sure most people in this world are not familiar with the Huffman compression algorithm, but an entry exists because it is real. The same goes for a slang word which undoubtedly does indeed exist in the business district in NYC. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.185.36.216 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.185.36.216_6680.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.185.36.216">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p><b>Delete Delete Delete</b> This was a <b>mistake</b> and I'm <b>sorry</b>. Ok, I know there is wikipedia etiquette and protocol and the right places to discuss things but I am seriously upset and need to just say this, so to anyone who reads this <b>please</b> just hear it as a person, and not as a breach of protocol (the page will be deleted anyway, so don't worry about it clogging up the site etc) just consider it: Please be nice to people, and not be jerkish. We are probably all aware how there can be misunderstandings when typing (like, I'm sure everyone has had a problem when talking on msn and someone thinks you are having a tone where you aren't, you know? and then they are hurt but it was all a misunderstanding) because a certain way of saying things in writing can sound different then how you mean it (you might have been meaning to just be brief, or succint, not snappy or rude, you know? So, please just *try* to be nice and curteous and even if you are like "This article is the worst I've ever seen!!" just patiently explain yourself and not swear at them or think they are automatically ridiculous--they are probably new, or whatever, actually it doesn't even matter if they aren't new, you should still be nice, because sheesh its just a website! One of my sisters was like 7, and she wanted to make a wikipedia article about her stuffed animals or something (silly, I know, and competely not useful for an encyclopedia, but she is 7!) and she was so proud of it, and our dad helped her put up a picture etc, and the next day someone deleted it and actually called the article "f***ing useless" and called HER "some worthless lame*** bitc*". She was 7! I know that is an extreme example, but seriously, just get over yourselves and the fact that you know about computers and be nice.&#160;:( Ok, I know this is just a rant and not supposed to be here, but as a person, please understand where I am coming from, and try to remember to think about how your words might come across to someone who might be sensitive, or a child. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeritasophia_d515.html" title="User:Veritasophia">Veritasophia</a> 00:51, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>A separate TSN website is under development. The TSN is a semi-autonomous organization with a committed cadre of volunteer activists (transnationally based, I might add - this is a global organization that is starting to build infrastructure at the regional and national levels). At this early stage, we have six affiliates, one non-affiliated allied group, and 14 chapters-in-development. We are creating plans to become bigger and more influential than we have been up to this point. Additionally, we have outreach branches in various social networking systems, one of which (an organizational MySpace profile) has become sizable with over 1,000 "friend" supporters. I can update and expand information presented on this page if i am given some assurance it is not about to be deleted. Best, TSN Transnational Organizer Ben Hyink 06:55, 8 June 2006 (CST)

<li>Hello. Yes, I did write that article, which appears to have already been deleted (at least it is inaccessibe to general users). I felt there was no reason not to write it at the time, but given that Wiki is now trying to economize space I am comfortable seeing it deleted. If I had been focusing on academic work the last year I might have something significant published to my name, but instead I have invested most of my time and energy in fully establishing the TSN. I think the TSN does have significant potential to grow once a few more resources (like a separate website) are established. As I mentioned, we managed to get a fairly large number of "friends" for our MySpace profile within the first two weeks of its existence: [<a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=80528137|TSN" class="external text" title="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=80528137|TSN" rel="nofollow">MySpace Profile</a>] &lt;a href="<a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=80528137" class="external free" title="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=80528137" rel="nofollow">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=80528137</a>"&gt;TSN MySpace Profile&lt;/a&gt;. - <b><a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurobionetics_1bad.html" title="User:Neurobionetics">User:Neurobionetics</a></b> <small>talk/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Neurobionetics_703e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Neurobionetics">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Neurobionetics_b831.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Neurobionetics">email</a></small> 22:00, 9 June 2006 (CST)</li>

<li>SnitchSeeker.com is a Harry Potter fan website and has been around since 2002. I noticed you have other Harry Potter websites listed on wikipedia, as well (one of which has only been around for a month). We boast over 10,000 original hits to our site every day and have a membership nearly 20,000 strong. In addition to being one of the top sites for Harry Potter news (along with Mugglenet, HPANA, and The Leaky Cauldron, which also have articles on wikipedia), we have hosted a number of contests which were sponsored by Warner Brothers. Is the article being deleted because it is a forum-based website? Is there a google criteria for websites being posted to wikipedia? Is there a minimum ranking we have to achieve?

Oh, I see. Well, our site ownder was interviewed for an article on Norwegian-based HP sites here: <a href="http://www.rb.no/lokal_kultur/article1681962.ece" class="external free" title="http://www.rb.no/lokal_kultur/article1681962.ece" rel="nofollow">http://www.rb.no/lokal_kultur/article1681962.ece</a> (unfortunately, the article is in Norwegian but a translation is here: <a href="http://www.snitchseeker.com/vb3/showthread.php?t=26835&amp;highlight=community" class="external free" title="http://www.snitchseeker.com/vb3/showthread.php?t=26835&amp;highlight=community" rel="nofollow">http://www.snitchseeker.com/vb3/showthread.php?t=26835&amp;highlight=community</a>). We also won Best Community, Most Interactive, Best Linkage, and Most Fan Oriented Seeker Awards last year: <a href="http://www.thequidditchpitch.net/seeker/winners.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.thequidditchpitch.net/seeker/winners.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.thequidditchpitch.net/seeker/winners.shtml</a> I guess if that's not enough, we can get deleted but, you should check the rest of the HP sites you have on here for the same issue (only Mugglenet, TLC, and HPANA have been recognized by JK Rowling or any other sites, as far as I'm aware).<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.130.1.235 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.130.1.235_bee9.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.130.1.235">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Additionally, we beat all the above listed sites, including JKR, when we won those 4 awards listed above. We also have regular correspondence with a WB representative in regards to news, rumours, contests and images.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.6.115.183 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.6.115.183_08bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.6.115.183">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> There's nothing really notable about it, apart from awards it got from another Harry Potter site. By contrast, Mugglenet has a big enough presence to have had staff interview Rowling face to face, among other things, so there's a pretty big distinction. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadSeraphim_8b00.html" title="User:DeadSeraphim">Dead</a> 01:00, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Right, which is why I don't dispute Mugglenet, TLC, or HPANA having listing on here. It's the smaller sites, like one that has only been around since last month that have entries, that I take issue with if they are allowed where we are not.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.130.1.235 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.130.1.235_bee9.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.130.1.235">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>The one that stood out to me was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_Illusions" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_Illusions" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_Illusions</a> (Magical Illusions). They state in their article that they opened in May 2006. I want to apologize to Metros232 for all the work they put into our article which isn't getting published. I assure you that the members who put it together and posted it here on Wikipedia didn't realize that being notable by the fandom and Warner Brothers wasn't enough to earn a spot here. I'd like to thank all of you for your time and maybe once we live up to your expectations, we'll try posting again (I just felt bad for the people who put all the time and effort into this, both on our members' end and your end and thought I should come over here and see what I could do). Thanks again.</p>
<p>Oh, one more thing, would a statement from our Warner Brother's contact do any good? I know we haven't spoken one-on-one with JK or gotten any big awards from non-HP sites but, we are a large enough presence to warrant the attention of the people over at WB. We also had Matthew Lewis, who plays Neville Longbottom in the films, answer questions from SSers (albeit not in person): <a href="http://www.snitchseeker.com/vb3/showthread.php?t=29007" class="external free" title="http://www.snitchseeker.com/vb3/showthread.php?t=29007" rel="nofollow">http://www.snitchseeker.com/vb3/showthread.php?t=29007</a> I don't want to seem like I'm fishing here but, I never expected this article to be deleted and, like I stated above, I'd hate to see everyone's hard work go to waste if we are worthy and it's merely my lack of proper communication that's preventing it. 69.130.1.235Kris</p>

<li>Realistically, I doubt it would help. People from the movies engage in all sorts of PR in very minor ways, like appearing at a shopping mall. Doesn't make the mall notable. Sorry, I understand you've put a lot of work into this, but I just don't think, at this time, your site makes the grade. Good luck on expanding your influence and popularity, and you may be back. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 03:52, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm back to annoy you once more. Does being mentioned in a Wikipedia article on the Harry Potter fandom earn us a spot? Or is being linked from Wikipedia not considered notable enough to earn us a spot on Wikipedia?

<li>Sorry, but the "we should be in Wikipedia because somebody put us in Wikipedia" argument is a little too circular.

Supporters respond that the German <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kaiser.html" title="Kaiser">Kaiser</a> had the executive power. He appointed and dismissed the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chancellor.html" title="Chancellor">Chancellor</a>, the Imperial officials, and the officers. He could and did declare war together with the not democratically elected <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bundesrat.html" title="Bundesrat">Bundesrat</a>, 30% of which was appointed by the Emperor, and most of the rest by the German princes. The Reichstag had little control over the executive power and its legislative power was greatly limited by the Bundesrat. The Emperor's appointees in the Bundesrat could themselves veto amendments to the <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_German_Empire" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Constitution_of_the_German_Empire">German constitution</a>. In 1913 the Chancellor ignored a <a href="../../../v/o/t/Vote_of_no_confidence.html" title="Vote of no confidence">vote of no confidence</a> and there were often threats of a military <a href="../../../c/o/u/Coup_d%27etat.html" title="Coup d'etat">coup d'etat</a> if the Reichstag should ignore the Emperor on important issues. In effect, therefore, especially in foreign and military affairs, there was little democratic control. The Emperor was also the King of <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prussia.html" title="Prussia">Prussia</a> which had 3/5 of the German population and the Prussian constitution gave him even greater power there.

<li><b>Delete</b> Personal essay/research. Being interesting and provoking questions does not make it an encyclopedia article - every newspaper editorial is intended to do that. <a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthenaeum_9647.html" title="User:Athenaeum">Athenaeum</a> 11:48, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I think claims of POV are unsubstanted, the article is not a fork, it is an important appendix which would not be suitable for the main article, which is already too long. The article also stands in its own right as a partial history of war and democracy. Perhaphs more worring is that I think many of the delete votes are actually more to do with the main editor than the article itself and this people would instinctively vote against anything which his name is attached to. While he may be headstrong, ultramarine does have a far better grasp of the DPT litrature than most other editors (myself included)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>To address the POV claim in more detail first some history on the article, this was worked on in my user space and it was my idea to present the data as a table, precicely so that opposing views of the different conflicts could be clearly illustrated, and thrus better address claims of bias.</dd>
<dd>On my talk page <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Pmanderson/Septentrionalis</a> nicely outlined the different views of authors working on DPT:
<ol>
<li>Gowa and other Realists deny that there is an actual democratic peace altogether.</li>
<li>Are democracies at peace only among themselves, or are they more peaceful in general;
<ol>
<li>Peaceful among themselves only: Doyle, Russett, Weart, Gleditsch, Owen, Singer and Small, Mansfield and Snyder, Mueller, Wolff in fact, almost everybody.</li>
<li>Peaceable with non-democracies: Rummel, Ray and half-a-dozen other papers listed above in Mueller and Wolff</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Is the democratic peace an automatic and mechanical thing, or is it a strong statistical tendency?
<ol>
<li>Automatic (and so without exceptions): Rummel, Ray and Weart (as far as I can tell nobody else)</li>
<li>Statistical tendency:Wayman, Bremer, Chan, Cederman, Doyle, Russett, Owen, MW, Gleditisch, Mansfield and Snyder</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Now, this article only adresses point 2.1 whether democracies tend not to go to war with each other, the more contentious issue 2.2 is not addressed (this is also why the <i>Why Rummel is always right</i> name for the article was always off the mark, it is not primarily about Rummels more extreme theory).</dd>
<dd>So we are basically left with a debate between those who study DTP and the Realists, notably Gowa. Gowa gets appropriate coverage in the article. Also note the comment from Pmanderson at the end of 2.1 <i>in fact, almost everybody</i> so there really is little debate on the central thrust of the article. From talking with a friend who has reciently completed a PhD in International Relations is that the field is split into Realists, DTP and a couple of other camps, each groups tends to work in its own camp and there is little cross fertilisation, hence lack of much Realist critique.</dd>
<dd>So why the lack of references to group 3.2, (Russet gets 4 citations). Basically this is not a question adressed here, further most of the studies have been from analysis of the same set of data (compiled by Weart?) which is basically presented here.</dd>
<dd>To conclude, what we have here is the basic set of data used by all those studing DPT, as such it is a useful and interesting resource. The DPT field has in recient times moved on from the binary discussion on the DPT-hypothesis, which is now largely accepted by all in the field (with a lot a cavearts about statistical tendancies etc.) The study has now moved on to other questions examining the Why? question and more sophsticated modeling involving other factors. POV claims are a strawman not reflecing the litrature. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 14:42, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I thank Salix for his kindness.</li>
<li>The basic problem with this article is that it is an argument for a corollary of position 3.1, which is only regarded as important by the three who hold it (and by Ultramarine). This does not reflect the literature. The three involve themselves in a narrow definition of democracy, and peculiar views of history, precisely to prove that two real democracies have never, ever, gone to war; which the rants here are designed to prove. A good article on this could be written, and Matthew White has approached it; but this is not it. This is at best a pile of raw material. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 18:57, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article is exhastively researched <i>(21 footnotes--I doubt many of those who are electing to delete this article have wrote an article with 21 footnotes)</i> and offers an excellent history substantiating the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_peace_theory.html" title="Democratic peace theory">democratic peace theory</a>.

Unlike these other users, I personally think I could debate <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> on the merits alone. Some of these users, unable to debate <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> on the merits, appear to be using wikipedia policy to silent a contrary opinion.<br />
This vote for deletion is a primae facia example (the evidence speaks for itself) why "democracy" for the wikipedia "<a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Lippmann_4d20.html" title="Walter Lippmann">braying herd</a>" can sometimes be detrimental.<br />
<a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> has done exhastive research on the topic.

<li>It's a POV fork of an existing article and the author is merely rephrasing his speculative original research (see previous AfDs above) in the hopes of keeping it after it was previously deleted (a classic POV push, in other words).

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Likeminded people and I will expand this article and make it a proud NPOV wiki aticle. Their are multiple meanings of the word Buttrock is the best way I can explain it. I started the page and people are adding to it like it means <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair_Metal_81d2.html" title="Hair Metal">Hair Metal</a> but it doesn't. I grew up in the Pacific Northwest (Portland) and Buttrock is an important word/concept for people here. I imagine it served a similar purpose in the rest of the US. When reminiscing about the 80's we would affenctionately call the soft metal songs that we like Buttrock. It's not just a local custom or a dictionary definition. The concept needs to be explored and the Buttrocker bands need to be delineated. These are the bands that at first glance are extremely cheesy but after a more thorough investigation are true pioneers of pop music. You know: Poison, Warrant (to a lesser degree), and AC/DC. - June 4, 2006 - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">User:Peregrinefisher</a></li>
