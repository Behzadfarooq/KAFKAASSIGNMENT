<p>I'm sick of this article being trolled. It's full of lies and nonsense. My justification for making a third nomination is that my circumstances have changed significantly since the last AfDs - I have resigned from the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation. Given that this was previously kept on the grounds I was on that Board, there is no longer any reason for this page to be kept. This has already been deleted on the French and German Wikipedias. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 02:41, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just to clarify - my reason for deletion is <b>not</b> the trolling. The reason is that I've resgined from the Wikimedia Board, so there's no longer any reason to keep it. A lot of people are stating "vandalism isn't a reason for deletion" - well, no... but I never claimed it was. I do not meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Other wiki hosting company founders do not have bios - Sam Odio (BluWiki), David Weekly (<a href="../../../p/e/a/PeanutButterWiki_461a.html" title="PeanutButterWiki">PeanutButterWiki</a>), Adina Levin and Edward Vielmetti (<a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialtext.html" title="Socialtext">Socialtext</a>), <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Kraus_e877.html" title="Joe Kraus">Joe Kraus</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/t/JotSpot_c5c1.html" title="JotSpot">JotSpot</a>), Ludovic Dubost (<a href="../../../x/w/i/XWiki_a56e.html" title="XWiki">XWiki</a>) etc, so I do not see the existence of Wikia as justification for this to be kept. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 06:21, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Oh, dear, I'm worried about your resignation not being enough for the people that believe you're encyclopedic... Something like "she was member of the BoT, but later resigned" =(. Since I think you're not encyclopedic (sorry =)) and keeping this article <b>do harm someone</b> indeed (you), I would <b>delete</b> it. I think she's not notable, she agrees, and doesn't like the effects of being mentioned in WP ("Why are popular people popular? - Because they appear on TV. - Why do they appear on TV? - Because they are popular!"). WP couldn't have an article on me just because every wikipedian would like the idea. I'm not popular, and certainly wouldn't like to be mentioned here. So I understand Angela. We don't pretend to be a tabloid, but an encyclopedia, so let's keep on focus.

<li><b>Comment:</b> This is a tricky case, and could be an important precedent. I hope you don't mind if I break the flow of the AfD to respond in some more detail. Let's pretend for a moment that this project was completely unreleated to Wikipedia and Wikimedia, because I don't think that should have any influence one way or another.
<p>Angela is borderline notable like many people associated with Wikipedia. Take the people associated with the German chapter and the German Wikipedia, some of whom (e.g. Kurt Jansson) have toured national media, spoken at important conferences, or accepted important awards on behalf of the Foundation many times. Or take Danny Wool, Brion Vibber, Tim Starling, all of whom are doing critical work for the Foundation on a full-time salary (Brion in particular has also spoken about this work at many occasions, including a speech at Google which is available on <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7747790812939045407" class="external text" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7747790812939045407" rel="nofollow">Google Video</a>). None of them has, or should have, an article. This is because Wikipedia is essentially a <i>media magnet</i>: it's such a buzzword that it's very easy to be interviewed, invited to conferences about it, etc. When does a person associated with Wikimedia become notable then? I would argue that the moment their <i>personal role</i> in the project becomes the center of media reports, and not just once, but on a regular basis, we need to re-evaluate our assessment.</p>
<p>Wikimedia alone would make it a borderline case. Certainly, she's historically been a very important asset for the Foundation, and being on the Board is in some ways a highly distinguished position. However, the judgment of her significance is one that should be independently established. Wikia makes the situation somewhat more complicated. Angela is the co-founder, and the company has received $4 million venture capital. It would not exist without her, and already hosts several notable wikis, including <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncyclopedia.html" title="Uncyclopedia">Uncyclopedia</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memory_Alpha_f337.html" title="Memory Alpha">Memory Alpha</a> (over 1,500 wikis overall). She is not the CEO of the company; however, she does play a critical management role. Angela has made the point in the past that it's not yet clear whether the company is successful. Financially speaking, that is certainly true.</p>
<p>Looking at other articles in the same space, such as <a href="../../../w/e/t/Wetpaint.html" title="Wetpaint">Wetpaint</a> or <a href="../../../p/e/a/PeanutButterWiki_461a.html" title="PeanutButterWiki">PeanutButterWiki</a>, we don't have articles about their CEO or key personnel, though arguably, Wikia is larger and already more successful. I would say that Wikia makes Angela notable enough that it's not a closed and shut case, i.e. her notability should at the very least be re-evaluated a year from now.</p>
<p>Given that it's a borderline case where reasonable people can argue either way, I would say that the subject's opinion should be the decisive criterion. I believe we've already done this in a couple of recent cases. I've actually seen the same argument made for <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>, but there I think the notability (NameBase founder, Google Watch founder, very prominent WP critic, activist) is much more clearly established. But, we need to be careful not to give Angela preferential treatment because she is a Wikimedian, and the "troll magnet" argument shouldn't weigh too strongly either. Whatever precedent we establish here needs to be applied consistently to other articles. As noted above, I vote for <b>delete and re-evaluate in one year</b> right now, with the rationale: "borderline case, subject requests it to be deleted." I might be convinced to change my vote to "keep", though.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 14:52, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>Let's pretend for a moment that this project was completely unreleated to Wikipedia and Wikimedia, because I don't think that should have any influence one way or another.</i> — I already did, at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Angela_Beesley_%282nd_nomination%29_bbad.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Angela Beesley (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Angela Beesley (2nd nomination)</a>. As I pointed out there, without giving the Wikimedia Foundation any special consideration and applying our <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria just as one would apply them to anyone else Tim Shell does not satisfy the criteria (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tim_Shell_1eb8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tim Shell">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tim Shell</a>) and Angela Beesley does. I strongly suggest that we apply the "no special consideration" principle to your idea that "the subject's opinion should be the decisive criterion".

<li>What I mean is that one of our policies should be: If the subject of a borderline biography does not want an article about themselves in Wikipedia, we should respect that. What is or isn't borderline is up to be interpreted by the community.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 15:54, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that it then hinges on the definition of "borderline" notability -- is Seth borderline? Is Angela? Is Brandt? I must admit that the Wikia argument weighs rather strongly in favor of keeping the bio, though it remains true that Wikia's financial viability is not yet proven.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 22:04, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Correction: I don't want a *Wikipedia* article. That's NOT synonymous with "*encyclopia* article". And I believe the latter way of phrasing it frames my objection in an extremely misleading way. If at all possible, I'd rather opt-out of being a target of trolls, flamers, and vandals. This seems to me to be an eminently reasonable position. To describe it as a *general* not wanting "an encyclopedia article" makes me sound like some sort of Thomas Pynchon style recluse, which will strike many people as very unreasonable. Normal encyclopedias do not allow anyone in the world to use them as attack platforms. That matters. -- Seth Finkelstein 16:36, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>But they should have the same rights as anybody else to nominate an article for deletion (whether it is about them or not) and, since they are <i>the</i> authority in the case of their own bio, their opinion has to carry some weight (unless we accuse them of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>).

If we wish to change that practice, we should do so in a general policy/guideline discussion, which might be a good idea - if someone is truly of encyclopedic importance, it will be possible to write a good article on them after they are dead, and we are never going to have articles on everything we intend to cover - but the change ought to be to tighten the standards for all living people, not just those who ask for their page to be deleted.

But obviously we have failed with this biography, which I think is a shame. We're unable to protect from trolling junk. I think this deletion sets a sad, but unavoidable precedent. If this is deleted, we must now honor all similiar requests by the "notable but not famous". Also, if we make this permanently fully protected as deleted (or redirected), we certainly have no justification for denying at least permanent semi-protection to any other living biography with problems.

Congratulations for showing some humility. =) Anyway, I think we have established by now that "I don't want an article" is not an excuse, "I've resigned from this high post" isn't either (Beethoven isn't making much music these days, is he?) and "troll magnet" is merely a contributing circumstance in the deletion case of a problematic entry.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'd keep a scary proportion of relatively long-deceased people so long as their articles were very well-sourced (long-forgotten local bigwigs of no national importance and little lasting legacy are A-OK by me). I guess at least it's conceivable that a local history buff could find such articles worthwhile; and even if they are rarely edited that'd be fine since there'd be relatively little fresh source information to draw on anyway. Even if nobody looked at it for 5 years, it may turn out to be just the obscure person that the next reader was looking for, and to find a well-referenced article on the subject could be extremely useful to them. On the other hand, when faced with a modern person (and at the back of my mind the fact they don't want to be listed lingers) I set the bar far higher. The absurdly poor state of this article, the poor referencing etc. is, in theory, a matter for cleanup not AFD. But still part of me thinks: what's the point of cleaning this article up? What information, or useful way of seeing information, will be saved by doing so? Miss Beesley has played a part, if we wish to aggrandize ourselves, in shaping the history of the internet, but only as a cog in the bigger machine of the Foundation and the online communities she has interacted with. This article will never explain, nor should it attempt to, the way that cog turned, the gears it meshed with, the times things ran smoothly, and the times more oil should have been applied... that would all fall short of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> (at least until some biographies get published, but heck, I doubt that'll happen any time soon, and no, a blog does <i>not</i> count as a "serial biography"). Without that, though, I'm afraid there's really nothing left to be said. <i>That</i> was precisely what her role in "notable" history has been. We can have her date of birth (ooh, is that a reference I can see for it? Ummm... no) and place of birth (aha, a reference! oops, my mistake) and even find out which university she went to (so long as you'll believe anything you'll see uncited in an encyclopedia that "anyone can edit"). Oh yes, and she has the sort of picture that drive anon IPs to leave unwholesome messages on her talk page; but so long as we don't go down the <a href="../../../../de/index.html" class="extiw" title="de:">de:</a> route and scrap fair use images entirely, they can always check out a certain J. Wales's former employees instead. In summary, what would be lost from leaving an unlinked "Angela Beesley", heck, even an "A. Beesley", in the articles where she's relevant? I can't see any "notable information loss". And deleting articles like this is a surefire way to boost our average factual accuracy. And indeed, to get back closer to the "anyone can edit" philosophy (which Angela would espouse, I am sure), so long as the back end of that was an "and also anyone can nominate non-notable living people biographies for deletion". <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 09:37, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Angela is a public figure who deserves an article. Firstly, "I'm sick of this article being trolled. It's full of lies and nonsense" is not a good enough reason to delete an article, it is reason to fix and watch an article. Secondly, I don't think the person whom the article is about should ever request AfD themselves, it is a request of special treatment.

<li><b>Keep</b>...I concur with the likelihood of notability around Wikia, and believe a lot of notability remains from her association with Wikimedia. I disagree with the premise that resignation does not reduce one's notability. For a living person, part of one's notability is their potential for future action. Thus, being in an ongoing association with an organization ties you to that organization's notability. Removing that link causes you to evaluate their past actions (and possibly their impact on the future success of the organization) and determine notability on that basis. This is one of the reasons that many above feel Wikia is a basis for notability...it is notable in and of itself, and Angela is (at this point) intrinsically linked to its future success / failure.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeJ9919_0983.html" title="User:MikeJ9919">MikeJ9919</a> 18:35, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Abstain</b>: I voted "Keep" on two previous occasions and have strongly anti-deletionist principles. In favour of the "Keep" position, I am concerned about the precedent of allowing an article to be deleted at the request of its subject - if someone who considers herself not to be "notable" can make such a request, what is there to prevent persons who are unquestionably notable from making similar requests? What about persons who were once well known, but have since faded from the limelight? Against that, I have to note that Angela is someone I personally like and respect, and I don't feel good about thwarting her repeated requests for the deletion of what is, after all, an infringement on her privacy.

<li><b>Comment</b> As I understand it, Angela is unhappy with <i>"lies and nonsense"</i> which she says have been inserted into (previous versions of?) her wikibio. OTH, since she appears to have been a leading Wikipedian for many years who was involved in various key decisions (or non-decisions), it seems that many users agree that there is a legitimate need to keep some basic factual information about her available somewhere in this website.&#160;:As I understand it, Angela's motivation for the AfD nom is that reverting bad edits to this article has grown too wearisome for the Wikipedia community--- yet permanently protecting it in a minimalist state which provides only the most basic factual information would be seen as an admission that the traditional description of Wikipedia as an "on-line encyclopedia <i>which anyone can edit</i>" cannot be sustained.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I happen to believe that the WP community must indeed muster the courage to publically admit that indeed, <i>which anyone can edit</i> is inconsistent with the goal of building a reliable encyclopedia, and that this policy needs to be rescinded. Be this as it may, I see a third alternative:
<ul>
<li>create a new namespace for write protected pages offering essential items like a mission statement, privacy statement, basic information about the principals of WikiMedia and the operation of Wikipedia</li>
<li>put a page giving essential information about Angela and her service on the Board in this new namespace,</li>
<li>delete the unprotected wikibio</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>By the way: I realize that Angela is not leaving WP, just resigning from the Board, but I'd like to see a policy or even a guideline on "graceful exits". That is, it seems that sooner or later, most contributors, even formerly very active contributors, do decide to leave WP. In such cases, there is reason to keep their user pages around for a year or more, but it might be well to protect their user page(s) on request in a designated area, for example in a case where the former contributor has left as the result of some acrimonious dispute with vandals. Or create a WikiProject whose members agree to let a bot add to their watchlist the user pages of departed Wikipedians and these users would then monitor for and revert any vandalism (former users could request the bot to sign them up for this service). No doubt there are other possibilities. ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 21:59, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm confused at the suggestion that deleting the article will set a precedent for the deletion of articles based upon the subject's wishes. First, Articles for Deletion is not precedent based. A precedent that I'm actually concerned about is people resigning or declining leadership positions in Wikipedia and the Foundation because they have had, or are worried about, their privacy being invaded. Also, while human decency, in my opinion, requires us to consider an article's impact on the subject, another very good reason for deleting the article has been given, lack of notability. Finally, having an encyclopedia article on a person, when he or she never would have had one if he or she had not been involved with Wikipedia and Wikimedia is more damaging to Wikipedia's credibility than deleting an article for humanitarian reasons, which we do not even have to resort to in this case because of the lack of notability. Far too much weight is placed on certain subjects on Wikipedia, like Pokemon, Star Wars, the free software movement and Wikipedia itself. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 03:55, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - We should get permission from people before we write articles on them! Just kidding, but seriously, she really isn't notable outside of wikisociety. Jimmy Wales, for example, was on Time 100, interviewed on NPR and CNN, and is generally famous as hell. Angela has none of that. There's also precedence here: Brian Peppers is only known within internet humor sites, and virtually nowhere else, so his article was deleted. (Not that I'm comparing Angela to Brian Peppers.) (Yes, I'm aware of the e-mail from Peppers's family, too.) Likewise, Angela Beesley only affects Wiki, which makes her notability questionable. -- <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessedrocker_53b5.html" title="User:Messedrocker"><font color="blue"><code>this is messedrocker</code></font></a> <a href="../../../m/e/s/User_talk%7EMessedrocker_915e.html" title="User talk:Messedrocker"><font color="blue"><code>(talk)</code></font></a> 01:15, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would probably agree with anyone who complains that <i>far too many</i> bios of not truly notable persons are kept following AfD discussions. I would even agree that those who say that Angela is notable mostly only at Wikipedia (but she is <i>very</i> notable for users of this website!--- which just happens to be one of the most used websites in the world). And I think those who fear an invasion of privacy of major Wikipedia figures who might prefer more anonymity have a point. Certainly I would not support a gratitious invasion of privacy at this or any other website. But I sense that many of the voters for deletion in this particular AfD would vote differently if it were anyone but Angela who was asking, and setting a precedent for some kind of double standard seems like a bad idea. Above I tried to suggest some compromises between outright deletion and keeping the article as an unprotected wikibio. One of my simplest suggestions would be to replace the bio with a redirect to a wikimedia.org page describing Angela's service on the Board and simply permanently protecting this redirect. Wouldn't a permament redirect be less obtrusive than a permanent notice warning against attempts to recreate an article called <i>Angela Beesley</i>? ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 04:06, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: so she's notable because she co-founded some web page (Wikia) and because of her involvement in WP and its derived foundation. Well, IMO that doesn't give notability for anyone in the real world, where people still watch news on TV instead of in Wikinews. But OK, some people believe she's notable, she's awesome, etc., so let's have an article about her. I don't care about <i>having</i> the article. But, <b>what can we put in that article?</b> I doubt there can ever be a non-stub article about her. Her birthdate, nationality, birthplace, living place, her boyfriend, or even her photo have nothing to do with what (suposedly) makes her notable: they're tabloid info, not encyclopedic info. And still with that info, the article isn't but a stub. I don't mind having an article about her. It's just we have <b>not</b> an article, and I cannot think of a way for it to become an article. That's what happens with non-notable people, IMO. That's why I consider she isn't notable enough. And the fact our wannabe-article acts like a tabloid, not only being non-encyclopedic, but doing damage, is why I decided to participate in this debate. I could add that Angela's opinion doesn't move me anymore than any other's opinion about their own article, since I know about her only because of her WP article.

<dd>I believe distinctions should be made between major public figures and people who are of minor notability. A head of a broadcasting network is not in a comparable situation to an ordinary person. -- Seth Finkelstein 19:25, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Reply</b>. A distinction is already made between notable and non-notable individuals. That distinction is whether or not they get articles at all. "Minorly notable" is still notable. Vandalism occurence is not a determining factor in deletion arguments, unless the page itself was created solely as a vandalism/trolling page. This isn't.</dd>
<dd>Angela's argument is also based on the idea that a subject ceases to deserve an article once they stop holding the office that made them notable. Wouldn't this also apply to former <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congress_8653.html" title="United States Congress">United States Congressmen</a>? For example, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_D._Carey_0fc0.html" title="Robert D. Carey">Robert D. Carey</a>, Republican representative from the state of Wyoming in the early 1920's, no longer holds office, and his only claim to notability was that office. Further, he's dead, meaning his current influence is effectively null. Yes, I recognize there is a difference in the notability holding a governorship gives you vs. being on a board at a company, but if formerly held offices don't count as notability criteria, then Angela is actually more notable than Robert Carey at this point in time. If we are to be a timeless repository of knowledge, then formerly held offices should be weighed on the same scale as currently held offices. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 20:18, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Per Jorge Luis Borges "These ambiguities, redundancies and deficiencies remind us of those which doctor Franz Kuhn attributes to a certain Chinese encyclopaedia entitled 'Celestial Empire of benevolent Knowledge'. In its remote pages it is written that the animals are divided into: (a) belonging to the emperor, (b) embalmed, (c) tame, (d) sucking pigs, (e) sirens, (f) fabulous, (g) stray dogs, (h) included in the present classification, (i) frenzied, (j)innumerable, (k) drawn with a very fine camelhair brush, (l) et cetera, (m) having just broken the water pitcher, (n) that from a long way off look like flies.". So if people can be divided into notable and non-notable, they can also be divided into majorly notable and minorly notable, as well as living and dead, with the living minor notable respected in a wish to opt-out. There should be a balance between being a timeless repository of knowledge, and a present repository of trollery -- Seth Finkelstein 20:54, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is almost starting to become some sort of inverse vanity page argument. And in my opinion, the conclusions are the same: the wishes of the subject of an article as to its existance or nonexistance do not over-rule the policy and notability criteria. If I want to have an article about myself, but I am not notable, no amount of me protesting will get it included. If I don't want to have an article about me, but am notable, the same thing applies. The trolling is regretable, but until we develop the software to read the minds of editors and determine whether they are acting in good faith or not, it is a necessary evil for the continued existance of the Wikipedia project as a whole. Perhaps our most relevant rule here, however, is <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. Which is an official policy, I might add. You don't own articles which are <i>about</i> you any more than you do those you <i>wrote</i>. An opt-out system would violate this rule. Also, I think we have a slight <a href="../../../s/e/t/Seth_Finkelstein_6930.html" title="Seth Finkelstein">conflict of interests</a> here. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 21:54, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Forgive me, I've lost track of what's being disputed factually, versus what's being recommended as a wise course of action. Are we agreed or disagreed that a reasonable categorization distinction can be made involving degrees of notability, and interests of living people? That is, are you arguing this material cannot be taken into account for some significant reason? Or that even though it's possible, it should not matter - which can't be justified self-referentially, because that's exactly the point of dispute here? Remember, <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_binding_decisions_c105.html" title="Wikipedia:No binding decisions">Wikipedia:No_binding_decisions</a> is also official policy. A reasonable opt-out is merely a recognition that sometimes "do no harm" is the best policy. By the way, there's something deeply scary if not wanting to be trolled disqualifies me from participating in a policy-related discussion as to whether or not people should have to endure being trolled. -- Seth Finkelstein 22:59, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>An argument could be made that there is a difference between those who are majorly notable vs. those who are minorly notable or notable only within a small field. You can obviously group people into whether they like the idea of having a WP article about them or not as well. The disagreement is over whether it matters, or more precisely, whether in a project such as Wikipedia the subject of an article has (or should have) any more say than any other editor as to what happens with that article. In my mind, I look at this AfD, and I read the reasons why it is being proposed for deletion. Judging from the reasons given, I come to the conclusion that the nominator and deletion voters do not provide enough support for deletion, given the passing of two previous AfD noms, meeting the notability criteria, etc.</dd>
<dd>I would re-evaluate my vote in light of a policy or guideline change, but at this time, I do not believe that the name of the nominator for an article's deletion has any bearing on whether it should be deleted, as that would violate <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> as well as the common sense principle of impartiality. Unless your name is Jimbo the human supermajority (and I say that with no animosity towards him, as I recognize the need for "divine intervention" occasionally), you have the same vote and obligation to go along with consensus as everyone else does. "Do no harm" is not violated by the <i>existance</i> of this article, just by the trolls, which can be easily rectified. In fact, given the current semi-protection and the multiple people (including myself) who have doubtless watchlisted the page as a result of this debate, your concerns about vandalism will probably no longer be an issue no matter what the decision of this debate is.</dd>
<dd>On the conflict of interests, I did not intend to imply you shouldn't participate, clearly you are just as entitled to do so as I. I was merely suggesting caution, and that you might wish to objectively think over what your answer would be to <i>this</i> AfD if it weren't for your own article. No offense intended, and I realize I may have been slightly hypocritical to point this out, for which I apologize. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 23:44, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Apology accepted, and similar apology tendered for any harshness on my part. If you read above where I made my actual vote, I outlined my ethical reasoning. My position is of course affected by my experiences, but the outcome is logically self-consistent - all living people of minor notability who want to opt-out should have their wishes respected. If it takes finally affecting someone "inside" the circles of power, to spark enough debate which results in some positive change, well, it wouldn't be the first time that a problem had to hit an insider before it was addressed, whereas outsiders were blown-off. Of course, *only* addressing it for the insider would be the worst of all worlds. But I'd rather this all lead to some rethinking of what I view as a bad policy, rather than having that bad policy continue on.</dd>
<dd>There's a difference between wanting to micromanage one's biography, and not wanting to have to patrol and clean up after mudslinging. <a href="../../../i/n/t/Wikipedia%7EInterpret_all_rules_7caa.html" title="Wikipedia:Interpret all rules">Wikipedia:Interpret_all_rules</a> should support a distinction between these two types of objections. Telling people not to be control-freaks is worlds apart from telling them they have been chosen to be part of a grand experiment in having trolling, defamation, libel, lying, smears, and vandalism, directed at them, but it's settled policy that they can't decline. -- Seth Finkelstein 03:47, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would suggest what you should do is write a policy proposal in which you outline all of your arguments. If your policy passed, it would solve this entire issue in one fell swoop, while even if it were turned down, so long as it had a decent minority who supported it, it could be left as an essay. Essays may not be policy but the popular ones do carry a good bit of weight, especially on the less by-the-book processes such as deletion review. Also, you may be able to find an ally in the form of <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">User:Herostratus</a>'s <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_EVIL_85b9.html" title="WP:NOT EVIL">WP:NOT EVIL</a> proposal/essay.

<dd>Yep. I hate to say it and this is not Angela's doing (I would hope and do assume) but lots of these <i>delete</i> votes smack to me of folks, aware of it or not, who are mushing up to a member of Wikia who has a perceived, pervasive influence (true or not, resigned from WP or not). People are afraid to say so openly is all, for fear of falling out of favour, getting banned or whatever. Anyway Wikipedia is one of the highest traffic sites on the Internet and she's part of the story, which is already historic (one way or another) and that's encyclopedic. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 22:12, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wouldn't say it's out of any sort of fear so much as respect. Rather ironically, the fact that she is a notable individual (especially one involved with wikis), the very reason she should be included in the first place, results in people respecting her. This respect makes people give credence to her opinions, which in turn makes them vote with her in her claim to not be notable. It's almost a paradox, a situation in which your accomplishments allow you to claim that those accomplishments are unimportant.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I believe she passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, based on various interviews (multiple independent published sources), and I don't think notability is a concern anyway: info about the subject is potentially verifiable, and some is verified, that's good enough for me. And notability can only increase with time, as far as I'm concerned, never decrease, even if I did care about it: the number of <i>new</i> media references to her, for instance, will decrease, but the number of <i>old</i> ones will never fall. Sorry, Angela. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 21:47, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: the best next thing would be Angela taking an important decision based on this article not being deleted, so the article could say it, and doing so, self-reference not merely WP, but itself! "blablabla because of this article not being deleted from Wikipedia." References could be added pointing to the AfD discussions. At least, that would be encyclopedic, being related to the cause of her "notability": WP. That is, it wouldn't be <b>trivia</b>. BTW, anybody knows what's the name of her pet? And anybody heard about <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>? If in some years she becomes notable enough for someone to do a research about her (for, say, writing her bio), he would find the same info we've found about her, in the same places we've found it. And then, we could make a serious encyclopedic, third source, article about her. Don't fear for that info to be lost because of deleting our article. WP is not a log. --<a href="../../../e/u/y/User%7EEuyyn_f321.html" title="User:Euyyn">euyyn</a> 07:46, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
