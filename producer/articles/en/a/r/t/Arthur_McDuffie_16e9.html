<p>McDuffie was an insurance salesman, and had previously been a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Marine_a1ef.html" title="United States Marine">United States Marine</a>, and a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_police.html" title="Military police">military police</a> officer. He had two daughters and was planning to remarry his former wife.</p>
<p><a name="The_Incident" id="The_Incident"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_McDuffie_16e9.html" title="Edit section: The Incident">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Incident</span></h2>
<p>In the early morning hours of <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_17.html" title="December 17">December 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, police officers pursued 33-year-old McDuffie who was driving his <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> black and orange <a href="../../../k/a/w/Kawasaki_Heavy_Industries_5f17.html" title="Kawasaki Heavy Industries">Kawasaki</a> motorcycle. McDuffie had accumulated traffic citations and was driving with a suspended license. A high-speed chase ensued.</p>
<p>The four white officers involved in the chase (Ira Diggs, William Hanlon, Alex Marrero and Michael Watts) later filed a report claiming that McDuffie had run a red light and led police on an eight-minute chase. They claimed that, after losing control of his vehicle while making a left turn, McDuffie attempted to flee on foot but was subdued by the officers. McDuffie was accused of kicking Diggs during the scuffle. By the end of the struggle the officers had cracked his skull, in the words of the prosecutor at the trial, "like an egg."</p>
<p>McDuffie was taken unconscious to a nearby hospital, where he died four days later. The coroner's report concluded that he had suffered multiple <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_fracture.html" title="Skull fracture">skull fractures</a> after being hit by a blunt object.</p>
<p><a name="The_Trial" id="The_Trial"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_McDuffie_16e9.html" title="Edit section: The Trial">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Trial</span></h2>
<p>The four officers were indicted for manslaughter, as well as tampering with or fabricating physical evidence. Marerro's charge was later elevated to second degree murder. The acting director of the <a href="../../../d/a/d/Dade_County_91d5.html" title="Dade County">Dade County</a> Public Safety Department, Bobby Jones, suspended them on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_27.html" title="December 27">December 27</a>, noting that the four officers had been cited in 47 citizen complaints and 13 internal affairs probes since 1973. In addition, two other officers, Herbert Evans, Jr. and Ubaldo Del Toro, were charged with being an accessory to the crime and also fabricating evidence. All of the officers were fired less than a month later.</p>
<p>Due to the volatile atmosphere in Miami, which presiding judge Lenore Carrero Nesbitt had termed a "time bomb," the trial was shifted to <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tampa%2C_Florida_a617.html" title="Tampa, Florida">Tampa, Florida</a>, where jury selection began on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_31.html" title="March 31">March 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>. The lead prosecutor of the case was future U.S. attorney general, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janet_Reno_7383.html" title="Janet Reno">Janet Reno</a>.</p>
<p>Defense claims that the police were under attack were disputed by fellow officer, Charles Veverka, who had received immunity in exchange for his testimony. Veverka stated that officers hit McDuffie 10-12 times with clubs and fists until he was motionless, then attempted to cover up the attack by using a police car to run over the motorcycle and claim that McDuffie's injuries were the result of an accident.</p>
<p>Hanlon, who had also received immunity, testified that he had choked McDuffie to the ground with his nightstick before Marrero began striking him. Hanlon also backed up Veverka's account by saying he was the officer who had driven over McDuffie's motorcycle.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_25.html" title="April 25">April 25</a>, still another police officer given immunity, Mark Meier, testified that the high-speed chase had slowed to 25 miles per hour when McDuffie shouted, "I give up." Meier then stated that 3-8 officers surrounded McDuffie, pulled off his helmet, and proceeded to beat him with nightsticks, with Marrero striking him at least two times.</p>
<p>Testimony from one medical examiner stated that McDuffie's injuries were the equivalent of falling out of a four-story building, while Dade County's chief deputy medical examiner, Dr. Ronald Wright, said McDuffie had suffered the worst brain damage he had ever seen in over 3,600 autopsies.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_8.html" title="May 8">May 8</a>, Del Toro was acquitted, with Judge Nesbitt saying the state had failed to prove their case. Nine days later, an all-white six-man jury acquitted the remaining officers on all 13 counts of the indictment after less than three hours of deliberation.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_McDuffie_16e9.html" title="Edit section: The Riots">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Riots</span></h2>
<p>The verdict sent people pouring into the streets, with approximately 5,000 people attending a protest at the downtown Metro Justice Building. However, by 6:00 p.m., the protest turned into a riot as three people were killed and at least 23 injured. Several of the injured were in critical condition from being shot, beaten or stabbed.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> governor <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Graham_44e5.html" title="Bob Graham">Bob Graham</a> immediately ordered 500 National Guard troops into the area, but despite doubling their presence the next day, 12 more people died and 165 were injured as violence spread to the Black Grove, Overtown and Brownsville sections of town. In addition, fires, burglaries and looting increased, with police reluctant to enter some areas due to sniper fire.</p>
<p>By the third day, the violence declined as an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew, coupled with a temporary ban on the sale of firearms and liquor, finally helped get things under control. In addition, Graham sent in an additional 2,500 National Guardsmen. Alex Marrero was later aquited, and found non guilty on a count of self deffense. The evidence essentially proved that McDuffie attempted to pull Marrero's gun out of his holster and in deffense, Marrero struck him accross the head. Thus, all charges were dropped.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_McDuffie_16e9.html" title="Edit section: Aftermath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_22.html" title="May 22">May 22</a>, former defendant Michael Watts was rushed to the hospital after a carbon monoxide suicide attempt, although police stated that his attempt was the result of a romantic breakup and not related to the trial. Meanwhile, the federal government declared Miami a disaster area, allowing the city to receive funds to rebuild.</p>
<p>The following day, the five officers acquitted were reinstated to their jobs after threats of a walkout by the Miami Fraternal Order of Police.</p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department announced just days after the verdict that it would press for indictments of the policemen for civil rights violations. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_28.html" title="July 28">July 28</a>, 1980, Veverka was indicted by a federal grand jury, despite having received immunity during the original trial.</p>
<p>The subsequent trial was held in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Antonio%2C_Texas_74ae.html" title="San Antonio, Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a>, after <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta.html" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_615c.html" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a> asked that it be moved from their areas due to the explosive racial component in the case. Their reluctance gave rise to the case being nicknamed as "The Trial That Nobody Wants."</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_17.html" title="December 17">December 17</a>, Veverka was acquitted in the week-long trial after over 16 hours of deliberation. Minor incidents of violence were reported in Miami after the verdict was announced.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_17.html" title="November 17">November 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, Dade County commissioners agreed to a $1.1 million settlement with McDuffie's family in exchange for dropping their $25 million lawsuit. Of that amount, the family's legal team received $483,833, while McDuffie's children each received $202,500, and his mother, $67,500.</p>
