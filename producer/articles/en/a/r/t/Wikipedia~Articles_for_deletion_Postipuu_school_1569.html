Cluttering up Wikipedia with pointless articles that nobody will ever read, about non-notable trains - which are merely hunks of metal on wheels - and featuring such useful information as what colour the carriages of some defunct British rail company that nobody has ever heard of were painted in 1958, makes most school articles look like they're worthy of the Nobel Prize for Literature, by comparison. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 00:25, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Personally, I'd happily delete most schools but my reading of <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> is that the only <i>choose one of</i> (polite|sensible|useful) procedure is to recognise that we differ on this and hence consensus to delete will not be reached, implying that vfd's should not normally be started.
