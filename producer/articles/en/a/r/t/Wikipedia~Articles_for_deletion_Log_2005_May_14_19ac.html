<p>Page purports to describe a "diminishing angle paradox". The only Google hits for this phrase (4 of them) are Wikipedia mirrors, and hence this topic seems to be original research (which is admitted in <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_John_Gabriel%27s_Nth_root_algorithm_66e3.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/John Gabriel's Nth root algorithm">this VFD</a>). <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric119_9f87.html" title="User:Eric119">Eric119</a> 02:19, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Not original research, but also not much of a paradox. This is just an example of division by infinity - it could possibly be merged into any article on that subject, but it's not really as clear or obvious an example of the problems with this operation as more classic examples such as:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
1/infinity = 0; 
2/infinity = 0; 
therefore 1=2

<p>Non-notable. While they do score the top for their listing on Google, and it does have about 100000 hits on Geocities, the article feels as though it was written for vanity or advertising purposes. Plus, do we have a standard for roleplaying groups (even pro wrestling roleplaying "leagues" like this) for worthiness of entry?

Or perhaps, just move it to her user space and delete the resulting redirect? It's a few days since she did this, it may be a few more before she checks her messages here, and the VfD period seems a bit short for this. It's not an objectionable attempt at self-promotion, just a newbie. I recommend patience. No vote as yet. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 16:57, 14 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>She has 5 days from the time of the VfD listing until the article gets deleted. That's plenty of time to move it to User space if she wants to.

<li>Comment: Agree that she has 5 days to move it. Disagree, as I said above, that this is plenty of time in this case. Agree that extremism on VfD is not good, but surely, a comment (not even a vote) that we are rushing things a little here is not extremism?

<li><b>Delete.</b> This tastes like original research/neologism to me. Never heard of this "genre", any Google combination of the two words gets "nice" as an adjective in reviews of "pop" songs, plus (as defined in the article) it can apply to any artist in any genre where some people think that the artist is too nice to really belong in the genre.

<dd>Tell you what, I'll drop my delete vote and change it to a <b>keep</b> vote if the word list is dropped from the article title (change it to MacDonalds around the world or something like it). We can then have an article, which can discuss the worldwide reach (and limits thereof) as well as mention the myth, and the business paradgim, resistance to MacDonalds in certain settings (like the Spanish Steps). The list, with dates, can then be part of an article, like each biological family article has an article and then a list of the species in that family.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../w/i/t/User%7EWitkacy_80e6.html" title="User:Witkacy">Witkacy</a>, as I tried to suggest on your talk page, the issue is about what the article itself states. If you feel that a person is notable enough to deserve an article, go ahead and write the article, but please include information in the article about <i>why</i> that person is notable, as well as providing references for your research. Simply writing that a person was notable, with no way for other editors to verify it, is less that helpful. It seems you're doing a lot of good work to improve Wikipedia's coverage of Poland, and we would like to help you make your work on Wikipedia even better. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">EvilPhoenix</a></dd>
<dd>I <i><b>don't</b></i> know if they're notable or not, that's why I said <i>Article does not establish notability</i>. But is every single child of every single Polish noble notable?

<li>Comment - articles need to establish notability. At present, these do not. However, Czartoryski at least appears to be notable due to position in government.

The conclusion is irrelevant, by false <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antecedent.html" title="Antecedent">antecedent</a>.

<li>To formalize my position, I say that I agree with Martg76. Witold Leon Czartoryski is the only one of the three that is sufficiently notable. The other two have no better claim, as the articles stand so far, than that they are related to someone. Those two should be deleted. They're certainly far less notable than the first anime (<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astro_Boy_4f64.html" title="Astro Boy">Astro Boy</a>) or someone who appeared on the cover of TV Guide's "50 Greatest Characters Ever", has an asteroid named after him, and whose name, used by itself, nearly always refers to the fictional character rather than the individually quite notable real person who shares it (<a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Spock_c32f.html" title="Mr. Spock">Mr. Spock</a> - asteroid is <a href="../../../2/3/0/2309_Mr._Spock_b427.html" title="2309 Mr. Spock">2309 Mr. Spock</a>, real person is <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Spock_c797.html" title="Benjamin Spock">Benjamin Spock</a>).

<p>Yes, I'm nominating this for VfD again. Yes, it's less than a day since the old VfD closed. However, circumstances have changed significantly since then. The images on this gallery page have been moved to Commons, with a gallery page set up there: <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Historical_Maps_of_Korea" class="extiw" title="commons:Historical_Maps_of_Korea">commons:Historical Maps of Korea</a>. This page and the images that are on it are now redundant, as well as being an example of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and should be deleted.</p>
<p>The results of the old VfD were 10 (or 11) in favor of "transwiki to Commons and delete", with five (or six) in favor of "keep". The closing admin interpreted that as a decision to keep the article.

<li><b>Keep</b>, Wikicommons, in my uderstanding, was not set up to be a substitute for galleries. It was set up so that the different wikimedia projects could all use images without the having to upload the image to each of the projects. Wikicommons is not English Wikipedia and directing readers away from Wikipedia has a high potential for confusing casual readers who might not be aware that they have left wikipedia. There is not yet a consesus on Commons wether or they wil use image galleries or categories to organize the images there, and it may happen that they will stop having galleries. Finally wikicommons is a multilingual project and would be a disservice to send anglophone readers to pages such as <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Louvre" class="extiw" title="commons:Louvre">this</a>. It is important to note that, as commons matures, more and more pages will becom multilingual. <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 22:58, May 15, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Be fair</b> -- Even if you're ambivalent or simply not a fan, that should not be enough of a reason to delete the entry.

<li>Until there's an informative article on "<a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy_wrestling.html" title="Fantasy wrestling">Fantasy wrestling</a>" that persuades me otherwise, this seems extraordinarily trivial stuff, written up in a somewhat breathless style that has a presumably unintended comedic value. So, what is "fantasy wrestling"? Google led me to <a href="http://www.talkwrestlingonline.com/fantasy-wrestling-league.php" class="external text" title="http://www.talkwrestlingonline.com/fantasy-wrestling-league.php" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which suggests to me it's a bit like betting on wrestling ... but without actually betting.

<p>This <s>is</s> appears to be a joke page, it uses complicated (but accurate) phrases to translate simple words which have English equivalents. For example: "å â this is a noun signifying a sort of device usually used to keep dry during a rainstorm". The normal translation for <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%82%98" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:å">å</a> (kasa) is "umbrella". (<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%82%98" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%82%98" rel="nofollow">wiktionary</a>). It's funny though, could be userfied or sent to BJAODN. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 09:07, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Response: It is most definitely not a joke page. The "complicated phrases" are intended as descriptive definitions so that there can be no confusion regarding meanings. "kasa" for example can also translate to any number of English words which are more specific types of umbrella. (note for example that Wiktionary includes "parasol" and "parachute" although I would disagree with the latter) "Umbrella" in English is also used in many cases where it makes no sense in Japanese. (on <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/umbrella" class="extiw" title="wikt:umbrella">wikt:umbrella</a>, the second through fourth definitions are not accurately translated as "kasa")</p>
<p><strike>Also, I challenge you to find a single one of these that is incorrect. Some here who don't seem to speak Japanese have said the page is wrong, or that there is some factual error, with some sort of authoritative air about them, yet all I can think of is that they are making a conjecture based on the lies Uncle G has been spreading and the implication of your original nomination that the "complicated phrases" are nonsensical or incorrect.</strike> (fixed by Kappa)</p>
<p>So while it may seem like a joke, this page is entirely serious. To those who think I'm trying to make this page into a dictionary, the list is intended only to be illustrative and never to be an exhaustive list of Japanese nouns - whether that even belongs at Wiktionary is questionable (as a category maybe) - because that would really suck and stuff. As you can see, nobody has added or removed any nouns to or from the list since I created the article. I know plenty of other Japanese nouns (æ, for example, is a noun referring to a sort of formation of condensation which, when seen in the sky, appears fluffy. but did I put that on there?), yet I have not put them there. --<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 05:31, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I disagree. This page serves a serious function. Linguistically, it is true that there is no exact semantic equivalent for any Japanese noun to any English noun or vice-versa.

<li>This comment betrays a profound lack of knowledge about Wiktionary. I recommend a visit to Wiktionary. A vast number of Japanese/Chinese articles were added to the English Wiktionary early on in its life. Its coverage of those languages is extensive. For your edification, I've interwiki linked some of the words in this list to the Wiktionary articles. I strongly suggest following them, and comparing the (deliberately) pathetic tripe that is in this article with the proper definitions that already exist at Wiktionary. This article is plainly a parody, created to make a point. Wiktionary has no need of it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:08, 2005 May 15 (UTC)

<li>1) not a parody, 2) not created to make a point (if it were, would I be defending it?), 3) tell me a single definition in that list that is incorrect. --<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 01:53, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Isn't there something about being nice to users? As for profound lack of knowledge (not nice), many many many articles on Wiktionary are not very good. There's no set standard for a Wiktionary article, so there's no consistent look to find a definition. Furthermore, doesn't the article under discussion provide nuances on the meanings of words? If you've looked in the OED, you'd notice some definitions akin to these. 132.205.15.43 00:04, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Should this page exist? Should we have Japanese nouns about and with a list of Japanese nouns, or Bengali counting words? There is nothing different between the function of modal particles in German and in other languages. A list of German modal particles definitely does not belong here, any more than does a list of Navajo noun classifiers.</dd>
<dd>And as noted above, a list does not belong here, even if this article does.</dd>
<dd>Also as was said before, duplication of information at other, more generalised articles is frowned upon.</dd>
<dd>And I will show you two policies, one that says Wikipedia is not a dictionary (that's what Wiktionary is for), and another that says we aren't trying to teach people slang or how to speak a foreign language, when combined they mean that a list in this article, at least at the length you have (two or three examples would be OK), belongs on Wiktionary or Wikibooks, and not on Wikipedia.</dd>

<ul>
<li>That is indeed more accurate. "intended to be a parody" does not include the information: "which is supposed to be factual information appears to be instead" (parodies aren't nessecarily "supposed to be factual", although they can be), "humorous reproduction of a previously developed collection of text" (this indicates that it is a text-based parody, and that it uses layout and sentence structure from the original, rather than having all-new text), "and while it may be useful for you to attempt to make your argument from a previous page more clear" (these alleged circumstances are not conveyed by "parody"), and "not within the guidelines and other rules for this online encyclopedia project" ("parody" does not imply that the content is nessecarily against the rules). That gave me a good laugh - what was intended to be sarcastic actually went the opposite direction than intended. Anyhow. It was not intended as a parody. If it were, I would've pointed out explicitly on Talk:German modal particles that "To show you just how rediculous this is, I have created blah blah blah blah blah blah blah", which I most certainly didn't. I simply changed my opinion regarding articles on parts of speech by language, and decided that Japanese nouns, a nonexistant page, should really exist in the interest of completeness, and so populated it with content. After all, if there are so many Japanese nouns and they are used by the millions on an hourly basis, doesn't that make them notable?? --<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 01:29, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>What can I say to an article that claims:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Born is Dunkles Holz, Goelsâ early life was spent in the bucolic environs of his fatherâs successful fish ranch. A promising athlete as a youngster, Goels trained seriously at <i>Das Institut der BeilÃ¤ufigen Athletik</i> in Kleve. His sporting career ended abruptly when Goels was badly injured in a freak <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trampoline.html" title="Trampoline">trampoline</a> accident that left him with a slight limp and a pronounced lisp.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Or:</p>

<dd>Goelsâ most famous work <i>Dank fÃ¼r die Probe Bitte</i> â a sixteen panel work depicting the Board of Directors of Belgian <i>chocolatier</i> Sucrerie ChÃ¨re â was a <i>cause cÃ©lÃ©bre</i> at the 2001 <a href="../../../k/o/w/Kowloon.html" title="Kowloon">Kowloon</a> Biennial when one of the subjects of the work insisted his portrait be removed because it made him âlook fat.â <i>Schlammklappe</i> is typical of Goelsâ work in series, reflecting his tendency to make large numbers of discrete images on a given theme which, collectively, make up a single work. Goelsâ willingness to allow a given work to comprise, in a particular context, all or part of a series has been seen as a radical attempt to destabilize the unity of the art object and to challenge the authority of the artist. Others have seen the practice as the product of lazy or sloppy execution.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia has expanded past half a million articles covering practically all aspects of almost everything. With such a number of articles and many new ones introduced every day, the article topics are now getting more detailed. Considering the detailed nature of many of the articles in the half a million we have, I think it is consistent for Wikipedia to keep this internationally applicable and relevant list, although I concede it is not relevant to most people. Also, the list is not so exceptionally long that it poses a burden for Wikipedia to keep. As for the fact that it does not seem like an encyclopedia article, perhaps the explanation should be expanded so it is like one. <a href="../../../h/_/p/User%7EH_Padleckas_0cae.html" title="User:H Padleckas">H Padleckas</a> 04:21, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Master Thief Garrett</i>, I don't see any anger in this discussion except in your perception of the comments of others. This is encyclopedic, NPOV, and verifiable, as are all school stubs. They belong here.

</li>
<li>Sorry, I was meaning "angry" in a purely symbolic sense. Many users have a viewpoint that boils down to "How *dare* people vote to delete?!? All schools are automatically noteworthy here, WP is not paper; I don't see how anyone can possibly think otherwise!" This view is not necessarily given in as many words, but that's the basic idea of it.</li>

<dd>We're not at all concerned about running out of disk space--<a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html" title="WP:WWIN">WP:WWIN</a> openly encourages long, detailed articles, and if we were really <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scrooge.html" title="Scrooge">Scrooges</a> we wouldn't allow User pages to tie up said bandwidth--but the thing is the ultimate ungainliness of it.</dd>
<dd>OK, my mother came from <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabri.html" title="Cabri">Cabri</a>, pop. ~500 and declining (the old people slowly die off, the children quickly move to <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swift_Current_9c52.html" title="Swift Current">Swift Current</a>, and no new families move in). It is a town so obscure it doesn't even have an article of its own yet (if ever). Now would anyone from Cabri come here and search for the their one-and-only school (with a roll of ~50) and actually *expect* it to be here? Of course not, because they know full well they're insignificant to most of the world and are even missing on many maps. But, according to the Schoolwatch ideal, should that school be here? Oh yes, of course, it's instantly notable.</dd>
<dd>Now that is the problem. As I expressed it <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html#Schoolwatch" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">on my User page</a>, "<i>the Vfd ideal ... is, that people vote for an article to be kept <b>because it is *actually* valid</b>, NOT merely <b>because it is a school</b>.</i>" The schoolwatch program tells me nothing of a realistic minimum of (non)notability, and in the end we could end up with 500,000+ school pages <i>that will never get hits</i>!</dd>
<dd>Now THAT is my concern, that the Schoolwatch program has "legitimised" a precendent for the addition of countless useless pages.</dd>
<dd>Please understand this, I hold academic institutions of all forms in high regard (except for the Kohanga, which result in children having a great understanding of <a href="../../../m/a/o/Maori.html" title="Maori">Maori</a> but no working knowledge of the English language whatsoever, but I digress), but very, very, VERY few of them are noteworthy to the outside world. And, therefore, THIS one certainly isn't. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 07:19, 16 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Personally I would love wikipedia to have a decent article on that school in Cabri, sorry about that. As to numbers, there isn't a huge flood of school articles coming in, and the nominations and votes on school "notability" leave no room for compromise on the validity of the article. Let's make a {{cleanup-schools}} tag to get the articles up to a certain minimum quality, and discourage people from dropping in substubs which others have to fix up. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 07:38, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Irrelevant material for wikipedia. (<i>Unsigned comment anon user 128.135.188.232</i>)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. (I am the original author.) I am cool about the VfD, but I would like 128.135.188.232 to at least try to give a reason for his implied deletion vote. On the other hand I worked to make this article conform to Wikipedia policy (or semi-policy), especially <a href="../../../f/i/c/Wikipedia%7EFiction_37b0.html" title="Wikipedia:Fiction">Wikipedia:Fiction</a>. The rationale is that tourneys are a <i>major concept</i> of the books in question, and the article takes some time explaining their significance. So, depending on your perspective, this article is either a "major concept" of a work of fiction (and deserves its own because because of its length), or it is a "List of (minor and major) events", which makes it a topical, cross-volume plot summary. Both I find good enough reasons, but I certainly welcome the opinion of other editors. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbor_06ec.html" title="User:Arbor">Arbor</a> 19:54, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Comment</b>. By the way, this page doesn't seem to be listed on the main VfD page at all. (In any case I cannot find it). 128.135.188.232, since you made the nomination, maybe you would like to finish the process by putting the page on the main VfD list, so that it can be found by others than me and you? That is the third step of the VfD proces. Also, I encourage you to expand you nomination in the first paragraph with a reason. (And next time, please don't forget to sign your contribution.) As it is now, this page is unlikely to be found by anybody and hence won't gather many votes <i>pro</i> or <i>contra</i>.</s> No longer relevant. Uncle G kindly finished the proces. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbor_06ec.html" title="User:Arbor">Arbor</a> 09:32, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as claims made in posting are patently false. Ron Sakolsky cannot be the "author" of <b>Surrealist Subversions</b> (an article only posted on VfD in the first place because of the "surrealism deletion account" Classicjupiter2's well-documented anti-surrealist vendetta), as it was an anthology.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: I have rewritten this article, including references, citations and links. Sakorsky is highly notable and influential in the field of Pirate Radio, is a published author and anthologist of several texts on music, pirate radio, and surrealism, and is a regular contributor to popular magazines within these fields. The stub may have been very minimal but 965 hits would indicate a certain importance within his fields of expertise. --<a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETirin_6dbf.html" title="User:Tirin">Takver</a> 08:02, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: after doing some further research, I believe this listing for deletion is vexatious and trivial and has been done to pursue a personal agenda and debate between <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C. Boyer">Daniel C. Boyer</a> over entries on <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealism.html" title="Surrealism">surrealism</a>. This is not a debate over whether Sakolsky is an expert in Surrealism, but whether he is at all notable or influential in any area for inclusion in Wikipedia. I note that Classicjupiter2 stated above that Ron Sakolsky was a "non-notable author of "Surrealist Subversions"", yet failed to mention that in their opinion Ron <b>"is a pirate radio expert"</b>, which surely should be enough for his inclusion in wikipedia, which my update to the article now details.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. "Vitamin T" is mentioned in <i>Earl Mindell's Vitamin Bible</i>, which is a standard health-food-store reference on the subject, although Mindell himself says not much is known about the substance. "Vitamin T" seems to be one of those health food hoaxes that gets promoted periodically as a new "vitamin", but it's not a particularly notable one. It may or may not be notable enough for an article; I can think of several "vitamin" hoaxes like <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitamin_B17_3578.html" title="Vitamin B17">Vitamin B17</a> that are far more notable and don't have articles yet. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaibabsquirrel_3907.html" title="User:Kaibabsquirrel">Kaibabsquirrel</a> 07:33, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't believe that the article is self-promotion, and I would like to mention that the article previously came up for Deletion in May (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_AwesomeFunny_Archive1_8a9d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/AwesomeFunny/Archive1">archive</a>), with no consensus. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">EvilPhoenix</a> <a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">talk</a> 22:03, July 12, 2005 (UTC)

<li>AwesomeFunny was well-known because of an internet fad, and has been steadily losing popularity. Thus, it is useful to reconsider deleting the page now, as the site is all the more nn and the Alexa rating is low. <a href="../../../m/i/m/User%7EMimsy_Borogoves_513a.html" title="User:Mimsy Borogoves">Mimsy Borogoves</a> 13 July 2005 17:09 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article is no big deal (although I admit I did vote keep last time). But there's also a principle here: If this <b>content</b> was <i>ever</i> encyclopedic, then it still is. Maybe we should tighten up our practice on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomena.html" title="Internet phenomena">Internet phenomena</a> generally, that would wash. But deleting an article on the grounds that it was <i>once</i> significant but isn't now is a very dangerous precedent, and that seems to be the sentiment above. The article itself might be considered a candidate for redirect and merge, just so long as the content is preserved, and the redirect makes it still accessible. But that doesn't need a VfD discussion. Food for thought? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 00:21, 14 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a big "if." It never was encyclopedic, and half of it was wrong until my recent edit. (Check out the history for references to the fictional legal battle between Awesomefunny and its "rival," Funnyawesome.) Awesomefunny is not an internet phenomenon, even if "How to Kill a Mockingbird" was. And you will notice that the HTKAM wikipedia entry has been deleted. There is no matter of dangerous precedent here. The article should be deleted, not because it was once important but is no longer popular, but because it was never important, because it is self-promotative (which it clearly is, as it contains references mailing list content), because it is unencyclopedaic. Now that HTKAM is gone, Awesomefunny should follow. <a href="../../../m/i/m/User%7EMimsy_Borogoves_513a.html" title="User:Mimsy Borogoves">Mimsy Borogoves</a> 16 July 2005 00:05 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: Agree with some of this. If this survives VfD (and to me it looks close) then I'll be nominating HTKAM on VfU to make it a redirect to AwesomeFunny, I think that's the correct process and I can't see how we can have it both ways. Agree that <i>if</i> the argument is that AwesomeFunny was never really encyclopedic, then there's no dangerous precedent. But that's a big if itself considering previous Alexa rankings, surely? This is just the sort of content that it's important to preserve, otherwise it will be lost.

<dd>It's not appropriate to remove comments by other users. Its looked at as bad form. Also, I don't believe anonymous votes even <i>count</i> for deletion debates. Further, articles may be brought up multiple times on VfD, so there's no need to remove the tag just because it has been on VfD before. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">EvilPhoenix</a> <a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">talk</a> 21:10, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry. I didn't mean to break Wikipedia, but the comment was addressed to me so I felt I had the right to remove it. I'm also sorry I don't sign my posts, but that's my style. I don't see why I have to sign them, I've seen other people vote anonymously. Also, I'd rather people didn't sign them for me: you can check the history page to see who the editor is.</p>

<dd>Comment: I think they do count, but I don't think they count for <i>much</i>. VfD is a bit different to national elections and the like, in that it's difficult to police someone creating a new userid each month, for example, and contributing (and voting) under each. So the admins in practice weight the votes in a quite subjective (and I believe intelligent, fair and reasonable) way. And it works quite well enough. Part of the theory behind this is that borderline votes like this one don't really matter a lot. The credibility and integrity of Wikipedia are not at risk at all here either way, regardless of what some may think. No change of vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 07:45, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>In my defense, I listed this on VfD not because it was a stub dicdef (I would have marked that differently; I spend a lot of time on RC patrol) but because it was pretty obvious bullshit, but not quite obvious enough to be a CSD.

<li>I've taken a look at the revised edits and agree that the new text improves the NPOV but I still have very strong reservations about the title of this article. I believe it is best resolved by deleting the article and merging its improved content onto either the <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> article or the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus_c705.html" title="Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus">Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus</a> article. Both articles seem a more appropriate place for this content rather than a stand alone article. Additionally, I believe it will be easier to maintain the NPOV if this content is integrated into one of the above articles as there is more context available.<a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobycat_72d8.html" title="User:Tobycat">Tobycat</a> 01:50, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>What are you talking about? You can delete this page from here because the passion for greeks might have turned your eyes blind, but you cannot delete the unescapable reality of the Turkish Cypriot Genocide from the history.</p>
<p>We'll make you an offer. If you can bring back the thousands of innoncent Turkish Cypriot men,women and babies murdered between 1963 and 1974(the peace operation of Turkey) back to life, the Turkish Cypriot Nation will be absolutely happy to forget about the genocide.</p>
<p>Can you do so?</p>
<p>If not be respectful to the memory of the victims of the Turkish Cypriot Genocide.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> The Soul of Thousands of Turkish Cypriots Murdered Until the Peace Operation of Turkey</li>
</ul>
<p>Article is renewed, prove that the Turkish Cypriot Genocide is not a fact or withdraw your offer of deletation.Article can no more be classified as a page for deletation due to the fact that <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> which is not on the list of deletation uses absolutely the same wording.

<li>this article is much improved and if the info isn't elsewhere it should be kept. But I have grave concerns about the title's NPOV. Genocide is a very strong word. The article admits it is what the Turkish call the incident - not the Greeks - and apparently not other parties either ('Turkish Cypriot Genocide' yields only 4 sites on google and all are strongly POV). I'll change my delete vote for a <b>strong rename</b> - but unfortunately I don't know enough about this to make a suggestion.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc Glasgow</a> 14:16, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Agree that it's much improved, but I still don't think it's encyclopedic. The article itself now states that this <i>genocide</i> claim is used by one side of the conflict. To me the title still seems to be more a political slogan than an encyclopedia topic. My suggestion is that we delete this and invite those who've done good work on it to add their material to the articles we already have on the conflict. I also notice that the talk page has now been blanked. No change of vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 00:16, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
