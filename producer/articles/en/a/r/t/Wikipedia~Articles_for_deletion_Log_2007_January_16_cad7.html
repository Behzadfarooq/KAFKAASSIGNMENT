<li>Because the department has had a major influence on the modern course of NZ politics, and because a few of its current lecturers are major figures in their own right, the page should stay.

<p>This really smacks of jealousy. Cantebury ranked higher than Auckland in Political Studies? Are you serious? Is there anyone at Cantebury in Politics that matters? Vic can make some claims, but the PBRF scores in no way reflect the true weight of Auckland in national political life. Beside the alumni, people like Jack Vowles, Raymond Miller, Yongjin Zhang, Paul Buchanan, Helena Catt, Andrew Sharp, Barry Gustafson, Peter Aimer, all current or recent staff, are certainly major academic figures in NZ political life. Deleting the page or merging into the Auckland general page might be advisable, but the grounds advocated by the one commentator show a clear prejudice against the department. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 130.216.146.240 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.216.146.240_bade.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.216.146.240">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Transit agencies, even defunct ones, generally have their own articles. Having a separate article makes it easier to find if you are looking at a category of transit agencies.

<li><b>Comment</b>: an article about transporation in Iqaluit would have much better chances of expansion, and this information could find its place there.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm inclined to agree with <a href="../../../q/y/d/User%7EQyd_7b48.html" title="User:Qyd">Qyd</a>. I don't see much purpose in a short article about a now defunct public transit system and there isn't much potential for expansion really. Forking out the Iqaluit transportation section of <a href="../../../i/q/a/Iqaluit%2C_Nunavut_7e26.html" title="Iqaluit, Nunavut">Iqaluit, Nunavut</a> to a new Iqaluit transportation article and then incorporating the small amount of content at <a href="../../../i/q/a/Iqaluit_Public_Transit_8dca.html" title="Iqaluit Public Transit">Iqaluit Public Transit</a> into this new article pretty much guarantees a decent amount of information in the article.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:59, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think some people need to give more consideration at times not just to content <i>itself</i>, but to how best to <i>organize</i> that content for maximum clarity, visible relationships with common topics, and ease of location. If this were merged into <a href="../../../i/q/a/Iqaluit.html" title="Iqaluit">Iqaluit</a>, for instance, then it wouldn't be in either <a href="../../../t/r/a/Category%7ETransit_agencies_in_Canada_4785.html" title="Category:Transit agencies in Canada">Category:Transit agencies in Canada</a> or <a href="../../../t/r/a/Category%7ETransportation_in_Nunavut_7c2c.html" title="Category:Transportation in Nunavut">Category:Transportation in Nunavut</a> — so even if we keep the information itself, we have no natural way to <i>flag</i> to a reader of those topics that the information is present in Wikipedia. I'd suggest something like Qyd's proposal: <b>merge</b> to a larger article on Transportation in Iqaluit, and <b>redirect</b> this title to that...<b>but keep the redirect filed in <a href="../../../t/r/a/Category%7ETransit_agencies_in_Canada_4785.html" title="Category:Transit agencies in Canada">Category:Transit agencies in Canada</a></b> as a flag. As a suggestion, however, the nominator should be aware that in future, if you're going to propose a <i>merger</i>, you should use {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergefrom_0c79.html" title="Template:Mergefrom">mergefrom</a>}}/{{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergeto_cea0.html" title="Template:Mergeto">mergeto</a>}} rather than AFD to do that. While an AFD can <i>result</i> in a merge if people <i>disagree</i> on the appropriateness of deletion, it's not the correct process to use if you're proposing merger rather than deletion right from the start. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 05:37, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>no clear consensus</b>. I see significant camps wanting merge, delete, and keep -- ultimately, it seems the mergists may have the most support, but it doesn't seem those calling for deletion have carried the discussion, one way or another.

<p>Sorry to bore you all again, but someone has seen fit to contest my prods on the above with compelling (sic) arguments such as <i>"I disagree that masts aren't notable", "leave masts alone", and "towers and masts of this height (349m, 401m) are categorically considered notable enough for articles"</i>. No improvements have been brought to the plain one-line stub articles in question. I beg to move for deletion as per numerous overwhelming precedents.

<li><b>Heathens and villians all</b> - You should all be hung from six-inch high yardarms. But seriously... The arguments that tall masts aren't notable (see <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_Far2manymasts_c9a5.html" title="User:Ohconfucius/Far2manymasts">User:Ohconfucius/Far2manymasts</a> don't hold water. Notability is subject specific and to some degree locally determined as well - these masts are in most cases notable locally (the tallest thing around, often visibile throughout a county, etc). There really aren't that many of them in total. Having adequate descriptions for each would require one overly long article. There is no damage done by keeping the stubs; at some point, we may have someone who wants to expand them and can gather the requisite details. Ohconfucius' assertion that there's a consensus on this is specious - the consensus is one (him) plus those few who noticed them on AFD - there has been nothing approaching a reasonable effort to construct a notability guideline for Masts, get consensus for that, and then apply it consistently and globally. The current campaign has no logical well defined stopping criterion and is a terribly bad idea. This should be abandoned and Ohconfucius should start working on a notability criteria document for masts, and get real consensus on that, first. <b>Keep all, and stop AFDing until there is an agreement about notability criteria for masts</b> <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 04:28, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I would tend to think that the consensus at AfD has been overwhelmingly to delete-notability is actually <i>not</i> subjective, including subject specific, it depends over anything else on multiple non-trivial reliable source coverage.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I have outlined what I believe could constitute notability, and assertion thereof, and my approach has been consistent. This approach has been consistently backed over a 7 week period at AfD. Articles which have been de-prodding with even a remote improvement in line with <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">policy</a> have been left alone. The above were only brought to AfD because somebody disagreed but did not shape them up. I'd be happy to participate in hammering out a guideline for these structures, but I feel <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is adequate for the sake of these discussions. Please note that there have been a few stubs which editors have been spurred into turning into full-sized articles - <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediumwave_transmitter_Mainflingen_ec08.html" title="Mediumwave transmitter Mainflingen">Mediumwave transmitter Mainflingen</a> is a good example of this. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 09:10, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

After a bit of effort, I was able to determine that the Westport Tower is a transmitter for KCCO-TV (a "satellite" of <a href="../../../w/c/c/WCCO-TV_e384.html" title="WCCO-TV">WCCO-TV</a> in Minneapolis) in <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandria%2C_Minnesota_d93a.html" title="Alexandria, Minnesota">Alexandria, Minnesota</a>. KCCO-TV doesn't even have an article, nor should it. It simply duplicates the WCCO-TV broadcast signal. Sources can't be found, aside from the FCC, that give any details about the tower. Even the WCCO-TV website didn't say anything. It is simply not notable. The WCCO-TV article mentions "Additional TV transmitters in the north serve Alexandria (KCCO 7, 24 DT) and Walker/Bemidji (KCCW 12, 20 DT)." Having the tower mentioned as such in the WCCO-TV article is the way to go. The other transmission towers don't appear to be notable either. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 18:25, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, non-notable. The only review is that of RPG-Planet and on its own it is not enough to prove notability. Even more so, the review is everything but objective and has the appearance of being written by the fan. Quoting: "<i>For instance, after the PlayStation2 came out, I obviously had to own one, and couldn't spend any money in Achaea for a couple months.</i>". Reviewers don't operate in this fashion. In addition to that, Mr. Reves is neither listed as a staff member nor does he address any controversial issues of the game apart from saying that they exist. It's a praise, not a review. The other sources simply don't mention the game as a central subject nor address it in any way other than existing. <b>Still no evidence of the awards provided.</b> Non-Notable.<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxgrin_481e.html" title="User:Maxgrin">~~MaxGrin</a> 11:33, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'll admit that I haven't found evidence of an "award" (although the company nebulously claims it has done so), but I'm afraid I do not understand the criteria you are trying to fulfull. The Terdiman article in Wired and the CGW article are both demonstrably about the game -- or, rather, about an item introduced to the game, which would seem to be splitting hairs to differentiate. Also, I might argue that the use of the Achaea engine for the medium of communication of a conference involving UN dignitaries would be sufficient under <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> regardless of other concerns. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 11:50, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would say that the discussion about the item is rather about the phenomenom that was observed while doing so, rather than about the game in which it was introduced. Similarly, if a rock band in a small town would run around and slaughter bystanders, the phenomenom would be notable, yet not the participants, i.e. we would not be interested in the biographies in an encyclopedia. Also, the reference made is to the engine, not to the game itself, making it a rather weak link. Feel free to disagree, but that how I see it.<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxgrin_481e.html" title="User:Maxgrin">~~MaxGrin</a> 11:57, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>By the way, out of pure interest, where did you dig up that Computer Gaming World quote?<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxgrin_481e.html" title="User:Maxgrin">~~MaxGrin</a> 12:15, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>At some point, CGW made a giant database of all their articles publically available, and I grabbed it. The link to it that I used back then seems to have died, but, happily, I now find that a 3rd party site has mirrored at least some of the article text. That one, in particular, is <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zdcgw/is_200409/ai_n7182698" class="external text" title="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zdcgw/is_200409/ai_n7182698" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I believe there's also an interview with the Achaea designer in another issue; I'll try to scrounge that up shortly.</dd>
<dd>In any case, I'm not sure your analogy is ideal here. Jokes about the addictive nature of MMOGs are pervasive, but Achaea had the gall/insight to actually introduce an in-game substance that got <i>characters</i> (rather than players!) addicted. If nothing else, its novel. I'll probably agree to disagree on the importance of the engine use as regards the game itself, although I'll point out that the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quake.html" title="Quake">Quake</a> article discusses the uses of the Quake engine for other games (it never hosted a conference ... I don't think).</dd>
<dd>Regardless, I'll try to find some more content. I'll admit that the article as it stands is still poor. I just think is keep-able. There are a lot more negative comments from reviewers to be had, but they are often in comparison to other games, in those games' reviews (<i>Foo-game</i> gets my recommendation, because, unlike Achaea, it does <i>bar</i>). I didn't include such sources because they don't advance notability for AFD (although they will be important to present a comprehensive and NPOV article if it survives this process). <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 12:29, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Nice link, thank you. On the matter of engine, Quakes engines have been used in a good score of games, making it very special, however it is only a side note as Quake itself is notable. I completely agree that shall the artcle remain, the engine bit should be a part of it. Would be nice seeing the UN directives chat with Quake running in background though.:P</dd>
<dd>Anyway, Achaea has quite a number of curiosities about it, such as the Gleam story, however the AfD states that "that's an interesting article" is not a criterea. The way it stands now, it is objectively speaking non-notable.</dd>
<dd>PS: This is terribly weird, but after about a 30 minute search in google(one sees that sometimes I get really bored), I didn't even find a hint on Achaea winning any awards other than their homepage. This is off-topic, but why on earth are they so well hidden? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxgrin_481e.html" title="User:Maxgrin">Maxgrin</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/x/User_talk%7EMaxgrin_0fd1.html" title="User talk:Maxgrin">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Maxgrin_9aa9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Maxgrin">contribs</a>) 12:41, 16 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

They've also noted a couple of reviews I can't find, such as a "#1 MUD" from gamers.com and a 5/5 rating from mpog.com that I'm having trouble finding due to their age.

<dd>I would dare say it did at least when compared directly to this disputed article, as I re-wrote that now deleted article myself in late 2006 with the specific purpose of fixing the problems which had the original version deleted under consensus back in 2005. (Rightfully so by the way, hence my initiative to attempt to make the content acceptable to Wikipedia standards.) The great irony is that I actually based the structure of that re-written article heavily on this very Achaea article, as since this article was not being considered for deletion, they apparently seemed to be doing something 'right'. And yet that very same 'something right' certainly wasn't its reliable sources provided, as this debate seems to be making increasingly clear. The aforementioned deleted article didn't have any notable differences in content to this Achaea article, apart from the former having a more detailed gameplay section, and neither article provided <i>valid</i> sources to establish its notability. Both were essentially in the same situation, yet one was deleted and the other was not. I thus am left with the distinct perception that a double-standard seems to be in effect at this point in time. I can very easily provide my deleted article with the precise same type of sources as this Achaea article has done with itself, yet that would simply not be ethical on my part, as they would not be valid under Wikipedia's guidelines to begin with. Logically, the same standards should thus apply to this article. Given the near identical situation of these two articles with regards to both content and validity, they either should both go, or both be restored. 84.192.125.204 09:46, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I've made a 2nd pass through the article with an eye toward improved sourcing, again. At least for now, I've removed the RPG Planet review over concerns that it was inappropriately hagiographic. However, the article now cites its review on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Screen_Savers_5877.html" title="The Screen Savers">The Screen Savers</a></i>, as well as substantial coverage in <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Bartle_f414.html" title="Richard Bartle">Richard Bartle</a>'s most recognized book on multiplayer online gaming. I've located a couple of additional criticism sources in an effort to ensure the article adequately reflects all available opinions, have brought the text more in line with the manual of style, and have found quite a bit of further discussion regarding the payment system, especially from <a href="../../../i/g/d/IGDA_570e.html" title="IGDA">IGDA</a>. At least to my eyes, the <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> proposal requirements are more than satisfied. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 19:06, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>You know, I think if we really want to keep this article we at least need to refine the sources. Now you did a great job of finding them, but we really need to sort them out a little. Right now it's a puddle of mud. Even more so, I think we should make an exception here and add the links to the forums from the previous version. Since Achaea is not very famous, we won't get any of this feedback from independent press and in my eyes, we're missing a big point about the revenue system by leaving out those entries.<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxgrin_481e.html" title="User:Maxgrin">~~MaxGrin</a> 09:25, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps it's simply the hour here, but I'm not sure what you're suggesting needs to happen regarding "sorting out" the references. Regarding the forum links from a few versions back ... most of that appears to be standard MMOG "how dare they make me play!" forum banter. On the other hand, linking to a forum discussion regarding the autoclass changes might be prudent, since it won't be covered in a better source, and directly impacts the roleplaying environment that the positive sources spend so much time lauding. I'll see what I can conjure up. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 10:18, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment for keeping</b> This is my personal point of view, but if we decide to delete this then what will be next? I realize that there are extensive rules, regulations, and preconceived notions of what should and shouldn't be on wikipedia, but i also think that it is or should be more accepting. But i digress. For this article i call into light such others as the article on D&amp;D, Zelda, and other games of such note. True, this particular game is not as well known, but if has been around for so long, and has so many participants in so many places, then it meets my notability requirements. I also feel that if wikipedia is such a "comunity oriented" excersize then we should be allowed to have articles about other communities. Achaea is a community, much like Gaia and some other games of note. If you need it to be more suit-and-tie, isn't it owned/run by the Iron Realms? Surely they are notable enough. At <b>most</b> we should smerge this with any wiki on Iron Realms. I believe that Achaea is stand-alone enough to reside in wiki's hallowed halls. 64.251.57.196 13:21, 22 January 2007 (UTC)Rhunsulrana</li>
<li><b>keep</b> -- Achaea is the most popular MUD today (according to topmudsites.com), and for that reason alone should be on here. It has a large player base and is one of the few remaining examples of quality text-based roleplaying games. I agree the article should be improved, but deletion is not warranted. - <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Nowak_a997.html" title="User:John Nowak">John Nowak</a></li>

<p>I created this article a <i>long</i> time ago, back before I knew what was appropriate for Wikipedia. The reason I'm AfD'ing it now is because I've realized that 1) it's basically a game guide and/or nonnotable material and 2) it spawned the second article I've listed for deletion which is even worse than the first, in terms of game guide-ness. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 01:01, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Hope and Faith are more than props, they are two little girls who have appeared in many different TV roles in a year, more than most kids would by age 5. Even if the role is small, to use a baby to film the kid(s) have to be able to feel comfortable working with other kids and not become every time the cameras roll. Agents look for certain things in young children, so they must have shown some kind of promise for agents to choose to represent them. Yes, they are babies but they won't be that way forever and their resume is going to keep on growing. So many other young kids around their age have Wikipedia pages, what should make Hope and Faith any different? <b><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Megan xo (<a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegan_xo_7321.html" title="User talk:Megan xo">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Megan_xo_398e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Megan xo">contribs</a>).</small> (Megan xo is the article's author.)</b></li>

Furthermore the movies listed do not correspond with the release date, and some of the movies listed were made/distributed by studios other than Warner's.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm disappointed that this article might wind up as a "no consensus keep", which I don't think is necessary. Therefore, I would like to point out (1) that unlike most other television shows which are cancelled before being aired, this one has an obvious target to merge into, since the Cheetah Girls remained viable as a project despite the cancellation of their series; and (2) that there are only 4 sentences of prose text in this article, which could easily be merged into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cheetah_Girls_%28girl_group%29_39ad.html" title="The Cheetah Girls (girl group)">The Cheetah Girls (girl group)</a>. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 19:20, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>From the article, <i>A virtual series is an unproduced series of teleplays, TV scripts, stories, which a screenwriter, or a group of screenwriters, post onto the internet, either as an unauthorized continuation of an ended, existing series, as fanfiction for an existing series which may still be in production, or in some cases, as a completely original creation of the writer(s) that simply hasn't found a network audience.</i> In other words, they are unproduced scripts made by screenwriters, posted onto the internet as fanfiction for a <a href="../../../n/i/c/Niche_market.html" title="Niche market">niche market</a>. This article tries to demonstrate the notability of the term, yet fails to provide examples of famous virtual series. The most famous one appears to be Buffy, however the series already have an article at <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffyverse_%28fan_films%29.html" title="Buffyverse (fan films)">Buffyverse (fan films)</a>. The article mentions a site that hosts a lot of scripts, but an article about it and related topics was deleted due <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Monster_Zero_Productions_e291.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Monster Zero Productions">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Monster Zero Productions</a>. The article has had a section of "How to do it yourself" since a month ago. I suggest deleting this article due lack of notability. At worst, redirect it to <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_fiction.html" title="Fan fiction">Fan fiction</a>. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 02:16, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> There is apparently a distinction between fan fiction and a virtual series (according to the entry anyway) which is that a virtual series can be an entirely original creation.

<p>As per my previous nomination re: Andy Grossman. Appears to be a hoax. Article created by same user (Nymski). The films in this case match dates listed but were directed by D.A. Pennebaker, not Terrence Willow. A google search of Pennebaker and Terrence Willow doesnt seem to correlate any hits, except wikipedia mirrors. imdb and TCM databases turn up nothing on Terrence Willow. Again nothing links to article and is unreferenced. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegX_bd87.html" title="User:MegX">MegX</a> 02:25, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Subject's main claim to notability is a non-successful recording career, some unpublished books, and apparent friendships with more notable people.

<p>The result was <b>keep.</b> There appears to be a lot of support for improving and verifying the article to the best of our ability -- that sounds like an excellent idea. Some people think splitting the article between different articles would be the way to go; could give that a shot, and either redirect, disambiguate, or re-nom for deletion, if you like. One way or another, though, there doesn't seem to be a consensus to delete at this time. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 23:25, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep, but provide more references</b> "Listcruft/fancruft" is not a valid reason for deletion. Entrance music is particularly important in professional wrestling, and many of the wrestlers and shows on this list are extremely notable. In addition, this list indexes a great deal of information that can not be easily cataloged within other existing articles or the category system. Therefore the list is both useful and notable. However, that all being said, it does currently suffer from a large lack of references. The songs are most likely correct, but to meet citation standards someone needs to provide references verifying the information in the article. I have therefore flagged the article requesting references. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:51, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, it's not. Even per the above referenced <i>essay</i> (not guideline or policy), "Generally speaking, the perception that an article is fancruft can be a contributing factor in its nomination and deletion, <b>but it is not the actual reason for deletion.</b>" In other words the perception of something being "fancruft" might contribute to people wanting to delete it, but it is <i>not</i> used as the reason for deletion. There is no policy or even any guidelines against "fancruft". <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:16, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And to put it another way, you should <i>never</i> see an admin delete an article with the official reason being "fancruft". It might be deleted for lack of references or a notability issue, but you should not see articles deleted if the <i>only</i> complaint on the afd is "fancruft". <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:20, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually I'm not ignoring anything, as I already described above that in my opinion the information in the article is notable and useful to readers, but that it does have a problem in that it currently lacks references. My complaint is that "fancruft" is, frankly, an unfortunately all too common and inappropriate phrase for afd and cfd discussions. I would much rather nominators not use that term at all since whether or not something is "fancruft" has no bearing on whether or not I'll support deletion. It's a waste of time to use the phrase in a nomination for deletion, and also is rather insulting to otherwise good faith article authors. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:03, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Difficult, this one. The psychological aspect of music in relation to crowd "heat" at wrestling events is pretty large, as the characters are quite closely tied to their themes in the mind of the audience, so there's a reasonable amount of potential for an article on that side of things. However, sourcing is definitely missing, and the list seems to be overdoing it. <b>Weak delete</b>; possibly merge the information in the first couple of paragraphs to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling.html" title="Professional wrestling">professional wrestling</a>, but axe the list (despite my finding it useful once or twice) as being nearly impossible to source. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 21:17, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Serve the same purpose as soundtracks listings of discographies (different from those of an artist's). Same as List of songs performed on The X Factor (UK TV series) or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_in_South_Park_480b.html" title="List of songs in South Park">List of songs in South Park</a>, which are also musical lists related and belonging to highly different categories and apparently has no informational values apart from gathering them in one page. But that's not a reason for deletion for me. <a href="../../../l/a/j/User%7ELajbi_aa80.html" title="User:Lajbi"><b><font face="Lucida handwriting" color="#78866B">Lajbi</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/a/j/User_talk%7ELajbi_4318.html" title="User talk:Lajbi"><b><font color="#C3B091">Holla @ me</font></b></a></sup> 22:49, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As per above. Also I like to add that if I was interested in any of the songs by wrestlers, I find this an excellent article to browser for the artist, find out the song name. This is a good article and it runs like a catalog. Maybe it also requires a category to run with it. <a href="../../../g/o/v/User%7EGovvy_b92c.html" title="User:Govvy">Govvy</a> 12:18, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> In its current state it contains large amounts of mostly unverifiable original research. If the article is kept I recommend the list of songs is deleted and started again from scratch with each song being properly referenced, otherwise the article will always have major problems. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 13:54, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually a surprising amount of the information is verifiable, although the references aren't yet included. You can typically verify what theme songs a wrestler or PPV used in a few ways. First, some of that information appears on the wrestling promotion's official website. Second, the major promotions release periodic official music CDs which feature the theme songs for their wrestlers and PPVs, including listing on the track list which song is for which wrestler. Just using those two sources, you could probably provide accurate citations of either official internet postings or from official CDs that verify who uses what. The remaining uncited songs could be either removed or tagged with "citation needed". <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:32, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I'm prepared to give the benefit of the doubt on notability, per arguments above. Verification is poor to non-existant; ideally, each entry on the list needs a source. Assuming a consensus that this is notable, we would want to keep the list for those cases where an article about the wrestler does not yet exist, or does not include this information. May be appropriate to <b>keep, mark for verification</b>, list on relevant Projects, and revisit in a month. If verification then remains flimsy, I would be minded to delete, but let's give the workers a chance. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEludium-q36_1333.html" title="User:Eludium-q36">Eludium-q36</a> 18:02, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Except that this part of the "I Like It" essay (not guideline) does not make a claim that usefulness has no bearing. Clearly the more people that consider an article useful as Wiki readers, the more likely it is to be worth inclusion.

<p><b>Split and Re-Write</b> This info belongs on the wrestler's pages, and doesn't need a page of it's own. The prose can stay, but the list doesn't belong here. If someone wants to know the name of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Aries_3045.html" title="Austin Aries">Austin Aries's</a> enterance, they'll go to his page to find it. While the info here is valid and varifiable, the collection is messy and invites the inclusion of <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">non-noteable</a> information. A good way to decide if the enterance music is notable, is if the wrestler is notable. If they don't have their own page, they don't deserve an entry here. If we are going to use that logic, why not just put the info in their page, and throw on a catagory on it to group wrestlers with distinguished music? -- <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickSentowski_243d.html" title="User:NickSentowski">NickSentowski</a> 20:12, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - Flixster is well-known amongst film fans, predominantly teenagers.

<li><b>Keep</b> I heard of this website a while back in a printed newspaper. Website is relatively new, so not a surprise there aren't a huge number of notable publications about it, but did find some online mentions which, while not all about Flixster, refer to it as a fact of the Web in the same breath as <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a>/<a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a>, and a quickly growing site: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6157134.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6157134.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC News</a> <a href="http://www.filmstew.com/showBlog.aspx?blog_id=938" class="external text" title="http://www.filmstew.com/showBlog.aspx?blog_id=938" rel="nofollow">Film Stew</a> <a href="http://www.internetadsales.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=8726" class="external text" title="http://www.internetadsales.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=8726" rel="nofollow">Internet data</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> - of the external references above, only the BBC one seems like a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, and it only mentions Flixster in passing -- the site is not the subject of the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> please see my edits. Although <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeLarge_49dd.html" title="User:DeLarge">DeLarge</a> may disagree with the notability of some of the references, the net is run by blog-makers these days. And having a regular commentor for the BBC mention Flixster in passing as if it were something everyone should know about it a positive, rather than a negative point for notability.<a href="../../../g/d/a/User%7EGDallimore_1dd1.html" title="User:GDallimore">GDallimore</a> 18:22, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Reply</i> -- we'll have to agree to disagree on several points; (i) The entire quote from the BBC seemed like a bit of name-dropping to me -- "look at the esoteric sites <i>I've</i> heard of, I must be a commentator with my finger on the pulse" -- but that's just my cynical opinion. (ii) The fact that there's 100x more bloggers than a couple of years ago doesn't make them more reliable, which is why they're explicitly mentioned as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">largely unacceptable source</a> (see "Using online and self-published sources"). Having said all that, it <i>does</i> look a lot better than when it was nominated, and probably wouldn't have come under the scrutiny of an AfD if the original editors had put in the effort you did. PS I thought the net was run by the same porn barons and online gambling sites as always... <i>--<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeLarge_49dd.html" title="User:DeLarge">DeLarge</a> 21:44, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</i></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> #1 - in response to <a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">Yukichigai</a>, if the people can't "find elsewhere", the church would not be "notable" and therefore should not be included in this list. And, if it's a "megachurch", wouldn't part of the definition be that there would be lots of information readily available? And in the same line as <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a>, there is already a category for those that have their own articles. #2 - Again, just doing a quick survey of numbers (the bottom #of this list in the 2000's for attendance/membership (again, it's not delineated) I could easily include 100 Catholic Churches from CA (USA) alone; multiply that by 50 states, and I've immediately added 5000 churches to this list! <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH">SkierRMH</a> 20:51, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>One I added a great deal to this list by searching for third party or verified info, some were easier than others. I live in Louisville, Ky. so obviously I added a great deal to this area. That is part of the issue here consistency. Louisville, Ky. does NOT have the most mega-churches per capita ... I mean we could but I have no way of knowing that. By looking at the list it would seem that we have proportionally more mega-churches than other cities. These are issues. This is a list. Is it as important as the article "megachuches"&#160;? No and in some ways yes. Merging this list with the article would make the article too long. However this is an interesting research tool -- if I'm correct that would be encyclopedic (in essence). What you get by looking at the list here is something that you don't get from the article. You see how diverse this cultural phenomenon is. Look at the diversity of denominations, geography, etc. you SEE more from the list than you do in the article. Admittedly I know there are a lot of "red" links in the text. But there are also a lot of external links (I know because I looked a great deal of them up). These links combined with a list create an interactive research tool that honestly exists nowhere else. You want to read about the mega churches fine here's a list including a link to their websites read for your self, see the similarities and differences. Most of these sites have an "about us" or "what we believe" section or news; any number of things that tell you more about the congregation. These links are not provided on the Hartford site. This is where you find diversity and this is where you have a tool for knowledge and research. YES this article or list needs some clean up, ok a LOT of clean up. I'd argue format first and foremost, along with set criterion and verifiability. The challenge is the list is growing and it's hard to verify them all. I mean some churches don't boast about their attendance you only find it buried in the church newsletter on the website. I think a solution would be a lock on the page. This would prevent someone just posting their church for recognition and in order to be added it has to go through the discuss page and meet a set format. I'd be happy (if I can be given a week or so) to go through and make the list uniform in format and I'll even research out the list as I go. I’m willing to step up and do it if and when something is decided. Format I think would work … Southeast Christian Church - Louisville - Dave Stone [66] [Attendance: 19,100]</p>
<p>Church name linked to internal site if none external – location – congregational leader – extrenal link if an internal article exists – attendance</p>
<p>This gives a source a set criteria (attendance avg weekly) and consistency. List by state or country and by church alphabeticly.</p>
<p>But I seriously think we need to keep this. Deletion gets rid of something that could be useful even if only to a small group, it is a research tool.

<p>The article is about a term that has not reached any degree of notability, with only 6 Ghits, despite the article's claim of broad industry acceptance. Moreover, the term, Hendy's Law, is merely the application of a broader term, <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moore%27s_Law_4f26.html" title="Moore's Law">Moore's Law</a> to a specific product. Finally, the article seems to be a form of Blatant advertising as the article's primary author, <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarry.hendy_710d.html" title="User:Barry.hendy">Barry.hendy</a> has attached his own name to the 'law.' <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMindsEye_e83c.html" title="User:TheMindsEye">TheMindsEye</a> 05:12, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>NO NOT Delete</b>This matter has just been brought to my attention by an actor who was in the process of doing research on David-Matthew. Just to clarify: David-Matthew Barnes has a novel, two films and three collections of work coming out this year and two television series in the works. His stage plays have received <b>over three hundred productions</b> in eight countries, twenty-five states, at nearly twenty festivals and have been performed in three languages. Copies of his plays have sold in the thousands and he receives letters daily from young readers who identify with his work. His film Frozen Stars is <b>available around the world on DVD, including rental copies via Blockbuster and NetFlix</b>. Is that considered notable enough? I can have those who support David-Matthew as a noteable artist submit their opinions if it would help.--Nick 18:52, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> the article does <i>not</i> lack citations, although it could use more of them. And since "LOL" is maybe the most common piece of Internet slang, it's probably best to keep it. Otherwise we might end up deleting all articles on Internet slang, which would be too bad. (I'm all for getting rid of the slang itself, by the way (btw?), but since it exists it is, unfortunately, notable in my opinion (IMO?). --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 06:08, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ironically, whilst researching <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joke.html#Cycles" title="Joke">Joke#Cycles</a> I found a lot of material written by folklorists and others on the jokes that people tell after deaths and disasters, including one lengthy piece by Christie Davies that describes at length the error of commentators who complain when someone makes a joke about such subjects.

<li>Much of the time I don't mind jokes about a death or tragedy, "gallows humor" type stuff either, as they're a way to deal with it, etc. For example I didn't have a problem with people lampooning <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven%27s_Gate_5d0a.html" title="Heaven's Gate">Heaven's Gate</a>. For some reason though this was a case where I didn't like it. I'm guessing this woman didn't know about water intoxication and wasn't drinking huge amounts of water purely for her own amusement. This seems like a case that could get lawyers involved too. "Funny deaths" don't work like that to me.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I am not opposed to mentions of her in the other articles. I think there should be a mention to this incident on the articles water intoxiation and the Wii, however i think it should be a brief mention that she died and with all the press coverage, have the article with more details on her and her death. I think this is a fairly tragic event and is getting a fairly large amount of press coverage (e.g. not a slow news day story that was covered by some local newspaper only). If i were doing reserach on water intoxiaction and saw a blue link to <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Strange_64ed.html" title="Jennifer Strange">Jennifer Strange</a> as an example, i would most certianly follow it and read up on it, and what happened.

Say 20 people died from the radio stunt, does anyone truly believe then all 20 victims would deserve their own wikipedia page? The answer is obviously a resounding NO.

<li>You appear to argue that news reports should not count as an independent reliable source. If you are trying to say newsworthiness is irrelevant, then you should say so. As for whether human interest news reports are of a lesser quality than other types of news reports for setting notability, I would argue that is a distinction not present in WP:BIO altogether. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 00:03, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

Some have attempted to cite other death victimns in this debate, yet none have succeeded to cite one that was notable only for their deaths. e.g. one "keeper" cited Matthew Carrington (whose death lead to Matt's Law) and another cited the incongruant example the Columbine Killers (when a better parallel would've been the victims, only two of whom have wiki pages as books have been published with them as the subject). The keepers thusfar have not supported their case via passages from WP policies and guidelines, I suspect perhaps because there aren't any that would support keeping it.

<li>Cry strawman and red herring all you want, or whatever other high school debate foul, but it's rather clear Jennifer Strange is more notable than a common individual 9/11 victim, and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> does not dintinguish human interest news from other "more legitimate" news. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 23:57, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> (maybe) - I'm not a regular around here and I don't know all the policy details for whether or not to delete an article. The woman is notable (see the previous discussion on deletion and the mentions of Baumgartner in the media on the talk page) but I fear it will be difficult to write a high-quality article about her due to the lack of verifiable, credible sources. I wrote most of the text that is currently present in the article, and it was almost entirely based on the Cleveland Scene article (which apparantly is no longer online) - unfortunately, I couldn't find another source that didn't seem to be published by Baumgartner or her affiliates. <a href="../../../b/b/u/User%7EBbuda_0805.html" title="User:Bbuda">BB</a> 07:31, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The nominator omits to mention that the article also uses an article from the Cleveland Scene. There is also a fairly extensive list of news articles about her at <a href="../../../e/l/s/Talk%7EElsebeth_Baumgartner_9891.html#Notability_of_Mrs._Baumgartner" title="Talk:Elsebeth Baumgartner">Talk:Elsebeth Baumgartner#Notability of Mrs. Baumgartner</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The sources alluded to by GRBerry are generally unavailable for free online - you have to pay for archived news stories.

It is primarily a local news story and the article needs clean-up - I share the concerns that the "North County Gazette" is not a reliable source - but it appears to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.--<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i> 17:40, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

(I would not object to reformatting the quotation, and I doubt whether the available illustrations were GFDL) If the present amount of material is thought not enough to justify an article, there seems to be more available. Note that the article in GLT was written as a condemnation of the practice, which shows it is possible to discuss these subjects NPOV. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:39, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>First off, I'm confused and mildly annoyed you even mentioned censorship, because it's completely unrelated to the issue and isn't mentioned anywhere else on this page. As for the quotes you provided, I'm aware of them, because I wrote one of them. However, both quotes provided attest to notability, which teabagging is, but that's not enough. The word "vicariously" is also notable, and is used <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:en.wikipedia.org+vicariously&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:en.wikipedia.org+vicariously&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">3 times</a> as many places in Wikipedia as teabagging, that doesn't mean it's not a dicdef.

<li><b>Keep or transwiki</b> There's no question that the term is widely used so the only debate we should be having is to whether there is sufficient material for an article that goes beyond a dictionary definition.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is an encyclopedia article, largely because there have been a large number of (sourcable) controversies, including interviews with victims of "teabagging", and the effects it has had on their social lives, I seem to recall one overstated interview where two parents claimed a teabagging incident had turned their son into a recluse.

<dd>That's not quite what is needed here. As someone else has pointed out above, the sources need have to explicitly discuss the topic of space warfare in fiction, and more importantly the article has to be more or less be about what those sources have to say. The sources cannot be sprinkled in there to support what the Wikipedia article author has to say. That's the essential problem with OR in this article. To repeat the relevant excerpt from from <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> "Editors often make the mistake of thinking that if A is published by a reliable source, and B is published by a reliable source, then A and B can be joined together in an article in order to advance position C." Do you see what is meant here by Original Research here? An encyclopedic article has to document some notable bit of knowledge, and that knowledge has to exist prior to the article being written, otherwise it's just a collection of facts, and that's not what an encyclopedia is for. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 04:48, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> The topic of the article is fine, but unfortunately the article as written is entirely original research. It is not collating research by other published sources on warfare in space - rather it is the author giving his own analysis of how things might work using a few examples from fiction.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I prod -ed this over the holidays but people disputed it. I agree, there will never be any accurate standard for this list and like a few other philosophy lists, it ends up being filled with non-philosophy every 3-6 months and starts a revert war which usually the philosophers give up on in a few weeks, thus this list had a category of disputed materials... so a list, including things that should not be on the list. it should be deleted. it is also generally uncited, those materials that are cited do not have reliable, unbiased sources. The majority does not need cited if you stay in the history of western and eastern philosophies, but it is never those additions that become edit wars. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 13:44, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a useful list and it should be kept. I don't believe that the "importance" of a philosophical work is unverifiable, there are many renowned texts that have attempted to compile a list of the most important philosophical works. Take for example, the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Books_dfc4.html" title="Great Books">Great Books</a> series. The solution here is not to throw out the whole list, but to define a strict inclusion criteria that limits the list to important works and offers a way to verify them (e.g. identified as an important work of philosophy by multiple, notable philosophers and taught at multiple colleges and universities is a quick and unrefined example). <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 16:18, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> The nomination apparently ignored the warning on the deletion template that "the article must not be blanked, and this notice must not be removed, until the discussion is closed" Further, the nominator misunderstood WP:CITE, which reads "If it is doubtful but not harmful to the whole article, use the <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tag to ask for source verification, but remember to go back and remove the claim if no source is produced within a reasonable time; If it is doubtful and harmful, you should remove it from the article; you may want to move it to the talk page and ask for a source, unless you regard it is as very harmful or absurd, in which case it shouldn't be posted to a talk page either. Use your common sense." There is no provision for blanking a page that one thinks unsourced. To blank at all in face of a contentious issue seems inappropriate. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> (<a href="../../../d/g/g/User_talk%7EDGG_49c8.html" title="User talk:DGG">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DGG_009a.html" title="Special:Contributions/DGG">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>As for philosophy, to remove content &amp; then propose for debate does not show an objective attitude.

<li>Philosophical books with their own Wikipedia articles need only have sufficient sales to meet notability criteria. This has absolutely nothing to do with the importance as a work of philosophy. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_and_Philosophy%7E_The_D%27oh%21_of_Homer_d65d.html" title="The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer">The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer</a></i> would be eligible under such a criterion. This problem may be addressable by "a clearly highly reputable source" vouching for it, but there is nothing that establishes what "a clearly highly reputable source" is. That is, of course, unless you just mean anyone who is <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">relevantly credentialed</a> (i.e., has a Ph.D. in Philosophy), which makes it no restriction at all (<i>The Simpsons and Philosophy</i> meets this standard). <b><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes"><font color="#006400">Simões</font></a></b> (<font size="1"><sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimoes_e6ed.html" title="User talk:Simoes">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simoes_0c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simoes">contribs</a></sub></font>) 22:09, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with your first point, the presence of a wikipedia article is not in itself enough to justify inclusion in this list. As to your second point, the trick is to find a good inclusion criteria. We can set the bar very high by only including works that have been identified by multiple, notable sources as important to a particular branch of academic philosophy. We might even say that if there's any serious doubt about a particular publication's notability, don't include it. The point is that we can devise an inclusion criteria that will keep out the dreck. This page isn't the place to hammer out what that inclusion criteria should be, but if we agree that such a criteria is possible than we should keep the article. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 23:13, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If that were possible, I doubt this would be proposed for deletion. However, what has come to passis that there are minoritarian groups in philosophy who can dig up enough citations from minor works to claim the work is major or influential. Since there is no such thing as a negative citation, people cannot make the inverse argument, so we have cited verifiable sources of what amounts to highly dubious works. Then...we go look up the authors of these sources and it is usually a very small network of people, or the citation does not represent the claim, or related issues. Believe me, if the problems of philosophical inclusion were solvable, they would be solved, however on wikipedia a vocal minority can outweigh anyone, so unimportant works will always end up on lists of important works. This usually causes an edit war.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 14:17, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Lists are handy for users to see groupings, to inform their searchs, to link to articles. That is why they are here. It is one of the valuable advantages to an electronic encyclopedia.</li>
<li>The need for total perfection, or of absolute correctness of an extreme exclusionary approach doesn't serve well for lists or categories. It is in the articles themselves that we should be rigorous and critical. To go overboard on deleting entries from lists or categories is just an unnecessary kind of censorship.</li>
<li>Notability is a sufficient standard. Words like 'important' or 'major' should be avoided in criteria or titles.</li>
<li>Sources aren't needed where there is good will and there no objections to an entry. Where there is a request for a source, then it can be supplied or the entry dropped.</li>
<li>There are always people who think any list is too long. If it begins to grow to too large, break it into sub-sections.</li>

<dd>Common sense says to ignore wild calls to get rid of every page whose every entry can't be sourced beyond the objections of every editor - especially in contentious fields like politics and philosophy.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It would be easy to use verifiable criteria to decide who counts as a philosopher (covered in reliable philosophy survey texts as a philosopher, published a paper in a philosophy journal, etc. ) and what makes a book by a philosopher notable. Certainly these criteria should be narrow in scope and only include notable publications by philosophers. But with such criteria I think this would meet all the WP guidelines for lists, and so it would probably just get recreated in this form it were deleted. One caveat: the "mostly read by analytic/continental" part seems unverifiable (even in principle) to me; I think it should be removed. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 00:53, 18 January 2007 (UTC))

<li>There are criteria for what makes a book notable in general; the list could contain notable book by philosophers, with a verifiable definition of philosopher. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 01:01, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">Wikipedia:Notability (books)</a> is only a proposed guideline. And even if we go by it, philosophical books can be notable without being important to scholarly philosophy. The above-cited example of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_and_Philosophy%7E_The_D%27oh%21_of_Homer_d65d.html" title="The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer">The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer</a></i> is both notable as a well-selling book <i>and</i> is the work of multiple people who are indisputably philosophers (they hold academic appointments in university philosophy departments). <b><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes"><font color="#006400">Simões</font></a></b> (<font size="1"><sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimoes_e6ed.html" title="User talk:Simoes">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simoes_0c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simoes">contribs</a></sub></font>) 01:15, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>But there is still <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">WP:NOTABLE</a>, which says "a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself." That standard would be fine. If the book about the Simpsons actually <b>is</b> a notable philosophy book by notable philosophers, then its inclusion on a list of such books is no cause for alarm. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 01:39, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Comment: Here is the problem with getting rid of the list: Where else will users (which includes people new to philosophy) find a list of publications in philosophy by topic? A list of philosophers with their publications tagged on like baggage wouldn't work that way unless you relist each philosopher in each topic section they wrote for but just with the books appropriate to that section - not likely to happen. And one can always see a bibliography by philosopher by just going from a philosopher list to their article. I think the approach to reducing edit wars is not found by getting rid of all philosophy lists. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveWolfer_b631.html" title="User:SteveWolfer">SteveWolfer</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteveWolfer_562f.html" title="User talk:SteveWolfer">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SteveWolfer_6051.html" title="Special:Contributions/SteveWolfer">contribs</a>) 21:36, 22 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

The entries were simply definitions, and that’s not what Wikipedia is about. They've since been transwikied and I totally agree. These were some of my first wikis, and I regret the miscategorization. --hypercritic 19:45, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> (and wikify) or <b>Merge/Redirect</b> WP:NOT paper, and this is not indiscriminate: The play-by-play of an important CFB game is not random, it's very selective. My only concern with merging is it might make the 1987 Fiesta Bowl article too long. Further, this type of information, if sourced, is valuable as it could contain links of players involved. If cleaned up and put into a template system (to be developed, but on my/WP:CFB to-do list (not official)) it could be well presented and organized and perhaps merged onto the 1987 Fiesta Bowl article. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 13:36, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response to the keep voters.</b> I don't think there's a single other football article with play by play like this. If we keep this, we may as well create play by play for every Super Bowl and every other championship game that's ever been played. A summary of major events (mostly, the scoring) is entirely appropriate. A play by play with excruciating detail should be left off Wikipedia, and linked as an external link if one is available. I emphasize again, ask yourself, do you want every single football article to look like this? I don't. (YechielMan) 129.98.212.72 02:06, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>(I request YechielMan sign his/her post while logged in please.) Yes, I do think every game worthy of an article should have play by play as a part (or sub-part, listed on another page) of that article. For completeness of the subject (See <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">WP:FA</a> requirements, <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_criteria_6d12.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article criteria">Wikipedia:Featured article criteria</a>, specifically 1b) and as well as being a resource and complete encyclopedia. I do agree this needs cleanup, and this could be the precedent of whether the information should be on the main page or a "sub" page like this is acceptable. I think this AFD came before the system (ie, a template system and rules on how it should be done) is ready to handle the article in a proper manner. The information can be referenced and is valid information that contributes to the subject. I would content that a game that doesn't have a play by play couldn't even be considered a <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">good article</a>, but that may be extreme, since <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifth_Down_2737.html" title="Fifth Down">Fifth Down</a> made it without it, but it likely couldn't make it to A or FA without it. The drive play-by-play that leads up to the fifth down would be critical for exhaustive completeness. The entire play by play would be important for a reader to get the flow of the game and understand how the scoring and position put the team in the situations they had. Is there a game article that's a FA? As far as I know, Fifth Down is the first (CFB) game article to make at least GA. I'm not aware of NFL games really though. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 03:36, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response to (YechielMan) 129.98.212.72</b> - the answer is "Yes". In an ideal world, any game which we cover with its own article would be written in summary style and would include links to other articles with a high level of detail. That could include pages like this play-by-play summary, rosters, photo-galleries on commons, etc. There is no harm to this level of detail. It is completely within policy. What needs to happen is it needs to be wikified and cleaned-up. If the article survives AfD, I will volunteer to clean it up. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 05:47, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> After long deliberation, I can only come to this conclusion. The only reason this person is notable is over the PriceLine incident, which isn't all that notable to begin with.

At the time, I believed the article could be justified on the grounds that Kohn was a sufficiently interesting local character.

<p>Fails WP:BIO There's very little on google about this guy. And there's a group of articles, each supporting each other--his company (I suspect he is his company) and the two games he's written in almost 20 years. None of which are particularly notable, but I will wait and see what reaction is here before proposing deletion of the others. They seem to be vanity or advertising articles. <a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 12:54, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Trash is an award-winning RTS with an active user community and Chopper Commando remains one of the best and most important DOS games ever created. Sure, the article can be improved and I'll do so should the page be kept. IceCreamJonsey 03:07, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, but update references to be in-line</b> "Listcruft/fancruft" is not a valid reason for deletion. Note that finishers are an important part of professional wrestling as a sport; they are the signature move most identified with the individual wrestlers and often times serve to help define them. Listing them also allows readers to compare wrestlers who use similar finishers or, on occasion, share the same finisher. The article does appear to be referenced with four different external links to finishing moves as well. The only thing I see, therefore, is that it would be useful for verification purposes to provide inline footnote citations for each move pointing to a source that can verify the wrestler uses that move. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:06, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Soft Delete</b> This is a long list and has obviously been worked hard on. But my problem is it is repeating two things. The first being that every wrestler article already contains the information. The second is the actual move itself already has a page and is described on that page. This is less like a catalog and more like a list. The good note I can only think of is for those who are actually starting up wrestling can view this list and decide what kind of signature finisher not to do or what to do! <a href="../../../g/o/v/User%7EGovvy_b92c.html" title="User:Govvy">Govvy</a> 12:28, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Just to reply, the purpose the list serves is to reindex the information found in the wrestler articles. Let's say a reader wants to compare for historical purposes wrestlers that have used a particular move or type of move as a finishing move. It would be extremely difficult to figure out who did which move by simply perusing individual wrestler articles. By having this information in a list format, though, it provides a single source the reader can visit.</li>
<li>In fact, <i>all</i> list articles have redundant information with other articles. A list of movies or books or games or people will always be constructed using information found in the associated main articles. There are probably no lists on Wikipedia that use information not already found in the corresponding articles for individual entries. The point of lists, then, isn't to provide "new" information, but is rather to reorganize and summarize existing information in a form that is useful but not easily accessible by reading the individual articles themselves. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:00, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is a case of having two different ways of indexing the same information. One is to list all wrestling moves, and then next to each move list wrestlers that use it as a finisher. The other is to list all wrestlers, and list all the finishing moves that wrestler used. Note that it's possible for a reader to want to use either method to find information. For instance, they might be thinking of a few wrestlers they like and want to look at their moves in one article. It's also possible for a reader to be interested in a particular move and want to find people that might have used that move at some point. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:07, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure you understand my point here. I'm not debating the value of having a list of moves that identifies which wrestler uses them and wrestler pages that list their moves. What I'm doubting is the necessity of having a separate section devoted to finishing maneuvers when we already have lists of maneuvers under three other articles, and which could be merged with this one into one comprehensive article identifying the move, whether it's a hold/attack or throw, whether it's used as a finisher, and who uses it as a signature maneuver. Surely we should have one page devoted to maneuvers, not four? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatsnumbereleven_aa67.html" title="User:Batsnumbereleven">Batsnumbereleven</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatsnumbereleven_ca60.html" title="User talk:Batsnumbereleven">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Batsnumbereleven_0ccb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Batsnumbereleven">contribs</a>) 23:39, 18 January 2007 (UTC).</small> Oops, sorry, should have signed it! --<a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatsnumbereleven_aa67.html" title="User:Batsnumbereleven">Dave.</a> 23:40, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, ok, that's actually an interesting question. I think what we both seem to agree we should focus on is the question "What is the best way to organize information about wrestling moves for Wiki readers?" Splitting information between three or four articles has the disadvantage of making it harder for the editors to maintain, and also makes it possibly harder for readers to navigate. Consolodating the information into one or two pages makes it easier to find the pages, and avoids duplication of maintainence, but in the case of extremely large articles can make the articles unwieldy to read and use.
<dl>
<dd>Personally I think a good set up is to have one article that lists all wrestling moves sorted by type and then alphabetically by name. The move article probably would have to be split, though, into two subarticles since there are hundreds of moves, which might make that article too large. Then have a seperate list article that only lists the names of the moves sorted by wrestlers who use them as signature moves, possibly with a two or three word descriptive notatation, and links those moves to the main move article(s). I'm pretty sure this is similar to the set up we have now, but thinking from scratch that's probably how I'd set it up if I were doing it myself. It would allow readers to search for moves by name or by wrestler, but detailed information about the moves would be restricted to a single article and thus would be easier to maintain. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:18, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps some of the various I-don't-know-how-many millions of pro wrestling fans there are worldwide?

Most of the editors who have replied in that discussion on this section of policy agree that there is a common misconception on how broadly that part applies.

Of course, policy can change, and an article can fail to meet other standards like notability guidelines or verifiability.

<li><b>Keep</b> I cleaned up and rewrote removing junk. I also looked at his imdb entry (which I added to the article) he has 85 entires on different Howard Stern television shows.

<dd>Thanks for the cleanup, it looks much better. But I would still say that notability is questionable. His IMDB references are mostly the TV broadcast of Stern's radio show. And the articles just mention his name, they aren't about him. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenter4499_a7a0.html" title="User:Center4499">Center4499</a> 16:43, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mund works there, so he isn't a guest. And as for the imdb references, I think those assert notability. Being on the show is notable. Just look at the list of people who have been on the show. I also give the CNNMoney piece more weight. It is mainly about, and involves him. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 17:26, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I added two more references from CNNMoney regarding Mund being probed by the SEC, and the a profile of the show by MSNBC. So the references are there, and I have a feeling I could keep going. He is notable, the sources show it. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnightLago_716b.html" title="User:KnightLago">KnightLago</a> 17:40, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Strong keep he is part of the show, he had his own televised roast, revelation etc. He is head of security there and personal driver for Stern, but he is clearly notable based on the amount of air time he gets on the biggest radio show in the world, which is a lot. This also puts him to some extent into the radio performer category.

<p>I don't mean to disrespect the creator, but the idea of having *one* list for all cultural references ever shown on the Simpsons, is in my opinion not a good idea. Each episode must have at least five cultural referecens, so the list will quite simply get too long. It is a much better solution to add these to the episode articles. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMaitch_8373.html" title="User:Maitch">Maitch</a> 15:28, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Five? Fifty is closer. Each reference can be dealt with in its episode article.

<p>Two major concerns with this article:</p>
<ol>
<li>I feel that the subject cannot be considered inherently notable due to a limited range of success. In addition, there are not multiple nontrivial references. The onlineathens site is apparently the only non-personal source that actually links to any information at the moment (I'm assuming - I can't access it)</li>
<li>The current article was written over an already existing article on a fictional footballer, which several pages still link to. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERampart_9e21.html" title="User:Rampart">Rampart</a> 15:41, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If the consensus is that this rapper is not notable, then the article should be reverted to the version immediately prior to User:TommyValentine taking it upon himself to rewrite the page to be about himself (stating in the edit summary and on the talk page that he is the "best known" and "correct" Tommy Valentine) and the merits of the other Tommy considered separately, otherwise we'll essentially be losing two completely separate articles off the back of just one AfD. If the rapper is deemed notable then the article with this name should still be reverted and the rapper's article should be moved to a different name, say Tommy Valentine (rapper), as should have been done when it was first created. Hope all that made sense!!!! <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 11:16, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Smite</b> with great vengeance.

<dd>None of the qualify as independent or reliable unfortunately. The official website and myspace are obviously not independent, and link no.3 isn't working for me. The other site, from a brief perusal , appears to accept submissions from anyone and has only a cursory method of approval (it also says that the band are unsigned, which doesn't augur well). Most people will require better sources in order to&#160;!vote keep. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 23:12, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Metal-archives.com has a very hard criteria for bands, they check if the band exists, has records released and if it is metal. It is more than a reliable source, being the metal site with the biggest archive is notable to be mentioned. Anyway here you have more sources of this well-known band:</dd>

<li><b><s>Keep</s></b>. I respectfully disagree with Recury's assessment that the topic is well covered in the main article. Most of this article is encyclopedic IMHO. I would not call the disagreements minor, especially to Simpson Race Products. There was very much controversy over many months in my opinion (contrary to Dhartung's opinion). Keeping it in its own article serves to keep those ugly trivia sections out of Earnhardt's main article. Maybe it will help lessen the vandalism of that page too. This article can be refered to by the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Simpson_57c8.html" title="Bill Simpson">Bill Simpson</a> and the yet to be written Simpson Race Products articles.

<p>This actress has only two roles listed on IMDB. Admittedly, she was in the successful <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lilo_%26_Stitch_7025.html" title="Lilo &amp; Stitch">Lilo &amp; Stitch</a>, but that's her only major role (and she was a secondary character). The PROD was removed because "a google seac h seems like enough hit on her". She gets <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22alexandra+dreary%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22alexandra+dreary%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">five</a> results on Google. <i>One</i> of these is unique, the rest are clones of it. They all look like spam content. So I have my doubts as to whether or not this girl is notable enough to deserve an article. <font color="#000000">♠<a href="../../../p/m/c/User%7EPMC_03a4.html" title="User:PMC">P</a></font><a href="../../../p/m/c/User_talk%7EPMC_cf58.html" title="User talk:PMC"><font color="#FF00FF">M</font></a><font color="#000000"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Premeditated_Chaos_3dcc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Premeditated Chaos">C</a>♠</font> 16:54, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This was tagged as a speedy deletion candidate as an anonymous user with the reason that Nikki Craft is "non notable" and that everything in the article is self-referenced and not reliable, outside sources. This had a previous AFD at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Nikki_Craft_5ff0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nikki Craft">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nikki Craft</a> where there was no consensus.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Nikki Craft is a notable feminist anti-porn activist. She was probably better known in the 1980s and 1990s than she is today, but I still think she meets the criterion for notability. (Also, the person who nominated the article for speedy deletion was likely doing so in bad faith – this is an anonymous user who's done a string of hasty edits removing links to Nikki Craft's site, which in most cases amounted to removal of needed citations in various articles (I've reverted these edits.)) All that said, I do think there are serious problems with this article that need to be addressed. The article is maintained by someone who is an associate of Nikki Craft, some of the edits may have been made by Craft herself, and as a result there are real NPOV issues with the article. These problems need to be dealt with, but the article itself should stay. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 18:17, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Facts cited that have no source:
<ul>
<li>born 1949) is an American political activist, artist and writer who is known for her provocative and controversial approaches to societal problems and political situations.</li>
<li>She is also known for radical feminism</li>
<li>has been arrested 50 times for acts of civil disobedience. (Can we say that in a BLP with no cite?)</li>
<li>Her work has been recognized by numerous academics considered experts on civil disobedience including Marge Frantz. (Perhaps, but dubious as there is no record of any published books by the subject)</li>
<li>She is perhaps best known for researching and publicizing cases of nudists/naturists who have been arrested or convicted of pedophilia and child molestation.</li>

<li>
<dl>
<dd>In 1976 she altered a billboard by changing it from "Miss America" to "Myth America," an action covered in the Dallas Morning News and Parade magazine[1]. (however, te reference is Nikki Craft. No reference from the Dallas Morning News, or Parade Magazine can be uncovered.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The same year, Craft founded Women Armed for Self Protection (WASP), which advocated armed self-defense for women and retaliation against rapists by their victims</li>
<li>she wrote and recorded the Rape Song about Inez Garcia and Joan Little. (only reference is her web site again)</li>
<li>In 1976, Craft co-founded the Kitty Genovese Women's Project (KGWP) when she and another activist posed as sociology students under the pretense of doing a "statistical study on violent crimes" and obtained the names of every indicted sex offender in Dallas County from 1959 to 1975 (Can we say that she broke the law in a BLP, without a cite?)</li>
<li>On 8 March, International Women's Day, the group read the names over local community radio KCHU for 13 hours.[3]</li>
<li>In 1979, Craft helped organize the first Myth California Anti-Pageant in Santa Cruz, California. In 1980 Craft joined other pageant protesters and over the next nine years conducted other actions, including throwing raw meat on the stage and pouring the blood of raped women across a pageant entryway.</li>

<dd>I'll stop here, but there are at least 20 other statements uncited, or uncited except by the subjects web site.</dd>

<dd>I think most of these are true, even if not cited.

<dd>Of these numbers 1,2,3,4, and 11 are self-published. 5 I don't have a copy of at hand, but it appears to be a simple claim that craft is <i>in</i> a photgraph <i>in</i> an otherwise non-notable book. Number 6 I am unable to evaluate, as every repository I tried in universities on-line women's issues collections returned a 404. Numbers 7,8,9, and 10 do not relate to this person. Number 11 is a dubious one, as the claim in the article "An award-winning documentary called Miss or Myth examines these protests and Craft's role in starting them" is not supported by the link. It's a precis only, but a <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D91531F935A2575AC0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all" class="external text" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D91531F935A2575AC0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all" rel="nofollow">more complete</a> exposition on the film does not mention the subject of this article at all. Dhartung's links appear to show that there may be an article to be written on Craft, but this self-aggrandizing and reference-free work is not it. If I may quote myself from the previous deletion discussion, "This is a person who's made a lifetime out of getting publicity, let us recall, so as to not be used for the same end." Looking over the very long first debate, I see in-depth analysis of the sources provided, and identical conclusions that this had serious issues with verification and bias. There was a great deal of talk of cleaning it up and providing real sources, however this was not done. <b>Delete</b> without prejudice to a new, acurately sources sourced article, not written or "maintained" by anyone associated with Craft. In the event I (or anyone else) gets off thier arse and savagly trims back this article to a verifiable stub, wave a magic wand over that to become "keep."- <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> 06:37, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> If the article is biased, edit it. if there is no agreement over the edits, use dispute resolution. Doing as suggested above, deleting it and making a new one, is hardly likely to solve POV problems. Though I probably share the previous editor's opinion of the subject and her views, the suggestion above for a "new, accurately sourced article, not written or "maintained" by anyone associated with Craft. " is wholly against the principles of WP, and threats to delete material if the article is kept are wholly out of order. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:55, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b>: My personal experience has been one of battling any changes with a friend of the subject. Dispute resolution has not had any results, as no one responds to an RfC. I can't make even a minor change without a battle, much less delete and remove all unsourced statements, as is required. Regardless, the recommendation for deleting and starting over suggested by brenneman are not based on that. His rationale was that 1) The article has many occurences where there are no citations. Where there are citations, most of them rely on the subjects web site. A removal of all of the uncited and self-cited references would essentially leave an empty article. 2) In the previous discussion on AfD it survived on the premise that you suggest, that it would be rewritten. The diff<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nikki_Craft&amp;diff=101141405&amp;oldid=42114447" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nikki_Craft&amp;diff=101141405&amp;oldid=42114447" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> he offered shows that the changes from that time (mostly mine) are minor compared to the scope of work that needs to be done; And, in fact it has not been rewritten to meet Wikipedia standards. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 20:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is all been discussed before, as can be seen on both the discussion page of the list article as well as the discussion page of <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_tie.html" title="Bow tie">Bow tie</a>. I see no indication in this discussion so far that anyone here looked at any of those discussions. I initiated a discussion there to get a consensus on whether to put the list at the bottom of that article or in its own article in large part because the list is more extensive than, say, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monacle.html" title="Monacle">Monacle</a> or <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_hat.html" title="Top hat">Top hat</a>. Is there an objection to having articles on these subjects? Then nominate them all. If <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_tie.html" title="Bow tie">Bow tie</a> is justified, then a list is justified and the only question is whether to put it all on one page or separate it out for convenience and considerations of article size.
<dl>
<dd><b>unencyclopedic</b> — <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_tie.html" title="Bow tie">Bow tie</a> is not unencyclopedic, therefore the list isn't either. In fact, the list is closely linked to the <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_tie.html" title="Bow tie">Bow tie</a> article (see "trivial" below).</dd>
<dd><b>indiscriminate</b> — the list is meant to be made up of well-known people or fictional characters or other entities known for their bow ties. There is nothing indiscriminate about that. Please justify use of that word.</dd>
<dd><b>trivial</b> — evidently not to the many famous people on that list or the millions of bow tie wearers. Incidentally, when a man is thinking about wearing a bow tie or other prominent fashion accessory (top hat, monocle, french cuffs, cigarette holder) he thinks about what associations the tie has. A very important consideration in that regard is what well-known people are strongly associated with it, therefore the list is important.</dd>
<dd><b>unverified</b> — Cute. For every list on Wikipedia with a "verified" list, I can show you 1,000 without, and you all know it. The only verification I've ever seen on any list are the footnotes I've put on list items myself. Do you really want a footnote to confirm that Boo Boo the bear in the Hanna Barbera cartoon always wears a bow tie?</dd>

<ul>
<li>Here's how: Some people are known for wearing bow ties. It is a part of their public image. Which public figures wear bow ties affects how men (and maybe women) view the wearing of bow ties. They think about this kind of thing if they're thinking about wearing a bow tie or monocle (or whatever) regularly. Use a cigarette holder regularly and you're going to bring up images of FDR (if you're a man) or Holly Golightly if you're a woman. Associations with famous wearers is the kind of thing that almost automatically comes to mind when people see somebody with any relatively rare fashion accessory. It's inherently part of the subject of bow tie. The justification for having the list on a separate page from <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_tie.html" title="Bow tie">Bow tie</a> is simply because it's rather long. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 02:48, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, don't take my word for it. Take Joseph Epstein's <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=95000421" class="external text" title="http://www.opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=95000421" rel="nofollow">word for it</a>. Oh, I forgot, you guys don't indicate that you consider any other ideas before making condemnations. Here's a quote then (pay attention to the middle paragraph; emphasis added):<br />
In a long essay on American English usage in the current issue of Harper's, the novelist David Foster Wallace refers to linguistic pedants and their "snobbishness and bow-tied anality." Nicholson Baker, in "Double Fold," his recent book about the destruction of newspaper files in libraries, seems to have his villains neatly turned out in bow ties: A man named Verner Clapp is a "polymathic bowtie wearer," and the historian and former Librarian of Congress Daniel Boorstin is described as a "chronic bowtie wearer." As a terminal bow-tie wearer myself, what, I have to ask, is going on here?<br />
First, though, <i><b>let me organize a lineup of bow-tie wearers</b></i> to establish a variety. The most distinguished of all, of course, was Winston Churchill, whose favorite was a fine floppy blue job with white polka dots. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a tall man, often adds a giant butterfly to his getup, which gives his appearance a light and rakish air. Saul Bellow has taken to wearing bow ties late in life. Former Sen. Paul Simon is a habitual bow-tie wearer, though, oddly, he seems never to have learned to tie them properly, for the right side of his ties never quite make it to full bow form. For diversity's sake, it would be good to have an NFL linebacker instead of Louis Farrakhan to round off this roster, but Churchill, Moynihan, Bellow, Simon and Farrakhan (a clip-on man, I surmise) perhaps provide sufficient diversity in themselves.<br />
Is there something about bow-tie wearing that suggests temperament, point of view, gestalt, full-blown Weltanschauung? The bill of complaint against the bow-tie wearer includes, I believe, the following: He is overly precise, cold-blooded, unimaginative, pompous and, let us for good measure throw in, mean-spirited. That's a lot of negative qualities to attribute to a bit of colorful cloth tied around a fellow's neck, but there it is. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> (<a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENoroton_4514.html" title="User talk:Noroton">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Noroton_a85f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Noroton">contribs</a>).</small>

<dl>
<dd>The demographics of men who wear bow ties are changing, owners of bow tie companies say.</dd>
<dd>Bow ties are often thought of as an older man's fashion choice, but more and more younger men are turning to them thanks to some celebrities such as local NBC meteorologist Glenn "Hurricane" Schwartz, MSNBC talk show host and commentator Tucker Carlson and Eagles football star Dhani Jones. In fact, Jones, who's widely known for his unique fashion sense, has started a company to sell hand-crafted bow ties.</dd>
<dd>Jones' image, particularly in an Eagles-frenzied area such as the Lehigh Valley and Berks County, has had an impact on the bow tie business, says Greg Weitzenkorn, co-owner of Weitzenkorn's men's clothing store in Pottstown.</dd>
<dd>"We are not an ultra-traditional store," Weitzenkorn. says. "But we see bow ties coming on stronger in the mainstream."</dd>
<dd>Celebrity-wearers of the bow tie have certainly helped businesses.</dd>
<dd>Kirk Hinkley, owner of the Bow Tie Club, which sells bow ties on the Web, says his company got a big boost from Raj Bhatka, a young contestant on the second season of NBC's "The Apprentice."

I guess the greatest affirmation of my sartorial choice in regard to bow ties is related to my admiration for one of my favorite literary characters, who happens to be a lawyer. Atticus Finch, the heroic lawyer/father of To Kill a Mockingbird, wore a bow tie. I can’t think of a better character to emulate.<br />

<dd>Bow ties, once popular in earlier eras and again in the forties and fifties, are making a small but noticeable re-appearance as a fashionable item, [...] affluent professionals are adopting the wearing of bow ties for their ability to convey stature and enable the wearer to stand out from the crowd.</dd>
<dd>Cutone noted that there is ample evidence to support the uniqueness and stature of those who wear bow ties. In the past, famous bow tie wearers included Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill, Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud, in addition to many other notable figures.</dd>

<li>Titanium's comment is an excellent example of not bothering to even get the gist of the discussion, just voting in a hair-trigger way to delete. I was very clear about why I was including these examples and they had nothing to do with what Titanium says they are about. There's something deeply wrong with this process if the people who vote to delete don't listen to the people who actually care more about an article and have paid more attention to the subject. I've actually got something to say here and I see no evidence that more than a couple of people are actually listening, and I see no evidence that they are considering the point I'm making. This is not consensus, this is railroading. Does Titanium even have an argument? <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 21:25, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think that not being swayed by your arguments is an indication that they're being discarded. As silly as I think this is, I will try to explain the point once more and then be done with this. Most of the people/characters on this list are famous and wear bow ties. Few of them are famous for wearing bow ties. It's that difference which changes a list from encyclopaedic to arbitrary, almost a collection of trivia. I admire your perseverance in finding this articles, but, in my opinion, most of them would at best support the idea that bow ties are notable and encyclopaedic rather than the people who wear them. GassyGuy 21:45, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>GassyGuy, as you well know, I was objecting to seeing evidence in Titanium's post that he hadn't even bothered to read the discussion, at least not well enough to understand a simple point I repeated again and again. That indicates something other than disagreement and, I repeat, I've seen no evidence that anyone else has looked at my arguments (which may mean they have and simply choose not to respond — but it's pretty suspicious that I haven't gotten much else by way of response). You're simply repeating your previous point, which is to say that someone needs to be famous for wearing bow ties to be on the list. (See? I'm reading what you say and responding to it.) I'm saying that doesn't matter. What matters is that a lot of people apparently believe, because they say so in writing, that when people decide to wear a bow tie, that decision in part is made on what they think about others who wear them. I repeat, that's a justification for the list. If you don't think this reasoning is good enough to keep the list, please explain why. In any event, I've demonstrated that there is A REASON to keep the list, which some people here have indicated didn't exist. We have articles on the Tom and Jerry cartoon show and you can think of a thousand other articles with less reason to exist than the justification I've just given. So tell me what's wrong with my reason, please. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 22:28, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

The article cannot be said to be unverified because it's now one of the most verified articles on Wikipedia. It can't be said to be indiscriminate, although I now favor changing the name to <b>List of influential bow-tie wearers</b> or <b>List of notable bow-tie wearers</b> because there's no use in listing anyone unless they're well-known. The reasons why this article is encyclopedic and on a notable subject are now clear from the paragraphs at the top of the article and the first sentences in the next three sections.

<dd>This advice applies to all lists. An article should only be categorized using notable information included in the article itself. If the article never mentions that someone wore a necktie, then they shouldn't be included in this list. Requiring that the necktie be mentioned in the article implies that it should have been verified by an external published source, and it's unlikely that a publication would mention someone regularly wearing a necktie unless it was somehow a notable distinguishing feature (as opposed to the occasional tux wearer). <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 19:46, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you could make a case that it's <i>possible</i> someone could be notable for wearing a necktie in a signifcant way but not on a regular basis. Hypothetically, you could have someone that made a significant, notable impression by wearing a necktie at an unusual time or place, perhaps to make a statement of some sort. I think I can safely say, though, that the great majority of famous people who are associated with neckties wore them regularly. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:45, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're correct about the introductory paragraph being unreferenced. However, that would only require either cleaning up or deleting that first paragraph, not deleting the entire article.

<dd>Oh, on an interesting tangent, thanks for correcting the link to <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">Wikipedia:Five_pillars</a>. "Five pillars" does say, in one sentence, that "Wikipedia is not a trivia collection, a soapbox, a vanity publisher, an experiment in anarchy or democracy, or a web directory". Oddly, though, while the other terms of "soapbox" and "vanity publisher" are discussed in either policy or guidelines, the word "trivia" doesn't seem to appear in policies or guidelines (at least not that I can find). The only item that discusses "trivia" is an essay <a href="../../../t/r/i/Wikipedia%7ETrivia_16ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Trivia">Wikipedia:Trivia</a>, which doesn't yet have consensus (as would a guideline). Personally I wouldn't mind seeing an actual trivia guideline of some sort, since at the moment it is a vague, subjective term that gets introduced in cfd and afd discussions with little consensus on what is or isn't trivia. Probably would be a good topic for discussion, if I can figure out a good page to post a thread. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:39, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b>Let's go over Agent 86's objections:
<ol>
<li><b>Quite a matter of personal opinion whether or not someone makes this list</b> Well, no. The article name shouldn't be taken literally, and I think it should be changed. That's what the extensive discussion on the article's talk page is about. I think the list should be about famous people who are known for wearing bow ties — this is not a matter of personal opinion, particularly if editors insist on sourcing. "Famous" could be a matter of dispute, but not beyond the abilities of Wikipedians to figure out ("famous" people are known beyond their local community and outside of a particular profession or avocation; I would include famous people of the past who are no longer well known and anyone famous across their nation, such as the Estonian president and the Belgian politician; this isn't rocket science and the gray area is not so wide that we can't live with it and come to consensus on specific cases). If we want to include, for instance, university presidents on the list, then perhaps we should call it a "List of notable bow tie wearers", if not, then a "List of famous bow tie wearers". Bow tie wearing is either sourced to good sources or it's not. Almost everyone on that list is sourced, and if I didn't remove them from the list then I think they can eventually be sourced (Chippendale dancers, for instance: I haven't found an adequate source that says they are known for their bow ties — yet). Even without any of these changes, this is not an indiscriminate list, and that second paragraph you object to helps to avoid it being an indiscriminate list. Note that good sourcing very often mentions "signature bow tie", "trademark bow tie" and other phrases or facts that back up the assertion. Some of the sourcing could be better, I think, but give it time.</li>
<li><b>Original research</b> — here's the paragraph:</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well-known people who become associated in the public mind with wearing bow ties can have a powerful affect the popularity of this type of neckwear, according to numerous observers, including writers and bow-tie sellers. Bow tie wearing by well-known men is often noticed and commented upon, a phenomenon that differs from commonplace celebrity endorsements in that it includes historical figures, including some long-dead famous people, and the topic is often brought up by writers and observers with no financial interest in promoting bow ties.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It's an introductory paragraph (actually the second paragraph). It summarizes what's in the article and every statement in it is backed up by sourcing in the article. I can provide footnotes, but I thought the connection with the following paragraphs was obvious. Sentence 1 is backed up by the numerous statements taken from the Eastern Pennsylvania Business Journal and the Texas publication and ends with "according to ...". Sentence 2 is quite directly proven by every other source in the paragraphs before the listings start, involving no leaps of logic on my part. Please specify where you believe original research takes place. You might object to the use of the word "numerous" in the first sentence, and I could take that out, but I have no doubt I could eventually find enough articles to justify that word. Do you doubt it? Do you object to the word "powerful" in the first sentence? It seems to me that the sources back it up. Do you object to the word "often" used twice in the second sentence? In the first instance, the list footnotes offer pretty convincing evidence that it is "often"; in the second, ditto, although I might add "no <i>apparent</i> financial interest", but I think that's a little fussy.</dd>

<p>Quote from the article: <i>The Loyalist currently has no official candidates. The party officially started in November of 2006, and is attempting to have several candidates available for the 2008 election.</i> I was going to speedy delete it, but preferred to get some feedback, as it seems to have some hits at Google, but most are mixed with Northern Ireland's Loyalist party and nothing about this one. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 17:49, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Section justifying "notability" - WP:OR and Misrepresented Sources</b></p>

I don't know if this is right or wrong, but since this is supposed to be a discussion and not a simple vote, it seems wrong to just shove it onto the talk page without at least a link. No one of consequence 01:44, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</i></p>
Please read the articles WAS cited in the section "Used to Illustrate Legal Ethics and the Need for Reform" that WAS cited for this section he added to justify "notability".
<p>The sourced articles were not "Used to Illustrate Legal Ethics and the Need for Reform"!! Please read the talk page (and the articles cited as sources). This is WP:OR. Jance 18:38, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-notable subject. A previous article was speedy deleted as an attack article. This article was the end result, after an editor attempted to find references, and an administrator tried to help create a useful article. Unfortunately, this subject is just not notable outside Rochester, and some of his 'colorful' ads.</li>
<li>Lack of Reliable sources -- the sources are <i><b>not</b></i> <b>"Used to illustrate legal ethics and the need to reform"</b> misrepresents the sources cited. (See talk page to this nom, and to <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Shapiro_8a56.html" title="Jim Shapiro">Jim Shapiro</a>). <i>None</i> of the articles the author added supports the claim that Shapiro "illustrates" "legal ethics and the need for reform." I have outlined this on the talk page of the article. Quite simply, all of those references only mentioned Shapiro peripherally, if at all. More importantly, the only individual "using" Shaprio to "illustrate legal ethics and the need to reform" is WAS - certainly not any of the authors of the articles cited as sources. Therefore, this entire section is WP:OR. I don't know what WP tag can be used for complete misrepresentation of sources (is there one?).</li>
<li>So, ultimately, the only purpose of this article on Jim Shapiro, as the original author admitted, was that it was "funny". Jance 17:47, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I didn't see a "joke" in here nor anything all that "funny".

<li><b>Delete</b>. I wrote the biographical part of the current version of this article (minus the long section of cribbed-together-quotes on legal ethics and changes to the law) as an attempt at improving what was an absolute mess of an article that pretended to be a bio. In researching the article, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> were very hard to come by. There are a few articles on Factiva that complain about Shapiro's annoying commercials, a few about his suspension from practice and a few about him donating money to education. But nothing significant and unfortunately, I don't think there is enough verifiable material available to make a case for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notability</a>. Since I wrote the article, that situation does not seem to have changed. Unless someone else feels they can make a verifiable case for notability, I think the article should be deleted as a not notable bio, and preferably salted. <b>Sarah</b> 18:39, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b>"A few" articles is enough in the way of sources. If is he mentioned in general discussion of legal ethics he is notable.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 19:45, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b>. It seems to me that a content dispute (Jance may want to use {{<a href="../../../t/o/t/Template%7ETotallydisputed_3989.html" title="Template:Totallydisputed">totallydisputed</a>}} ...) that has not been resolved through channels is spilling over into AFD. Shapiro seems to turn up as an example in some national news stories about aggressive legal advertising practices, thin notability indeed, but potential to pass.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> WAS, if that's your goal, to illustrate legal ethics issues and legal reform, then please do this in an article under an appropriate title. To attempt to manipulate a biography on a living person into a dissertation on legal ethics is completely inappropriate. A biography on Jim Shapiro should be a rounded article about him and his life. It shouldn't be primarily about legal ethics with genuine biographical content playing second fiddle. You were told this back in August, but you don't seem to understand. What you are doing, by turning this into an article about ethical issues within the legal profession, but under the title of the name of a real man, is creating an attack article and a violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. <b>Sarah</b> 16:58, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Shapiro is <i>at best</i> only borderline notable and I might be inclined to say "weak keep" if WAS would allow it to be a biography, as it should be, and wasn't insisting on shifting it back to an attack page by pasting in long slabs of selective and misleading quotes one after the other from mostly dubious sources. This needs to be deleted under <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and re-salted. I might add that it was salted after the last AfD, but 2 days after it was closed (speedily) as an attack page, WAS created what amounted to another attack page masquerading as a bio and posted it at <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_J._Shapiro_19b0.html" title="James J. Shapiro">James J. Shapiro</a> to get around the AFD and salting. <b>Sarah</b> 13:54, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Agreed. It should be deleted and salted. <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_Ethics_acca.html" title="Legal Ethics">Legal Ethics</a> is an article itself, but could be expanded - for the US, and different countries. Advertising for both doctors and lawyers has changed. Shapiro was not a very relevant force in this, except possibly the NY bar (and I am not sure about that, based on one article). If something positive comes out of this, it would be to expand the ethics article. Advertising - on television and the internet - has been an issue in my state too, but not because of one lawyer. Jance 15:01, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Jim Shapiro and legal ethics has been created. It is <b>not</b> a "biography". See the talk page of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> for a discussion of the issues related to wikipedia articles named after living people that are not in fact "biographies". Wikipedia articles do not contain original research but instead only noteable sourced facts, thus many are not well rounded and not bios but encyclopedic nonetheless. Making them <i>look</i> like bios, as one editor noted, only makes things worse. Wikipedia definitely does not have all the bugs worked out in this regard. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 22:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So now you have duplicated your original (and misleading) article and called it something different? Are you serious? The sources you cite here and in the duplicate article do not support the content you wrote - whether it is called a WP:BIO or anything else. I admit this is over my head as far as WIkipedia knowledge, so I will appeal to others more experienced. However, I have to say you are insistent, and it seems clear that your interest is not in a neutral Wikipedia article. Jance 22:42, 17 January 2007 (UTC)Jance 22:37, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This is outrageous. This is a blatant attack; it is a biased, malicious attempt to disparage a living person. It doesn't matter if this new version is strictly a biography or not. BLP clearly states, "These principles also apply to biographical material about living persons in other articles." You must abide by BLP regardless of whether it is a biography and using Shapiro as the only example is giving undue weight to the POV you are pushing. You have also violated the terms of the GFDL. <b>Sarah</b> 23:13, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Article reverted back to Sarah's version of 16 November 2006</b> This removes the material that the objections are directed at.

<li><b>Keep</b>, regardless of content dispute the current version of the article seems sufficiently referenced to qualify for notability. BLP says irrelevant and poorly sourced negative information doesn't belong; it doesn't mean that a guy who's gotten nailed for scamming shouldn't have the truth told about him.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I see. So anyone of any profession who has ever been caught "scamming" or disciplined by his profession should have a WIkipedia article? WOW. I can think of some medical doctors who have lost their license or been disciplined, although that is the sole reason for their "notability". According to Night Guy's standards, that would be fine. Maybe I will do that. I would also appreciate if profanity was not used, when talking to me. Jance 00:52, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, shapiro did not receive major media attention. I just "googled" doctor malpractice and came up with Washington Post articles about one doctor, and articles on other doctors, as well. None of those doctors have articles in Wikipedia (well, one now does). I hope that something the absurdity of an article on one individual who has been disicplined will eventually get users' attention, but maybe it won't.

<li><b>Smash with hammer</b> I think the case cited against Shapiro (persuaded client to accept less than the insurance company was offering, has never tried a case) needs <i>more</i> awareness in Rochester; no one else should care. Relatively isolated cases of misconduct don't make one important enough for an encyclopedia. We had an ER doc here who was caught with child pron on his PC, time for an article about him? How about the chinese restaurant that was closed for 6 months for health violations? It was in the newspaper. How about the financial planner whose mismanagement screwed a bunch of Kodak employees out of their early retirement buyouts?. No one of consequence 01:19, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm just about to go back to my (attempted) break and I thought I should clarify my position because I seem to have confused some people. I don't believe the version I wrote is an attack article. I do think that Shapiro's notability is borderline and I find WAS's behaviour offensive. He seems to have an obsession with creating Shapiro attack pages, as evidenced by the various pages he's created in the namespace and his userspace. His attempts to justify it by characterising the article as "named after living [person] but not <i>really</i> [a] biography" is outrageous. This <i>is</i> a biography. There's no other way to define it and even if it's put under a different name, it's still covered by BLP. I am neutral on deleting my version of the article, but WAS's insistence on turning it into an attack page tips me over into the delete side of the debate. If this can be maintained as a general biography, free of WAS's attacks, my&#160;!vote is neutral. Otherwise, delete it, salt the earth and let's be done with it. Shapiro's notability isn't worth this much angst and this much arguing. <b>Sarah</b> 00:17, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: So is it neutral or delete? The original AfD was WAS's version. And I am not sure how one can deter anyone from turning it into a more disparaging article... I honestly don't know why this person is notable except for sleazy ads and that notability is local to his area. If major newspapers or radio stations picked it up and reported it, then I would say Shapiro is a notable subject. Otherwise, he is not. This article may not technically be an attack article per Wiki policy, I don't know. But it is clear that the original intent was as an attack article, which WAS abundantly demonstrated. After sanitation, the article is merely disparaging and there are a few actual sources (99% local). Is that the distinction? Jance 01:34, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia has a fairly long article on <a href="../../../c/a/l/Cal_Worthington_68e4.html" title="Cal Worthington">Cal Worthington</a>, a used car dealer who would be unrecognizable outside the airwaves of Southern California broadcast television. Regardless of whether Jim Shapiro is notable for other reasons, he's notable for the same reason as Worthington. There's even an article on <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelyne.html" title="Angelyne">Angelyne</a> the local billboard spammer whose billboards became such a regular feature of the SoCal landscape that the billboards got into several films (the billboards but not her - she appeared to have a wealthy patron and a desire to break into the entertainment business).

<dd>If Cal Worthington warrants an "encyclopedia" article, I suppose Shapiro does as well. I do not think either is notable. But maybe the Wikipedia standard is not, in actuality, what is posted in policy or what is typical of an encyclopedia. I concede and agree with Sarah - it isn't worth the ugliness. I still wonder about those who fought like hell to keep a marginal article - and this article is far more disparaging than either article Durova mentioned.

<li><b>Keep</b>. While some of this article might be a bit of a jib, this album is coming out. I'm close friends with Tomas and Sergio and the both told me. Obvioulsy Kearby mid-to-late afternoons isn't coming out in 20010. Tomas said around 2010. So I'd guess 2030 roughly. Everything else is pretty damn true.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- I agree with the above poster, although some details are obviously fake (the cover is, of course, not actually modelled by a dog in a bee costume), Keas Bees is a legitimate album and shouldn't be deleted simply because the editors think it's too bizzare to be true. Streetlight Manifesto has always been a unique band, and a concept album about the lives of bee breeders and treadmill salesmen should come as no surprise to their fans. They also have a history of not announcing their releases except through fan buzz (KNAPBSM, for example), which would be why information on the internet as of yet. However there was quite a buzz at their shows, everyone was really pumped when Tomas announced it here. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by IAMED 2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_IAMED_2_91f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/IAMED 2">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— IAMED 2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_IAMED_2_91f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/IAMED 2">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. At a recent BOTAR show Tomas did tell the crowd his grandpa once told him that his last wish was for Tomas to make an album about bee sellers, because he was a bee worker himself, and Tomas agreed.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Also, as an addendum to those below me (I wrote the one directly below this), you folks say there is no verifiability.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Tomas Kalnoky has only recently started to reveal details about the album, that's why references are lacking on the internet. As if any website would be a credible reference. On tours and interviews he has confirmed these things. I know lots of the people who helped write this article and they definitely know more about Streetlight than any of you ... so take our word for it. Plus, it has cover art. It's real.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. To be honest, the argument has several merits. Tomas has been known to be "eccentric" at times. He also is known for not publishing any information about his albums till right before their release. and the tracklist looks convincing based off the songs available on youtube that have been recorded from many streetlight shows. I have even attended one where i heard them playing "mercy me" The negatives really only seem to indicate that is is disbelief at the eccentricity of the article, and i don't believe that it should be removed based on that alone. It will probably need editing (the whole 20010 peice is obviously a 2010 typo) but perhaps we can leave it with the statement that the validity has been questioned and actually do some investigation instead of just saying how unlikely it is.12.226.120.192 00:19, 19 January 2007 (UTC) <small>— 12.226.120.192 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.226.120.192_5d5f.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.226.120.192">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

The only references that would even remotely pass <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, don't really say much other than vague statements that, well, at some point they'll put out an album, which could be said about a lot of bands.

<li>The summary of the deletion of the {{db-nonsense}} section specifically stated that the article was not nonsense (as I am in agreement to). It is not patent nonsense, this should be patently clear. The content contains essentially no useful information, but that is only because it is not notable, and is OR. As per section stated above, the article does not meet any proper criteria for Speedy Deletion. If people could just settle down and wait about five days, then the article will be removed. Also, the edit removing the speedy delete was not by the author, but by <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">User:Tonywalton</a>, who returned it to a Proposal for Deletion, on the grounds that it was not nonsense (which it is not), but it did qualify as a neologism. In looking into the issue, I found that the article meets at least one criterion for AfD, and thus, I took steps to mark it for AfD. In the process of investigating what criterion it meets, I did consider Speedy Deletion, and found no criteria suitable to list it as a Speedy Delete. Patience is usually considered a virtue. --<a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuellanivis_b7b1.html" title="User:Puellanivis">Puellanivis</a> 09:17, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, the tag was improperly removed by the author User:Darxer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pubology&amp;diff=101041544&amp;oldid=101041484" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pubology&amp;diff=101041544&amp;oldid=101041484" rel="nofollow">in this edit</a>. That is the earliest edit showing removal of {{db-nonsense}} in the edit history. At that point, the article certainly looked like patent nonsense to me, and likely would have been speedily deleted if the author had complied with the instructions in the tag. =<a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxlq_af18.html" title="User:Axlq">Axlq</a> 16:09, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I will accept that he did indeed remove the nonsense tag at the time in the edit that you indicated. The page how ever does not match either criterion of <a href="../../../p/n/_/WP%7EPN_ca1e.html" title="WP:PN">WP:PN</a>: "<b>Total nonsense - i.e. text or random characters that have no assignable meaning at all.</b>" (The article very obviously does not match this criterion, as it is grammatical English.) "<b>Content that, while apparently meaningful after a fashion, is so completely and irredeemably confused that no intelligent person can be expected to make any sense of it whatsoever.</b>" (The fact that we understand that this article is both OR and non-notable, this criterion is obviously not met, as many intelligent people are having no problem making sense of the article.) So, again, no the article does not match the criteria for patent nonsense; it does however match numerous AfD criteria which have been expressed above. Now, <b>please</b> can we stop arguing about what kind of delete this article deserves, and just work towards getting it deleted? On AfD criteria alone, we can have this removed. --<a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuellanivis_b7b1.html" title="User:Puellanivis">Puellanivis</a> 16:29, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

The question I asked myself was whether Jackiey Budden has done something which makes her notable. She is not notable merely for being the mother of a notable person. She is not notable for her appearance in a television series. She is not notable for appearing in the newspapers quite often. I cannot find any reason why she is notable.

<li>A statement such as "all Members of Parliament are considered notable" is about as absurd as someone claiming that all Big Brother contestants are. Something that I would not advocate myself. However, in line with people such as Makosi, Nikki Grahame and Jon Tickle all having their own pages due to having done other stuff outside of the Big Brother house, Jackiey should ALSO have her own webpage for exactly the same reasons. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriangle_e_0a5b.html" title="User:Triangle e">Triangle e</a> 00:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I would distinguish Jackiey Budden from the three examples you cite as they all have media careers developed independently after their appearance in Big Brother. Jackiey Budden has only a few scattered appearances on television before. If she becomes a more important personality, then we can reconsider, but based on what we know now, she is not notable for an entry in an encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 00:31, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Makosi has managed a (sort of) career in the media, though her article is far to large imho. It's not snobbery - if there was an article for everyone who had ever been on TV game shows, it would all get silly. I was on a TV quiz once, and had my pictures in a few papers because of being in quiz teams - I'm not notable though. btw- Triangle E - you seem to be the only one making a serious case for the article to stay- most of the Keep comments are yours. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrenwith_53e5.html" title="User:Trenwith">Trenwith</a> 17:32, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>1. Jackiey's media appearances are about as numerous and notable as Makosi's. 2. I am NOT advocating that every gameshow contestant should get their own wikipedia page, I am saying that THIS wikipedia page satisfies guidelines for notability. 3. The votes to keep this article are not predominantly mine - I made one vote to keep the article and the others were comments highlighting the ridiculous nature of the votes for deletion. 4. I wrote the original article way back when and have put a lot of effort into it - of course my case for it staying would be stronger than that of the others. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriangle_e_0a5b.html" title="User:Triangle e">Triangle e</a> 19:06, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Mild keep</b> It looks like she's been a contestant or notable guest on multiple reality shows. If she had only appeared on one show, I might suggest simply redirecting to that show. But as is we have someone that has appeared on multiple television series and no one article to place that information in. Maintaining this article seems to be the best way to preserve the information for anyone interested. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:26, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

Jade got famous on a UK Gameshow (<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_f5f8.html" title="Big Brother">Big Brother</a>). Jackiey is sort-of known because of the daughter and because she too, was on the same game show. The vast majority of people who are on that game show had their articles deleted and redirected to <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_f5f8.html" title="Big Brother">Big Brother</a> once they left, as apart from being on TV, they had achieved nothing of note.

<li>Although I am unable to speak for him personally, with all the edits that AnemoneProj has done to the Big Brother pages over the last few series, I can assure you that he is very familiar with the subkect matter. Since I have been following how wikipedia operates with regards to BB - the articles for each individual contestant were redirected to the BB page straight away and were only given their OWN pages if they did something notable outside the house - something that Jackiey has already done. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriangle_e_0a5b.html" title="User:Triangle e">Triangle e</a> 19:06, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No. We decide what information is <i>verifiable</i> through the use of external sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> GOAM is not dependent upon the listed schools, if that's what you meant by "non-notable." GOAM is an independently functional organization that only utilizes the priviliges provided by the schools to help further publicize itself. Once they have accomplished their goals with the schools, they will no longer have any use for them and will discard all remaining business with them. You see, GOAM has a very strong will and motivation to become something much greater and renowned than simply a club or clan, I speak of it as an organization because, essentially, that is what it is. It involves people from various parts of the globe, which I'm sure is not much of a surprise as an online clan, and various people of all ages, both genders, and all ethnicities. I don't say that GOAM will "probably" become something greater, I say that it will. Because of their driving motivation and progress, I am assured, and you should be as well, that GOAM will become a larger, much more renowned organization.

<p>Nominating this for deletion as it is a gallery of fair-use images, which may not be covered by <a href="http://www.navy.gov.au/copyright.html" class="external text" title="http://www.navy.gov.au/copyright.html" rel="nofollow">Royal Australian Navy copyright</a> or the {{<a href="../../../s/y/m/Template%7ESymbol_47c0.html" title="Template:Symbol">symbol</a>}} image tag use to justify most of the images in this article. There is little chance of expanding many of these out with encyclopedic commentary, as these images are being used to represent the ships and divisions; the crests themselves are not the subject of this article.</p>
<p>The main reason I can see for keeping this is so that we have access to all the crests, but I believe that such a taks is better handled by <a href="http://www.navy.gov.au/downloads/badges/shipbadges.html" class="external text" title="http://www.navy.gov.au/downloads/badges/shipbadges.html" rel="nofollow">the navy itself</a>. Also, I have spent the past few weeks adding these images to the articles on the various ships/organisations (or to the appropriate disambiguation page if such articles do not exist: see <a href="../../../h/m/a/HMAS_Bunbury_04d8.html" title="HMAS Bunbury">HMAS Bunbury</a>). I will state that not <i>all</i> images have found a home elsewhere, as I cannot find an appropriate location for some in the "Commands", "Force Element Groups" and "Other Badges" sections. For organisational purposes, I set up a visual category at <a href="../../../r/o/y/Category%7ERoyal_Australian_Navy_badges_32cf.html" title="Category:Royal Australian Navy badges">Category:Royal Australian Navy badges</a>. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 21:55, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete, and if necessary create an article about the story</b> Appears to be a description of something from a story of the same name (Lucifer’s Mirror, the novel by J.J. San Martín. ISBN 142510191). I don't know anything about this work of fiction, but <i>if</i> it is notable enough for its own Wiki article then I'd suggest doing that instead and merging this article's information into it.

<p>I find it hard to believe that even unknown, non-iconic songs merit their own articles. Furthermore, this song was not released on an album and seems only to be circulating around the murky reaches of the internet. Only about 7,000 google hits, many are myspace pages or wikipedia mirrors. No evidence that this song is particularly notable; nothing about the song, even its existence, can be comfortably verified per wikipedia policy at this time.

I don't have an opinion either way on the merit of the article, but if there's already an AfD up, just let it run its course — speedy deletions are best when there's no debate whatsoever on whether an article belongs, and <i>somebody</i> must've thought enough of it to remove the prod.

<li><b>Comment</b> Wrong, <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a> has no foundation in policy, nor is it even a guideline. Its just an essay written by an extremely small handful of people. Bobix makes a reasonable argument to keep, which is backed up by a LexisNexis search which shows 76 articles written about this mall <i>in the last two years alone</i>. <a href="../../../r/f/e/User%7ERFerreira_c585.html" title="User:RFerreira">RFerreira</a> 10:48, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> First, I was responding to Alkivar, so Bobix has little to do with it. As to sources-great, if there are some <i>nontrivial</i> mentions, add away, and I'll happily consider changing my position! However, in my experience, most of the time these "tons of sources" regarding malls are reprinted press releases, construction timetables, or reports about events which happened or are slated to happen at the mall-trivial mentions. As to <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a>, it most certainly has a foundation in the notability guidelines. Why? Because <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> says <i>one and only one</i> thing satisfies notability-and "something else like it is here" is not that thing. It would be entirely possible for one large mall to meet the notability standards and another to fail to do so, even if they're generally relatively similar. Of course, if someone has found multiple <i>non-trivial</i> reliable source mentions, they should be added to the article at once, so we can settle this whole thing! <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 10:57, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Several things. First, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is a guideline, not a policy. Second, there are multiple <i>"non-trivial"</i> articles about this mall; feel free to verify this for yourself on LexisNexis if you would like. Then again, <i>non-trivial</i> is a subjective term, but I hold the position that a good portion of these are indeed notable and non-passing mentions of the mall. Third, Alkivar's point is valid; if we are to cover a minor Canadian street performer, I would expect an equal amount of interest in a neighboring mall — this interest is confirmed by the 76 odd articles about the mall. Feel free to disagree. <a href="../../../r/f/e/User%7ERFerreira_c585.html" title="User:RFerreira">RFerreira</a> 11:08, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In practice, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is very widely followed, even to the point of being an integral part of the speedy deletion policy, so the "it's just a guideline" bit holds little water. I see four articles cited within the article, not seventy-six. One of those is about UPS, one of those is about produce, and two of them are about controversy over older drivers. I presume they mention the mall somehow, but from their titles, they certainly are not <i>about</i> the mall. I don't currently have Lexis-Nexis access, but I'm able to find plenty of stories just on Google News. Unfortunately, they're the exact types of stories I discussed previously-they're not <i>about</i> the mall. They're about events in or near the mall, and just mention it in passing as the place where something happened or will happen. Trivial mentions, certainly nothing a comprehensive article could be written from. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 00:10, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Given that <i>you have never even read the source articles in question</i>, the closing administrator may safely disregard your illinformed commentary. The third-party sources which have been cited thus far are perfectly relevant. The first compares the differences in size between the UPS headquarters and the Burlington Mall, and serves as a reference for the square footage of the mall; make a note of the context in which the cite is used. The second is a reference about the Burlington Mall Farmers' Market, and the last two are about a death that occured at the mall. More will be added as time permits, as there are plenty to choose from. <a href="../../../r/f/e/User%7ERFerreira_c585.html" title="User:RFerreira">RFerreira</a> 04:28, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've not read them, granted, but they're exactly what I figured they'd be. One is a single fact about that mall (and that one could easily enough be verified through primary sources). That's hardly enough to write a paragraph, let alone an article, and is a trivial "mention in passing". The second is about a store at the mall, not about the mall itself-the mall is simply "where it is", a mention in passing. Finally, the third is about an event at the mall-the article is primarily about the <i>death</i>, the mall is just where it "happened to happen". Again, a trivial mention. What kind of article is possible from these sources? "Burlington Mall is X square feet large, it has a farmer's market, and someone died there once?" <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 04:49, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Excuse me if I find it notable that this mall was once the largest business center in the metro area, according to one of these so-called "trivial" sources you've never laid eyes on. &#160;;-) <a href="../../../r/f/e/User%7ERFerreira_c585.html" title="User:RFerreira">RFerreira</a> 04:54, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Subject is not notable. He does not meet the criteria of notability for Wikipedia. The two sentences which claim notoriety are unsourced. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetuser500_3903.html" title="User:Netuser500">Netuser500</a> 15:28, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> He appears to be notable in his field (that field being conspiracy theorists). You may (or may not) consider him to be a nut-job, but that doesn't make him non-notable. Important nut-jobs are notable. He gets 43,000 google hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=Kenn+Thomas+conspiracy&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=nw" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=Kenn+Thomas+conspiracy&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=nw" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>, which for some things isn't much but for a conspiracy theorist seems like a lot. A lot of those hits are on Amazon and such advertising his book and his magazine; but some like this <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/GetTimeZone.aspx?redirect=/Gorightly" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/GetTimeZone.aspx?redirect=/Gorightly" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> are interviews that he's given on various topics. The article is unsourced and that needs to be fixed, but just a cusory google search leads me to think he is notable and should be kept. ~ <i><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="color:#0cc">ONUnicorn</span></a></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup><small><a href="../../../p/%26/s/WP%7EP%26S_1d27.html" title="WP:P&amp;S">problem solving</a></small> 16:31, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>KEEP:</b> He has written several books from several publishers, none of which are <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_press.html" title="Vanity press">vanity presses</a>, contributed to books by other authors, publishes a magazine, writes for other magazines (including <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortean_Times_295c.html" title="Fortean Times">Fortean Times</a></i>), makes occasional appearances on AM and Internet radio as well as broadcast television, and lectures both in the United States and Europe on a frequent basis -- and he is not a "nut-job" (whatever that phrase may mean to you), but a serious, sober researcher. -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidkevin_1642.html" title="User:Davidkevin">Davidkevin</a> 19:40, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The criteria for <i>notable</i> is whether there are things published <i>about</i> him, <b>not</b> whether he has published his own works. I've quoted the criteria for authors in my remark above. Serious researchers usually have PhDs and experience as hired <i>researchers</i> at one or more universities. There are more than 1.4 million Google hits for "Anthony French" who is a notable professor. Mr. Thomas does not seem to me to meet any criteria of <i>notable.</i> BTW, I don't believe you should have removed my earlier signature from this page. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetuser500_3903.html" title="User:Netuser500">Netuser500</a> 20:03, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mr. Thomas has professional research qualifications through his "day job" as an archivist at the Western Historical Manuscripts Collection in the Thomas Jefferson Library at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Missouri_dceb.html" title="University of Missouri">University of Missouri</a> at St. Louis, which I mention only to show those qualifications, with no endorsement by the university of his opinions or conclusions implied.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Without meaning to get overly personal, I have to confess that I wonder if this possibly has to do with you're not personally being familiar with Mr. Thomas' work? I've never heard of Anthony French, but I wouldn't make a similar claim for that reason as I don't know everything or everybody in every field. However, I do know that in his field, Mr. Thomas is regarded as a rigorous scholar.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As far as "notable", while it isn't academic, he has been a guest on the nationally-syndicated <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Bell_b332.html" title="Art Bell">Art Bell</a> radio program at least twice that I'm personally aware, as well as on nationally-cablecast television and smaller-market radio programs. He writes regularly for the <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortean_Times_295c.html" title="Fortean Times">Fortean Times</a></i>, an internationally-published magazine about which there is a Wikipedia article, and lectures across the United States and in Europe.

<dd>I haven't done any particular searches on what other people think or say about him -- I never knew it was a requirement in order to write or edit an article about a person who is prominent in his field, even if that field tends to be beneath the notice of the mainstream press.

<dd>I see what I wrote is ambiguous. I am not accusing Mr. Thomas of using a vanity press. I am saying that to be notable, other people must have written about him. How many biographies of Mr. Thomas are available at your local library? A separate criterion for notability is the winning of awards for his works. Another is multiple independent reviews of his works. He fails all of these criteria. As for "professional research qualifications," he is not a professor who performs research for his university. He is an archivist, and his job has nothing whatsoever to do with the topics in his published work.</dd>

<dd>Here's another official criterion "If the individual is more well known and more published than an average college professor (based on the U.S. practice of calling all full-time academics professors), they can and should be included."

<dd>. . . Some folks on the political margins are feeling more maligned than usual these days. "When people talk about conspiracy theorists since Oklahoma City, they're talking about these militia types," says Kenn Thomas, editor and publisher of Steamshovel Press, a small St. Louis magazine. But there are many kinds of political paranoia. "We may all be nuts," Thomas says, "but we're not all the same nuts."</dd>
