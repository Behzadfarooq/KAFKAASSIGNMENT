<p>This is a non-notable series of matches that began on Smackdown this week and will end on Smackdown next week.

<li><b>Mild Keep</b> Just to reply, I should point out that I read the discussion and it was not "unanimous" as implied by the nominator. At least one person seemed to disagree, and only three or four people commented. Second, I'll point out that I'm not sure there's a big distinction between tournaments on Smackdown and individual episodes of other television series. How are the Smackdown tournament episodes any less notable than the the episode <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blind_Bandit_8123.html" title="The Blind Bandit">The Blind Bandit</a> of the series <a href="../../../t/h/e/Avatar%7E_The_Last_Airbender_dca9.html" title="Avatar: The Last Airbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>, or the episode <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motivation_%28episode%29.html" title="Motivation (episode)">Motivation (episode)</a> in <a href="../../../i/_/p/Category%7EI_Pity_the_Fool_episodes_1c5e.html" title="Category:I Pity the Fool episodes">Category:I Pity the Fool episodes</a>, both of which have articles? Basically, if being an episode of a major television series is notable enough to allow that episode to have an article, then why aren't multi-week tournaments on Smackdown or RAW or TNA:Impact likewise notable enough to have articles? Basically these are the equivalent of episodes. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:51, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Who disagreed? It was, and still is, unanimous. If you were talking about Govvy, he disagreed that it had been done on Raw before, but he still agreed that this article didn't deserve to exist. -- <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">The</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">Hyb</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">rid</font></a></b> 22:06, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ah, I stand corrected on Govy's point. Still, that leaves the rest of what I said unaddressed. Namely a) that there doesn't seem to be a fundamental difference between this tournament and an episode or episodes of a television series; and b) that the "unanimous" consent of WP:PW consisted of exactly three editors (Paulley, Hybrid, Govvy). I didn't post there, but obviously I would have posted the same comments there as I did here. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:13, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Episode lists and synopses of wrestling episodes have been deleted as unencyclopedic. And yes, I chose to skip over the fact that only three people voted. However, that still leaves the rest of my nomination unaddressed. -- <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">The</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">Hyb</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">rid</font></a></b> 22:50, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Addressing your nomination, "Cruft" is not a reason for deletion. As far as notability, I gave examples above of a couple of other television series I pulled out of the air that are <i>less</i> notable in terms of viewership than Smackdown episodes but which are apparently considered notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia. So again, to rephrase, my question comes down to this - why are Smackdown episode articles held to a different standard than either reality television episode articles or less popular scripted television episode articles? If Smackdown is at least as popular, if not more, than other shows that have complete articles about every episode, then why shouldn't there likewise be articles about main Smackdown episodes or story arcs? <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:28, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I wasn't saying that cruft was a reason for deletion; I was simply driving home the non-notability point. Anyway, there are precedents for deleting synopses of wrestling episodes. They are held to a different standard due to the quantity of them <i>in my opinion</i>. Raw has over 700 episodes, and Smackdown has been going on for a long time now. A summary of every episode is an incredibly large amount of articles to have on any subject. For comparison, more than double the total number of articles on the infamous Pokémon. -- <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">The</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">Hyb</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">rid</font></a></b> 23:36, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are definitely correct that there are many more episodes in a season of Smackdown or RAW than a typical television, because the shows air once a week every week with no repeats. However, storylines and multi-episode tournaments such as this one take multiple weeks to resolve, so the total number of story- or tourny-related articles wouldn't be any greater than the number of episodes for a scripted series or reality show.</dd>
<dd>In fact, though, this brings up a broader question about how to organize pro-wrestling television show articles in general. Let's assume for the moment that we don't want to include specific articles for individual wrestling show episodes due to the sheer number of episodes involved. What if you were to compact that information into, say, multi-week storyline specific articles (like this one) or month-by-month synopsis timeline articles for a series? Doing that would reduce the number of articles to a more manageable 10-20 articles per year per show.</dd>
<dd>Since it's looking to me like I'm getting into the realm of broader overall discussion of wrestling show articles in general, I'll leave this particular afd nomination up to consensus and instead pose the above questions over at WP:PW. Who knows, maybe in the broader review it'll turn out that there is a way to present episodic-style information about wrestling in a compact enough form to be managable? <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:53, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Wait and See.</b> I think the nomination for deletion was far too quick as the significance of the tournament has yet to ultimately be revealed. Even now (as the second set of matches is over and Kennedy is the victor), the sprint may be incorporated into a major plotline. The creation of this page may have been hasty, but at least have the decency to wait and see how it all plays out before you destroy it. Even in the very long term, this may be a multi-year thing. How long does a tournament have to go on, or how many times does it have to happen for it to be significant? Aren't all PPVs fancruft, since realistically a title COULD (and has) changed hands at any time, feuds could (and have) been resolved without a PPV, and DVDs also highlight normal matches? I disagree with fancruft. I agree with the fact of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_match_types.html#Beat_the_Clock_match" title="Professional wrestling match types">Beat the Clock match article</a>. I agree partially with the point of less significant episodes in a series, but disagree as well because professional wrestling really bears more a comparison to a soap opera, as there are no repeats, multiple feuds, and people that should be dead after getting hit with something aren't. Just <i><b>WAIT</b></i>... the article doesn't have that much size to it (yet) anyway, so wikipedia won't be bogged down terribly if this isn't deleted immediately.
