<p>Kaye Lazar is probably not notable enough for this encyclopedia right now. He is public access talent in Richmond, Virginia. An article about his associate, "Gorgeous George", has already been deleted. --<a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakeel_bd6a.html" title="User:Takeel">Takeel</a> 18:03, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - cable access television show host. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 22:26, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep This Entry</b> - more than a cable access television host due to a vocal and obsessive international following. RGTraynor is absolutely correct about IMDB not listing Lazar's uncredited role, although Lazar is very clearly visible in the film itself as one of the jurors and his participation in the film is well known among viewers of his show. Lazar's other film acting work consists only of dozens of short films shot by local Virginia filmmakers, none of which would merit IMDB's attention. <b>Here's the thing</b>, though: Lazar and his partner attract attention worldwide despite being on a local Virginia television show due to heavy internet traffic in clips and countless discussions in blogs, which is why I believe Lazar is noteworthy enough to rate a brief Wikipedia article (someone surfing the net might see so many references to Lazar in blogs that he might turn to Wikipedia to find out who this is: I'd bet my life this is happening). Lazar has even been animated into a cartoon video by some German fans (and it's quite funny). The reason Lazar's partner's entry in Wikipedia was removed was not because of lack of interest but because of <b>too much</b> of the wrong kind of interest: repeated vandalism of the site. Lazar's entry, however, hasn't suffered that fate, and I think that his international following merits an entry for Lazar, particularly since Wikipedia literally can't have a site for his partner. If the attention garnered by Lazar's television work were limited to Virginia, I'd say delete the article, but Lazar and his partner have a surreally vocal following in Europe, which I think makes the difference and makes Lazar's entry well worth keeping. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStoryliner_f8c1.html" title="User:Storyliner">Storyliner</a> 23:28, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Unfortunately, the assertion that this fellow has a vocal international following or "countless" discussion in blogs falls pretty flat when you only have 23 Google hits for him, the assertion that his role in that film was genuinely important bucks against that the IMDB entry lists about a dozen uncredited actors, none of whom are Lazar. If you can't satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, then no statement can be made. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:29, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: I never said that Lazar's role in the film was important, it's an uncredited nonspeaking role (the very definition of unimportance), I only pointed out that he certainly is in the film and quite clearly visible; it's germane only in that Lazar occasionally discusses the experience on his show. What I do think is noteworthy, however, is the sheer <b>multiplicity</b> of blog references to Lazar in both Europe and the United States, as well as the animation I mentioned. Perhaps part of the purpose of Wikipedia, in the current digital environment, is to provide an online reference for people to look up a television entertainer if they keep seeing that person repeatedly referred to in many blogs and online video clips being posted across the world.<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStoryliner_f8c1.html" title="User:Storyliner">Storyliner</a> 20:42, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>DON'T DELETE---It's the internet, stupid! one blogged entry on ask.com or google is as reliable as your best friend's band's website or ex-girlfriend's list of recent dates with all their negatives! cyberspace is ethereal...and that's just about how much of it is verifiable. Thus, Kaye Lazar is no better or worse than any other performer with a limited number of listings. This is reminiscient before I got tenure, when I had to go to the dean and present to him all the books I wrote. Even though, the faculty was impressed with the stack and my photo on the back cover, they had no intention of ever reading my books. Let Kaye Lazar's entry remain on Wikipedia.---nospeedlimit</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - If I understand the argument correctly, you beleive that nothing on the Internet is reliable so this means that the entry for Kaye Lazar should be kept since verifiability shouldn't be a concern. That's not consistent with with wikipedia policy of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 20:09, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
