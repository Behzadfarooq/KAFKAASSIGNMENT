<li><b>Comment</b> OK, sorry. I wasn't happy about the earlier incarnation, and had made the following comments: <i>The concept is not new, but the name seems to be a neologism. Computer science guys have versions of this, with lots of different NaN's. I am certain I heard of the thing in grade school, but don't know what name it was given then. I take Φ to be a <a href="../../../n/i/m/Nimber.html" title="Nimber">nimber</a>, namely <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conway%27s_star.html" title="Conway's star">Conway's star</a>. (Just in case its not obvious why Φ is star, refer to Conway's book, wherein division is defined through an axiomatic system for numbers and games, and zero divided by zero is indeterminate, its star. Among other things, you'll find a proof that star is greater than -1 but less than +1 and is incomparable to everything in between. I would prefer that such concepts be treated in terms of the sound, well-developed, commonly accepted axiomatic footing, rather than invented from scratch, on a whim). I'm not convinced there is a need for the current article, it seems awfully simplisitic. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 15:59, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</i> To which I add: Conway is a world-class mathematician, nimbers and the entire panalopy have been researched in detail for many decades (or centuries? dating back to <a href="../../../d/e/d/Dedekind_cut.html" title="Dedekind cut">Dedekind cuts</a> and Cantor??). Anderson seems happy to promote a neologism on BBC, and that strikes me as the worst sort of mathematical illiteracy. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 19:58, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><s>The axioms for arithmetic, incl. division, are in "On Numbers an Games", at the very begining. The axioms are straightforward, and generate the smallest possible games. So <img class='tex' src="../../../math/0/3/7/03716dc5ee49a35673859c892f8e6fcf.png" alt="\pm \infty" /> would be born on day <span class="texhtml">ω</span>, and clearly, that's wrong, whereas * would be born on day one, which sounds about right to me.

<ul>
<li>Can someone please explain what is wrong with "nullity"? If this is major front page news, maybe it is notable, and maybe it should have an article? I'll admit, I came here because I read the BBC article, which didn't do a good job of explaining nullity, so I came to Wikipedia to find out more, and just found this. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 19:56, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: what’s wrong with nullity is exactly what’s wrong with mainstream news sources dealing with science: they usually hardly know anything about what’s at stake. Until a panel of specialists have peer reviewed the new theory/tool/proof/etc., Wikipedia should not talk about it (we can however talk about the buzz going around it). I understand it’s nice to come to Wikipedia and find an analysis of that “new” tool, but as of now it’s original research. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Hocevar_dccf.html" title="User:Sam Hocevar">Sam Hocevar</a> 20:03, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So in other words <i>nullity</i> is just this thing made up by an elementary school math teacher, and doesn't have any real publications in the mathematical literature that proves it to be more than just a made-up name? --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 20:04, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li>Unless there are other unlinked sources, this doesn't seem likely to be "major front page news". Although the BBC can carry a lot of weight, the linked article in this case is a minor <i>local</i> news story (in fact it's not even branded as "news", but "people"), and is more about the reactions of the kids at a local school than the shattering importance of the theory. --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcGeddon_9720.html" title="User:McGeddon">McGeddon</a> 20:48, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The problem, as I see it, is that its a shallow reinvention of well-known concepts in mathematics (see above), a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>, that fails to advance the state of human knowledge, and demonstrates ignorance of mathematics on the part of the inventor. If this was the re-invention of some mind-boggling difficult concept, I would have no complaint. However, this idea appears to lame and shallow, something that eager teenagers dream up by the dozen in grade-school algebra. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 20:07, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: in this <a href="http://www.bookofparagon.com/Mathematics/SPIE.2002.Perspex.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.bookofparagon.com/Mathematics/SPIE.2002.Perspex.pdf" rel="nofollow">article</a> on the perspex machine the concept of nullality has a bit more relavance. In it Anderson considers spaces of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homogeneous_coordinates.html" title="Homogeneous coordinates">homogeneous coordinates</a>, (x,y,z,w) which have the equivilence relation (x,y,z,w) ~ (x/w,y/w,z/w,1) to complete the set of posible coordinates there is a need to represent the number (0,0,0,0) (typically not included in homogeneous coords, but might have a use in his specific application). Taken as specific element in this set it actually has a subitily different meaning to just dividing 0/0 in the reals. So its technically different to NaN or <a href="../../../n/i/m/Nimber.html" title="Nimber">nimber</a>.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. The basic problem in my opinion is that it's impossible to write an article about this that is both neutral and no original research. The concept is not discussed in the mathematical literature and I doubt it ever will, which means that we can't offer arguments against the theory, or say that it's basically the same as NaN's (if it is). However, if we have an article we must make it clear that the concept is rejected by mathematicians.<br />
The SPIE Proceedings have minimal review: the <a href="http://electronicimaging.org/call/07/Ei07_call.pdf" class="external text" title="http://electronicimaging.org/call/07/Ei07_call.pdf" rel="nofollow">Call for Papers</a> states "To ensure a high-quality conference, all abstracts and Proceedings manuscripts will be reviewed by the Conference Chair/Editor for technical merit and suitability of content.", which I take to mean that the Chair/Editor may refuse submissions that are obviously unsuitable, but that no rigorous peer review takes places. Furthermore, SPIE is the International Society for Optical Engineering, which is perhaps not the most proper body to review novel mathematical theories.<br />

<li><b>Comment</b>. There seem to be a lot of 'keep' comments based on "we should cover this debate", "this will make it into a peer-reviewed journal", etc... As it stands now, there is no peer-reviewed debate about this subject. In fact, it is highly unlikely that any mathematician will respond to this in a serious manner. At the very most, Notices will write about "Nullity" as an example of mathematical reporting gone horribly wrong. Nullity is not mathematically profound, innovative, interesting, or noteworthy. Some of the claims about "nullity" border on mathematical nonsense. He's simply added a disconnected point to the extended real line, claimed that being able to divide by zero is more important than the topological properties this breaks, made a bizarre argument about why it's a field, and then made some grandiose claims about the importance of this "discovery". As for any serious "division by zero" research, we already have <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_by_zero.html" title="Division by zero">Division by zero</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. ISI Web of Knowledge reports this paper has been cited zero times. Google scholar reports three citations -- two are from the author. "Perspex machine" doesn't seem to give results on any relevant database (aside from Anderson's stuff). Even the arXiv fails to give results. I also wonder why this paper was published in the <i>biological</i> division of Philosophical Transactions. Seeing as how the paper was published in 1997, there has been ample time to drum up attention. Please correct me if I'm wrong about the above claims. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShotwell_e27f.html" title="User:Shotwell">shotwell</a> 01:42, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To add a little bit, the Philosophical Transactions publishes three kinds of articles: review articles, articles in a "themed" issue, and conference proceedings. The article cited above comes from conference proceedings and was not peer-reviewed. For those without access to the abstracts, here it is:

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This paper introduces perspex algebra which is being developed as a common representation of geometrical knowledge. A perspex can currently be interpreted in one of four ways. First, the algebraic perspex is a generalization of matrices, it provides the most general representation for all of the interpretations of a perspex. The algebraic perspex can be used to describe arbitrary sets of coordinates. The remaining three interpretations of the perspex are all related to square matrices and operate in a Euclidean model of projective space-time, called perspex space. Perspex space differs from the usual Euclidean model of projective space in that it contains the point at nullity. It is argued that the point at nullity is necessary for a consistent account of perspective in top-down vision. Second, the geometric perspex is a simplex in perspex space. It can be used as a primitive building block for shapes, or as a way of recording landmarks on shapes. Third, the transformational perspex describes linear transformations in perspex space that provide the affine and perspective transformations in space-time. It can be used to match a prototype shape to an image, even in so called 'accidental' views where the depth of an object disappears from view, or an object stays in the same place across time. Fourth, the parametric perspex describes the geometric and transformational perspexes in terms of parameters that are related to everyday English descriptions. The parametric perspex can be used to obtain both continuous and categorical perception of objects. The paper ends with a discussion of issues related to using a perspex to describe logic.</dd>

(2) Look, I proved it inconsistent. (3) No, actually it is consistent after all.

<li><b>Redirect to <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Anderson_%28computer_scientist%29_6d5c.html" title="James Anderson (computer scientist)">James Anderson (computer scientist)</a></b>, and expose him for the fraud he is in that article. Misinformed math students will come looking for "nullity" on Wikipedia, and they should find it. When they do, it shouldn't be described as a legitimate mathematical concept (that would be both a travesty against education and original research), but as a word used by a pseudomathematician. The theory is original research, but the phenomenon of a pseudomathematician deluding his students for his own benefit is well covered in the news. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer"><b><span style="color: #63f;">r</span><span style="color: #555;">speer</span></b></a> / <a href="../../../r/s/p/User_talk%7ERspeer_a656.html" title="User talk:Rspeer"><span style="color: #555;">ɹəəds</span><span style="color: #63f;">ɹ</span></a> 22:47, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> If indeed James Anderson's concepts are pseudomath and/or an unoriginal rehash of ideas that have been used before, why not keep the article but specify the holes in the theory or the equivalencies that are claimed? That might provide useful information to anyone else trying to develop a similar idea. The subjects pass notability by merit of the ongoing public discussion. The subjects pass OR by merit of being verifiably published by third-parties.

<li>I like this solution. It sounds increasingly like he's a vocal guy who may come up with other crazy stuff in the future that might also get press coverage. Moving coverage of nullity to his page would make it clear that the idea isn't a mainstream idea and would direct deserved scrutiny on the man himself rather than raising "transreal number" to the level of a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenFrantzDale_c7e5.html" title="User:BenFrantzDale">—Ben FrantzDale</a> 03:30, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You've misunderstood our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy. A theory that has been proposed by one person or group, and that has gained no traction in the world at large, having not been acknowledged by anyone else (either supporting or contesting it) outside of its creator(s)/proponent(s), does not belong in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_sources_and_content_98bf.html" title="User:Uncle G/On sources and content">Everything in Wikipedia must have gone through a process of fact checking, peer review, and acceptance into the corpus of human knowledge</a>.
<p>This is certainly true of Anderson's "perspex machine". You argue that Wikipedia should have a fair and unbiased article on the subject. Please think that argument through. Wikipedia is not magic. <i>There is no way to have a fair and unbiased article on a subject when the only person to have ever properly written and published works about it is its creator and proponent.</i></p>
<p>Similarly, there is no way for Wikipedia to magically have a reliable article on something where the source is, in your very own word, "unreliable".</p>
<p>"transreal numbers" and "nullity" have been contested and discussed by people other than Anderson. But only very weakly and badly.

<li>The problem is that there are no reliable sources that assert that it is nonsense. <i>Only Daniel Firth</i> has actually tried to address this properly, and xe hasn't finished yet. Most of the discussion is by pseudonymous people, who cannot be traced, writing on web logs, and a lot of that discussion is, moreover, <i>wrong</i>. (One pseudonymous web log posting that I read this morning tried to prove the system faulty by asserting that in the transreals it could be proven that <span class="texhtml">1 = Φ</span>. The proof was flawed, since it involved cancelling <span class="texhtml">0</span> with <span class="texhtml">0 <sup>− 1</sup></span> to yield <span class="texhtml">1</span>, something which the transreal axioms don't allow.) The fact that pseudonymous postings on web logs <i>clearly</i> haven't been fact checked or peer reviewed is why they are unacceptable sources.
<p>The only proper way to discuss this system of numbers is in the same way that the <i>only reliable sources that we have</i> discuss it: in the context of discussing <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Anderson_%28computer_scientist%29_6d5c.html" title="James Anderson (computer scientist)">James Anderson (computer scientist)</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:30, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
