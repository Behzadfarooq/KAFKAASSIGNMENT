<li><b>Delete</b>. The article merely states that this exists, rather than why it is notable. An internet 'TV show' is something rather easy to do if you can be bothered, so not automatically notable. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 21:17, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b>. anyone can produce their own show, like average earthman said, and their is no proof that this show is wildly popular. -anonymous IP user</li>
<li>Advertising. I agree with the above. <b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b>, ego stroking self promotion. <i>Unsigned vote by 67.140.145.26 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.140.145.26_f008.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.140.145.26">contribs</a>), who has five edits, only one of which is not to the article or to this VfD.</i></li>
<li><b>Don't delete</b>, compared to topics like "badger badger badger" pure pwnage really deserves an article as it's a very professional show compared to many many others on the internet. <i>Unsigned vote by Mtoman (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mtoman_eac7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mtoman">contribs</a>), whose only edit is this vote.</i></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Skimming google, it appears that this show is very well-covered on gaming websites. I'm not completely convinced it belongs, but it's an edge case and as a matter of principle I believe edge cases should be included. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 04:01, 2005 Apr 11 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. In my opinion:
<ul>
<li>The article is a stub with potential. (See <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Deletion policy</a> - table 'Problems that don't require deletion')</li>
<li>It is related to precedent: <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Precedents_e2a3.html#Is_some_Internet_culture_encyclopedic.3F_-_Yes" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents">Is some Internet culture encyclopedic? - Yes</a>. Gaming and Internet culture are quite intimately related, and this is apparent from the video series itself.</li>
<li>As Mtoman pointed out (in the unsigned vote above, nevertheless), the subject of this article is somewhat related to <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_vs_Blue_4af2.html" title="Red vs Blue">Red vs Blue</a>.</li>
<li>The article might <i>presently</i> be seen as a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Vanity page</a>, however, as I pointed out above, the article is still a stub and is in need of expansion. As for the claims of 'non-notability', please see <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html#Does_lack_of_fame_a_vanity_article_make.3F" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Does lack of fame a vanity article make?</a>. <i>Pure Pwnage</i> (the video series) is primarily about gamers and the gaming subculture, however, since it is a parody, it can appeal to a much wider audience. (e.g. see <i>Pure Pwnage</i> Episode 2: <i>Girls</i>)</li>
<li>This is <b>NOT</b> a personal attack, merely a statement of fact. The VfD tagger has not viewed the video series that is the subject of this article (excerpt from <i>#wikipedia</i> on FreeNode, times are GMT +08:00):
<ul>
<li>Apr 11 12:02:09 &lt;eleusis&gt; InShaneee: have you watched the pure pwnage series?</li>
<li>[...]</li>
<li>Apr 11 12:02:21 &lt;InShaneee&gt; eleusis: can't say I have.</li>
<li>Apr 11 12:02:27 &lt;eleusis&gt; ok</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As such, I believe the VfD listing is based on simple assumption relating to the current length of the article, rather than its potential. I also believe that <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> would not have VfD'd this article had he seen the video series, considering that he is familiar with the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_vs_Blue_4af2.html" title="Red vs Blue">Red vs Blue</a> series, and would have been aware of the parallels:
<ul>
<li>Apr 11 12:03:58 &lt;eleusis&gt; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_vs_Blue" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_vs_Blue" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_vs_Blue</a>) is related to (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Pwnage" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Pwnage" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Pwnage</a>) in that it's a video/animation series published on the web, and that they're both about gaming</li>
<li>[...]</li>
<li>Apr 11 12:04:07 &lt;eleusis&gt; i don't see (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_vs_Blue" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_vs_Blue" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_vs_Blue</a>) getting vfd'd</li>
<li>Apr 11 12:04:40 &lt;InShaneee&gt; eleusis: I love red vs. blue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Answering other VfD voters' concerns:
<ul>
<li>The present form of the article does not make its notability apparent - as I pointed out, the article is still a stub in need of expansion.</li>
<li>The popularity of the video show is mostly irrelevant: <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html#Does_lack_of_fame_a_vanity_article_make.3F" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Does lack of fame a vanity article make?</a>.</li>
<li>The article is not simply promotion. For example, a term that is often used without explanation in the video series is 'Uber Micro'. This article is properly linked to explain this term.</li>
<li>Labelling this article as 'Advertising' because of the presence of a 'Review' section is irrelevant. This 'review' was <i>not</i> NPOV (negatively biased against the content of the video series) and was added by an anonymous user from IP 67.140.145.26. This review was removed by another anonymous user from IP 24.3.104.7, but then reverted back by 67.140.145.26. Notice that the anonymous user from 67.140.145.26 has also posted a <i>Delete</i> vote on this page. The review has since been moved to the Talk page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In summary, I believe that <a href="../../../p/u/r/Pure_Pwnage_9d82.html" title="Pure Pwnage">Pure Pwnage</a> has good potential for growth, being a good example of a <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webisode.html" title="Webisode">Webisode</a>. (The webisode article doesn't exist yet, try google for definitions and other examples. IMO, a webisode is a more general concept than a <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webcomic.html" title="Webcomic">webcomic</a> - something that <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_vs_Blue_4af2.html" title="Red vs Blue">Red vs Blue</a> is classified as.) As evident from the article presently, the video series is relevant to the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamer.html" title="Gamer">gamer</a> subculture. However, a wider audience should be able to relate to the content of the video series, as it is a <i>parody</i> of gamers, not simply an obscure gamer-related publication.</li>

<li>I'm glad that Eleusis made a clear explanation, but unfortunately I don't find it particularly convincing. The article is conceivably vanity since it is written by people involved with the show. That is, of course, debatable as always, but it is valid grounds for voting. "Red vs Blue" gets over ten times as many google hits as "Pure Pwnage". Thus it does not follow that Pwnage is 'famous' simply because it is 'similar'. And it is pretty easy to create whatever kind of site on the net; <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a web directory. So I'd have to agree with the <b>delete</b> voters above. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 09:18, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As far as I know, there is no evidence to suggest that this article was written by, or has had most (or even, any) of its contributions coming from the cast or crew of <i>Pure Pwnage</i>, or anyone else affiliated with (read: helps run, or promotes) purepwnage.com. I was not implying that <a href="../../../p/u/r/Pure_Pwnage_9d82.html" title="Pure Pwnage">Pure Pwnage</a> is as famous as <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_vs_Blue_4af2.html" title="Red vs Blue">Red vs Blue</a>, merely that they were both parodies of the gaming subculture, and were both published in the form of 'webisodes'. (Indeed, I stated that fame is mostly irrelevant) <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EEleusis_9c04.html" title="User:Eleusis">Eleusis</a> 09:47, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> as vanity, the videos are unprofessionaly made. If they were a band they wouldn't be accepted on Wikipedia. Also Alexa rank of 138,580. <a href="../../../b/b/x/User%7EBbx_da7b.html" title="User:Bbx">bbx</a> 12:04, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The band that half of Internet knows about would certainly be accepted on Wikipedia. Similarly, an Internet phenomenon that is Pure Pwnage certainly deserves a mention in Wikipedia. The "vanity" argument is ridiculous in this case. Alexa rank for something that you can download from a dozen of sites and torrents is not very relevant too. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 14:26, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Take a look at <a href="http://www.onestat.com/aspx/reports.aspx?nav=i" class="external free" title="http://www.onestat.com/aspx/reports.aspx?nav=i" rel="nofollow">http://www.onestat.com/aspx/reports.aspx?nav=i</a>. I feel that the videos are popular enough and of a level of professional quality to be included in wikipedia. If the first episodes don't fit your definition of "quality" you should also watch the newer ones.<a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_Simons_3d57.html" title="User:Walton Simons">Walton Simons</a></li>
<li>'<b><i>DEFINITLY'</i> Keep</b> Pure Pwnage is a sure example of artistic view and knowledge of the mind of pro gamers, along with comedy and information. It definitely should stay up as a source of information for the fans, like me, and many others. <i>Unsigned vote by 24.156.25.92 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.156.25.92_26ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.156.25.92">contribs</a>), who has only one edit.</i></li>
<li>Keep: This article is educational. It educates people on gamer culture as does the show. There is no self-promotion here, this article was produced by those that were enlightened by the show and feel a deep sense of satisfaction from the education they have received from the show. <i>Unsigned vote by 82.133.100.157 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.133.100.157_e0a1.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.133.100.157">contribs</a>), who has just two edits.</i></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the show is a comedy but nevertheless a well made non-vulgar view into the world of gamers. Though not the best role model for kids, it is interesting to keep the article in the condition that it is kept in a good level of writing. -- Faerun 18:25, 19 Apr 2005</li>
