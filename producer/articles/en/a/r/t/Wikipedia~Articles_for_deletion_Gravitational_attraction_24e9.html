<li><b>Redirect to gravitation</b> Current article has many serious problems.

<li><b>comment</b> The <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinetic_energy.html" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic energy</a> of the particle changes in a free fall (e.g. when particle "drops" its kinetic energy increaes). So from Newton's POV (and so also from POV of <i>non relativistic</i> classical mechanics) there was a need for an assumption of some kind of "<i>gravitational attractive force</i>" F=dE/dx (where E is this kinetic energy and x is distance) that could be responsible for this change of kinetic energy of the free falling particle. To keep the conservation of energy intact this energy has been assumed to be delivered form a source called "potential energy of the particle". And that's why it has been assumed in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newtonian_physics.html" title="Newtonian physics">Newtonian physics</a> and non relativistic <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_mechanics.html" title="Classical mechanics">classical mechanics</a> that the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy of the particle is constant. In relativistic physics since the energy of the free falling particle doesn't change despite its changing kinetic energy (see Landau) there is no need for an assumption of any "<i>gravitational attractive force</i>" nor any "potential energy". That's why we say now that Einstein eliminated "<i>gravitational attractive force</i>" form physics. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 15:50, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> - You did not write "kinetic energy" above, but instead wrote "total energy". You are going to have to learn that if your writing is subject to misinterpretation, the fault is yours and not the reader's. BTW - You still have a goof in the above as you wrote that the "energy of the free falling particle does not change despite its changing kinetic energy", yet the point of your write-up is that the change in <i>c</i> (as determined by a distant observer) keeps the kinetic energy constant in general relativity. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 16:51, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> - What do you mean <i>You did not write "kinetic energy" above</i>? I just started my last comment from <i>The <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinetic_energy.html" title="Kinetic energy">kinetic energy</a> of the particle ...</i>. When I write "kinetic energy" I mean "kinetic energy", when I write "total energy" I mean "total energy". While the idea of "kinetic energy" is almost the same in Newtonian and relativistic physics, the idea of "total energy" is obviously different in relativity since in Newtonian physics it used to be "kinetic energy" plus "potential energy", the latter being usually "negative". The "potential energy" lost its meaning in relativity where "total energy" is <img class='tex' src="../../../math/c/a/d/cad4c110a310f6e78728237399d48381.png" alt="E=mc^2\sqrt{g_{00}}" />. Could you explain more clearly what you mean by "<i>keeps the kinetic energy constant in general relativity</i>" since in relativity the <i>total energy</i> is constant. The "kinetic energy" isn't constant in neither physics unless in the reference frame of the free falling particle when it is a trivial zero. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 20:55, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> - Interesting goof on my part, as you are correct that Newtonian physics lack any rest energy, and kinetic energy does not include that. My point remains that energy is conserved (locally) in any case. More important is that your question to linas can only be valid if potential energy is excluded, but there was nothing in the question to make that clear. You keep approaching things from your own perculiar POV, and have no respect for the knowledge base or the needs of others. More specifically to this case, you seem to think that the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitational_attraction.html" title="Gravitational attraction">gravitational attraction</a> article should be a pro-GR rant instead of an informative review of the topic itself. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 21:14, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> I'm just trying to explain gravitation based on the "needs of others" which I hope is as simple explanation as possible so it could be understood by a high school student. That's why I use just derivatives and not the tensor calculus which would turn off most people. However, as Einstein said, while everything should be made as simple as possible (and luckily physics is simple, even simpler than Newton's) the math shouldn't be made any simpler than possible. So I think I made it the simplest possible. If you can make it any simpler you are welcome to modify my stuff but I don't think that keeping old Newtonian stuff would do anybody any good. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 21:57, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>additional comment</b> - You seem to be one of the guys on the other side of the issue who understands the issue. So you might be able to turn the whole consensus from 9:1 (as it stands now) to 0:10 (as it should be if everybody understood clearly what the issue is). So I should probably explain the issue more clearly. But I had a feeling that I did it already in the "gravitational attraction" page and no one was interested enough to read it all. So if we could discuss, after reading the page, what are the real objections (not just "troll Jim pushing again his POV") I'd have an opportunity to clarify them and explain while in this case Jim's POV is also POV of the hard science that is taught in all universieties around the world, unfortunately only to graduate physics students. And I'd like it to be taught to high school students as well since they are perfectly well capable of understanding this hard science POV, when it is properly explained to them. So if I make dydactical errors, as you seem to suggest, please point thosse errors to me and we may clarify them. One isse that you pointed to already is "<a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_energy.html" title="Total energy">total energy</a>". However I also modified this page to fit the contemporary state of affairs and it was reverted to some non <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invariant_%28physics%29.html" title="Invariant (physics)">invariant</a> nonsens as well. So I just concentrate on the most important issue in my opinion, which is the faith in gravitational attraction. This faith has persisted already for over 300 years, and it is outdated for almost 100 years, but despite that it is taught to high school students around the world, as <i><b>good enough for them</b></i>. Which then it has all the features of a <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_religion.html" title="State religion">state religion</a> (in this case even a <i>world religion</i>). It is tauht with a hope that when those students are interested in the <i><b>truth</b></i> then they may study physics and learn <i>in due time</i> what the truth is. Apparently they never do as it is shown by this consensus of educated people, most likely graduated from many high schools, and some even graduate students in physics at Harvard University. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 09:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The inverse square law holds in everyday life, and is a great approximation to nature at the energies and in the fields that humans are accustomed to. As others have pointed out, the fact that you don't fly off into space is evidence that "something" is pulling you down. Whether that something is some kind of inverse square law, or quantum gravity, or the result of some field equations doesn't matter, in ordinary human life we observe that we are attracted to the Earth. Arguments about what general relativity means should take place on GR pages, not on a page designed to attack the normal understanding of gravitation. As a final point, consider someone creating a page called "Earth's Geography" and stating in the lead sentence that "the idea that the Earth is round is a myth. It's actually a bumpy elipsoid". Even if the point is true it's badly representing the normal person's worldview.</li>

<li><b>comment</b> - Your example with a round Earth is about <i>approximation</i> while sentence about <i>gravitational attraction</i> is about something not existing at all. It seems that almost a century after the <i>gravitational attraction</i> disppeared from physics the high school students might finally start reading encyclopedia's articles that tell them the same thing that physics students learn in their gravitation courses and to learn how gravitation really works instead of believing a nearly century old story. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 21:31, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> - Science is about approximation and model building. The model of 1/r**2 attraction works very well (wihthin measurement uncertainties) for almost everything everyone does. Should we change the first sentence of "proton" to "The existance of protons is a myth! In reality the proton is a bound state of three quarks of individual color". (Of course in perturbative field theory "quarks" don't exist either, they're just excitations out of the vacuum, so one can go even further...) We teach high school physics students about friction - but "friction is a myth"! It's really an integral of electromagnetic interactions between atoms (uh oh) on each of the adjacent surfaces.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Models are used constantly in physics. Condensed matter physicists talk about "depletion forces" (really electromagnetic), electronics designers talk about the AC current through a capacitor (electrons don't actually flow), we even talk about electrons "flowing" even though individual electrons bounce all over the place in the wire, and don't really go in orderly circles through the loop. The model of gravitational attraction due a to 1/r**2 force is an exceedingly good model for everyday life, is VERY important in the history physics, and is a great teaching tool. If you want people to learn about general relativity then include a link to it on <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitation.html" title="Gravitation">Gravitation</a> (I assume it's there already), and mention that the 1/r**2 force law represents the old way of thinking about it.

<li><b>response</b> - I did what you advise long time ago, and it was removed by someone who believes (without any proof so far, but he believes it is going to be proved in future) that <i>masses attract each other through empty space</i> and a sentence to this effect still opens, untouched, the "<a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitation.html" title="Gravitation">Gravitation</a>" page. That's why I stopped editing for a while (as <a href="../../../f/e/y/Feynman.html" title="Feynman">Feynman</a> advised "<i>no argument will convince the idiot</i>" <a href="http://www.geocities.com/wlodekj/sci/Feynman.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/wlodekj/sci/Feynman.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) but then it occured to me that I may create a page about <i>gravitational attraction</i> and clarify this issue according to knowledge delivered by <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">reliable sources</a>. It might have the advantage that idiots can't blank it since it would make an act of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a> according to Wikipedia's policy. Now you and <a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> did just that and additionally you think that high school students should be shielded from contmporary knowledge about <i>gravitational attraction</i>. Apparently you believe that shielding brings them a lot of good. EMS even thinks that admitting that relativity is real might blow people minds (<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimJast_0eed.html#Teaching_gravitation" title="User talk:JimJast">which he saw happening</a>). So you guys think that telling the truth as we know it is bad and Wikipedia should protect inocent high school students from learing truth about the real world and do it through an administrative action. However it is probably against Wikipedia's policy and for sure against policy of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albus_Dumbledore_087b.html" title="Albus Dumbledore">Prof. Dumbledore</a> who maintained that the best way to improve society is to tell the truth as it is known. The simple reason behind such policy is that one can't predict the results of the lies that people are fed with, for noble purposes, and sometimes those lies backfire and then one regrets that those people were ever lied to.</li>

However the noble idea of creating a "perfect tool" for improving hospital statistics backfired by refusal of some Polish doctors to perform surgeries, which the Government didn't foreseen. They meant well and yet the bad doctors turned the best intentions into a disaster for Polish people who now have difficulties with having surgeries since 20 years in jail is too big a risk for those cowardly doctors. Unfortunately there is no death penelty in Poland so 20 years for assasination is max the governmant can afford but the Government is working on improving Polish Constitution that would be more like in Texas. So soon if a patient dies so does his doctor. Apparently, Polish Government might assume that it "<i>is an exceedingly good model for everyday life, [...] and is a great teaching tool</i>" to teach doctors.</dd>

<dd>Even if you try to think everything over in every detail they always manage to screw up something and then they tell you "<i>you said it yourself</i>". And then your only defense is "<i>well, I lied, since I thought that you are idiots and can't bear the truth since it might blow your minds</i>". And this is a very weak defense. So if you can document the fact that three quarks together is a myth, say it. It is BTW what Feynman always did. When he knew that something isn't true he said so and then he explained what model we may use to work with it anyway. Because science is not about models, as you say, but suprizingly enough it is abobut finding what is false. Which can be done in all relevant cases through experiments. That's why we already know, and are sure of, a lot of myth. By an important <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistemology.html" title="Epistemology">epistemological</a> rule we can find what is true only when it is just oposite to a myth that we already proved false. And unfortunately there are many possible things opposite to a given myth. That's why to find truth is so difficult but luckily not impossible in principle.</dd>

<li><b>comment</b> Science is not the search for truth. There are no certitudes in science, only theories and models. Further, since you mentioned Feynman let me quote from page 3 of the Feynman lectures on gravitation: "First of all there is the fact that the attraction follows an inverse-square law... Then there is the fact that the force is proportional to the masses of the objects." Then later on the same page: "we first define the mass as the inertia of the object, which we measure by applying known forces and measuring the acceleration. Then we measure <b>the attraction due to gravitation</b>, for example, by weighing, and compare the results." (emphasis mine). I think this ought to settle this matter.<a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_fish_a481.html" title="User:Flying fish">Flying fish</a> 14:43, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>response</b> - You say <i>"Science is not the search for truth"</i>, making an impression that maybe I said that it is. I said: "<i>science is [...] about finding what is false"</i>. Of course <i>finding what is false</i> is not the same as <i>the search for truth</i> since as you agreed <i>there are no certitudes in science</i>. So we agree on this point. Then as it turns out we agree also on a point that <i>The inverse square law holds in everyday life, and is a great approximation to nature ...</i> which you said yourself. So your example with Feynman is about a model that Feynamn explains and which is an <i>approximation to nature</i>. It is all independent of what Einstein discovered, since as Feynman says in section 7-8 (Gravity and relativity) of <i>The Fenman lectures on physics</i> "<i>In spite of all the excitement it created, Newton's law of gravitation is not correct!</i>" (exclamation is Feynman's). Now my POV is that we shouldn't present to high school students something about which we already know that it is <i>false</i>, which contrary to <i>truth</i> can be discovered by science and it's even the purpose of science to find what is false. Because we don't want to live in the world of illusions as lived the people of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Ages_1e14.html" title="Dark Ages">Dark Ages</a>. So my purpose is to show to the high school students how easy it is to understand Einstein's gravitation (and if I didn't do it well enough you are welcome to help), and so they don't need to <i>believe</i> that the <i>gravitational attraction</i> is real. They should know that it is not real (as far as we know) because this knowledge makes them capable of discovering something on their own in physics. While this opportunity will be taken away form most of them when from the earliest years they are going to believe in <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_legends.html" title="Urban legends">urban legends</a> which <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitation.html" title="Gravitation">Newtonian gravitation</a> claerly is as Feynman confirms. We differ then only in POV on the educational policy. The education of most people taking part in this debate is an evidence that the present policy on teaching gravitation starting from Newton's theory is wrong. IMO it should start from stating clearly that there is no such thing as <i>gravitational attraction</i>, how it is simulated (which as you can see from the disputed page, thanks to Landau, takes less than 45 minutes to explain) and only then, when students comprehend the physics of the real world, explaining how simpy we can solve problems involving gravitation with Newton's equations. Otherwise we create mentally challenged individuals who might believe that the real world can't be understood. And later in life have problems with explaining many cosmological puzzles since faith in gravitational attraction affects their clear judgment. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 18:08, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep it as it is</b> since high school students shouldn't be fed majority opinion but they should be told what physicists (and apparently not many of them have time to edit Wikipedia) consider to be a true story.

It is rather a sad picture that now, almost a century later, so many people want to come back to the gravitational attraction as a reason for things not falling off the Earth. In nearly hundred years they couldn't managed to understand Einstein. It means that my job of popularizing Einstein's gravitation is urgently needed to keep Wikipedia from sinking in the see of ingnorance about the physics of the real world. I just see a need to explain at least what this physics isn't and why. At least to high school students who might not yet have their own prejudices about it and could learn physics as understood by physicists and not those who understand only the simplified <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newtonian_physics.html" title="Newtonian physics">Newtonian physics</a>. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 23:43, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1. It doesn't make any sense that people who want to read about the gravitational force would need to understand general relativity first. It would be a very non-standard pedagogical approach.
<dl>
<dd><b>comment</b> Apparently this non standard pedagogical approach is urgently needed since relativity is around already for about a century and as demonstratef by this voting list a lot of intelligent people still don't understand it and some don't even know the simplest things about it. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 16:39, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>2. The article includes many mistakes. For example, the text claims that gravitational force exists when the body "is prevented from its free movement" and that it doesn't exist when the body is free to move. With or without general relativity, this statement is wrong.
<dl>
<dd><b>comment</b> This POV is wrong according to your POV but it is right according to POV of any textbook on general relativity. So to be fair you might say that opinions are divided, and yours aren't supported by any relible source yet since reliable sources support general relativity's POV. Even the autors that you quoted in discussion with me admit that they don't know yet how to prove their POV so they say that existence of <i>attractive force</i> is just their hypothesis. General relativity's POV, on the other hand, has been confirmed by all experiments up to date. Which makes pretty clear choice for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 16:39, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>3. The main claim of the article that "gravitational attraction is a myth" isn't the only existing interpretation of Einstein's equations, and maybe not even the dominant one.
