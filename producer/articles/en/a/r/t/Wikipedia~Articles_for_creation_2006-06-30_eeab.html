<p>Peter Hand (is the presenter and producer for ABC Illawarra's Morning Show.</p>
<p>From a long career in Sydney radio in the role of talk personality at 2GB, journalist and award-winning reporter, Peter is now living the Illawarra dream in a house atop a cliff in a seaside village with the waves crashing below.</p>
<p>His ideal pleasure is swinging in a hammock, listening to Benjamin Britten while taking in the changing hues of the escarpment.</p>
<p>When he has to work, Hand likes to have fun, combining serious journalism with entertainment and his uniquely original humour.</p>
<p>Peter's career has seen him cover some of Australia's most notorious crime stories and the nation's most notorious politicians. From heading election-night coverage to Royal visits, bushfires, floods and disasters like Waterfall train crash or Thedbo mudslide or moments of celebration like the Olympic Torch Relay, Peter paints pictures with radio to 'take you there'. His highly acclaimed coverage of the Gulf War was seen as a landmark in Australian radio journalism.</p>
<p>His passion for radio is just a little greater than that for his avid reading, huge music collection, taste for art, design and architecture and of course...home renovating.</p>

<p>The album Reel to Reel was released by the freshly solo Grand Puba in 1992, following group projects with the likes of Brand Nubian and the short lived duo Masters of Ceremony. Both of the group’s albums were critically acclaimed but failed to duplicate that success in terms of album sales. Puba’s previous works did nothing if to help to establish himself as one of Hip-Hop’s (still fairly new) strongest lyricist. Grand Puba’s Reel to Reel spawned a style lyricism and word play that had never been witnessed by the likes of Hip-Hop. Puba’s wordplay was reminiscent of Slick Rick’s fairy tale rhymes (e.g. The Great Adventures of Slick Rick) yet, they had a more socially conscious undertone (e.g. “Proper Education”) but also still keeping a playful attitude about them (e.g. “Honey Don't Front”). Puba’s style on and off the microphone would later play a major roll in the development of rapper/producer Kanye West. Everything from West’s polo, yacht club fashion sense, to his rhymes boasting of spending four-hundred dollars on Gucci loafers and being the “freshest” rapper alive was from major influences by Puba among others.</p>

"In quest of the unpublished manuscript of a martyred Yiddish writer, the American novelist Nathan Zuckerman travels to Soviet-occupied Prague in the mid-1970's. There, in a nation straightjacketed by totalitarian Communism, he discovers a literary predicament, marked by institutionalised opression, that is rather different from his own. He also discovers, among the opressed writers with whom he quickly becomes embroiled in a series of bizarre and poignant adventures, an appealingly perverse kind of heroism. The Prague Orgy, consisting of entries from Zuckerman's notebooks recording his sojourn among these outcast artists, completes the trilogy and elilogue Zuckerman Bound. It provides a startling ending to Roth's intricately designed magnum opus on the uforeseen consequences of art."</p>

<p>The Senlis Council is an international security and development policy think tank, established by The Network of European Foundations. This organization has just published a report critical of the Canadian operations in Afganistan, leading to media focus ... but in spite of its international status and links to the UN, there is no information about this organization in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Quote from CBC: "The Senlis Council, which has offices in London, Kabul, Brussels and Paris, is a development think-tank that focuses on global drug policy. It is funded through the non-profit Network of European Foundations for Innovative Co-operation."</p>
<p>I note that this organization has 40 employees in Afganistan, alone.</p>

<p>Mike scored the deciding goal in Game 5 of the first round of the 1981 NHL playoffs giving the St. Louis Blues the series clinching win in Double Overtime over the Pittsburgh Penguins. Crombeen had not played for most of the game due to illness. But seeking fresh legs, Blues coach Jacque Demers, inserted Crombeen into the lineup at the beginning of the 2nd OT period at the Checkerdome in St. Louis. Crombeen deposited a centering pass from behind the Penguins net and as Dan Kelly called it on KMOX, "The Checkerdome has exploded!!!"</p>

<p>Tsuchiya Yuichi or better known as TUTI was born on the 6th February 1979 in the Yamanashi prefecture, Japan. His bloodtype is O and he is 180cm tall. He loves playing tennis, table tennis and billiards.</p>
<p>He is part of a stage performing group consisting of members who act, sing and dance called *pnish*. Other memebers of *pnish* are Moriyama Eiji, Sano Daiko and Washo Noboru. While his singing skills are just average, his breakdancing skills are remarkable as seen in many stage performances he has done.</p>
<p>Among the roles he had played are Oishi Syuichiro in Tennis no Oujisama the Musical(TeniMyu). This role is an irony. Tuti, like his character, used to play tennis for the Kantou Region when he was in middle school. However he played singles as opposed to Oishi's doubles role. Besides his role in TeniMyu, he also played Ichimaru Gin in the Bleach Rock musical.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Chelsea Barracks is a British Army barracks located approximately three-quarters of a mile from Buckingham Palace in central London. It is in Chelsea Bridge Road, Chelsea, SW1H 8RF, at the end of Lower Sloane Street.</p>
<p>HISTORY</p>

<p>The three incremental companies of the Foot Guards (Nijmegen Company, Grenadier Guards; No 7 Company, Coldstream Guards; F Company, Scots Guards; all on permanent public duties in London) are based there.</p>
<p>SALE OF THE BARRACKS</p>
<p>The Secretary State of Defence, John Reid, announced on 6 September that Woolwich Station will be kept as infantry barracks whilst Chelsea Barracks will be sold. Woolwich Station will be refurbished to accommodate approximately 1,000 infantry soldiers based in London and their families. Chelsea Barracks, originally built for two battalions, needs extensive renovations and currently houses only 300 personnel. The site is to be vacated by 2008.</p>
<p>Under the MODs FOI request number 29-09-2005-104742-001 was submitted on 13/10/2005. Details are "Request for details of the funds raised by selling Chelsea Barracks"</p>

<p>MoD hopes to make £200m from Chelsea Barracks sale. By Neil Tweedie.(Filed: 07/09/2005). www.telegraph.co.uk</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defence is expected to make £200 million from the sale of a barracks in one of London's most expensive residential areas.</p>
<p>Almost 14 acres of "super-prime" land in the heart of fashionable Chelsea will be offered to developers from 2008, providing a windfall for the department. Town houses built on the site will command prices of £1 million and above, with one-bedroom flats fetching at least £300,000.</p>
<p>The decision, announced yesterday by the Defence Secretary, John Reid, was long expected. Chelsea Barracks are in poor condition, the ugly tower blocks built in the early 1960s no longer in use. The MoD said yesterday that the site was no longer required, even taking into account the heightened terrorist threat. The cost of renewing the buildings would be prohibitive.</p>
<p>Instead, the 250 or so troops who use Chelsea will be transferred to Woolwich Barracks in south-east London, which will become home to most of the infantry units stationed in London for public and other duties. Some £50 million is to be spent refurbishing Woolwich, home of the Royal Artillery since the 18th Century.</p>
<p>Selling off Chelsea. (Filed: 07/09/2005). www.telegraph.co.uk</p>
<p>The Government's decision to sell Chelsea barracks makes sound commercial sense. Property developers are thought likely to pay at least £150 million for the 14.4 acre site, probably more. Another happy consequence of the sale is that it will mean keeping open Woolwich barracks in the east of London, home for more than three centuries to the Royal Artillery. Georgian Woolwich is far more handsome than 1960s Chelsea, and will offer better facilities to the soldiers who will live and train there.</p>
<p>Nor does the sale pose any risk to the capital's security. If it should ever become necessary to muster large numbers of troops in central London, this can still be done on the huge parade ground at Wellington barracks in Westminster, or at the Army's other bases in Knightsbridge, Regent's Park and the City.</p>
<p>We have only one regret about Chelsea's closure: nowhere in central London has the Army's presence been more visible than here. How sad that there will be nothing left, when the Army trucks and Land Rovers lined up on the parade ground have gone, to remind Chelsea shoppers of the military might on which their liberties have always depended.</p>

Latest News. Army to remain at Woolwich, Chelsea Barracks to close. Published Tuesday 6th September 2005 <a href="http://news.mod.uk/news/press/news_headline_story.asp?newsItem_id=3519" class="external free" title="http://news.mod.uk/news/press/news_headline_story.asp?newsItem_id=3519" rel="nofollow">http://news.mod.uk/news/press/news_headline_story.asp?newsItem_id=3519</a></p>
<p>Historic Woolwich Station is to be retained and extensively refurbished to house infantry soldiers based in London, the Secretary of State for Defence, John Reid, announced on 6 September 2005.</p>
<p>The Station was due to close following the departure of 16 Regiment Royal Artillery in 2007. But following a two-year study into its London estate, the Ministry of Defence has decided to refurbish the Station to become the long-term home of some 1,000 Army personnel (and their families) posted to London, predominately for ceremonial duties. As part of the decision, Chelsea Barracks will be disposed of.</p>
<p>John Reid said:</p>
<p>"Soldiers on public and ceremonial duties in London are one of the most striking emblems of our great capital city. Historic Woolwich Station will be a fitting home for these soldiers.</p>
<p>"The investment in Woolwich Station will provide new training, sports, recreation and accommodation facilities.</p>
<p>"None of these improvements is possible at Chelsea Barracks without knocking down the whole site and rebuilding it. Retaining Woolwich offers both good value for money and first-class facilities. The decision is a win-win for soldiers."</p>
<p>Major-General Sebastian Roberts, General Officer Commanding for the London District, said:</p>
<p>"The decision to retain Woolwich Station means that the Army's 400 year old links with the area can continue as strong as ever. Soldiers will welcome the move to Woolwich, as it means a better quality of life for them and their families in a striking, historic location."</p>
<p>Woolwich Station was built between 1776 and 1802 to be the home of the Royal Artillery (RA). The area has a long military association, with references to the ordnance at Woolwich dating from the 15th century. The MOD announced in 2004 that the last remaining RA regiment stationed at Woolwich, 16 Regiment, will relocate to Thorney Island near Chichester. The home of the Royal Artillery will be Larkhill, on Salisbury Plain, which is to be a RA centre of excellence. Close links between the Royal Artillery and Woolwich will be maintained by the independent "Firepower" museum which is at Woolwich Arsenal.</p>
<p>On current plans, Woolwich Station will house two of the three infantry battalions stationed in London at any one time, along with their support elements. Infantry battalions are predominantly posted to London for Public Duties and State Ceremonial duties, although they remain deployable for operations both at home and overseas.</p>
<p>Until now, many ceremonial duties personnel have been accommodated at Chelsea Barracks, which is in need of extensive renewal. The barracks were built in 1962 on the site of earlier buildings constructed in the 1860s. The barracks were originally built for two battalions, but now only house 300 personnel. Chelsea Barracks will be disposed of after the site has been vacated in 2008. Cavalry Barracks in Hounslow, which can accommodate approximately 600 personnel, may also be disposed of if another Defence use cannot be found for the site.</p>
<p>Historic London barracks to close. Tuesday September 6, 2005 <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/military/story/0,11816,1563968,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/military/story/0,11816,1563968,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/military/story/0,11816,1563968,00.html</a></p>
<p>The historic Chelsea Barracks in central London is to be shut down and sold off for redevelopment, the defence secretary, John Reid, announced today. The closure will end military links with the site dating back to 1860, releasing a 14.4-acre area of land for residential and retail development in the exclusive area between Sloane Square and the Thames.</p>
<p>It is believed developers could be ready to pay the Ministry of Defence as much as £250m for the site.</p>
<p>Mr Reid also announced that there had been a reprieve for the grander and much larger Woolwich Station in south-east London. Woolwich Station was built between 1776 and 1802 as the home of the Royal Artillery, and had been earmarked for closure when the last RA regiment leaves in 2007.</p>
<p>However, Mr Reid said that, after a two-year study, the MoD had decided to refurbish it instead.</p>
<p>The barracks - which has the largest parade square of any in the UK barracks - will become a long-term home for around 1,000 personnel and their families posted in London, largely for ceremonial duties.</p>
<p>Until now, ceremonial duties personnel have been accommodated at Chelsea, which is around three-quarters of a mile from Buckingham Palace. Woolwich Station is 11 miles from the palace.</p>
<p>Operationally, Chelsea Barracks provided the army with a valuable assembly point in the heart of London. However, the facilities - built in 1962 on the site of buildings constructed for two battalions in 1860 - have become outmoded, and currently house only 300 people.</p>
<p>The government rejected a private finance initiative deal to keep it open, saying it would not be value for money.</p>
<p>Mr Reid said the "dilapidated" barracks was blighted by "very poor accommodation indeed", and would be sold after being vacated in 2008. He said any developers would have to approach the government with a very good price for the land.</p>
<p>Cavalry barracks in Hounslow, west London, currently accommodating 600 servicemen and women, could also be disposed of if another defence use cannot be found for the site.</p>
<p>"I'm absolutely certain that the security of the capital will not only be maintained but enhanced," Mr Reid said.</p>
<p>"Soldiers on public and ceremonial duties in London are one of the most striking emblems of our great capital city. Historic Woolwich Station will be a fitting home for these soldiers.</p>
<p>"The investment in Woolwich Station will provide new training, sports, recreation and accommodation facilities.</p>
<p>"None of these improvements is possible at Chelsea Barracks without knocking down the whole site and rebuilding it. Retaining Woolwich offers both good value for money and first-class facilities. The decision is a win-win for soldiers."</p>
<p>Major-General Sebastian Roberts, the general officer commanding for London district, said: "The decision to retain Woolwich Station means that the army's 400-year-old links with the area can continue as strong as ever."</p>
<p>Woolwich has a long historical association with the military, with references to the ordnance there dating back to the 15th century.</p>
<p>In 2004, the MoD announced that the last remaining RA regiment at Woolwich station - 16 Regiment - would relocate to Thorney Island, West Sussex, while the home of the RA would move to Larkhill, in Wiltshire.</p>
<p>Woolwich Station covers 320 acres, 160 of which is an MoD-owned section of Woolwich Common.</p>
<p>Nick Raynsford, the local Labour MP for Greenwich and Woolwich, said he was "delighted" that Woolwich would not close.</p>
<p>He said: "This has been associated with the British army for 400 years. It would have been devastating, after all this uncertainty, for it to have gone."</p>

<p>William Joseph Franks was born in Pittsboro, North Carolina in 1830. He enlisted in the United States Navy on 16 September 1863.</p>
<p>Franks distinguished himself in action at Yazoo City on 6 March 1864 when he and his shipmates from the Marmora landed a 12-pound howitzer to defend the city, which was threatened by strong Confederate forces. He and his group were in the thickest of the fighting, but it was never enough to drive them from their cannon. The actions of Franks and his men came to play the most important role in maintaining the Union position. Franks was awarded the Medal of Honor and promoted to Acting Master’s Mate in recognition of his gallantry.</p>
<p>A DD-554 Fletcher-class Destroyer was named in his honor (USS Franks) and launched on 7 December 1942.</p>

<p>The Eta Gamma Chapter began as Chi Alpha Pi. They were known as the Red Cap Society because they wore Red Cap Ale patches on their blue shirts. The CAP's were founded June 16, 1966 at Elams Mill by: Bill Landers, Gene Neely, Bill Baskin, Paul Landers, and Jerry Hawk. By their second year at MTSU the CAP's had grown by more than thirty members strong. Their affilation with Sigma Chi began in the fall of 1967, they petitioned for a charter in the fall of 1969, and the first I-week began on March 30th, 1970 and ended on April 5th, 1970.</p>
<p>On January 7th, 2000, the first Greek Row opened on the campus of Middle Tennessee State University and welcomed the brothers of the Eta Gamma chapter into their new two-story home.</p>

<p>School Profile:</p>
<p>"Vermont Secondary College is a highly regarded single campus, co-educational state secondary college located in a quiet residential area within the City of Whitehorse; eastern suburbs of Melbourne. In 2002 the Eastern Region agreed to an enrolment ceiling of 1300 students as the demand for the college has continued to grow.</p>
<p>The College’s motto, “Lift Up Thine Eyes” exemplifies a forward-looking college community committed to maintaining a strong tradition of excellence through the achievement of enhanced educational outcomes for all students.</p>
<p>Vermont Secondary College was established in 1962 to provide education for students in a growing outer suburb of Melbourne. The college maintains its focus of providing for students from its local neighbourhood but also caters for students who travel from outside its local neighbourhood. There are several school buses that allow students to travel from adjoining suburbs to the college or to connect with trains on the Lilydale and Belgrave lines.</p>
<p>In a caring, friendly, orderly and supportive environment, the college sets and achieves high standards of student endeavour and behaviour. Students have the opportunity to develop their full potential academically, socially, physically and creatively. At Vermont Secondary College learning is valued as a life-long process that fosters self improvement and personal fulfilment.</p>
<p><br />
A strong sense of community identity exists and students take pride in themselves and their school, exercise self-discipline, accept personal responsibility and demonstrate concern for others.</p>
<p>A comprehensive, challenging and stimulating curriculum, delivered by dedicated and highly qualified teachers and supported by a strong team of non-teaching staff, fosters academic rigour and maximises levels of student achievement. The college also offers an expanding range of educational pathways for students.</p>
<p>Students in Years 7 and 8 undertake a core program in all eight key learning areas with a choice of Indonesian, German or French. The smooth transition to secondary school is facilitated through a Year 7 Integrated Studies program with an effective overlapping pastoral and curriculum focus. In Years 9 and 10, students undertake a balanced program with a judicious blend of core and elective studies.</p>
<p>Students achieve high academic standards with a proven record of outstanding Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) results leading to impressive levels of entry into tertiary institutions. Students consistently excel at levels significantly higher than state benchmarks and like schools.</p>
<p>High retention rates ensure a diverse range of VCE studies is offered, including VCE Vocational and Educational Training (VET) Units. The College is a member of the Mullum cluster which provides access to a broad range of VCE VET studies.</p>
<p>The individual needs of students are addressed in an environment of respect and encouragement. Support programs assist students experiencing difficulties with learning such as Literacy Intervention Middle Years (LIM) and English as a Second Language (ESL) support. Enrichment and extension programs cater for the needs of gifted and talented students with opportunities to accelerate from Year 10. All students in Year 9 undertake a Personal Enrichment Program (PEP). Student Services include counselling and support services for student wellbeing, work education (careers), Managed Individual Pathways and access to many community support agencies for welfare support, employment and training.</p>
<p><br />
The college’s acclaimed co-curricular programs offer students dynamic experiences through which their individual talents and interests can be further enriched. These programs include Performing Arts, Sport and Music. The Instrumental Music program is a feature of the college complemented by regular orchestral, choral and theatrical performances. A major feature of the College calendar is its annual theatrical production attracting widespread and enthusiastic participation by our students. The college is renowned for its strong emphasis on Sport with students distinguishing themselves at district, zone, state and national levels. An extensive camps and excursions program including an annual exchange with our sister school IGS Kaufungen in Germany provides enhanced learning and personal growth opportunities for students. Students have access to a developing range of special interest clubs.</p>
<p>The college places a high priority on student participation in decision-making and promotes the development of student leadership. Students are encouraged to take on leadership roles as form captains, Student Representative Council (SRC) members, sports coaches and peer support mentors. Senior school students are expected to be positive role models to younger students. Students are highly valued representatives on all major committees and on college council.</p>
<p>VSC views education as a partnership where collaborative decision making processes involving all sections of the college community ensure the effective development and implementation of policies and programs. VSC welcomes and encourages the involvement of parents in a wide range of committees, support groups, and voluntary or social activities. The college is strongly supported by a highly effective College council, complemented by a number of active parent groups, a dynamic Student Representative Council and a developing past-students network.</p>
<p>The college is attractively presented with native bush areas, well-established gardens, lawns, paved courtyard areas, barbecue facilities and sporting fields. Spacious all purpose classrooms, well-equipped specialist rooms, a modern computerised library, a VCE Centre, a well-equipped gymnasium, theatrette and music centre form a well maintained complex of buildings. Students, staff and community groups utilise the extensive range of modern computer technology. In 2002 the Victorian Government announced funding in excess of $3 million for the implementation of the first stage of the college master-plan. This incorporates a new Music centre and a redeveloped Arts and Technology wing.</p>
<p>Vermont Secondary College provides exceptional educational opportunities for its students, developing within them optimism, high self-esteem and community responsibility as they become confident, contributing and successful members of a changing global community."</p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The term Profession Agrologist refers to members of the self regulated <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agrology.html" title="Agrology">Agrology</a> profession in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. A Professional Agrologist (P.Ag.) is an individual dedicated to contributing to the prosperity of Canada’s agri-food industry by providing unbiased and professional expertise. Profession Agrologists are guided by a strict code of ethics to ensure that Canada’s agri-food and health products are of the utmost quality. P.Ags come from many diverse fields such as soil science, genetic research, animal science and agriculture business. The P.Ag. protects the interest of the public by licensing and safeguarding the competence of Agrologists. Professional Agrologists are committed to growing the industry and the business. Their purpose is also to enhance the quality of professional development for colleagues within the industry. Agrology is a self regulated profession and each province has a Provincial Agrologist Act which defines the scope of the professional and the practice of agrology. The act also defines the qualifications required for the right to practice.</p>
<p><b>Becoming a Professional Agrologist</b></p>
<p>While the process varies slightly between provinces becoming a Professional Agrologist requires a formal education in agriculture followed by an articling process. The articling process lasts approximately two years and is meant to develop a better understanding of the rights, responsibilities and obligations of a Professional Agrologist. While working with a mentor the Articling Agrologist (A.Ag.) gains experience and opportunities that will help integrate them into the profession. After completing the articling period and being evaluated by their peers the title of P.Ag. is bestowed granting with it the rights and responsibilities of a Professional Agrologist. Professional Agrologists have a continuing commitment to professional development a constantly seeks to improve upon their skills and education.</p>
<p><b>Internationally Educated Agrologists</b></p>
<p>Recently the Ontario Institute of Agrology (OIA) in Guelph launched a new initiative to attract and develop international Agrologists. Through this program newcomers to Ontario or current residents with agricultural degrees (or their equivalent) from Colleges, University or other educational institutes abroad can receive assistance from the OIA and Ontario’s professional Agrologists to get registered to practice the profession in Ontario. The program hopes to entice 300 new Agrologists over the next 3 years to add to the critically important group of Professional Agrologists. This is the first program of its kind for Agrologists in Canada although similar programs exist for engineers, teachers and medical professionals.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-30_eeab.html" title="Edit section: MORRISSEY - MULLEN (M&amp;M)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">MORRISSEY - MULLEN (M&amp;M)</span></h2>
<p><b>Morrissey - Mullen</b>, aka <b>M&amp;M</b>, Britain’s most outstanding jazz-funk/fusion group of the Seventies and Eighties, was formed by <b><a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Morrissey_469d.html" title="Dick Morrissey">Dick Morrissey</a></b> (tenor and soprano saxes and flute) and <b>Jim Mullen</b> (guitar), who joined forces in 1976 and played together for some 16 years with various regular line-ups featuring British jazz musicians such as <b>Martin Drew</b> on drums, and <b>John Critchinson</b> or <b>John Burch</b> on piano (with whom Dick Morrissey formed an octet in 1984), although none of the three appear on any of the albums.</p>
<p>They also used the band as a springboard for a new generation of young British musicians, including <b>Chris Fletcher</b> on percussion, <b>Gary Husband</b> on drums and <b>Carol Kenyon</b> as vocalist among others, until Dick Morrissey’s ill health required too many visits to hospital. When M&amp;M finally dissolved in 1986, Jim Mullen and Dick Morrissey continued meeting up for what would in effect be jam sessions with what they called, in their characteristically easy-going style, “<b>Our Band</b>”, usually featuring the same musicians that had accompanied them in M&amp;M.</p>
<p>The band actually came into being in New York where Dick Morrissey and Jim Mullen were recording and touring with their mutual friends in the <a href="../../../a/v/e/Average_White_Band_f71a.html" title="Average White Band">Average White Band</a>.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the recording and release of the first of seven Morrissey-Mullen albums (plus two EPs), <i>UP</i> (Atlantic, 1976), which featured the guys from AWB, plus <b>Luther Vandross</b> and <b>Cissy Houston</b> on vocals, together with some of the New York scene’s top session musicians, the Morrissey-Mullen Band spent eight months in New York, including a six-week residency at New York’s famed <b>Mikell’s</b>, which attracted the attention of many of the top musicians of the day, with <b>Boz Scaggs</b>, <b>Dave Sanborn</b>, <b>Steve Gadd</b>, <b>Richard Tee</b>, <b>Michael &amp; Randy Brecker</b> and many others dropping by for a jam.</p>
<p>On their return to the UK, and shunning the gruelling road, Morrissey-Mullen concentrated on the small-club circuit. In 1980, EMI persuaded them to enter the Abbey Road recording studios to make the first-ever digital recording of a non-classical music piece, a cover of the <b>Rose Royce</b> hit <i>Love doesn’t live here anymore</i>. Their 1981 album Badness reached number one in the UK disco charts.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Zeta Sigma Phi was founded on March 4, 1988 at New York University,in Weinstein Residence Hall, Room 402. The 29 founding sisters had a vision of a sisterhood that exemplified their collective goals and values -- strong friendships and social relationships, dedication and enthusiasm, a spirit of individuality, academic excellence, and service to the community. With the assistance of the NYU chapter of Zeta Psi fraternity, the founding sisters of the sorority formed the group, originally known as the Zeta Psi Sisterhood. Soon after, the sisterhood was officially integrated into the NYU Greek system as Zeta Sigma Phi.</p>
<p>Since 1988, we have preserved the aforementioned goals and values and have developed a community marked by diversity, individual and collective strength, loyalty, and true friendship among our members. We are primarily a social &amp; charity oriented sorority and strive to maintain a balance between social events, community service, and our academic responsibilities at NYU.</p>
<p>Since 1989, Zeta Sigma Phi has been fortunate enough to be granted a house in NYU's campus housing. The house serves as the home of many of the sisters, as well as a home-away-from-home for commuter sisters and those who live in other residence halls. From 1989 to 2001, the Zeta Sigma Phi house was located on the 13th floor of NYU's Third Avenue North residence hall. From 2001 to 2004, our house was located on the 6th floor of Palladium. We currently are located in Lafayette Residence Hall.</p>
<p>Zeta Sigma Phi's open motto, "Ut incepit fidelis, sic permanet," reflects our sisters' unwavering commitment to furthering the unity of the sorority and preserving the goals of the founding sisters. The motto, in translation, means "As loyal as she began, so she remains."</p>

<p>Monolith, California is roughly 4 miles east of Tehachapi, California.</p>
<p>Monolith began in the early 1900s as a location secured by the Los Angeles Board of Public Works. The location was a good source of limestone and clay needed for high quality cement to bring water from the Owens Valley to Los Angeles, a project finished in 1914.</p>
<p>In 1920 the U.S. Potash Company, renamed Monolith Portland Cement company the next year, set up at the site and was a major player for the cement needs for Southern Califoria. During WWII, it's output was used to construct a naval base on Guam.</p>
<p>The company town established in Monolith lasted to 1972 when the general store and houses were destroyed.</p>
<p>(Personal note: Monolith was easy to identify when driving from Bakersfield to Mojave on US Hwy 466(now CA Hwy 58) in the 1960s. Everywhere nearby was coated in white dust and visibility was often near zero when crossing the railroad tracks. Now the plant is empty, and wind turbines cover the hillsides. The air is generally clear.)</p>

<p>Hitler's Willing Executioners is a contraversial book that challenges the previous view of Germans as Hitler's innocent people that were all but unaware of concentration camps and mass-homicide and instead puts the view across that the German people were indeed, also anti-Semitic and supported the Nazi party whole-heartedly in the culling of the Jews for several reasons including: -Their uncanny success in business -Past rivalries with Germans and Jews -The killing of Jesus Christ by Jews (although this is a debatable subject)</p>

After a long period of examination, this committee narrowed transit options for the corridor from a broad universe of choices to just three: a no-build option where services are only incrementally improved, a <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus_Rapid_Transit_c425.html" title="Bus Rapid Transit">Bus Rapid Transit</a> (BRT) option, wherein buses run on semi-dedicated transitway, and a <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_Rail_Transit_df50.html" title="Light Rail Transit">Light Rail Transit</a> (LRT) option using Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs). In May of 2006 the CCCC concluded its study by publishing a Draft Environmental Impact Study, which concluded that LRT was the best option for the corridor.

<p>Champion's Presidency was notable for being the one to initiate the KCLSU Governance Review and spawn a process that is being repeated in student unions across the UK. Controversially, though, it was also the year that the historic medical students' bar at <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Thomas%27s_Hospital_d6aa.html" title="St Thomas's Hospital">St Thomas's Hospital</a> was closed, due to declining trade. Champion, though a War Studies student, enjoyed a large following from the medical school and hence this move was unpopular, though it was made on Health and Safety grounds.</p>
<p>His Presidency was also the first time in recent years that the student newspaper, "Roar", was permitted a greater degree of editorial independence. Subsequently, articles that questioned his regular enjoyment of alcohol in the KCLSU bars were published, polarising student opinion about the appropriateness of his indulgence. His former Deputy President, Rajesh Joshi, often openly criticised Champion's actions outside the political arena, leading even to an outright war of words in the student paper.</p>
<p>However, Champion did institute the tradition of the Macadam Cup, named for Sir <a href="../../../i/v/i/Ivison_Macadam_7bcb.html" title="Ivison Macadam">Ivison Macadam</a>, a fellow former President of KCLSU. The day of sporting rivalry between the medical students and non-medical students is now accepted as a regular sporting fixture and is considered by many to be his most well-known achievement.</p>
<p>In the 2005 elections, Champion stood for re-election to the part-time role of Equal Opportunities Officer, which he lost. He also faced two motions of censure at KCLSU Executive Committee meetings, one at Student Representative Council (SRC) and was threatened with a motion of <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_confidence.html" title="No confidence">no confidence</a> at the final SRC of the year, which was withdrawn before the vote. He was, however, awarded Honourary Life Membership of KCLSU, along with the majority of the other full-time officers that year. This is the highest award that KCLSU can present.</p>

<p>On the back of his election to KCLSU, he stood and won a seat on the National Management Executive of Conservative Future. Part of his manifesto included the belief that "there's nothing wrong with a bit of lefty-bashing". He also promised more social events, one of which was held at KCLSU as a private function.</p>
<p>That year, Champion was selected as the official candidate for NUS President by Conservative Future. As <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kat_Fletcher_d752.html" title="Kat Fletcher">Kat Fletcher</a> was widely-expected to win a second (and final) term in office, a low-profile campaign was run with Champion openly admitting he expected to lose. In a widely reported misjudgement, he attended the informal hustings at NUS National Conference in a state of inebrieation, earning him notoriety across national student politics. To his credit, he gained 76 votes, a few dozen more than the fall-back option of "Re-open Nomination", but an order of magnitude less than the incumbent President.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-30_eeab.html" title="Edit section: Carnoustie Theatre Club">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Carnoustie Theatre Club</span></h2>
<p><b>Carnoustie Theatre Club</b>, is a small amateur theatre club based in <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnoustie.html" title="Carnoustie">Carnoustie</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angus.html" title="Angus">Angus</a> <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a></p>
<p>It owns its own theatre the curiously named <b>Dibble Tree Theatre</b> situated in the towns high street.</p>
<p>The clubs original constitution urged it to 'own and run its own theatre'. Over the years many attempts were made to do this. One hopeful but ultimately hopeless effort was the lease of the then defunct Dominion Cinema. It looked good during that beautifully dry summer. When the Autumn rains came, so did the internal floods. There weren't enough buckets and basins in <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnoustie.html" title="Carnoustie">Carnoustie</a> to keep our beautifully decorated and much loved clubrooms a viable prospect.</p>
<p>But in 1991 we acquired our present property and had it redesigned and rebuilt it in its present form as a comfortable 48 seat theatre. The club is a member of both the National Operatic and Dramatic Association and the Scottish Community Drama Association</p>
<p>Our annual programme of productions includes a pantomime in December at Carnoustie High School Theatre, full length plays in May, June and October and one-act plays in February, all in Dibble Tree Theatre.</p>
<p>How did the theatre get it's peculiar name? For this we have to understand a bit of Carnoustie folklore. In Napoleonic times Carnoustie was a much smaller coastal farming village and Thomas Lousen, a Sea Fencible (coastguard) and small time farmer was trying to plant out a relatively infertile plot of land close to the village. Thomas was using a willow 'dibble' (planting stick) and in the planting process grew tired, fell asleep and when he awoke forgot where he had left his dibble. Some months later he found it again but as is the wont of willow, it had rooted.</p>
<p>This became Carnoustie's Dibble Tree. David Lowson, Thomas's great, great grandson, now a man in his seventies, lives close to the site of the Dibble Tree which grows just on the edge of the theatre grounds. Over the years he tended the tree which has suffererd lightning strikes and other injuries and now shows it's great age.</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Club, in seeking to find a suitable name for the theatre wished to link it strongly to the town and so it wasn't difficult to choose 'Dibble Tree' Theatre, as the name. David Lowson and his wife performed the official opening of the theatre at a Grand Gala Fete 18 months after the start of work.</p>

<p>Human beings demonstrate remarkable abilities to move in different kinds of terrains with dexterity. Most parts of the earth, and other planets, are comprised of anomalous terrains. Wheels are faster on level ground, and wings or rotors avail the third dimension of motion, but legs have demonstrated agility moving about the surface of the earth and are unsurpassed by any other form of locomotion [1]. Research in the field of legged locomotion can lead to development of machines capable of traversing harsh terrains. Pertinent to the legged machines, walking robots are good for moderate speeds across the terrain but they cannot cross the holes wider than their reach [1]. Particularly, the hopping machines are better than the walking machines because they can jump across holes, climb up and down steps, and their movement is not limited by the physical span of their legs but only by their capacity to store the energy and to release that energy when needed.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> Youth Orchestra is one of the world’s most prestigious and dynamic Orchestras. It unites Europe’s most talented young musicians from all 25 <a href="../../../e/u/_/EU_countries_57ba.html" title="EU countries">EU countries</a>, under some of the world’s most famous conductors, in an Orchestra which transcends cultural boundaries and performs all over the world. The level demanded of the players, combined with the renowned musical leadership of its conductors, has won the EUYO an outstanding musical and educational reputation and regular comparisons with the world’s finest Orchestras.</p>
<p>The Foundation of the EUYO The European Community Youth Orchestra (later to become the European Union Youth Orchestra) was founded in 1978 by Lionel and Joy Bryer, Chairman and Secretary General of the International Youth Foundation of Great Britain, with a view to creating an Orchestra which would represent the European ideal of a community working together to achieve peace and social understanding. At the same time it was also designed to provide an invaluable professional development experience for young orchestral musicians.</p>
<p>The proposal for the creation of the Orchestra was first put to the Committee on Cultural Affairs and Youth of the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Parliament_a87a.html" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a> in 1974. As a result of an all-party effort, a resolution was adopted by the European Parliament by an overwhelming majority on 8 March 1976 during its plenary session. The European Commission officially confirmed the Patronage of the Orchestra in April 1976. The EUYO's Honorary President is the President of the European Parliament and its Honorary Patrons the Prime Ministers of each of the EU member states, headed by the President of the European Commission.</p>
<p>“This Orchestra has an outstanding reputation for excellence and for fostering a new kind of creative co-operation across borders with all the energy and potential that brings.” Josep Borrell Fontelles, President of the European Parliament and Honorary President of the EUYO</p>
<p><br />
The Musical Pedigree of the EUYO Lionel and Joy Bryer then began to work with Maestro Claudio Abbado, the Orchestra’s Founding Music Director, and its first President, the Rt. Hon. <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Edward_Heath_c915.html" title="Sir Edward Heath">Sir Edward Heath</a> KG MBE, to help establish the Orchestra as a world-class institution. <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claudio_Abbado_ee1d.html" title="Claudio Abbado">Claudio Abbado</a> was succeeded as Music Director by Bernard Haitink KBE in 1994, who in turn was succeeded by the EUYO’s present Music Director, Maestro <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Ashkenazy_b462.html" title="Vladimir Ashkenazy">Vladimir Ashkenazy</a> in 2000.</p>

<p>Ynnead is the Eldar "god" of the dead that is being cultivated in the eye of terror by the Ulthwe (damned Eldar). It is believed that Ynnead is "sleeping" until the time when enough soul stones can be collected and inserted into their infinity circuits that he can be awoken. Ynnead is not a "natural" god. He is the only god purposely created by the Eldar on a conscious level. It should be noted that Ynnead is not the god of death or of killing/murder, etc, but the god of the dead.</p>
<p>It is rumored that Ynnead is supposed to save the Eldar race somehow. This is taken as a saving of life, which would be quite ironic for the god of the dead. Rather than except this irony another idea is the belief that he is meant to save their "souls", and not their lives, as all Eldar "souls" go to the Chaos God Slaanesh upon an Eldars death.</p>

<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>Jeet Kune Do Concepts is a complete self defense process for the streets. It covers components from (CSW) Combat Submission Wrestling, Kali, Muay Thai boxing, Savate, Boxing, Jun Fan Gung Fu, Wing Chun and Defensive Tactics from the Law Enforcement field. The purpose of this art is to integrate different techniques and tactics from many sources to produce a style that is suitable for an individual, allowing them to defend themselves in kicking, boxing, clinch and grappling/groundfighting ranges, with or without weapons, against one or many opponents.</p>
<p><b>History</b></p>
<p>JKD means the way of the intercepting fist and was developed by Bruce Lee. His thinking was to combine techniques taken from some other martial arts such as the trapping and short-range punches of Wing Chun, the kicks of Savate, and footwork and rhythm of Western Boxing. More importantly JKD not only combines aspects of different styles, it also simplifies many of those aspects that it adopts by stripping what is unnecessary. Ultimately JKD preaches that a fighter should do whatever is necessary to defend him or herself. It should not be a specific set of styles, but rather the fighter should choose the tools necessary and disregard what is not useful to them in a fight. Many proclaim Bruce Lee and his JKD philosophy as the beginning of modern mixed martial arts.</p>
<p><br />
Bruce Lee</p>
<p>The JKD Concepts branch, was initiated by Dan Inosanto, Larry Hartsell, Paul Vunak and Burton Richardson. They have continued to teach JKD under the philosophy that it was never meant to be a static art but an ongoing evolution.</p>

<p><b>3AC</b> 3AC<b>Bold text</b> formerely threesacroud Are an unsigned melodic quartet from The conwy area in North wales. The band started in september 2004, and consist of guitarist and vocalist craig pheasey, lead guitarist david podbury, bassist and vocalist craig hughes and drummer geraint roberts. As stated by the band on numerous occasions the name has nothing to do with the ammount of members in the band. Four friends from local secondary school Ysgol Aberconwy, each sharing a keen interest in performing music, taking their influences from such bands as <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blink_182.html" title="Blink 182">blink 182</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_found_glory.html" title="New found glory">new found glory</a>, <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellowcard.html" title="Yellowcard">yellowcard</a>, the starting line. From 2004/2005 The band travelled 15 miles every sunday night to the hills of llanrwst be able to practise in drummer geraint robert's garage, where sessions would last up to seven hours.</p>
<p>With their live performance described as combing energy, melody and noise with catchy choruses the band have given themselves the tittle of being "3AC, As infectiously catchy as chlamydia". So far the band have played numerous gigs around the conwy area including the Dwygyfylchi Legend Inn, MASE, and the now annual penfest with their performance awarding a front cover appearance on local news paper the north wales pioneer.</p>
<p>The band originally released a rough 3 track demo including songs hot rox, ripped words, as well as the live favourite bunk bed, and have since stepped into the studio to start work on an, as yet untittled, E.P for the summer of 2006 with new tracks such as finding emo, batting for the other team, s..m.b, and others to be announced.</p>
<p>More information on the band can be found online. [www.myspace.com/3acmusic] [www.3acmusic.tk] [www.purevolume.com/3ac]</p>
