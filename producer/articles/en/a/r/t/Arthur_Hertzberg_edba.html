<p>Avraham Hertzberg was born in <a href="../../../l/u/b/Lubaczow.html" title="Lubaczow">Lubaczow</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>, the eldest of five children, and left Europe in 1926 with his mother and grandmother to join his father in the United States, where his name was Americanized to Arthur. Hertzberg recalled that as a teenager in an <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Judaism_0be8.html" title="Orthodox Judaism">Orthodox</a> <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> neighborhood in <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore%2C_Maryland_9c87.html" title="Baltimore, Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a>, he would not accept the notion that the literary world of <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">talmudic</a> learning, the <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">kabbalistic</a> books and the writing of the <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidic_Judaism_a5c0.html" title="Hasidic Judaism">chasidim</a> were less worthy as compared to the <i><a href="../../../i/l/i/Iliad.html" title="Iliad">Iliad</a>,</i> the <i><a href="../../../o/d/y/Odyssey.html" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a></i> or <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dante_Alighieri_bba0.html" title="Dante Alighieri">Dante</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Divine_Comedy_73d7.html" title="The Divine Comedy">Inferno</a>.</i> His father was an Orthodox <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi.html" title="Rabbi">rabbi</a> trained in <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Europe_ef2f.html" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a>, who taught Arthur to appreciate the richness of the Talmud and the other great works of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>. Although Hertzberg would later stray from his Orthodox upbringing and be ordained as a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Judaism_e32a.html" title="Conservative Judaism">Conservative</a> rabbi, he "never used my 'heresy' as the excuse to prefer the majority culture to my own." He was married to the former Phyllis Cannon from <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a> until his death. They are the parents of two daughters Dr. Linda Beth and Susan Riva, and they have four grandchildren.

Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg in 1972</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hertzberg's love of Judaism and the Jewish texts was at the core of his controversial life as a rabbi, scholar, educator and Jewish communal leader. Over the course of his 50 plus year career, Rabbi Hertzberg served as a congregational rabbi, president of both the American Jewish Policy Foundation and the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Jewish_Congress_7afa.html" title="American Jewish Congress">American Jewish Congress</a>, vice president of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Jewish_Congress_7c62.html" title="World Jewish Congress">World Jewish Congress</a> and a leading representative of world Jewry in the historic <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian-Jewish_reconciliation_402e.html#The_Catholic_Church" title="Christian-Jewish reconciliation">Catholic-Jewish dialogue</a> that commenced during the papacy of <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_XXIII_ce7b.html" title="Pope John XXIII">Pope John XXIII</a>. As a major public figure in the world of Jewish organizational life, Hertzberg was at the center of the crucial events shaping American Jewish life since the end of World War II. He participated in the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillel_Kook_55a9.html#The_Day_the_Rabbis_Marched" title="Hillel Kook">Rabbis' March</a>, walked with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr._19fa.html" title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>, in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_on_Washington_1a78.html" title="March on Washington">March on Washington</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloody_Sunday_%281965%29_9ff4.html" title="Bloody Sunday (1965)">Bloody Sunday</a> at the height of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_civil_rights_movement.html" title="American civil rights movement">American civil rights movement</a>, and also served as an intermediary between the American Jewish Community and Secretary of State <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Kissinger_71ce.html" title="Henry Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a>. Hertzberg played a major role in some of the most significant issues the world Jewish community faced in the decades following World War II, including discussions with the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> over the still unresolved conflict over the Vatican's release of documents pertaining to <a href="../../../p/i/u/Pius_XII_20fd.html" title="Pius XII">Pius XII</a> and the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, as well as his outspoken criticism of the policies of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> toward the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinians.html" title="Palestinians">Palestinians</a>.</p>
<p>Hertzberg also made his mark in Jewish scholarship. His landmark book, <i>The French Enlightenment and the Jews: The Origins of Modern Anti-Semitism</i> (1968), argued that the source of modern antisemitism could be traced to the ideas of such <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Enlightenment_2fd3.html" title="Age of Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a> philosophers as Voltaire. Similarly, his <i>The Zionist Idea: A Historical Analysis and Reader</i> (1970) pioneered the study of Zionism and provided generations of students with the understanding that modern Zionism was a secular movement to remake Jewish identity into one of the many modern secular nationalisms. Finally, although a self-styled pragmatic liberal, Hertzberg saw no contradiction between his political convictions and his reverence for a Jewish tradition shorn of its religious fundamentalism.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/o/r/Mordecai_Kaplan_c107.html" title="Mordecai Kaplan">Mordecai Kaplan</a> was also an influence on the young Hertzberg, who attended the Jewish Theological Seminary, where Kaplan taught and served as dean. Kaplan had proved, writes Hertzberg, that with talent and guts, you can be your own man even in mainstream America. Both from Kaplan and later from the eminent scholar of Jewish history, <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~smo2002/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.columbia.edu/~smo2002/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Salo W. Baron</a>, Hertzberg accepted the hypothesis that cultural and religious identity in America would exist in the future "only if they were redefined and reconstructed." Because the two men shared a genuine respect both for tradition and for intellectual rigor, during Kaplan's lectures on <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstructionist_Judaism_c62c.html" title="Reconstructionist Judaism">Reconstructionist</a> philosophy, Hertzberg was welcome to speak up, in that situation advocating more traditional views.</p>
<p>Kaplan's influence is apparent when considering the breadth of Hertzberg's public career and reputation as gadfly. Never one to eschew unpopular stands when it came to core issues that impacted on the Jewish community, Hertzberg's reputation as a maverick was perhaps most in evidence in the aftermath of the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six-Day_War_9c92.html" title="Six-Day War">Six-Day War</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> when he called for the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, a position that was anathema among most America Jews. He had recounted his public battles with both <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golda_Meir_0ec1.html" title="Golda Meir">Golda Meir</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menachem_Begin_0c8c.html" title="Menachem Begin">Menachem Begin</a> over their policies toward the Palestinians:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I was largely in opposition to the dominant policies. I found myself restating this view year by year, as repeated attempts were made to silence me in <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and by its lackeys in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York%2C_New_York_5001.html" title="New York, New York">New York</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington</a>. I insisted that we in the Diaspora could represent the best interest of the Jews worldwide — never mind the political and moral foolishness that governments in power might be proclaiming … I also had no fear that I was committing treason by denouncing what I knew was wrong and foolish, and I laughed off the label "maverick".</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Hertzberg's early support for accommodation with the Palestinians, coming from a leader of the American Jewish establishment, subsequently added credibility to the Israeli peace movement.</p>
<p>Hertzberg challenged the wisdom of what he viewed as banking the future of Jewish continuity on the twin pillars of unquestioned support for Israel and the veneration of the Holocaust. Referring to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., as "the national cathedral of American Jewry's Jewishness", Hertzberg questioned whether the memory of the Holocaust was sufficient to keep Jews "on the reservation." Citing demographic studies, he contended that the proliferation of courses on the Holocaust would not be sufficient to stop a large number of Jews from leaving the Jewish community.</p>
<p>Arthur Hertzberg graduated from <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johns_Hopkins_University_14b6.html" title="Johns Hopkins University">Johns Hopkins University</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, received rabbinic ordination from the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Theological_Seminary_dd15.html" title="Jewish Theological Seminary">Jewish Theological Seminary</a> in 1943 and a Ph.D. in history from <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_082c.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a> in 1966. He began his career as the director of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Hillel%7E_The_Foundation_for_Jewish_Campus_Life_8307.html" title="Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life">campus Hillel</a> for <a href="../../../a/m/h/Amherst_College_b06a.html" title="Amherst College">Amherst College</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Massachusetts_d915.html" title="University of Massachusetts">University of Massachusetts</a>, and taught at <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_University_960f.html" title="Princeton University">Princeton</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/t/Rutgers_University_ce58.html" title="Rutgers University">Rutgers</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_082c.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_University_3eaa.html" title="Hebrew University">Hebrew University</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_College_efeb.html" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth</a>. He was the Bronfman Visiting Professor of the Humanities at <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_University_dca5.html" title="New York University">New York University</a> from 1991 until his death in 2006.</p>
<p>In addition to his academic posts, Rabbi Hertzberg was a rabbi for congregations in <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville.html" title="Nashville">Nashville</a>, served as a chaplain in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_81b3.html" title="United States Air Force">United States Air Force</a> from 1951 to 1953, and was rabbi of Temple Emanu-El in <a href="../../../e/n/g/Englewood%2C_New_Jersey_613a.html" title="Englewood, New Jersey">Englewood, New Jersey</a>, from 1956 to 1985, where he remained as rabbi emeritus until his death. He also served as president of the American Jewish Policy Foundation since 1978, president of the American Jewish Congress from 1972 to '78, and vice president of the World Jewish Congress from 1975 to 1991.</p>
<p>Rabbi Hertzberg was a prolific author and wrote, edited or co-edited over thirteen books. Hertzberg had planned to write two more books and had partially completed one at the time of his death, entitled "This I Believe," an exploration of his personal theology. He had also intended to write a book explicating the Talmud to an educated but non-Orthodox Jewish audience, preserving the integrity of the source material but also demonstrating its relevance and accessibility to modern readers. <a href="http://www.jstandard.com/articles/933/1/A-JEW-IN-AMERICA" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jstandard.com/articles/933/1/A-JEW-IN-AMERICA" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>In his memoir <i>A Jew in America</i>, Hertzberg frequently referred to American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson, a descendant of American Puritans who revolted against his heritage and became a Unitarian, wrote that "every man is a conveyance on which all his ancestors ride." Hertzberg said he may not have opted to agree with every word of his Jewish forebears but wrote "my respect and reverence for them is the foundation of my being." <a href="http://www.forward.com/issues/2002/02.10.04/arts1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.forward.com/issues/2002/02.10.04/arts1.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

<p>In addition to being a public figure, Hertzberg maintained a personal religious practice that included daily morning prayer, during which he would don phylacteries, or <a href="../../../t/e/f/Tefillin.html" title="Tefillin">tefillin</a>. He once told the story of a plane trip on which he discovered that the time for prayer had arrived, but his tefillin were in his stowed luggage. Looking around, he saw a man praying with tefillin, and then carefully repacking them. He begged the man's pardon and asked whether he could borrow these usually personal articles. Upon being granted permission, he prayed and returned them gratefully.</p>
<p>But there was more to the story. The tefillin, it turned out, were not just old. They were of an illustrious lineage. Through his devotion to practice, and the accident of having stowed his own tefillin, Arthur Hertzberg had been lent, and had davened in, the tefillin of the <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baal_Shem_Tov_66e3.html" title="Baal Shem Tov">Baal Shem Tov</a>, the revered founder of chasidism.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
