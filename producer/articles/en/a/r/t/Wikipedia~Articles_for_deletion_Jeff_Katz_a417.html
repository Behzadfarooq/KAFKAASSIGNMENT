<li><b>Comment</b> Sailordude here: I have edited this page many times to reflect the facts contained on radio station WBT's own web site; I also KNOW Mr. Katz. I have spoken to him about the continual editing by the user of IP 67.102.230.77, who is apparently residing in San Francisco and has a grudge against Mr. Katz. I have made Mr. Katz himself aware of what is currently going on with this page, and I think that A) HE should ahve the last say as to what is contained on this page, and the page frozen, and B) the owner of 67.102.230.77 be penalized in some way, for what he is doing. I also have a strong hunch that user 208.66.31.54 and 67.102.230.77 are the same person. It appears that the IP begining with 67 is done from work, then he goes home where his Ip is the 208. Just an edjumacated hunch. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESailordude_694b.html" title="User:Sailordude">Sailordude</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/i/User_talk%7ESailordude_4aea.html" title="User talk:Sailordude">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sailordude_8e5f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sailordude">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am the one (gmss0205) that posted that updated info about Jeff Katz from the WBT home page, that you are refering to as copyright infringement. I am friends with Jeff, and he approved the content. If you need to contact him, his email (which is public knowledge) is jeffkatz@wbt.com. He will verify that he approved the content. Let me know what else I can do to help. I don't want to create any false perceptions, or have you believe that the information was taken from WBT without their approval. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.105.195.2 (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.105.195.2.html" title="User talk:64.105.195.2">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.105.195.2_22ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.105.195.2">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>Hello, gmss0205, thank you for commenting on my talk page. Getting permission from Jeff isn't enough. To be included in Wikipedia, the material must be released under the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Wikipedia%7EText_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License_702a.html" title="Wikipedia:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License">GNU Free Documentation License</a> which would be hard to do unless you can convince Jeff and WBT to do so. Also, that's besides the point. <i>The point</i> is that the material you're referring to isn't written in an encyclopedic <a href="../../../t/o/n/WP%7ETONE_f8b3.html" title="WP:TONE">tone</a> anyways. All content must be in a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable published sources</a> which the WBT text doesn't quite achieve. You're not trying to copy very much material, so I'd suggest rewriting your own text from scratch.

<dd>Thanks Arichnad. Quick question. Do I go back and edit the main "Jeff Katz" page, or should I do the text elsewhere to show it to you first? Let me know what you think is best. I will also make sure that Jeff approves the text before I send it to you.

<dd>No need to get Jeff's approval. Keep in mind, this is supposed to be an unbiased account of Jeff Katz. If Jeff "needs" to approve it, then it won't be very unbiased, will it?

<dd>Sailordude again: Once an accepted, legally acceptable entry is created, will this page be able to be frozen to the editing of the likes of 67.102.230.77? On the mention of Jeff Katz' information not being in an encylopedia, well, neither is Ray Taliaferro, who is another radio host, but resides on KGO 810 in San Francisco, yet there he is on Wikipedia as well! Thanks for the chance to input on this issue.
<dl>
<dd>No, it won't be frozen from editing.

<dd>I (gmss0205) made some edits and reposted a new version. Let me know if this version is acceptable. There is nothing "editorial" in there. It is all just factual information. I think Sailordude's point (which I agree with) is that is appears that someone out there is probably just going to vandalize this page again, once it is up. What can be done about that?

<dd>Thanks. I will try to figure out the best way to cite reference. Not sure the best way to do that. Also, I honestly don't know how to add a vandalizism warning. Would you be able to help with that, as this page has obviously been the target of vandalism, and probably will be again in the future? Any help is appreciated (if you are allowed to do that). Thanks again - gmss0205

<dd>I can help you cite references. If you put them here or on the page, I'll help fit them into the style usually seen on wikipedia.

<dd>I'll forward the references and cites presently. The information was pulled from transcripts of his shows and the station records from his various places of employ.

<dd>There was a question as to what defined "special needs". As such, I explained what was meant by that terminology. It is not a diagnosis nor is it meant to be hurtful wording merely a statement of fact and used as a description. His ratings in San Francisco were something less than stellar and there is no denying that. The fact that he was dropped as a fill-in host speaks to that. His audience at WBT has been steadily dropping - particularly in light of the attempts that have been made at cross-promoting him. I have seen the articles but I've also seen the facts and figures. I'm not sure why you have felt it necessary to blow this entire issue out of proportion. My entries have never been about any sort of personal attack - I have simply been trying to present the facts in the most accurate and concise manner possible. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.102.230.77 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.102.230.77.html" title="User talk:67.102.230.77">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.102.230.77_9405.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.102.230.77">contribs</a>).</small></dd>
