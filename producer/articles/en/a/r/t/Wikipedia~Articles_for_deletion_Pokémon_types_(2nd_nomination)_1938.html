<p>This article was nominated for deletion in October 2006 (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Pok%C3%A9mon_types_7ea8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pokémon types">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pokémon types</a>). It was closed as "<i>no consensus whether to delete or merge</i>", but very much not a 'keep'. Not a single jot of this has been merged. Three months is enough time, and so I am re-nominating it for deletion. As the prior nomination stated, this article/game guide is entirely <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> and violates Wikipedia policies, specifically <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which explicitly states that Wikipedia is not a venue for game guide information. No real-world perspective, at all, way too detailed for 'aiding understanding', utter fancruft. Please don't recommend merging with <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon_game_mechanics.html" title="Pokemon game mechanics">Pokemon game mechanics</a> - that article is already oversized and has sufficient information of this type already; plus, merging in unreferenced original research is a Very Bad Idea. <b>Strong delete</b> this. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 10:19, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I regret not being able to discuss this article the first time it came around for AFD because many of the "votes" made there were not supported by any arguements and didn't add anything constructive to the conversation. First point, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, while I will personally apologize for the lack of resources (i've been editing this and related articles lately and been lazy), their absence does not automatically make this OR, <i>most</i> of the information is able to be used from the video games themselves and from their respective instruction manuals. The parts I would concede to removing would be things like, "Ground-type Pokémon are tough Pokémon affiliated with the soil." This amounts to something that has to be <i>analyzed</i> from reading a wealth of Pokedex information and <i>does</i> constitute OR. However, listing examples is purely descriptive and easily verifiable. As for the non-list info:
<ul>
<li>Physical and Special Attack (instruction manual)
<ul>
<li>List of types in relation to Phys/Special (serebii.net)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pokemon types and damage multipliers (video games, serebii.net)</li>
<li>Imabalance in early gameplay (video games, anime, instruction manuals)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Please re-read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> <i>carefully</i> and realize that wikipedia is not a place for <i>instruction</i>. Where in the article is anyone being told "how to-do" anything? This article exists seperately because the information is too exetensive to appropritely contain within another article (i.e. too big and therefore distracting). IMO, there seems to exist a double-standard, have you ever looked at <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly.html" title="Monopoly">Monopoly</a>? Or how about the vast variety of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Category%7EChess_openings_db30.html" title="Category:Chess openings">Category:Chess openings</a>? And I'm sure you're aware of the example at wikimedia that talks about <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper#Organization" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper#Organization" rel="nofollow">rules and strategies of poker</a>. The point is that it's <i>fine</i> to discuss the details of a game as long as someone has done it before. Editors are just not allowed to give advice, instruction, or thier own opinions (OR).</dd>
<dd>Now on to sources (sorry this is so long, but it appears you need a thorough response or i don't have a <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>). Both Edison and Proto have now probably realized that this article <i>is</i> sourcable. But there undoubtedly remains some reservations about my sources and whether they follow <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Firstly, to Edison, primary sources are <i>perfectly suitable</i> for describing, which is almost all this article does, so complaining of a lack of them is irrelevant, especially when it's about a game. Secondly, one may notice my use of <a href="http://www.serebii.net" class="external text" title="http://www.serebii.net" rel="nofollow">serebii</a> as a RS. While fansites are generally <i>discouraged</i> I have yet to find a policy that <i>forbids</i> them.

<dd>I've added references, but I'm not sure how you'd like me to do the references it makes to the anime.

<li><b>Comment</b> If we were debating the keeping of a book, a church, a professor, a choral group, an artist, or a shopping mall, the citing of fan websites would not count for much with respect to reliable independent sources, and the citing of game guides from the company or the instruction manual for a game would not count much for independent sources or for notability. Observations from looking or playing the game are clearly original research. People are always saying "If we have all those Pokemon articles, why can't we keep this article" with respect to articles with way better sources than these. Why should computer game or video game characters/weapons/equipment/tactics get a pass from notability, verifiability, and reliable sources on the basis of ILIKEIT? <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:20, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason that fansites don't tend to count for much is because they are not stable, are not not subject to independent fact-checking, do not declare their source of information, are error-prone, and often-times uncorroborated. However, <i>none</i> of these apply to serebii.net. They are a reputable site within the pokemon community and considered reliable in their source information. Nintendo, by nature, does not tend to divulge information or talk about it's products in more than commercializing manners. And what does the source have to do with notability? You lost me on that one. Observations do <i>not</i> qualify as original research. From <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>:</li>

<dd>I would say that the physical/special attacks of Pokemon (probably in the individual articles too), list of types in relation to Phys/Special, the types and damage multiplier is solely of use to those who are playing the game (and it's in their manuals anyway) is very much game guide information. The imbalance in early gameplay? That sounds like original research based on assumptions from playing the game (please correct me if I am wrong). And the differences between the anime and the game is information already covered in sufficient depth at the parent article, <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 19:23, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>ok, so what use are things like Chess openings, and the cost of the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly.html" title="Monopoly">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> to people who will never play the game? What use is knowing exactly how many floors the Empire State Building has if I'm never going to go there? Isn't it enough to say it's really tall? Or what use is reading about <a href="../../../p/o/k/Poker_strategy.html" title="Poker strategy">Poker strategy</a> if i'm never going to play? Jimmy said we can have that... but not a simple breakdown of Pokemon types? It's been written about, so it can be included. And FYI, phys/special breakdown and damage multipliers are not included in the game manuals. That's why they needed to be referenced. Again, WP:NOT isn't about who the article will ultimately appeal to (many of the advanced mathematics categories are much to technical for the "general audience"), game-guide is about <i>instruction</i> and <i>advice</i>. If i was to write that players should use <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donphan.html" title="Donphan">Donphan</a> against a <a href="../../../r/a/i/Raichu.html" title="Raichu">Raichu</a> because it's immune to electrical attacks, <i>that</i> would be game guide. You say that the differences between the anime and games is covered in the main article. Where? There is nothing that deals with the specific point that the anime treats types much more loosely, often even ignoring some of the basic principles. Nor is there the discussion of physical.special breakdown, and how it has changed since Diamond/Pearl. This small bit of info <i>is</i> discussed at Game mechanics, but as argued before, to include the amount of info deserving of the topic would grossly imbalance the article and distract, like Kyaa has humurously pointed out. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ΖαππερΝαππερ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 20:40, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> As has been said, this is clearly to extend the Pokemon Game Dynamics. It shouldn't be deleted on purposes of OR because this is how the game type system works. It is useful information, but content on the page that are opinions should be deleted. Otherwise, it stands to be a valid article of information of how the Pokemon types interact with each other - not a game guide (there are parts that read like a game guide and should be deleted). Why don't we go around and nominate ALL the subsections in Pokemon Game Dynamics then as they are the same kind of article as this one? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.7.120.157_92d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.7.120.157">24.7.120.157</a> (talk) 07:48, 10 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
