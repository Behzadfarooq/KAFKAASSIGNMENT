<p>Non notable IRA terrorist. Seems to be written to make a POV attack on the British Police <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 13:35, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. O'Neill became notable only in death, because of the dispute over whether the police acted correctly in firing at him; a major campaign was organised by his friends to try to get official acknowledgment that the police acted wrongly. The case has been <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR450142000?open&amp;of=ENG-384" class="external text" title="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR450142000?open&amp;of=ENG-384" rel="nofollow">taken up</a> by Amnesty International. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 13:51, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think terrorists are fairly notable in any case and this one is a particular case. Could definitely do with a cleanup and probably a more thorough de-poving. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 13:52, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>- the way things are going, Wikipeida is turning into some sort of IRA memorial site. Although some terrorists are notable, most of them are not- this man didn't even seem to have committed an attrocity that would have made him notable. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 13:56, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>That comment actually disgusted me and really give me an incite into your vantage point with regards this type of topic. Do you think the only way a republicans can attain notability is by committing an "atrocity"?? This guy was pulled out of his bed and killed, so who is it that commits the atrocities. My advice would be to try and avoid POV and stick to fact in these types of issue. I have had to learn that lesson the hard way. regards--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 21:49, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I have sympathy for Astrotrain's position here and I can see the logic in that Astrotrain does not feel that this person was notable as a terrorist and as wikipedia is not a memorial, merely dying does not constitute notability. My position is that the death itself is notable, and I have a low threshold for the notability of terrorists. Though the language might not be sufficiently neutral, I don't think it is right to assume other than good faith. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 11:02, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I think this could be alright if rewritten in NPOV.

<li><b>Keep</b> - references show broad news coverage.

<li><b>comment</b> sorta maybe leaning towards keep, but really, it needs to say something more than x was an IRA volunteer killed by the British Police. I would also STRONGLY suggest we use the term "IRA member" rather than either of the terms terrorist or volunteer as both of them seem to be POV to me. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 22:32, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per above. I'm beginning to think that <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">User:Astrotrain</a>'s POV is so strong as to render pretty much any AfD by him as a bad-faith nomination. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 21:52, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please vote only on the article in question- not the nominator. There is no bad faith on my part- I agree for articles to be included for notable terrorists - and have only nominated articles that clearly cannot go anywhere. Other than being shot, what else has this person done to meet the critera in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>? <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 22:56, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When the nominator has a pattern of making nominations justified by his political feelings in the case, it is appropriate to regard further nominations as being against Wikipedia's NPOV policy, and thus, being in bad faith. If you'd show some selectivity about the articles you nominated, or hadn't expressed your opinions in the ways you have, I'd think that your blanket nominations of articles on IRA members was just an excess of deletionist zeal, especially since at least some of your nominations appear to be reasonable. But it's pretty clear that your nominations are based on anti-IRA animus, not on the merits of the case. I get the impression you'd AfD <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerry_Adams_0812.html" title="Gerry Adams">Gerry Adams</a> if you thought it wouldn't get you laughed out of Wikipedia.</li>

<dd>When they say delete per nom they are saying that it should be deleted per the nomination that this article seems to be written as a PoV attack on the British police. I agree to a certain extent but think it more important to realise he didn't accomplish anything of note. You say it is important as it raises questions of whether the police should've killed him...Surely all the victims of terrorsim deserve individual articles if this is allowed - there are certainly questions over their deaths! This deserves a few lines in another article, it doesn't need an article for itself.--<a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECouter-revolutionary_5112.html" title="User:Couter-revolutionary">Couter-revolutionary</a> 10:11, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And something being written in a PoV manner is <i>not</i> a reason to delete, it's a reason to clean-up. Which means they're arguing delete as not notable, yet no reference has been made to the notability guidelines.

<dd>Okay, the points you raised. Point 1 is a non-issue; nobody really thinks Wikipedia is in danger of becoming an IRA memorial site. It's not even close to being a reason for deletion. Point 2 is also not a reason. It says "delete" because "the article doesn't merit a dedicated page". That basically says "delete" because "it should be deleted". We have policies and guidelines to help, so try arguing from them. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 15:59, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Point 1: There seem to be a large number of articles, of doubtful worth, about IRA militants on Wikipedia, and <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> has made a start by nominating some of the more worthless ones for deletion. <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a> and I previously cleaned up the <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Sands_2dc2.html" title="Bobby Sands">Bobby Sands</a> article, which was so POV at that time as to be simply propaganda. As I say above, I have no problem with a general article about minor IRA personalities but I find it suspicious and disturbing to have a series of individual articles, padded as they are with references to POV sources and a strong bias of republicanism and/ or anglophobia. It seems to me that certain contributors are making it their job to list every IRA personality that they can. Point 2: As <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Bader_58c0.html" title="Douglas Bader">Douglas Bader</a> had it, 'Rules are for the guidance of wise men and the obedience of fools'. The Wikipedia policies and guidelines are sufficiently broad so as not to compromise users' common sense and do not, in any case, help either side in this debate. You also misrepresent my argument: I do not say, '"delete" because "it should be deleted" ', I say delete because the subject is comparatively trivial and being used to advance agendas, not knowledge.--<a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajor_Bonkers_92c3.html" title="User:Major Bonkers">Major Bonkers</a> 16:59, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(reset indent) How is it suspicious and disturbing? And what relevance does certain contributors' actions have to <i>this</i> debate? The policies and guidelines are not completely binding, granted, but they are established through general consensus and can't be ignored on a whim. This decision is clearly not "common sense" as there is plenty of disagreement.</dd>
<dd>Added to that, you still haven't constructed an argument. "Being used to advance agendas, not knowledge" is not a reason for deletion as far as I can see. I'm not even sure what's meant by it. Saying it's "comparatively trivial" is also meaningless as you're not comparing it to anything; it's like saying it's "too trivial for an article", which is again essentially saying "delete because it should be delete". When I analyse your argument, I'm still not finding anything that holds up. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 17:20, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have the feeling, <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a>, that we are simply not going to agree on this issue and that further discourse on the subject is pointless. However, to answer your questions: (1) I find it 'suspicious and disturbing' that what is being promoted as an objective source of information is actually tendentious; (2) particularly so because this article is one of a series; (3) that if someone wishes to construct an online shrine to IRA militants, that is their perogative, but it is not something for Wikipedia, no matter how artfully disguised. (4) I used the phrase 'comparatively trivial' carefully, because life is sacred and obviously his death caused pain to those who loved him. However, frankly and from an historical perspective, the sole interesting feature of this individual is his accidental shooting by the Police and that could be dealt with on a page dealing with that subject rather than giving this individual a page of his own.--<a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajor_Bonkers_92c3.html" title="User:Major Bonkers">Major Bonkers</a> 22:27, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> You may well be correct, but it doesn't matter if you are or not. Just as we write from sources, not our own personal knowledge, so we choose our subjects based on what there is enough source material to create a decent article on, not whether we personally think the person <i>deserves</i> to be written about. Sometimes, the media does have a bias toward writing about the sensational and bad. If you wish to try and correct that, you can certainly write letters to editors, start a citizen's group, or use any number of other means. But this is not the place to correct anything-either the sources exist, or they don't. In this case, they do. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 16:09, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Here are some more references listed by Amnesty International regarding the shooting of Diarmuid O'Neill that you might be interested in if you want ot know more.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>(1) This refers to the Canary Wharf bombing of 9 February 1996. The bombing resulted in a number of casualties and two deaths at the scene.</li>
<li>(2) Tracey Davanna: “Why Was Diarmuid O’Neill Killed&#160;?” in Fortnight, November 1999, p. 12</li>
<li>(3) Patrick Kelly, Brian McHugh and two others were charged with and tried for conspiring to cause explosions and with possessing explosives. It was during this trial that the officers involved in the raid were questioned about the incident in the hotel.</li>
<li>(5) The post-mortem examination was conducted by Dr Iain Eric West at Guy’s Hospital, London. The quotes are taken from his report which was written on 25 September 1996.</li>
<li>(6) Although the latter of these quotations appears in the police`s official transcript of the recording of the incident, the first one caused some controversy during the trial mentioned in footnote 3. According to the police transcript the words said are an order to shut up (“Shut the fuck up!”). Brian McHugh, however, claimed that the words in question were a command to kill (“Shoot the fucker!”).</li>
<li>(7) This quote is taken from the report of the PCA, handed over to the CPS on 11 April 1999.</li>
<li>(9) After Paul Philippou of the Justice for Diarmuid O’Neill Campaign had met the PCA to discuss the report, he summarized their argument to delay the interview with ‘Kilo’ as follows: ”They [the PCA] said it was standard procedure to talk to all the other officers first and then to question him [Officer ‘Kilo’]. That sounds very reasonable but only if the time period is quite short—not if it is two years.” [Tracey Davanna: “Why Was Diarmuid O’Neill Killed&#160;?” in Fortnight, November 1999, p. 13]</li>
<li>(10) Tracey Davanna: “Why Was Diarmuid O’Neill Killed&#160;?” in Fortnight, November 1999, p. 12</li>
<li>(11) “Minister Rejects Inquiry Pleas” in The Irish Democrat, December 1999 / January 2000</li>
<li>(12) Amnesty International has already expressed its concerns in earlier publications: Amnesty International, News Service 170/96, 26 September 1996: “United Kingdom: Killing of Diarmuid O’Neill Raises Serious Questions”, AI Index: EUR 45/12/96; and Amnesty International, 30 September 1996: “United Kingdom: Killing of Diarmuid O’Neill”, AI Index: EUR 45/14/96. --<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 19:59, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Generally, as soon as you appear in one newspaper the others all follow suit. Countless nonentities appear in newspapers all the time. By using the arguments put forward her this terrorist gets his page on Wikipedia not because he was notable - he was not - but because he appeared in the newspaper. Its quite pathetic. It is not a question of censorship, just whether or not this complete nobody, who never did anything in life other than join an organisation dedicated to furthing its aims by murdering innocent people and violence, should have an entry in an encyclopedia. I don't believe he should.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I read the following on the internet just now:</li>
<li>"Hardworking people have become alienated with politics because they don't have the time or inclination to struggle with its complexities. When they do try to put their view across, rational, well argued points are fobbed off with nonsense - spin, platitudes and stonewalling. So they give up, believing the world to have gone mad. Their silence clears the way for a small number of extremists to dominate policy making with their own agendas."</li>
<li>Does this sound familiar?! It sure does to me.</li>
<li>This comes from a guy who is speaking against the proposed new system of road-pricing in the UK, Nigel Humphries of the Association of British Drivers (ABD). This is NOT an endorsement of his views!!! (although...)</li>
