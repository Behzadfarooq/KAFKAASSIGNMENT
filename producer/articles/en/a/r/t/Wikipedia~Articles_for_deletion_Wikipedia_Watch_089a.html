<li>In what way does NPOV necessitate that Wikipedia Watch must get its own separate article? NPOV requires that things be described fairly; you're going to have to draw the connections if you want to substantiate your claim that "Wikipedia Watch described in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_Watch_ec7c.html" title="Wikipedia Watch">Wikipedia Watch</a> == good and fair; Wikipedia Watch described in <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> == bad and POV". Given the bad-faith "hide the content" games recently played with Wikifiddler, I must agree with FRS; <b>Protected redirect</b> to <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:45, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I guess the problem here is that we've claimed that <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> is notable. Now, within the activist community and the conspiracy theory community, he is, and has been for the past 20 or so years. However, those are seriously underground communities, and its really only through <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_419f.html" title="Google Watch">Google Watch</a> that he got any interest beyond those very underground communities, where most people's names are never released to the public. Thanks to Google Watch, his name was released, he was interviewed, etc etc. Yahoo Watch was really just a tag on to Google Watch, while Scroogle was almost always mentioned alongside Google Watch as they compliment each other. So then the issue is Wikipedia Watch. It is, in a lot of ways, just a tag along for Google Watch, because he created it claiming that Wikipedia is an agent of Google, and that everyone here is a CIA agent (or at least enough CIA agents to force us all to be brainwashed in to going along with the CIA agenda). All CIA agents put up your hand so that we know who you are! Come on, anyone? But see the big issue here is this - is Wikipedia Watch just Daniel Brandt? If it is, then merge and be done with it. If not, then don't. Whilst he does go on about his personal views, its not just about him, because he mentions all sorts of other people that were affected by Wikipedia, and it has been contributed to by more people than him. Is it notable? I've counted 15 international news sources that have mentioned it. By my mind, that makes <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> quite happily. Sure, most of them are in some way related to the Seigenthaler affair, but not all. So the issue is that - if we wipe this, then can we justify keeping things like <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>? We can hardly suggest that he as an individual is more notable than his pieces of work. Or do we think that <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> is more notable than <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>? Maybe we should merge Microsoft in to Bill Gates as well. And <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Windows_48e2.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> and everything else as well... <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 01:32, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just another bit. <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_Watch_ffee.html" title="Google Watch Watch">Google Watch Watch</a> has its own page, with less media coverage, and is a much smaller site - on virtually the same topic. So if this gets deleted, then so should that one. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 05:34, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Er, no. It does <i>not</i> have its own page. It has a redirect to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Beasley_d56c.html" title="Chris Beasley">Chris Beasley</a>. Which you know, because you were the one who created the redirect. Less than twenty-four hours ago. What exactly are you trying to achieve here? I'd hate to think that you created a redirect from <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_Watch_ffee.html" title="Google Watch Watch">Google Watch Watch</a> to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Beasley_d56c.html" title="Chris Beasley">Chris Beasley</a> <i>just</i> so you could argue that we have to keep <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_Watch_ec7c.html" title="Wikipedia Watch">Wikipedia Watch</a> for consistency, but I find it hard to construct any other explanation for you creating it and then misdescribing it here as an article rather than a redirect -- without disclosing that it only exists due to you. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 06:11, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I put in the redirect, but I didn't write the Chris Beasley article. I for one think that it should be Google Watch Watch with a redirect from Chris Beasley (i.e. other way around to what it is now) but hey, either way. And if Google Watch Watch has next to no media coverage, then Chris Beasley has even less. Outside of Google Watch Watch he is unheard of. Anyone who votes delete on this should put Google Watch Watch/Chris Beasley up for deletion, because there is no way in hell that that is more notable than Wikipedia Watch. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 12:25, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're not answering the question. You're saying that it is unacceptable to have Wikipedia Watch described at <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> and have a redirect pointing to it. You seem to be claiming that for consistency, Wikipedia Watch has to have its own article, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_Watch_ec7c.html" title="Wikipedia Watch">Wikipedia Watch</a>, because after all, <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_Watch_ffee.html" title="Google Watch Watch">Google Watch Watch</a> has its own article, doesn't it? But in point of fact, this is not the case, and you know it's not the case, so it seems that what you're trying to claim now is that Google Watch Watch is <i>automatically</i> so much less notable than Wikipedia Watch that if Wikipedia Watch doesn't get a <i>separate</i> article, Google Watch Watch shouldn't get <i>any</i> coverage -- a premise that I find extremely specious, to say the least. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:04, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What? Anyway, this web site has had major international news coverage and meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. And yes, Google Watch Watch does have its own article, and has for quite some time. As stated elsewhere, Google Watch Watch is NOT a site - its an article. Yes, that article has been referenced elsewhere, but that's just it - its an article. Now, if Wikipedia Watch was only 1 article, sure, same deal. But its not. It currently has 4 articles on the site. Granted that's not a lot, but Google Watch was notable when it only had 4 articles on its site too. Wikipedia Watch is a site. Whilst it started off quite personal, it has grown beyond just his personal campaign. Anyway, please stop adding "Outing" to the Daniel Brandt article. Your reasons, that it is "proving" that he is hypocriticial is POV. You might think he is hypocritical, but that's just your opinion, and it doesn't belong there. Instead of just having "Outing" in there, you should write how some people think he is hypocritical. Not everyone does. Most activists would think that he is far from hypocritical. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 05:56, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<p><s>*Frankly, I am weary of Brandt's hatemongering and disrespect for our body of work. He has no compunctions about tarring us all with the same brush because of whatever indignities he has been subjected to. The best we can do is report each and every facet of his efforts, provided they cross pre-existing criteria for inclusion. Heck, let's make him a Featured Article candidate. Why? Because we can.

<li>I'd think that Google Watch is sufficiently notable though. I had heard of that soon after it came out in 2002. As for the others, I don't know.

Wikipedia is not without its flaws and to delete articles like this would create the impression that these flaws are being covered up. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 04:21, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Much of what is covered in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_Watch_ec7c.html" title="Wikipedia Watch">Wikipedia Watch</a> is already mentioned in Brandt's own entry. No need for two pages that say essentially the same thing, especially when Brandt seems to be the power behind Wikipedia Watch in the first place.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Deleting an anti-Wikipedia site hobbles the concept of NPOV coverage. Articles involving individuals or entities critical of Wikipedia should be handled with care. I do think Brandt should be capped at, say, a maximum of five *prefix*-Watch site entries on Wikipedia, though. For his own good.

<p>Suppose I were to send a hoax email to the subject of a Wikipedia article, and then write up the results (haha! got him!) on the talk page and in the article. The subject of the Wikipedia article also happens to be a Wikipedian.</p>
<p>Would that be: (a) good traditional encyclopedia research, or (b) an egregious personal attack?</p>
<p>I say (b), but the Wikipedia community (including several admins) says (a).</p>
<p>Oh, and the article subject/Wikipedia user happens to be very unpopular (in fact has been blocked from Wikipedia). Does the answer depend on that? Should it?</p>

<p>No it is completely unacceptable behavior. Very disappointing. We are Wikipedians and for me that means something.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 19:10, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Do you think that I should include "Attacks on Wikipedia Watch" as a sub section? Happy to remove that. Can also include another section "Criticisms of Wikipedia Watch" as well if you like. I see that Jimbo's comments have been quoted in the Daniel Brandt article as criticisms of it. Are there any other published comments criticising it? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 08:05, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> And while we're at it, destroy the Brandt article too. <i>(unsigned anonymous comment 14:48, 21 December 2005 86.137.180.163)</i></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is becoming a part of Wikipedia history, and Mr. Brandt has thrust himself into the public spotlight because of it. He fights for privacy, but revels in the attention. I believe that this page, with a bit of work could become a great summary of a controversial event in Wikipedia's history. --<a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaiTengu_2b09.html" title="User:DaiTengu">DaiTengu</a> 01:17, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
