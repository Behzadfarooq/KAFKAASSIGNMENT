<dd>You mean the archaeology exhibition/museum which is described by <i>its creators</i> in the NYTimes article as:"<i>New York Unearthed</i> will be a modest enterprise, its creators say, not a reason itself to make a trip to lower Manhattan but a worthwhile addition to a Battery-South Street itinerary." If the official blurb is that visiting the museum is not worth me taking a subway trip from Upper Manhattan to Lower Manhattan, it's probably not a notable exhibition. As for the Chase Center - why, that's the tallest building in all of Arizona, woohoo. But this is <i>Manhattan</i> we're talking about here. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 19:10, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I do think the circumstances that led to the museum's inclusion are interesting. And it currently has <a href="http://www.southstseaport.org/places/nyunearthed.shtm" class="external text" title="http://www.southstseaport.org/places/nyunearthed.shtm" rel="nofollow">about 2 million items</a> in its collection, which isn't too shabby. In any case, it's something distinct about the building that can be used to expand the article. And why should the building be penalized because Manhattan is so densley packed with skyscrapers? Would you really consider this building more notable if it had been in a smaller city? <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 19:20, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, I was mainly addressing Wknight's comment, "I brought this to AFD mainly because there was so little info in the article." But with regards to your argument -- <i>are</i> there any established notability criteria for skyscrapers? I would think that all buildings that exceed a certain height threshhold are inherently notable. The World Almanac traditionally lists every building in the US over 500 ft tall, and I don't see the harm of giving each of those structures a Wikipedia article.</li>

<p><i>In the 1970s, some very interesting mid-size office buildings were erected by the William Kaufman Organization on the east side of Lower Manhattan - 77 Water Street and 127 John Street, and a bit later, the beautiful curved, reflective glass tower at 17 State Street, but these paled in comparison with the scale of the silvery twin towers of the World Trade Center, the strong vertical piers of One Chase Manhattan Plaza, and the ungainliness of the huge tower at 60 Wall Street for the Morgan bank.</i></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The building is clearly distinctive especially when the skyline is seen from the harbor. I also read that there was an issue about the deal behind its construction.
