<p>This page is both unencyclopedic (not sufficiently relevant to warrant an article of this size, and it's veracity, scope and enforcement are called into serious question) I am nominating the article for deletion for several reasions 1. lack of citation, this article has insufficient documentation (documentation such that there have been real arguments posed as to the veracity, enforcement, and scope of this alleged list. 2. unencyclopedic. This list at most rates a footnote in history or an encyclopedia, while I agree it passes the notability litmus test, it is not sufficiently notable to command an article of this size. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrelane_e11c.html" title="User:Trelane">Trelane</a> 01:50, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. No citations? There are 3 of them done in the standard format, and there are 2 links to the original list. Unencyclopediac? This was a major news event a few years ago which should be mentioned in Wikipedia. The size of the article is needed to fit the list, which is quite important to demostrating the extent to which the list went to remove songs from the air. There is no reason why we should delete an article on such a well-known event in the history of censorship in the US. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 01:53, 5 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd suggest you read the citations, and the discussion on the page, it is altogether unclear as to what the scope of this "censorship" was. That therefore must make this article pure speculation. Furthermore while we're on the discussion of censorship, let us then discuss the definition of a censor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From The Collaborative International Dictionary of English v.0.48&#160;:</p>
<pre>
 "Censor \Cen"sor\,    2. One who is empowered to examine manuscripts before they
       are committed to the press, and to forbid their publication if they contain         anything obnoxious"  
</pre>
<p>From this it is clear that a censor must be an outside, not an inside influence, else the arguement would be made that a Clear Channel DJ censored one artist by playing a track by another artist at any given time. And while the previous answer fails the reason test, it does not fail your definition of censorship, therefore your definition is unreasonable. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrelane_e11c.html" title="User:Trelane">Trelane</a> 02:06, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um, <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-censorship.html" title="Self-censorship">self-censorship</a> is a well-known concept (and that definition above is a pretty poor one). Censorship is a much broader concept than the most heavy-handed versions of it, and "content standards" are a very common form of what most people would call censorship, whether they are imposed on an organization from the outside or whether it is a result of an organization having a monopoly and using its own internal standards. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 23:23, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b><s>Keep, but...</s></b> (vote change below). I disagree with the nom about the notability of this article--Clear Channel is a large entity whose decisions affected the playlists of a huge portion of the radio marketplace. Its actions are indicative of the social and cultural climate of that time period in the United States, and a well-maintained list serves to illustrate the extent of that climate/attitude in the music industry. There are also references provided at the end that I expect back up most of the entries. That said, a review of the Talk page and edit history seems to back up allegations of attempted <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">OWNing</a> of the article, and it might have been wise to call for mediation some months ago. But at this point, the edit wars appear to have died down (no conversations on the Talk page for a month before today, and the bulk of recent edits have been more like copy-editing), so even that may not be an issue at this point. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 02:11, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The "owning" arguement was merely a personal attack (something that is also against Wikpedia policy) made by an editor who could not prove his own argument.

<li><b>Delete (vote change).</b> I still feel that the controversy was notable and that such a list, if it verifiably exists, has a place on Wikipedia. The "urban legend" argument isn't strong here--the article notes that the "banned" element of it has been proved an urban legend, but this doesn't mean a list of "inappropriate" songs wasn't distributed by Clear Channel--in fact, as Snopes points out, there <i>was</i> such a list, though Clear Channel notes that it was intended merely as advisory. However, I hadn't taken the time to review each cited source when I previously voiced a "keep" vote. As far as I can see, none of the sources for the actual list meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> (as per Zer0fault's post below). Thus, without any threshold of verifiability met to determine which songs were actually on this list, this article in its current incarnation should go. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 20:05, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I feel the subject of the article is reasonably notable. I was about to go with just having an external link, but the advantage to having the list here instead of just at an external link is that readers can easily click on individual songs and read about them to get a sense as to why the song may have been banned after 9|11. Alternatively, the article could be expanded to include that information directly in this article. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> <small>(joturner)</small> 03:10, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'll admit that I'm just skimming, but I believe that the article states that the list is not an actual "banned list," but a list that Clear Channel sent to member stations in an advisory capacity.

<li><b>Merge and Delete</b> I have attempted to get the editor to provide some proof of this list being "the" list that was circulated. They cannot do so because the list was never released, both of the sources offered do not have the same list and one is cited as more complete. While I am sure that a list was circulated, it was also need a ban or censor list, well the article fails to prove it was, with one source stating by Clear Channel that it was neither. So we have a list from 2 different sources, a list meaning a bunch of items, because neither is in a proper email or fax formatting or even contain a letter head to prove some sort of authenticity. Since the sources cannot be verified and do not even appear in any form that would be standard as evidence or proof. Keeping the list is promoting information we do not know to be true, the list cannot be different on two dif sources, and neither sources has the original fax email etc. merge mention, but delete the list as the songs on it are unverifiable. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 14:05, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually, there is one real version of the list, which we have here. The editor who claimed that this is an urban legend added the "Many versions of the list were circulated on the internet", which is his original research. That can be removed for now.

<li>No you don't have "the" list, you have a list of songs, neither source has a letterhead, a signature or any other identifying markers to prove its real, they are actually just recompiled lists of artists and songs.

The fact that there was a list has been proven, its reason for existence has been disputed and its exact contents is not existent in a verifiable form. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 15:36, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Maybe I'm going outside the scope of Wikipedia, but I think the list should stay. As long as it is verified, it makes much more sense to keep this list accessible to the reader so they can view the list and from experience or lyric research synthesise their own opinions on the event rather than relying on citations from other sources in the ClearChannel article. And if we remove the list and don't represent responses to the event, we trivialise it, when in this company represents the majority of radio media in the US and any action to discourage the playing of songs is very relevent to the emotional state of the nation after 9/11. (I don't see WHAT this could be merged into... ) - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalthCat_3c87.html" title="User:BalthCat">BalthCat</a> 06:36, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The article indicates accurately that the list was circulated but the songs were not banned. The president of Clear Channel is cited as admitting that the list was circulated. It was a notable incident, in part because of the rumors it caused, and the list should be preserved for researchers interested in this. The "lack of citation" argument seems incorrect, and even the person who nominated it for AfD acknowledges its notability. I could see supporting a merge argument if the list is put on wikisource, but having it here with wikilinks to articles on the bands could be useful.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 09:51, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

The fact that numerous versions of this list exist and it seems one is just randomly being vouched for as the complete list with no proof is a horrible failure of WP:V.

<li><b>Delete</b> We need to separate the deletion of the incident from deletion of a list of songs. The incident is notable enough for inclusion; perhaps not within its own article but as it currently stands within the Clear Channel article. A list of songs that were "banned" is not worthy of inclusion, and hence my vote is to delete. Unfortunately, a number of the opinions expressed are to include the article without consideration for whether this <b>list of songs</b> should be included. Ask yourself: Were the incident to warrant an article of its own, would a list of 150 songs be appropriate for inclusion in the article? The incident is minor but notable. However, including a list of some 150-odd songs is not, especially as they were a suggestion, not a "ban". --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 01:04, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
