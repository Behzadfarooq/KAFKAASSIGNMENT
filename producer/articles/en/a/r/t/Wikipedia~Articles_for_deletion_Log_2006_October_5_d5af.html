<li><b>Strong Keep of the latter</b> These are all well-known examples of biblical verses which support the idea of the coming of Christ. All of these have been frequently interpreted and cited as examples of this. So, rather than deleting it and doubting the obvious fact that "Many Christians believe that the Old Testament contains certain Messianic Prophecies of Jesus", let's <i>find sources</i> and improve it. Excepting a bit of POV language, there is nothing incorrect or OR in this article. None of the reasons given by the nominator are accepted reasons for deletion. Find sources. Explain. Provide context. At the very least add a template.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> This article has been in this poor state since 2002. In four years no one managed to find a source and contextualize the "list"? I'm not sold on "well-known" or even the validity of these examples. ---<a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 23:30, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'll work on it. Also, the point isn't that they're <i>valid</i>, but that they are commonly believed by Christians. Also, I created it in July of this year, so you must be referring to the other list. All of these have the potential to become like <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaiah_53.html" title="Isaiah 53">Isaiah 53</a>, another article I created. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 23:42, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The list was created in 2002 and the prophecies article, which is the same information, was created in July 2006. What I mean by valid is that they aren't contextualized and thus, a particular claim without a source could be incorrect. Reading some, I think that is the case. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 23:45, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The prophecies article is <i>not</i> the same information, because it contains detailed explanations each, whereas the other article merely lists them. What happened was this: I created section headings for each of the examples, hoping to fill them in later, but an anon IP actually did to my delight. I haven't had time to fully review this information being as busy as I am, but I plan to. I am also confused by your claim that they are "without a context". It is just a list of claims that Christians often cite as referring to Christ. It's one of those situations in which the "no context" problem can be solved by fixing up the opening paragraph. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 23:49, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>When you quote something you take it out of a larger work. That larger work is context referring to acts, premises, and events that give the quote meaning. Both articles are simply quotes without that larger meaning of what the quotes were centered on. Even if the article is deleted you can create a sandbox to improve it for reposting. And the articles are nearly identical, they both have examples about propechies of Jesus and use, say, Isiah 53, Psalms 22 and many others. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 23:55, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and merge per Tarret's suggestion and Adam's comments. This topic is a well established concept in Christian theology and evangelical interpretation of the OT testament.

The links all go to either scholarly journals or published books where the authors deal with the messanic nature of the scripture.

Moreover, all the claims of fulfillment presented in the article are quotes to the New Testament which (a) not all Christians agree is literally true; (b) is internally inconsistent (see <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_consistency_and_the_Bible_6601.html" title="Internal consistency and the Bible">Internal consistency and the Bible</a>). There are no claims of fulfillment advocated by numerous Christian groups from evident outside of the Bible -- especially eschatological harbingers. For <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messianic_prophecies_of_Jesus_bfbd.html" title="Messianic prophecies of Jesus">Messianic prophecies of Jesus</a>, the whole premise of the article is that "many Christians believe" but there is absolutely no reference to which denominations on each point and how "many" is "many" (see <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words</a>); unless this can be somehow corrected verifiably the whole article is no more than a collective set of authors' opinions that someone could claim yadda yadda yadda. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 20:39, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> 1st, <b>Delete</b> 2nd. The list is pointless. The latter article, while better, makes a grave mistake in using the generic "Christian" appelation, as there are so many diverse brands of Christianity that have existed.

Who's to say what prophecies "Christians" consider fulfilled?

The second article is better, as it's about a major theme in the Bible which is worthy of treatment, and is a fairly well-written article as well.

<li><b>Comment</b> I can't make up my mind. His book on Bush (41) is terribly researched and often contradicts other sources (or from what I can see draws connections out of thin air) and there are a gazillion online mirrors, meaning his wrong factoids keep finding their way into articles. It's somewhat helpful to have an article on him, then, showing the breadth and, er, depth of his career.

<li><b>Comment</b> Regarding Rosicrucian's argument, keep in mind some of the votes for the book called for merge of the information into this article. Also note that the claim in the deletion discussion for that book that Borders lists it as out of print was a complete falsehood. Borders lists 1st edition OOP. The 3rd edition is still in print and sells at Borders, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Amazon.

<li><b>Comment</b> that's a slight bump for Synthetic Terror, and admittedly we're not trying to resurrect the Synthetic Terror article. I don't feel that deletion was undeserved though. He <i>might</i> meet notability requirements for the Bush Sr. bio, but it's bad enough that I've already spotted Wikipedia articles citing it as if it were a reliable source. If I were to assume for a moment that the Bush book <i>is</i> notable, the article is still grossly undersourced and needs assertations of his notability that don't come from conspiracy theorists.

<p>Not one of the 10 has been recommended for deletion. None of them appear to be particularly notable. (Tarpley now has 3 screens of content so maybe this is no longer even a stub.)<br />
I conclude bias is shown. You say your deletion motion is neutral? Let's talk about <i>that</i> now.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm open to discussion on what needs to be adjusted or rectified with the Tarpley article, and also what was 'wrong' (sorry if I missed a lengthy prior discussion) with the entry on his key book. I'm especially curious as to why the entry on 9/11 SYNTHETIC TERROR couldn't have been framed to include equal sides of the debate on its validity, i.e positive and critical, rather than the complete removal of the subject. I'd also like to reconfirm what actually needs source citing in the current article, with - again - apologies if I'm missing something obvious. Tarpley has been getting more attention and positive reviews lately than Icke, and has greater credibility, unless Wikipedia currently exists to solely republish the official story about current political events. False Flag terrorist activity is documented - see links to Daniele Ganser's European work if I need to bring them in - and Tarpley has been quoted by Steele as the current English-language expert on the topic. Again, I don't see the rationale for complete deletion over a pro/con page discussing both sides. Anthony Thorne 01:40, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. You say "clearly fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>." At WP:BIO it says "People who satisfy at least one of the items below may merit their own Wikipedia articles... Published authors... who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work." Just check Synthetic Terror on Amazon and you will see multiple independent reviews. 44 reviews in all. Most of them raves; average is 5 stars. Google hits a gauge of negatives? The links are due to interest in his work. Anyway the argument is specious; it would mean deleting the bio's of infamous figures. There are currently 5 Google news items on Webster Tarpley. You have to search on "Webster Tarpley," not "Webster G. Tarpley." I repeat. Will one of the deleters please give us a hint what are the claims they want the keepers to verify? It is pretty clear that a lot of people want to shoot the messenger because they don't like the message. Thanks, I don't want to recommend hundreds of non-notable writer stubs for deletion. Let the deleters here go do it. But some people DO want to delete Tarpley, because they notably dislike what he has to say.JPLeonard 02:16, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, you can keep improving the article throughout the voting period, which normally runs for five days. If you're afraid the article might be speedy-deleted in the meantime, you can use the template {{hangon}}, but nobody here is calling for that to happen. Please note, though, that it isn't the quality of the writing that is the main concern, it's whether an in-development Flash game should have an article in the first place. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 02:11, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

Read those articles, don't assume you understand what "reliable" is because it has a very specific meaning here. The PC Gamer article is a start (if it indeed talks about the game in detail), but 1) there's no issue number or article title, that would be a good start to put in and 2) we need at least one more source. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 04:16, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Non-notable</b></p>
<p>While this article is lengthy and substantive, it seems to me to be an article about someone who does not meet the Notability requirements to be included in Wikipedia. It seems as if the article was written merely to promote this individual, and not because Mr. Casseres did anything notable enough to be included in an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Biographies ARE appropriate, even biographries about non-notables, but not here on Wikipedia. Additionally since the entire article is unsourced, we have no way of knowing if Mr. Casseres ever even existed.</p>
<p>I propose deleting the article (or at least shortening and merging under people of curacao or something like this) because of the reasons stated above. Jordanwaring 13:51, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Too early for an AfD. The article made two claims for notability - firstly that it had been picked up by major media and secondly that it is spreading to other areas. The first has now been removed as the citation request was around for 11 days, the second I've asked for citation requests. If that information can then be removed I'd say they were non-notable. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 10:46, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. It still is rather weaselly, and looks like original research to me. The title also is still not really descriptive of the article contents, and might go better as marginal utility of money.

<li><b>Delete the band's article, the articles for their two albums, Home Is Where The Heartache Is and The Natural Trend Of Breathing, and the article for their record company, All Records.</b> The band's article does not assert the least bit of notability, nor do the articles for their albums (aside from getting one song in a PS2 game). The only notability I could even find online was that they played at one local stop of the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warped_Tour_b64d.html" title="Warped Tour">Warped Tour</a>- but said tour has (literally) a dozen or so local bands play at every stop. Their record label has three non-notable bands. It has released a grand total of four albums/EPs, and only one in the past two years.

<li><b>Comment</b> The game isn't mentioned in the band's article, so I don't know if the game itself has an article. Do PS2 soundtracks burn through a lot of songs? If the game is notable, I'd have to know more about gaming to know if that alone could confer notability on its soundtrack, but I'd say it at minimum counts as a non-trivial published work. Unrelatedly, I note that <a href="../../../s/c/r/Screamo.html" title="Screamo">screamo</a> is a relatively new genre; we're not going to have an article on every punk band that comes down the pike nowadays, but this is a rather smaller pond, which I'd say makes all the fish in it at least a little bigger.–<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalieber_db73.html" title="User:Calieber">♥ «Charles A.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Erik, all of the sources that you put in, in order: #1 is the corporate site, which is a primary source. Encyclopedias being tertiary sources do not use primary sources, being <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. However, it is okay as an external link. #2 and #10 is just a partner-program mention, which is considered a "trivial mention" under the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability criteria</a>. #3 and #4 are real articles, but they too mention Commendo in passing (there was around 1-2 sentences on the company). Moreover #4 is directly from a Commendo employee, which is a primary source. #5 and #6 are wikis, not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> (no fact-checking process at all). The press coverage is usually quoted from press releases issued by the company, and therefore is also a primary source. #7 and #11 are also only trivial mentions, and while #8 is a substantial article, it establishes the notability of Reynaldo Gil, not Commendo. What you need is a magazine or newspaper article whose <i>subject</i> is the company in question. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 07:11, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>One of those huh? Stainton equates metasemantics with social semantics, as does this article.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article certainly needs sources, and I'm not convinced everything on it is true however metasemantics is a real and legitimate sub-field within the philosophy of language and the term is used enough among language philosophers (including Kripke and Chomsky) that it seems to deserve its own page. However, it needs to be sourced (though there are definitely sources out there, at least for some parts of the article). <i>Although, it should be noted that the use of the hyphen is improper, it should be metasemantics.</i> --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 09:38, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've thought from the outset that yes, the term is used by philosophers as well as philosophasters; sorry I didn't make this clear. Well, one could zap the article's entire content and replace it with "A term used in the philosophy of language. {stub}"; but that seems pointless. Or could you rewrite the article afresh, while this AfD is running its course? (I'd then probably change my own vote.) NB the deletion of an article does not necessarily mean that no article with the same title should ever be written. (As many deleted articles are promotional/vanity productions and newly created articles with the same titles are mere second attempts with the same inappropriate motivation, they indeed are or should be automatically deleted; but this is a separate matter.) -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 00:51, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>College drinking yes, humor no -- nose grease really can be used as a defoaming agent and really does reduce head on beer; it is verifiable to anyone with access to both a <a href="../../../n/o/s/Nose.html" title="Nose">nose</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer.html" title="Beer">beer</a>.

<li>"Verifiable to anyone with access to a nose and beer" is (1) not what Wikipedia means by <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, and is a cute drinking trick that might belong in a trivia book, not an encyclopedia. Same with the reference to the optical use, which is clearly some sort of science humor, unless there was something alleged to be unique about the properties of this material, which has not been shown. And "can be used as a light-duty lubricant (for example to stop door hinges from creaking)"? Come on. That's completely unremarkable.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The journal reference is bogus. I looked and so did the article author and we both agree that the reference to nose grease isn't actually there. But even if it <i>was</i>, is it actually encyclopedic? I think it's borderline at best. IMO, if you take out the folksy 'uses' for nose grease, you get a stub that's no different from a stub called 'Forehead grease' or 'Chin grease' or (my favourite) 'Chest grease'. If anything, I think the items on beer and lenses (if they can be sourced) should be in a section on <a href="../../../s/e/b/Sebum.html" title="Sebum">sebum</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 19:05, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Further comment</b>. My issue with the article is not so much the verifiability (which remains somewhat sketchy in any case) of the individual factoids, but that they are more suited to something like <i>1000 Fun Facts About the Human Body</i> than an encyclopedia. As trivia items, the strongly sourced ones deserve at most perhaps a sentence in the <a href="../../../s/e/b/Sebum.html" title="Sebum">sebum</a> or <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squalene.html" title="Squalene">squalene</a> articles. --<a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 17:22, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For what it's worth, I did hear back from Hal Zirin about his (attempted) use of nose oil at the Climax solar observatory. He certainly tried it, following in Lyot's footsteps. He wrote that he can't remember where he learned about it, but that it was certainly common knowledge in the solar observing community in the 1970s. (Hal never met Lyot directly, though they worked with many of the same people). <a href="../../../z/o/w/User%7EZowie_174c.html" title="User:Zowie">zowie</a> 18:09, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I really wanted to see this entry, remembering it from a silly pub conversation. Deleting it would lose valuable, if silly, information. Merging into Bilingual Pun or Joke Latin might be justifiable. Note that one of those calling for deletion commented "It's a (bad) joke that always seems to appear in Latin textbooks".

<li><b>Delete</b> This is not an appropriate encyclopedia article. Just one example is the quote they choose to use describing Ms. McLean's visit to France is from "Cult News" by Rick Ross (in itself a warning sign as Mr. Ross is one of the most extreme anti-LE advocates on the internet and is not even close to an objective source) and half the quote is about how this French expert did not "really" say it wasn't a cult. Apparently they can't read French. He said&#160;:: "«&#160;Aucun des six éléments majeurs relatifs aux sectes ne s'applique à Landmark Education&#160;»" He states that they are not a cult, or rather more rigorously that the attributes of a cult are not present. This is clearly a biased article. <a href="../../../a/j/a/User%7EAJackl_fc2f.html" title="User:AJackl">Alex Jackl</a> 13:33, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>An "important and entertaining fictional character": Actually, a just-invented internet meme cooked up by a blog recently. Gets ten (10) Google hits -- less than nothing for an internet meme.

<li>Is voting open to anyone? I vote <b>keep it</b>! The reason I created the article is I think the (very new) character provides a catchy and relatable name for a phenomenon that is very familiar. I'd love to see an article on the phenomenon that Artie personifies, and I think you're right, he should be a small part of that article. I was just hoping to get the conversation started. I hope I haven't done anything wrong. I'm relatively inexperienced, Wikipediawise, but it's my hope that contributions from casual users are as welcomed as those from longtime contributors. The more voices, the better. I certainly didn't intend to disrespect Wikipedia by adding the article.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> for now. It isn't an International Bacclaureat school but is "applying for the International Baccalaureate program" and even then that by itself would not confer notability, IB is very common. WP:SCHOOLS does not have a consensus behind it (and I fail to see how it meets criteria 1 and 4 anyways). However, the large number of German google hits makes this only a weak delete because that may give some indication of notability. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 14:15, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I don't know if I have a vote as article creator (if not, take this as a <b>Comment</b>), but I did say on the article's talk page that I am still working on it and trying to make it read less as an advertisement. *** The school is almost done applying for IB and is already offering it to students in Grades 9-11 if they want to do an additional 13th year. (I will be one of the first ones taking IB as I am currently in Grade 11) The official visit from the IB committee is on October 20 after which the school will be an "official" IB school. Also, this is one of the <b>very few</b> articles about a SABIS school, the system itself having no article at all. *** Regarding the name, the article's current title is how it was listed on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_international_schools.html" title="List of international schools">List of international schools</a>, so I used it.

<li><b>Do not delete</b> I believe that the article itself is likely more of a stub than an article, but I do not believe that it warrants deletion. I ask that those who are in favor of deletion visit the actual website, and educate themselves about the premise of this virtual globe. It is true that it is a commercial application, and as many commercial endeavours one of the goals is of course to turn a profit. On the other hand today's children are growing up with MTV and console games filling their time, and education has taken a distant back-seat to many other leisure activities. As a parent, and as an educator, a tool like Earthsim is invaluable to engage children into a learning process that utilizes the same elements that their console games utilize. There is no doubt that the current Earthsim is presenting a tiny fraction of Earth science that can be covered. There is also no doubt that this tool could benefit from closer ties with educators for the purpose of content development. Most importantly there is no doubt that any project whose goal it is to provide you with an entertaining method to teach your kids a thing or two about Earth science, any such project deserves your support. Please consider that the WP recommendation is revision before deletion. Perhaps this article could be revised in such a way to outline the science education goals of Earthsim to make the WP entry more relevant to WP's mission. 64North 22:50, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>. What this means is that we can't go to the actual website and use that as a source (because the source is primary). We need <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">third-party reliable sources</a>. The WP recommendation is indeed revision, but only with material derived from secondary sources, not primary ones. If secondary sources cannot be found, then deletion is the correct answer. Wikipedia's mission is not to push a point of view (that Earthsim is better than MTV or console games), unless somebody else writes about it first; otherwise, this violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. It is also up to the people who don't want this deleted to provide these sources, as they want the article not to be deleted. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 23:38, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> I really do understand the tertiary source concept. I also understand the NPOV and didn't mean to imply the article should reflect my personal opinion. However, my personal view was stated in regards to deletion to illustrate a potential benefit of Earthsim that may merit to keep the article around if the article were to be edited and perhaps marked as stub. I also believe that the user who asked for deletion did so in such a way that does not follow accepted Wikiquette and he certainly did not follow nomination guidelines which state that someone should "investigate the possibility of rewriting the article yourself (or at least creating a stub on the topic and requesting expansion) instead of deleting it". Be that as it may, the issue is Earthsim itself, and not the behavior of the one who started the deletion process. I am certainly giving the requester the benefit of a doubt as his way of expressing himself may not have been intentional but rather caused by his <a href="../../../b/i/p/Bipolar_disorder.html" title="Bipolar disorder">Bipolar Type I</a> condition. For those who are familiar with WP's inner workings. What would need to be done to convert the article into such a stub that the entry would for the time being be spared from deletion, and deletion can be revisited at a later date should no sufficient progress toward expanding the article be made? 64North 01:07, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To expand on that, I see some voted Delete per <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. However, <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> states that software entries are notable when "The software is among the core products of a notable software developer or vendor".

<dd>I'm afraid not. Even if Keondjian is notable (and I believe he is), he does not automatically confer notablity on whatever it is he does. Believe it or not, this is how it works for everybody. It is the sorry truth that very notable individuals usually stand a better chance of being covered by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">respected sources</a> even if they don't deserve it, so it might <i>seem</i> like anything that <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Jobs_f8a1.html" title="Steve Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> does automatically qualifies as notable, but in reality, he just gets followed around by thousands of respected newspapers and articles hanging on his every word.

A trivial mention of what games ATI certifies doesn't say anything about Earthsim (and certain does not say anything _in_ the article). A reference should support the article's contents.

<li><b>Absolutely</b>. KH1 is among the top 10 bestselling games for the PS2, and probably the top 30 or so in console gaming history.

<li><b>Delete</b> as minor part of a videogame series that simply isn't important enough, even in the context of the game, to merit a standalone article.

It's not that I have a strong opposition to a redirect or merge, but in the context of the games this is like a "mini-game" of sorts (that unlocks boards) and with 2 chapters in the game that both have the Gummi Ship system there is no logical redirect target.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:15, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I do agree that the Gummi Ship is a fairly notable part of the Kingdom Hearts series, but this is not the way it should be presented in an encyclopaedia.

<p>Music genre pages seem to cause more problems than anything else on Wikipedia! These particular terms ("post-prog" and "exo-prog") do not appear to have an established, consistent, verifiable usage and the current article is inconsistent and does not cite sources. Nothing links here (although <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Prog_1088.html" title="New Prog">New Prog</a> did). A Google search suggests "post-prog" is inconsistently used and little used, but when it is, it tends to be used synonymously with <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-rock.html" title="Post-rock">post-rock</a>, contrary to what the article says. "Exo-prog" is very little used: the one clear usage I found links it with <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-prog.html" title="Neo-prog">neo-prog</a>, which is consistent with the third paragraph of the article, but inconsistent with the first two. I've previously tagged the article as needing clean-up and citations, but neither have been forthcoming. I thought about trying to clean it up myself, but couldn't think of anything to write beyond "These terms are inconsistently and little used." The people who have added most content to the page haven't done anything else on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBondegezou_315a.html" title="User:Bondegezou">Bondegezou</a> 09:47, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Let me head off the usual "this was just AfD'd" at the pass: the rationale for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Chelsea_Charms_6e90.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chelsea Charms">the first AfD</a> was essentially casting moral judgment over the subject rather than discussing the merits of the article; the crux of the nominator's rationale was, "what if some woman comes here and thinks "id like to be like that" and decides to have an augmentation that completely destroys her health because of Wikipedia?" It became a discussion of taste rather than notability. This AfD nomination, on the other hand, has to do with our guidelines and policies. So, without further ado: the article on Chelsea Charms fails both in terms of establishing the notability of the subject, and by our policies of citation and verification. First, to her notability, the only <i>suggestion</i> of notability is that Chelsea Charms has a larger-than-average set of augmented breasts. The article makes no claim that they are record-setting, in any way, and in fact <i>specifically states that they aren't,</i> but just catalogs the various operations she's allegedly had done to them. Her IMDb page has a grand total of two films, so that's not where the notability is coming from. And then there is the second, major major problem with this article: <b>there's not a single reference or citation in the whole thing.</b> By my count, the article makes nearly 20 separate assertions of fact without a single reference as to where these facts came from (and that's not counting the excess verbiage about the general physiology behind breast enlargement, which probably wouldn't belong in the article anyway). <b>Delete</b> as unverifiable, and even if it were verifiable, as simply not notable. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 10:01, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Chelsea Charms is notable as the woman who has the largest breasts as a result of the "silly string" implantation surgery. Although I agree that her article is not as well annotated as it should be, I also must note that this is mainly because of time constraints on my part. (I was not the original author of the article but I do contribute to it from time to time.) As for the fact that the IMDB page on her only shows two films, how many films does IMDB show for James Dean, for instance? Remember that IMDB isn't the most accurate source although it is widely quoted -- they make plenty of omissions in their filmographies. A look at her own website shows that she has appeared in many more than just two films, so that it not a valid reason for deleting her article here. You want third-party, reliable sources on her?

<li><b>keep</b>. I think wiki shold have certain objective criteria for deletions. For instance, a google of "chelsea charms" as of Sat Oct7 2006, brings up ~ 200,000+ hits. While we all know about spamm, stuffing, bots , etc, at a certain point, if a person has a enough presence, that in and of itself, even if it is purely a media driven event - you have enough hits because you have enough hits - warrants auto inclusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, the whole string implant thing, in and of itself, surely is a wiki article, and as a representative public figure on that topic, this is a <b>keep</b>. As for the ref policy, the whole wiki ref policy thing needs to be completely rethought. Once you start entering the world of dry academic scholasticism with things like references, you need to evaluate them, etc etc.24.60.137.141 15:19, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

If you check the history of the Wikipedia article, you can see it slowly coming into its current form. For instance, on Nov 8/05, a user names LisaCarol added 3 paragraphs about Chelsea - the ones starting with "Chelsea's bust size...", "She was a natural..." and "When asked if...", citing Chelsea's FAQ as a source. <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabercil_a2ff.html" title="User:Tabercil">Tabercil</a> 00:59, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> - She is one of the top (breast pun not intended) big bust models over the last several years. She's notable due to her string implants. Her popularizing the rare implant procedure lead several others in her field to attempt to go bigger and bigger. If she isn't notable in her vocation, then no big bust model on Wikipedia is notable. Cause she has thousands of fans at various Yahoo Groups. And her official website gets millions of hits every month. Far more than Maxi Mounds, Minka, or most other big bust models. Also it should be noted that the article has been on Wikipedia for over two years, with several dozen people contributing to its expansion. All the people that have contributed done so because they thought it was important and worthwhile. People have put hours and hours of their time and energy into this article, and the various other model/pornstar articles. If anything the articles need expanded and improved, not deleted. And the above commenter is mistaken. They have it backwards, in that the site <a href="http://www.surgeontothestars.com/pages/celebrities/chelsea_charms.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.surgeontothestars.com/pages/celebrities/chelsea_charms.shtml" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> obviously took the free information provided on Wikipedia and used it in part to create their article. But the link does show that other sites do consider her not only notable but also an internet celebrity in her own right worthy of inclusion. Many sites list her name as a key word in attempts to get more visitors to sell their various products or services. Lastly, no information on this article, an article that has been worked on and edited by many different people for the past two years is in violation of copyright infringement. It is basic info that one would find on any biography page on widipedia about models, which the subject of the article has provided freely on her own site and in interviews or conversations with fans, such as her stage name, birthday, and the fact that she is a big bust model with string implants. The info is as accurate and truthful, as is possible with big bust models, or pornstars that the mainstream media usually ignore.Powergirl 17:43, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> The assertion of notability is that she is a top big bust model and that she has the largest breast implants in the world (10000cc string implants). Her 10000cc chest can be seen at YouTube where over 95,000 folks have viewed her video.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK3rvkmx67o" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK3rvkmx67o" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> With that many YouTube views, and all the search results on the major search engines, or the fact she's the #1 model at Photoclubs.com proves that she's not only notable in the industry but to most big bust fans online. Their can be no denying that she is more known than most big bust models listed on Wikipedia. Only someone that knows nothing about the big bust industry over the last few years would be unware to the status that this lady holds. There is no way to deny that she is one of the top big bust models in America this decade. And that her breasts weigh 31 pounds each. If that isn't mentioned in the article, then someone should add that. The article needs to be edited to make clear that the 26 pound number is from a few years ago when she was at 7000cc. Although the end of the article clearly mentions her announcement about having reached the milestone 10000cc at the 2005 Adult Entertainment Expo in Las Vagas. Keisha Evans<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keisha_Evans" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keisha_Evans" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> is the only other women in the exotic dancing/big bust business today that even comes close, with Miss Evans recently getting 6000cc implants. For the last few years everyone in the big breast niche market (ie Score, Photoclubs.com, ect.) recognize that with the FDA banning anyone else from getting string implants; and none of the other women that did having the level of growth that Chelsea Charms experienced; that Chelsea Charms is left as the undisputed title holder of "women with the largest breasts in the industry." Check out this article about Sabrina Sabrok, it mentions that Chelsea Charms has the largest breasts in the world, and that Sabrina is trying to go bigger and bigger to be #1 someday.<a href="http://www.amontillado.it/sabrok.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amontillado.it/sabrok.htm" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> Just because Maxi Mounds has an award from early 2005 for her string implants that weigh far less than Chelsea's has nothing to do with the notability of Miss Charms. Wikipedia clearly needs editors that know at least a little bit about what their writing about. If someone knows nothing about who is a top big bust model, or whether their notable in their profession, then they shouldn't be voting on or trying to delete such articles.Powergirl 07:03, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Restated Delete</b>. I took a look at the new references provided, and they have not changed my mind. None of them look like "credible sources", and indeed, most of them are just links to promotional or porn sites (one of them even requires a password for entry), some of which did nothing more than confirming that there is an entertainer named "Chelsea Charms", without giving any other information about her <a href="http://www.exoticdancer.com/?page_id=116" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.exoticdancer.com/?page_id=116" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>. As for the others, the two that looked the most credible were an article in a 2002 issue of <i>Hustler</i><a href="http://www.kapelovitz.com/stripcon.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kapelovitz.com/stripcon.htm" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>, and a website about San Francisco erotica <a href="http://eros-guide.com/articles/2004-09-21/edance04/" class="external autonumber" title="http://eros-guide.com/articles/2004-09-21/edance04/" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>, but again, they did little but confirm that Chelsea Charms exists. This kind of coverage is what we refer to as "trivial mentions", and they don't verify notability. Not every model who has appeared on the cover of a magazine, is notable enough to deserve a Wikipedia bio. To prove that Ms. Charms is "famous", I would want to see proof of published articles that don't just mention her, but are <i>about</i> her. Notability could also be established by providing proof that she had won an award of some type, or a credible claim somewhere that she was "biggest" or "most famous" or any of the other claims being made. As is said in many other places around Wikipedia: If someone is genuinely famous, then many articles are going to be written about them, and that will provide proof of notability. Wikipedia is not what <i>makes</i> someone famous, Wikipedia is what is used to report on someone who is <i>already</i> famous. If proof can be provided of that notability, to show that she meets any of the requirements listed in <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a>, I might change my mind, but so far such proof has not yet been provided. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 20:45, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b> Yes, "relatively objective". I dare say that this article could be written about the impact of Chinese goods on many nations including the United States. The fact that it focuses on the impact of Chinese goods on Pakistan is perhaps unfortunate since this suggests that we would have an article on the impact of Chinese goods on India and every other nation other than China. The tone of the article is unencylopedic but the substance is quite encyclopedic. I think it deserves a cleanup tag but not the NPOV tag although more POVs could be added to make it a more comprehensive article. What I mean by this is that there are the POVs of manufacturers big &amp; small, retailers big &amp; small, the national and local governments and the consumer. This article doesn't really cover the range but then again few articles do. In any event, this article certainly should NOT be deleted. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 07:18, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Do not delete</b>. Yes, I am the author of the article as well as of most (but not all) papers on Quantum Cybernetics. I will not go into any detail concerning the numerous errors and half-truths that came up in the discussion here. Knowing that you will delete anyway, here's what I still have to say.</li>
</ul>
<p>I put the article here, because I thought that WP was a forum less conservative than the average (sic!) academia. I am a person involved in the discussion on the foundations of quantum theory for quite some time now, and from the serious discussions I do have with open-minded physicists, I've not had a single argument that would cast serious doubt on the proposed theory. By the way, may I remind you of Murray Gell-Mann's famous statement: "Quantum mechanics is not a theory, but rather a framework within which we believe any correct theory must fit." This is true even 80 years after it has been brought into existence! So, a little modesty would be quite adequate when putting judgements into a general form, like saying, for instance: "...but then I supposes hidden variables approaches to QM have been out of vogue since, well, Bohr." This quote by Mr. Byrgenwulf speaks for itself, even if it is meant half-jokingly (which I assume, because later in the talk he quotes John Holland's book as a "good" one) - this is exactly the way most orthodox (quantum) physicists (Copenhageners) behave. This has of course nothing to do with intellectual sincerity, but only with (mostly institutional) power. Whoever doubts this is invited to look up our webpage http:\\web.chello.at\ains and scroll down to the article on "The John Bell Scandal".</p>
<p>It is far from true that Quantum Cybernetics is only founded on one scientific paper (the one I quote is just an exemplary one, of course, and Found.Phys.Lett. is EXACTLY the journal where you publish "foundational" theoretical papers - Nature, or Phys.Rev.Lett., resp., would not do that on principle!), nor is the theory unknown among experts (see, e.g., J. Baker-Jarvis and P. Kabos, Phys. Rev. A 68, 042110 (2003), who begin their summing up of hidden-variable theories by saying: "Holland, Grossing &lt;sic! no umlaut this time&gt;, and others have performed extensive research in this area." That my approach is not quoted in strictly Bohmian papers is no big surprise, as I do believe that the Bohmian approach does not go far enough, although in many respects I consider it one of the most valuable antidotes vis-a-vis the Copenhagen hegemony, which pervades most of conservative academia (and which, of course, still does not have a theory in Gell-Mann's sense yet!).</p>
<p>So, what can you do? Trying to go beyond Copenhagen Mysticism (which maintains that there will be no better "understanding"), with a realist agenda, but not being a Bohmian, you'll have to develop un-orthodox strategies to promote your theory. I thought WP was an option for doing this, because I did and do believe that Quantum Cybernetics is an OFFER to people who like to THINK AUTONOMOUSLY. Unfortunately, as it seems, WP is dominated by the same academic people who have the say in the intellectual milieu that is responsible, amongst other things, for the John Bell Scandal. (By the way, up until late in his career, when he published upon invitation for Rev.Mod.Phys., Bell never published any of his by now famous papers in a scientific journal of "high reputation". He even was not allowed to give a course on the foundations of quantum theory at CERN throughout his life!)</p>
<p>Personally, I am convinced that sooner or later, a hidden-variable type theory will have to substitute quantum theory. Most likely, this will become necessary not because of a phantastic new theory that all of a sudden explains it all, but because new experimental facts (based on better than present-day resolutions) will force even orthodox quantum physicists to admit modifications of their beloved holy grail. Then, perhaps in a not too far future, one would be forced to look for new theoretical approaches. Quantum Cybernetics may turn out to be too simple an approach, but it might as well be that it can provide an acceptable starting-point for a more profound understanding.</p>
<p>Of course, I cannot conceal my disappointment about WP policies responsible for deletion of my article. I feel they have to do with an urge to be "respectable" among academics, and to stick to what can "really safely" be said about, e.g., scientific issues. Unfortunately, there's not much that is "really safe", especially in the foundations of quantum theory (and its relation to relativity, for example), and it would be wise to remain open-minded on all those issues that are only seemingly "safe", but in reality covered-up with a lot of meaningless rhetoric, like "out of vogue-ness", and the like. Okay, I guess I'll leave it at that. 212.186.121.51 20:48, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello. I really was just being flippant when I made the quip about hidden-variables approaches being out of vogue. I don't like the Copenhagen interpretation either. Also, this is really not about the accuracy or validity of your work. We both know that hidden-variables approaches have their own problems (rotational invariance, non-locality, <i>ad hoc</i>ness, etc.). So it comes down to choosing one's poison, really, as Maudlin put it. Finding an approach that sits well with one philosophically, in the absence of the higher-resolution experimental evidence (which may never be forthcoming). However, if anything nowadays, a bit of Copenhagen austerity is a blessed relief from the ontological excesses of the many-worlds view, which is arguably becoming the dominant viewpoint.</dd>
<dd>I am pleased to see that I was right about your decision to post the quantum cybernetic article here not being out of vanity, but rather a sincere attempt to draw people's attention to it. The thing is, we have to draw the line somewhere, and experience dictates that theorists posting their own theories just doesn't work. However, maybe it is me who is being unforgiveably blind and ignorant here. Can you provide some citations of the quantum cybernetic approach by <i>other people</i>? Because certainly, if it has generated healthy discussion in the literature, then we <i>should</i> have an article on it. I just couldn't find any (and I did look!). But Wikipedia, I'm afraid, is not the place to <i>stir up</i> that discussion. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 21:27, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Hello again. I may be loosing my time here, but anyway: here’s one last comment on my behalf. Yes, there are actually quite a number of citations from other people; out of several such in the early days, take, for example: G. Resconi and P. J. Marcer, "A novel representation of quantum cybernetics using Lie algebras", Physics Letters A 125, 6-7 (1987), 282-290; and in recent years, since about 2003, apart from book reviews (in English, Russian and Chinese) of my Springer book, I can offer the Phys. Rev. article I quoted last time, and also those: R. W. Carroll, "On the quantum potential", Applicable Analysis 84 (2005), 1117-1149. R. W. Carroll, Fluctuations, information, gravity and the quantum potential, Springer, book in press (2006), and a book in preparation in German: L. Fritsche und M. Haugk, Anschauliche Quantenmechanik – where, incidentally, an intensive exchange of ideas since two years is taking place with Prof. Fritsche … all of this as an example of ongoing debates which don’t enter global recognition just because of local language (... but the book is to appear also in English, eventually).</p>
<p>One last remark on the alleged "problems" with hidden-variable approaches. I don’t see one any more with rotational invariance (cf. recent papers by Peter Holland, most of them on the arXive), and concerning nonlocality: well, is the Copenhagen or any other interpretation better in coping with nonlocality?? I don’t think so at all, and in fact, quantum cybernetics offers a way to model nonlocal correlations via establishment of standing waves between "particle" and "detector" – not quite unlike Cramer's <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transactional_interpretation.html" title="Transactional interpretation">transactional interpretation</a> (but without the spooky backward in time stuff). Finally, concerning ad hocness: Look into any book on quantum mechanics and add up all the ad hoc assumptions! Compared to just one (or two) in my derivation of the Schrödinger equation from a modified classical mechanics (related to assumptions about the vacuum), they are legions! Plus: you can't get something from nothing! With this deep insight I say hello one more time. May the good forces be with you! 212.186.121.51 20:08, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Quantum cybernetics is the subject of a book (<i>Quantum Cybernetics: Toward a Unification of Relativity and Quantum Theory via Circularly Causal Modeling</i>) published in 2000 by <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springer_Science%2BBusiness_Media_fe54.html" title="Springer Science+Business Media">Springer</a>, a major worldwide publisher. It has appeared in academic journals (<i><a href="http://www.springer.com/west/home/physics?SGWID=4-10100-70-35631631-detailsPage=journal|editorialBoard" class="external text" title="http://www.springer.com/west/home/physics?SGWID=4-10100-70-35631631-detailsPage=journal|editorialBoard" rel="nofollow">Foundations of Physics Letters</a></i> and <i><a href="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaleditorialboard.cws_home/505705/editorialboard" class="external text" title="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaleditorialboard.cws_home/505705/editorialboard" rel="nofollow">Physics Letters A</a></i>), and as shown by 212.186.121.51's citations above, has attracted interest beyond its originator. By the standard referenced by the nominator that a topic is notable if it "has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works, where the source is independent of the topic itself", quantum cybernetics is notable. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Smith_0e3f.html" title="User:Tim Smith">Tim Smith</a> 10:47, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Ign and Gamespot aren't the best sources to establish notability since they review every game that comes their way, and just because the designer is working on a game that people DO know about doesn't make THIS game notable. Did it sell well, did it win awards, cause controversy or make news in any way other than 'game released?' Did anyone other then reviewers and the article creator even play it? THAT is the information that would prove if this game is notable. Just being released is not enough to distinguish a game from other games. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 14:04, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Considering the developer is notable, I would presume that it would make this game notable enough to have its own article. We don't ask for sales figures on any other games on Wikipedia as a notability check, so why should we in this instance? I want to direct you to some articles about games that are not known by that many people, and not even released by a well known, big developer/publisher; <a href="../../../s/u/p/SuperPower_2_f70d.html" title="SuperPower 2">SuperPower 2</a>, <a href="../../../u/p/l/Uplink_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Uplink (computer game)">Uplink</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crimsonland.html" title="Crimsonland">Crimsonland</a> to name a few.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Also a good point. If you source those reviews, I won't have a problem keeping the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - If this article lacks your precious, "encyclopedic research," then I guess most, if not all, other Half-Life mod articles on Wikipedia better be deleted also. Wikipedia is becoming too tense in allowing what to keep and what to delete. Delete this, if you must, but you're just halting the forward progress of information and what the people see as important. You treat Google "hits" and outside "sources" like they're the bible of all things right with the world. This mod does get attention in it's rightful area, which is the Half-Life community. It does get recognition in said community. All because you don't "see" (read: Google search IYO) it, doesn't mean it isn't there. And as for this site not being a game guide, this page was anything but a guide. It only told about the bare basics about the mod and was to try and get the people informed about it. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacklist_b0a6.html" title="User:Blacklist">Blacklist</a> 22:37, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Buffy trivia he may be, but he was significant enough to be a character in the Sunnydale Sock Puppet Theater, and he's coming out as a merchandise item from one of the faux-prop makers.

<li><b>Keeper for sure!</b> If you are going to delete this because it is considered just a game then how about MSN zone? VATSIM is enthuasiast site/community that loves aviation and is modeling the real world airlines they represent. The community has been around for over a decade and has a strong following. They also have a yearly convention at a real hotel. What gamers site has that? The members are very professional and courteous. And some members are actual pilots and aviation employees. I say keep it right where it is with maybe some edits.MarkP1969 20:40, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Bit of Rebuttel</b> Not being critical but the 'deletes' are not showing me convincing evidence, they are just throwing the fact that this is a gaming site as a reason, should we delete the Myspace article or Neopets etc. etc. all popular all have articles all arn't deleted --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcgrath50_e147.html" title="User:Mcgrath50">Rob</a> 13:21, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Please Keep!</b> VATSIM is more than just a group, it is a whole organization with thousands of members. It was even on the front page of the Wall Street Journal! -- 06 October 2006 (1013 UTC)</li>
<li><b>Deffinetly Keep</b> This page is about a notable group in the FS community. It is written reasonably well, there is worse, a lot worse. If IVAO has been deleted I believe that was a mistake and should be rectified. If people believe the tone is 'advertising' then by all means rectifiy it but we have had worse articles about stupider stuff kept. We have articles for games, ranging from big games (Counterstrike) to games that probably few of the community have heard of. The articles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MMORPGs" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MMORPGs" rel="nofollow">Here</a> seem to all be of unkown things and most advertising... using this logic maybe we should delete them --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcgrath50_e147.html" title="User:Mcgrath50">Rob</a> 22:37, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. The page could use some clean-up, but the group seems fairly notable. 120'000 members and a Wall Street Journal article on their activities, that seems pretty iron-clad to me. The article definitely needs to be 'dumbed down' (it seems written for people who are already familiar with air-traffic control and Flight Simulator, which i am not), but i wouldn't call it 'nonsense'. ~ <a href="../../../l/a/v/User%7ELav-chan_eb6b.html" title="User:Lav-chan">lav-chan</a> @ 15:22, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> VATSIM is not just an ad for flight sim, it is a community much on its own dedicated to realistic simulation of ATC. VATSIM does not advertise commercial products (any add-on software required to use Vatsim is 100% free) nor is this article an add for Vatsim, as Vatsim is a NPO.

<p>Not only is this article's subject rather arguable in notablility as well as the title being in the wrong format, but the prose is extremely POV and riddled with phrases that make it sound like it was written by a close friend (I don't believe it was, however). It added {{POVcheck}} tag to it, which was subsequently removed by someone else (who did not make it NPOV). Even the article's picture has no copyright tag whatsoever. If someone wants to remake it, this time with more facts in a NPOV way then they may.

<dd>Nauticashades strongly insist on deleting this page rather that helping out when I asked as to what should I do. She says about NPOV which might be true, but I did not know.

<dd>Lav-chan says pastor Don's life has inspired a lot of people. He also goes on to say that this page has got nonsense <b>"Half the article is nonsense, half of it is pushing religion, and the other half lacks any notibility whatsoever.

<dd>Uncle G says <b>"· The article is clearly a mis-use of Wikipedia to publish a memorial. It was created the day after the memorial service for the article's subject.

And so everyone vote for deleting rather than seeing the content and helping me out when I asked so many of them. You can do what you want. Remember this page Pastor Don M Spiers is not a religious promotion. I just created it so that people can know more about him I thought there was also a stub added too.

<li>No offense, but try to check your grammar before you save a comment you have written.</li>

<li>You misread <a href="../../../l/a/v/User%7ELav-chan_eb6b.html" title="User:Lav-chan">lav-chan</a>'s comment. He/She wasn't saying the his life was inspiring, he was <i>quoting your article</i>. He/She was saying that such a statement is entirely not appropriate for an encyclopedic article.</li>
<li>Look up "tacitly" in the Wiktionary if you don't know what it means.</li>
<li>You may have asked for help, but the article is unsalvageable. As <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> said, there is no information on this article with a reliable source or that could be made NPOV.</li>

<dl>
<dd>I did a little formatting work, hope nobody minds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway i felt i should clarify what i said earlier. NauticaShades is right in describing what i meant — that that sentence was inappropriate, not only because it was nonsensical and badly written, but also because it is, by definition, pushing a religious POV. Which is what some of the article is still doing, despite Edison's claim that he removed POV material. There are still a few 'factual' references to accepting Jesus Christ and the power of God and all that jazz.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That of course isn't grounds to delete the article entirely. Those POV statements could still be reworded or removed. But i think it does illustrate a lack of understanding on the part of the two or three persons who are involved in editing this article (and its related articles, which have similar problems). They seem to be unable to grasp Wikipedia's NPOV and notability guide lines. There are people on the talk pages of these articles congratulating themselves on making things NPOV, and it's just kind of laughable, because it's <i>blatantly</i> POV and they don't even realise it. And i'm not talking about subtle subconscious wording, i'm talking about outright religion being pushed as fact, not even pretending to be neutral.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I hate to come off like i'm crusading against religion. I'm really not. It's just that, whatever religion you may follow, i think it's a very simple matter to detect when you're promoting a faith like that in an article. If you can't do that, you really need to familiarise yourself with Wikipedia's guide lines. And if you still can't do it after reading all that, i think you need to re-evaluate your involvement in certain topics on Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, as far as my comment on rencin24's history, i was referring to his <a href="../../../r/e/n/User_talk%7ERencin24_4a4a.html" title="User talk:Rencin24">talk page</a>, which suggests he has a lot of 'new-comer'-type issues which he doesn't appear to be interested in resolving. They'd be easily forgivable if it was a once-or-twice kind of thing, but he's only been here for a month and already he's racked up a huge amount of mistakes that he just keeps repeating over and over. If he has read any of the guide lines or help pages, he obviously didn't take them to heart.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't mean it to be a personal attack or anything, it's just something that i think should be taken into consideration when weighing the validity of his edits. ~ <a href="../../../l/a/v/User%7ELav-chan_eb6b.html" title="User:Lav-chan">lav-chan</a> @ 22:31, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I believe Lav-Chan has gone a bit too far in the criticisms of the article as blatant POV promotion of religion after the extensive edits done recently. In articles about religions, statements are commonly made such as "Followers of religion X believe Y." There should not be a stricter standard in this regard for some religions than others. If Spiers "accepted Jesus" that is a description of a decision he made one day, and would be standard for an evangelical minister. If it says he felt this or wondered that, or felt blessed, it is not a claim of proof or even advocacy of a religion. Articles about Catholics say some are determined by the church to be Saints. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marian_apparitions.html" title="Marian apparitions">Marian apparitions</a> says several miraculous appearances by Mary have been confirmed by the church as legitimate. The article on <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wesley_f66e.html" title="John Wesley">John Wesley</a>, Methodist, says he "Felt his heart strangely warmed" while hearing Bible commentary, and quotes him "For fifty years God has been pleased to bless the itinerant plan." A certain latitude should be granted in recounting the lives of religious figures. Certainly POV statements like "And then he went to heaven" or "Jesus spoke to him" should be removed. But Lav-Chan seems to demand there be no mention of God or the subject's religious belief in an article about a pastor, which is rather strange and extreme, in the light of say, the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Graham_526a.html" title="Billy Graham">Billy Graham</a> article. A better plan than deletion might be to edit out any remaining POV statements or statements about his life which are unsupported by verifiable sources. Enough well supported facts remain to satisfy <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I certainly removed POV statements; sorry if I missed some.

<dd>That isn't even remotely what i was implying. Statements like 'Jesus spoke to him' are exactly the kind of thing i was talking about; every other example you cited (if i'm to take your word for them, which i will) is perfectly acceptable and nothing i said earlier contradicts that.</dd>

<dd>Anyway that doesn't even matter if you want to get right down to it. Even if the article is the pinnacle of neutral point of view, it doesn't address the notability issue. You've got three references listed in the article, one of which is an obituary, which certainly does not count for anything since it doesn't assert notability. Another is an article published in a magazine in 1976. Can't find any assertion that the magazine is especially notable outside Oral Roberts's group. No awards, no Web site, no particularly reliable third-party verification that the magazine even existed (although i'm sure it did). And the last one appears to be a personal memorial, although the link isn't working for me so i can't check at the moment.</dd>

<dd>You mentioned on my <a href="../../../l/a/v/User_talk%7ELav-chan_ee99.html" title="User talk:Lav-chan">talk page</a> (and i'll reply to you there also) that 'Googleism' is a bad habit to get into and that it might just take a while to find good sources off-line. That may be the case, but that's not how Wikipedia works. You can't go around creating articles and promise to find sources for them later. You find the source and <b>then</b> you create the article. If you can find some reliable third-party references for Don Spiers in a notable news paper or magazine article, that's great, go ahead and write his article. But until then, you haven't asserted any notability, so i feel the page should be removed.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: "Jesus" is mentioned exactly twice in the article, and nowhere does the phrase "Jesus spoke to him" appear. It says he "accepted Jesus" which describes something common in all evangelicals, and does not say "Jeses did thus and such. " It also says that a gospel passage is the words of Jesus, hardly an extreme POV. I have done another pass of editing. I cannot find any POV statements in the article which go beyond the standard of stating what a religious person believed or felt, which is seen in all other articles about religious persons. It is legitimate, per your own comment on the talk page of the article's creator, to say "Pastor Spiers felt that Jesus was speaking to him." Nowhere does it state that any supernatural power did anything whatsoever. Please note that I did not create the article. All I have had time to do is Google search. Had I been the creator, I would have started with a university library or large public library. In the past I have even used interlibrary loan to obtain microfilm of foreign newspapers from 1915 to try and come up with a verifiable source for other articles. I never heard of this individual before finding it in AFD. If I see an AFD and it looks like the subject might be notable and verifiable with a little research, or that questions of style might be resolved by editing, I make the effort. Editing to improve articles or to verify claims is supposed to be a goal for Wikipedians. Also please note that I have started a discussion topic at Wikipedia talk:Notability (people) to create a standard for notability of religious leaders. Some should have articles, if, for instance they are an official of their denomination churchwide, or they started some important movement or were notable in ways special to religion. They probably should not have an article if they were just a typical priest, rabbi, or mullah serving a local group. We have such standards for Porn actors and sports figures, and it would save a lot of argumentation. I have also started a discussion for standards of notability for individual churches, also seen all the time in AFD. We have a standard for schools, so why not for churches.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:50, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You (and the article's creator) still haven't asserted notability, not even in your as-yet-unadopted notability proposal for religious persons. Being 'an official of their denomination churchwide' doesn't make a person notable, not outside their church anyway. The church itself must be notable, and the official must still have <i>references</i>. You can not add a person to Wikipedia without there being information available on him. It doesn't matter if he's the single most well-known person in all of human history. If there are no reliable published references on him, he doesn't get a Wikipedia article. It's just common sense, people can't edit an article on a subject that has no readily available sources.</dd>

<dd>I don't have anything against church officials and churches, even minor ones, being added to Wikipedia. And i don't have anything against devising notability standards for the same. But it's all a moot point, because this guy simply has no good references. If you can find your assertion of notability in microfilm or a library, that's awesome. I'll totally retract my opposition to this article. But until then, you've got nothing on the guy. You're apparently banking on the notion that something will be found <i>in the future</i> to assert his notability, and you just can't do that on Wikipedia. Notability comes <i>before</i> you write the article. ~ <a href="../../../l/a/v/User%7ELav-chan_eb6b.html" title="User:Lav-chan">lav-chan</a> @ 20:41, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your kindness and know that things of this nature should not be seen as an attack on your person, everyone here really is just focused on making sure the wikipedia is the best it can be. While I still would vote for a deletion, for much of the same reason as lav-chan, its now due largely to the issue of notability. If the article does stay it needs to be cleaned up a bit more for NPOV issues; I just cleaned up one particularly bad section (despite past claims that its been cleaned, phrases like "accepted Jesus into his heart" and such do support a POV). --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 04:39, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. Oh no, I spent a great deal of time talking about this AfD closure. For some reason, it didn't get saved. Now I have to wrack my brain and try to type it again...</p>
<p>I know that this AfD closure will likely be disputed, so I'd better write something that I will copy and paste to a DRV, if it happens. In a nutshell, the consensus is that this article fails to assert notability.</p>
<p>There were a few Keep&#160;!votes:</p>
<ul>
<li>One says all non-notable churches belong on Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Two say that this is one of the largest and most well-known churches in Melbourne. Later on, this was sourced, but only with a number of people attending the church. There were no credible sources/references saying that this is one of the largest or most well-known churches in Melbourne.</li>
<li>One says that there is a source attesting to its size, but that is minimal</li>
<li>One that basically says the article needs to be cleaned up because it fails to assert notability.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that these arguments to keep are insufficient to outweigh or address the concerns mentioned by the delete arguments, which is why I'm closing this as Delete. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 18:44, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Then you misunderstand what a church is about. The church is the people, not the building. What we need is a set of criteria written that establishes the notability of a church. (<a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 03:11, 6 October 2006 (UTC))

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I think Raffles mk's research has made this article notable, which is the best outcome for all. A Baptist Church in Australia with 2300 people is quite big - that should make it one of the biggest in Australia - and should make it notable. To be mentioned in the Bulletin as a mainstream media source on the rise of the churchgoing population makes it notable too.

The sole claim to notable I've seen so far is size (about 3000 on Sunday). (For the record, I find that kind of creepy.) Does that make it notable?

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, I think that size makes it notable because it means it is the largest Baptist Church in Australia. The article should probably be expanded (by someone more familiar with them, I know of them from being in a Baptist Church on the other side of the country) to include information on that status as one of the "flagship" churches and also about the stuff they do with their influence as one of the larger churches, such as their conferences to build into other church leadership. -<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonb_97e1.html" title="User:Jasonb">Jasonb</a> 13:11, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, If the largest church in one of the largest denominations in Australia is not notable, then what churches are notable? More members means more money, more influence with politicians, more media coverage, more charitable works etc. By Australian standards, 3300 members is extraordinarally successful. <a href="../../../r/a/f/User%7ERaffles_mk_104d.html" title="User:Raffles mk">Raffles mk</a> 06:18, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I suspect that the church is indeed notable, based on the discussion above. Unfortunately, the article and external links/references to date don't yet make it clear. I think we should have an article on the subject, so I can't say deletion is the right option. But the article also doesn't meet my standards for a keep opinion.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> there is now sourcing attesting to its size, but it is minimal.

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem is that everything I can find in a websearch are rumor sites. One says it's absolutely confirmed that Goran Visnjic will star. Another says for sure it's going to be Thomas Jane. IMDB says the movie is "Negotiating to shoot this winter". A good deal of the time on films "in development" at this stage, the movie never gets made at all. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 18:46, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

The result was <b>speedy delete</b> for several reasons. First, this is a wholly unsourced potentially libellous article about a real person, an <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttack_page_c5ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Attack page">attack article</a>. Second, seeing how short <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Barone_641e.html" title="Anita Barone">Anita Barone</a> is, the idea of having a separate article for an individual incident involving that person is just silly. Third, for a current event involving a television actress that purportedly took place 4 days ago, there is <i>zero</i> coverage on <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_News_5160.html" title="BBC News">BBC News</a> and <i>nothing</i> locatable via Google News. Fourth, the purported news article linked to by the article is bogus.

<li><b>Keep</b> The terminology used by the Celtic Alliance of America might be expressed somewhat in strong terms but essentially Cornwall is in effect a National Minority held as a subdued nation by the UK government. For those interested in respect of Cornwall a case has been presented to the European Court of Human Rights by members of the Cornish Stannary Parliament in respect of alleged violations of the European Convention of Human Rights and on the April, 13 2006 the Court acknowledged receipt thereof.Jowan99 13:26, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Thats all well and good and I don't necessarily disagree with your sentiment, but the article does not talk about Cornwall as a subdued national minority, but uses phrases such as "loyalist death squads" and "political prisoners" with respect to Cornwall. Where are these political prisoners? I also don't remember any loyalist death squads when I was growing up, although Penzance can resemble a war torn state on a Saturday night&#160;;) <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a> 15:07, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have visited the site in question and do not read the points you raise as you quote them, or specifically applying to Cornwall, but only if such a case were to exist that the CAA would highlight such actions. The ongoing contention over Cornwall within these pages does point to something being seriously wrong and depending upon which side of the fence one sits as to whether this is seen as pure evil [my position] or a nonsence [the Imperial view] -- TGG 16:37, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>"The CAA state that they are against "loyalist death squads", "racist neo-nazi groups", and what they refer to as "occupying British and French forces within Ireland, Scotland, Cornwall, Brittany, and Wales"</i> quoted from the article itself but also simmilar wording on the website - I can't really see how this can be read any other way.

<li><b>Keep</b> It presents another external view that potentially brings the iniquitous position of our Cornish Duchy into focus for the Cornish worldwide and anyone else genuinely interested in our Rights. The fact that Cornwall <b>is</b> included represents just another facet of what Philip Payton sub-titles his book "The making of modern Cornwall" as, Historical Experience and the Persistence of "Difference". It seems that the page needs to be rewritten to remove the cut &amp; paste feel and, possibly, the organisation needs to be approached on that basis? -- TGG 16:37, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I feel, personally, that the notable aspect rests in its particular focus of a <b>Celtic Alliance</b> at a time when we are being actively 'encouraged' to believe that the Celts are a myth! It is however, possibly, too early to judge whether or not it may achieve notability through successful activity -- TGG 19:51, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An even bigger problem than notability is verifiability. There is no source for the existence of this group other than its own website, and a few posts on web forums and bulletin boards. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 20:30, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: If an organization creates an article about itself on Wikipedia, and if the Wikipedia article is copied onto the many mirrors and spin-offs that use Wikipedia's content, then the organization's visibility and Google search ranking will rise. It's giving those organizations an unfair advantage, and frankly advertising isn't what Wikipedia is for. I'm not saying that's what's happened here, because I don't know for certain; but it wouldn't surprise me that the CAA has gained a higher profile since this article's been on WP. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuartierLatin1968_0d61.html" title="User:QuartierLatin1968">Q·L·</a><i><a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuartierLatin1968_3a4e.html" title="User talk:QuartierLatin1968">1968</a></i> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_QuartierLatin1968_1419.html" title="Special:Contributions/QuartierLatin1968">☿</a> 23:47, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Every section of the Ground rules article lacks references and therefore constitutes original research. No effort is being made to add references. Rather than delete all sections as original research, it makes more sense to delete the entire article. Besides the original research problem, the following are additional reasons for removing the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Businesses sometimes do use ground rules for meetings, but the list of rules in the article may be considered arbitrary at best and representing a particular business philosophy at worst (POV).</li>
<li>Does anyone besides the editors of this Wikipedia article talk about Congressional Standing Rules as "ground rles"? If not, then the article is invoking the view that any set of rules can be considered "ground rules." This page should then be replaced with a re-direct to the Wikipedia page on <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rules.html" title="Rules">Rules</a>.</li>
<li>Baseball does indeed have ground rules. But there is already an article on baseball ground rules in Wikipedia: <a href="../../../g/r/o/Ground_rules_%28baseball%29.html" title="Ground rules (baseball)">Ground rules (baseball)</a>. The baseball ground rules alone are not a justification for keeping this article.</li>
<li>Psychotherapists also use ground rules for therapy. However, as with the business ground rules, the list of rules in the article may be considered arbitrary at best or reflecting a particular therapeutic approach at worst (POV).</li>
<li>People in open marriages, such as swingers and polyamorists, often talk about having ground rules for their relationships. I had written a separate article on relationship ground rules that referenced all material to research conducted by PhDs and published in scientific books and journals. That article was, ironically, deleted as original research. (I was not the author of any of the scientific studies cited in the article.) The paragraph remaining in the ground rules article does not contain the referenced material and hence fails the original research criterion.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, per zat guy. The article is essentially a (vague) unverified dicdef with numerous arbitrary examples. The "government" section is completely unsubstantiated.

<p>Thanks for your help.

With this is mind, I would appreciate it if you could reconsider the deletion of this article. Many thanks. Kimwatkins 16:10, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm bringing this to AfD in hopes of clearing up notability. An article on this author, written in part by <a href="../../../n/s/t/User%7ENsteinbeck_cdaa.html" title="User:Nsteinbeck">User:Nsteinbeck</a>, was speedily deleted on 29 Aug. I think <i>co-author of the critically acclaimed memoir</i> is a claim of notability, so AfD seems a more appropriate venue. Article is currently a copyvio from the author's web site <a href="http://www.nancysteinbeck.com/author.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nancysteinbeck.com/author.html" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>; unsatisfactory permission to use this text was given at <a href="../../../n/s/t/User_talk%7ENsteinbeck_5685.html" title="User talk:Nsteinbeck">User_talk:Nsteinbeck</a>. As to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, she has written one book, which appears not to have done particularly well, although the subject of the book is quite notable. Amazon page contains reviews from Publisher's Weekly and Library Journal, but in a quick google I don't see a lot of other <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> discussing it. I do not have a strong opinion, but would consider this a <b>very weak delete</b>.

<li>The problem with the current article is that it reads like a blurb because that is what it is. I preferred Fan-1967's stub.

<li><b>Keep</b> Seems like the copyright issue has been fixed. Their website shows Ms. Steinbeck's numerous key-note lectures at major venues and many positive reviews of their book.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Her book was named among the top 10 for 2001 by Writer Magazine. Notability not an issue, copyright not an issue, and it's been stub-ified.</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. Please note that AfD does not govern merges, 'merge' arguments must be counted as 'keep' (due to the necessity of preserving the article in some form for working with and for GFDL licensing), and thus 'delete or merge' is self-contradictory. As there is a clear consensus for a separate article not existing, I'm closing this as delete despite the confusion among the participants. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 21:51, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The day Xtremebitz isn't notable will be the same day hell freezes over! Shouldn't people be able to look the show up? The show has so many listeners and it just keeps growing and it would be in wikipedieas best interest to keep xtremebitz on the site, when xtremebitz gets really big then wikipedia will be begging to have them back if they remove them.</p>
<p>Xtremebitz isn't just a small thing, it's big. It has listeners all over the place, it interviews bands and gives growing bands a chance to spread the word about themselves. And if a member of a band wants to look up what they're getting themselves into they should be able to using wikipedia</p>
</div>
<p><br />
Xtremebitz is great, it should stay on wikipedia. Not only is it a great radioprogram but also it encourages freedom of speech. Wikipedia has lots of articles about drugs, addictive ones too. And Xtremebitz is addictive so people should know what to do if they are an addict</p>

<p>A discussion on whether or not to keep this article has begun on its talk page. I am giving the discussion the proper forum (AfD) in order to settle the matter. Below is the discussion thus far on the article's talk page:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>This article is for a Greens candidate in the upcoming 2006 Victorian State election. There is a conflict with WP:autobiography. While political candidates (as opposed to elected politicians) are generally considered "not notable", <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Wooldridge_ab5c.html" title="Mary Wooldridge">Mary Wooldridge</a>, another candidate for the seat of Doncaster, has an article so there sets a precedent. Please indicate whether you <b>support</b> or <b>oppose</b> keeping this article.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>support</b> in the interests of balanced coverage of main candidates for the seat of Doncaster. Please note that I am also the Greens candidate for Box Hill. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 01:46, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>oppose</b> it should be written by someone other than the candidate (please refer to Adrian Jackson's and Luke Martin's case). There must be a description about the Greens Candidate for Doncaster, but not from him.<a href="../../../2/0/3/User%7E203.213.100.95.html" title="User:203.213.100.95">203.213.100.95</a> 07:18, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>oppose</b> The article is a list of election commitments and a single paragraph of biography. While I might personally agree with the policies (especially the Workchoices bit), I don't think Wikipedia is the place for what is essentially a political statement and not an encyclopedia entry. <a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeendan_30c0.html" title="User:Jeendan">Jeendan</a> 20:28, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Weasel wording: "It can be argued".</li>
<li>Scholarly opinions differ on the interpretation of "Let <i>us</i> make man . . .". Protestantism and Catholicism consider it an indication of the triune nature of God. Rabbinic Judaism considers it an honorific, like the Queen of England referring to herself as "we". Considering that there are about 10 million Mormons worldwide and well over 1.5 billion Christians, the Mormon view represents an extreme minority view. WP guidelines require that articles should not include extreme minority views unless they are identified as such, to avoid misleading those unfamiliar with a topic from thinking a very minority POV is mainstream. <b><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickReinckens_8aaa.html" title="User:RickReinckens">RickReinckens</a> 23:15, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</b></li>
