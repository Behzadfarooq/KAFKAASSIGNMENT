<dd><b>RE: Is this spam?</b>
<ul>
<li>It is not spam per se, it is an "information bank" of sorts by their description and after checking it out for a bit I'd probably agree w/ that description ... I clicked some links on the website, and I don't think they're actually selling anything. There is no fee to register/sign up for the website. The site has a 'mission statement' section, and in a nutshell, it says that the website is a service to facilitate communication between companies that are new to E-Commerce and companies/employees that have been around the block and therefore have advice to share/give. There is a discussion board section for users to post questions to each other. There's also a section with some informative articles on the nature/dangers/benefits/etc of E-commerce, an FAQ section, an advice section, a 'news' section, yada yada yada&#160;;)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>--&gt; there are two Turkish Wikipedia pages on E-Commerce (just searched to see if there were any, and two came up, and they should be combined though), both just defining and explaining what "E-Commerce" is, etc etc.

<dd>the source of the second one (w/ the capital T) is a Turkish Government website, so that is probably legit info. My suggestion would be to combine these two sites, and then make this Elektronikticaret.org site an external link at the bottom.</dd>

<dd>Well, it could be worth translating, expanding, and Wikifying.

<p>It is not the goal of an encyclopedic entry to flatter the vanity of the subject. Since the info is verifiable and the subject is notable, it makes no difference whether he would "cringe" to read it, or not. <small><i>–previous unsigned comment by NorthShoreNancy (<a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthShoreNancy_b690.html" title="User talk:NorthShoreNancy">talk</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NorthShoreNancy_e479.html" title="Special:Contributions/NorthShoreNancy">contributions</a>)</i></small></p>

<dd><small>No, you're misinterpreting my statement. I never said that the subject of the article would cringe at it; I couldn't care less. I said any reader of an encyclopaedia would cringe. And not at the facts, but at the obviously angry and biased tone. There is nothing wrong with any of the factual information, and that is why I cast a keep with cleanup vote. But, for example, the entire first paragraph reads like a gossip column written by an old enemy.

<li><b>redirect</b> above mentioned article on twins (for shows will small casts, where kid is mentioned, redirect to show). It was a mistake of the nominator to mix many preschool children with a few older kids. So, its a mistake to do a mass-blind delete here (I would have considered it, if I felt the nomination was selective). There's no harm in redirects. The redirects prevent cluttering up category's with non-notable names, yet preserves the information in out of the way place. The target article should then de-link, to discourage recreation. Group nominations can be effecient, but they require greater selectivity. Note: I'm not suggesting any of the older kids warrants an article, they probably don't, but they shouldn't be blindly dumped out with the rest. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 04:30, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm nominating this one for deletion because: (1) It gets 4 unique Google hits, none to any university websites, suggesting non notability; (2) when one adds the word "<a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagiarism.html" title="Plagiarism">plagiarism</a>" to that Google search, the results come down to zero, suggesting a hoax; (3) it seems to be justifying the great mass of copyvios that get submitted here. (4) It was created by someone with the same username as the author named in the article, suggesting vanity and original research. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> 01:03, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for fixing the tag!

<li>It probably is copyright and you were right to spot it and point it out. But the copyright page allows us 1 week to get permission.

<li>Indeed, WP:MUSIC does seem to allow for some leeway when talking about non-mainstream types of music.

<p>This was tagged for speedy by it's creator for being his own original research. However, it's been around a long time, has other minor contributors, and might not be a valid speedy under the rules. It also may have been VfDed a year or so ago, but that was before the archiving system for sych debates was in place, so locating it is difficult. Thought it better to bring here.

<li><b>Keep it</b> - It's just a page to catalogue the history of the game, which the players are very proud of and spend lots of time on. Just because certain people don't appreciate the game doesn't give you the right to try and delete the article about it. As you can tell by the external links, this game has been written up in other places, it has a big history behind it, and many dedicated members.

<dd>I usually use the term "fancruft" sparingly. This article does not have a professional or neutral tone, and harms Wikipedia, and if not for other users by possibly providing a biased or possibly unverified point of view. The community owns the articles, not the individual. It may well be played in many other areas, but there are no third party references to verify, nor does it try to assert its notability neutrally. We do have the right to attempt to delete articles we genuinely think do not belong in Wikipedia, bad faith nominations are <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violations.

<dd>Well we've spent lots of time editing this article, and for someone like yourself to come along and decide it should be deleted... it's disheartening to say the least.

<dd>First thing, trim and formalise the article. Make us understand what it actually is. Establish its notability. Use formal language. If people spend a lot of time on it, then surely, they can spend a lot of time making even better so it can be saved? Provide evidence of its impact on culture or the world. Then, yes, I will change my vote.

<li>Fine here's a compromise. Firstly, information has to be trimmed a bit, there's way too many tables with too little context. Secondly, until the awards ceremony doesn't have a huge impact, or at least it has a smaller impact that the Urapopstar concept as a whole. I suggest <b>merging and redirecting</b> the awards page to this one. Then <b>cleanup</b> is needed for the page.

<li>No change in my vote. The article still does not provide any proof of notability beyond a brief reference in print media and a review in an online paper. No verification is provided for the article's bald claim that it has received "a large amount of web traffic." Most of the article is nothing but a summary of what happens on the "pop charts" within its fictional world, without that context even being consistently clear. It reminds me of the cruft we've been forced to repeatedly delete that documented message board flamewars as if they were a topic worthy of Ken Burns. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 19:18, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> explain to me what "classical" theism is. Its certainly not what the article states: "Classical Theism is long-standing ideas about God within Christianity."

<li><b>Delete</b> I fail to see what the inclusion of the word classical brings to the party other than being a transparent attempt to somehow elevate a single belief system above others. As the simple definition as given on the page is biased, it is likely that the article itself would be just as biased and would serve as a soapbox.

<li><b>Delete</b> as calling Judeo-Islamo-Christianity "classical theism" is POV pushing.

The concepts may be "classical" in a certain set of cultures (particularly Western culture) but there are many beliefs that have been around longer (such as Hindu beliefs). It's rather ethno-centric of us to call something of our heritage "classical" as if it ante-dates all other beliefs somehow. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K.

<li><b>Keep.</b> The goal of Wikipedia is to provide a wide range of information. There is no reason for it to be deleted, though the title could be, as already stated, fixed to read "Last Man Standing Coop". Also, the stated text in the article is quoted from the main page of the site on the external links. It should simply be placed in quotation marks or the context should be changed in accordance.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> As previously stated, Last Man Standing Coop is a very notable Doom 3 user mod. The simple fact that it contributes cooperative multiplayer to the Doom 3 game makes it one of the most popular mods as per Doom 3 Files number of downloads. However, the article should indeed be fixed to read "Last Man Standing Coop". <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMercyKiller_1df7.html" title="User:MercyKiller">MercyKiller</a>
<ul>
<li>What makes this mod notable? What kind of player base are we talking about? What percentage of Doom3 servers are using this mod at any given time? Can you prove it? Empirically? Statistically? Wikipedia is <b>not</b> to provide a "wide range of information", it's to provide a wide range of <i>notable</i> information, the sort of thing a luddite who's never heard of Doom3 needs to know about it. What makes your mod that special? You tell us. But Wikipedia policy is "non-notable until proven otherwise." <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarblespire_61cf.html" title="User:Marblespire">Marblespire</a> 04:05, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, considering several people have come to the developers and stated that LMS is the reason they bothered to buy Doom 3 after hearing that the game was less than stellar, it's certainly notable to the uninitiated as well. See below for several statistics substantiating the mod's value in other ways. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMercyKiller_1df7.html" title="User:MercyKiller">MercyKiller</a></li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> As can be seen on the about page on the website the modification has been featured in well over a dozen magazines, won awards and been featured in many interviews. Not many modifications in any community can boast that many magazine mentions. Also, no other game or modification offers cooperative support for the Doom 3 Expansion pack ROE, not even the XBox version provides this. Last Man Standing is quite unique in this aspect. The vast community for the modification can be seen by it's large array of forum posts and irc users. Also check on <a href="http://topsites.moddb.com/all/" class="external text" title="http://topsites.moddb.com/all/" rel="nofollow">Moddb</a> as Last Man Standing Coop is consistently in the top 10 modifications of well over 2000. This definitely shows that it has quite a community and is popular. --calimer</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> In terms of servers that actually have people on them, it's a good 1/8th at least of the players. I'd say that LMS has the biggest playerbase of all the multiplayer mods in Doom 3, though admittedly there are not many multiplayer mods. The article itself needs serious NPOVifying. I'll try to see to that. (Oh, yeah, and I support moving the article as Zordrac suggests.) Note: I am part of the LMS community. --Iten 04:58, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> "What makes this mod notable?" - simple... Google "Doom 3 coop" and LMS is the first thing that comes up. Anyone wanting to know about Doom 3 cooperative gameplay should be able to find out about this. I agree with Zordrac's proposition to rename it though --Dr. Jones 07:15, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment, we don't actually have an article on ostrich racing, no more than we have an article on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheese.html" title="Cheese">cheese racing</a>, two, it's notable according to an <b>open quote</b> google, ie. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=turtle+racing" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=turtle+racing" rel="nofollow">turtle racing</a> vs <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22turtle+racing%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22turtle+racing%22" rel="nofollow">"turtle racing"</a>, where the first search simply looks for the number of websites containing both the words 'tutle' and 'racing', and the second search returns less hits than "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22hamster+for+president%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22hamster+for+president%22" rel="nofollow">hamster for president</a>", does that mean hamster for president is our next new article?</li>
<li>in fact I'd wager that most of the results of that search would be referring to something that is <b>far</b> from an organized 'sport', in fact, I'd like to see <b>at least</b> one source, that shows the existance of the organized sport of proffessional turtle racing, otherwise this is total nonsense, as the origional tag said--<a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.101.7.html" title="User:152.163.101.7">152.163.101.7</a> 23:55, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's definitely not what "patent nonsense" in the deletion template means; it means something more like "completely incomprehensible."

<li><b>Keep</b>. OK, this article leaves much to be desired, but it isn't totally worthless. There are several non-obvious things said about turtle racing, such as the first-to-the-edge-of-the-circle type of race.

<dd>Regarding his rating: currently only a minority of players has a <a href="../../../f/i/d/FIDE_41fa.html" title="FIDE">FIDE</a> rating or many entries to this card; Tom Dorsch has a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Chess_Federation_9133.html" title="United States Chess Federation">United States Chess Federation</a> rating, but indeed he hasn't played for some time.

<dd>Dorsch was treasurer of the USCF and president of the Northern California association (Calchess). I don't see that as "several top positions in US chess organizations". The USCF is the US national federation but Treasurer is not a top position, and Dorsch served only one term, in the early 90's. Calchess is a state organization (actually half a state, there's a separate Southern California regional organization), not a national one. Dorsch is a somewhat notable figure in recent USCF history and should get a mention in an expanded USCF page, but it's bizarre to say that every USCF ex-officer (there are hundreds of them) rates their own Wikipedia article. The USCF itself is not that important an organization. The person currently holding the comparable office (Finance VP Jonathan Mariner) in Major League Baseball, a much more noteworthy organization than the USCF, doesn't have a Wikipedia article, let alone someone who held that office many years ago. Imagine ex-functionaries of a national stamp collecting club getting all this Wikipedia heat. The only reason it happens for the USCF is because of the contentious personalities in the chess world arguing over nonsense. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> 11:29, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The most noteworthy thing about Dorsch was his campaign for USCF treasurer and what happened after he won the office (all his duties were taken away by the opposing faction which still controlled the policy board). Explaining this would require spending pages on stupid USCF internal politics which almost nobody cares about. The reason Sloan made this page at all is he's in the faction opposite the one Dorsch was in. Having an article about Dorsch makes no sense at all without a neutral treatment of those issues, but I don't think anyone is likely to write such a treatment. Certainly not Sloan. (OK, quick POV version: Dorsch ran on a financial reform platform against vested interests that have controlled the USCF on and off for decades, made accusations of mismanagement that turned out to be true, but was a dorky enough personality that not enough people listened to him at the time, partly because it was in their financial or factional interest to not listen. That includes Sloan.) Trying to turn that into an article would be one of those endless debates that would burn as much of people's wiki-editing energy as the serious national politics articles do, but on a subject of relevance to almost nobody. So creating this article in the first place basically amounts to trolling. I hope non-chess people who voted "keep" based on not understanding the situation will consider changing their votes. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> 11:23, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Come on "He plays chess and has now become a poker player" - what is this? As I said: my complaints about this article are not primarly based on the notability of Tom Dorsch. It's the complete emptyness of this article. And who is going to write something? Even what <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanneB_e69b.html" title="User:JoanneB">Joann</a> has left is not verified. If you remove this as well, only the title tag remains. So the content of this article is: "There is a man called Tom Dorsch."

<li><b>Delete</b> Dorsch is a former treasurer of the USCF, which is sort of like being a former treasurer of the National Bowling League or a former councilmember of some small city. He did have a role in the USCF's transition to the one-member-one-vote system (he opposed it) and he could reasonably get a mention in the USCF's article if it's expanded to cover that history (edit: his treasurer campaign too, a related topic). His highest chess rating was in the 2300's, probably around 1000th in the US--pretty good for an amateur, but nowhere near professional level. The stuff about him getting more Google hits than GM Vesselin Topolov was an error due to Sloan mispelling Topolov's name as "Topalov" when Googling. FWIW, Googling "Tam Dorsch" or "Tom Darsch" gets zero hits. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> 03:59, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This issue shows the complete bankrupt and petty nature of Wikipedia's modus operandi, members, and raison de etre, though I support the proper construction of such an article I think Wikipeda is a collective waste of time intellectually: Where they venerate the "HOLY BIBLE" for some obscure legalist reason today from the stuff cults are made of, but then next week they will burn and destroy those same "holy" documents on some flimsy pretext merely because they have enough votes in legalistic BOOK BURNING as part of some psychotic adversial process that is run like some childishness for the sake of integrity and fairness based merely on form and rules. WIKIPEDIA A GRAND MIND F--K a pedantic idiots' paradise where which ever side you are on you will win and tommarow upon the changing winds of shallow fashion some other will. I suggest all chess articles be forwarded to pushedpawn.org, deism to the templeofreason.org as without sure consistent editorial focus beyond the instance of the moment Wikipedia has the integrity of an adolescent fool. The focus of Wikipedia should be substance not form, and it should be based on preservation of every nuance of what may be a scintilla of what may pertain to knowledge wisdom learning and pertinence not the pettiness that is Wikipedia.

<p>BLANK VOTE - Many professional biographers have noted the problems of including even insignificant persons in a biographic dictionary ("what is the use of this long procession of the hopelessly insignificant? Why repeat the familiar formula about the man who was born on such a day, was ‘educated at the grammar school of his native town,’ graduated in such a year, became fellow of his college, took a living, married, published a volume of sermons which nobody has read for a century or two, and has been during all that time in his churchyard? Can he not be left in peace ..."). Their problem is, on the other hand, almost always related to the lack of space in printed editions -- if Wikipedia suffers even remotely from such a problem, the solution is not to refuse to accept material. My second concern is the relevance of the subject: this is not something to be voted over, unless the voters can be assumed to be reasonably knowledgeable about the context (contemporary chess afairs), as well as fairly unprejudiced towards the subject well as the author. I strongly suspect many voters on this topic vote largely because of lack of confidence in the author. If Wikipedia is to be taken seriously, a more stringent method to decide the inclusion of a particular name is required. I can't decide from the context if the voting is to deny the subject, or deny the article on that subject. In any case, when the subject is judged it should be done impartially. My third concern is with the article: I believe that a biography of any kind needs much more than this particular article shows ... but I also believe that neither biographers nor Wikipedia-authors are born ready-made. A process frpm draft to finished article seems to be called for. Wikipedia must have a procedure for handling these situations: and that must be considered by all parts as impartial and trustworthy.

<dd>That essay belongs in a discussion of grand wikipedia policy, not a vfd about a particular article. Right now the policy is that non-noteworthy biographies get deleted and there's guidelines for establishing noteworthiness. Debating whether the policy and guidelines are good belongs somewhere else. The vfd discussion is simply about whether Dorsch meets the guidelines. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> 11:23, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>DELETE - While Tom Dorsch was a notable figure in the United States Chess Federation, the article as written provides practically no coverage of the issues that made Dorsch important. Instead, the author relates us with tales of Dorsch's activities and proclivities from long ago, which have very little relevance or place in an encyclopedia. Sloan has often written disparaging comments about Dorsch -- and vice versa. It serves no purpose to accept his characterizations of Dorsch as anywhere near accurate enough for inclusion in an encyclopedia. As a United States chess player and former executive board member of the United States Chess Federation, I think it would be a travesty to allow this interpretation of Dorsch stand.</p>
<p>DELETE - Mr. Sloan is using Wikipedia for settling scores and posting his delusions of greatness. Have you folks learned nothing from the Siegenthaler debacle?</p>

<p>Delete. The article is almost complete nonsense, utterly inaccurate, and defamatory.</p>
<p>DELETE - Articles which are about mostly unknown minor officials in sporting associations, have no place on Wikipedia. Particularly ones which are badly written, and are there for the wrong reasons. I would think it hard to believe that there would be anybody else who would be prepared to rewrite this, or replace it with another article.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I included the joke in to <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_joke.html" title="Mathematical joke">Mathematical joke</a> (just added the few lines from here). By the way, the Mathematical joke page needs a massive cleanup, as the jokes would be great as their own sub sections. I am happy for it to be deleted now (so long as the joke remains). I think that a redirect from here is in order, as YES, I do think that there would be occasions when someone might type OCT 31 = DEC 25 in to a search engine. For example - when someone asks them how OCT 31 can equal DEC 25! Also could have a redirect from Halloween = Christmas too just to be sure. I think that everyone basically agrees with this (one way or the other) so I am hoping that this is seen as the consensus view. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 10:02, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. I was surprised to see a Speedy Deletion tag posted, ostensibly because of "notability" and "illegal material." Let me address each one:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>First, lack of notability is a criteria for deletion, not speedy deletion. The Usenet hierarchy alt.sex.stories is critical to an understanding of the growth of the internet into its present form. <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a> predates the Worldwide Web by well over a decade. Many people who are not familiar with the history and background that gave rise to the internet tend to think of the Web as the internet. That's simply not true, it is only one aspect of the Internet and only the most recent. Before there was a Web, there was Usenet. And one of the most important portions of Usenet that drove the popularity of the web were the stories told through the alt.sex.stories hierarchies. This was an important factor in drawing people to the internet in the first place. As detailed by the article itself, understanding the alt.sex.stories hierarchy is critical to understanding how the internet was born. To say it lacks notability is absurd.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As to "illegal" materials, there is no "alt.sex.stories.pedo" as far as I can tell. If one was created in the past (and a Usenet group is easy to create), there is no indication that it in any way has propogated. My Usenet service is among the most comprehensive, with over 120,000 Usenet groups. There's no "pedo" subgroup. If any such group is out there, it is certainly not being distributed. Nonetheless, even if it was out there, the other subgroups certainly do not deserve to be shunned because someone decided to create a questionable subgroup. It is all protected under U.S. law; written materials --even involving minors -- are protected by the First Amendment.<a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;navby=case&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=03-218" class="external autonumber" title="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;navby=case&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=03-218" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> There's no such thing as an "illegal" textual description of a sexual act.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I believe this nomination was made in bad faith and without any checking of notability or legality. <a href="../../../j/t/m/User%7EJtmichcock_d337.html" title="User:Jtmichcock">Jtmichcock</a> 13:07, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per Josh and Jmichcock, and suggest adding a clean-up tag to break things into a few subsections; perhaps Purpose, History and Sub-groups, for example. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 13:46, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> For those who say there is no <b>"alt.sex.stories.pedo"</b> may I point you to <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups/dir?q=alt.sex.stories&amp;sel=33572976&amp;qt_d=Directory+Search" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/groups/dir?q=alt.sex.stories&amp;sel=33572976&amp;qt_d=Directory+Search" rel="nofollow"><b>this</b> Usenet listing</a>. Not only does it exist, but it appears to be active. And as if that wasn't bad enough there is also <b>"alt.sex.stories.babies"</b> which describes inself as <i>"STories involving pre teen children and sex"</i>. alt.sex.stories is a usenet group not a website, but it is the equivilent of a single website. Wikipedia has a policy of not allowing articles devoted to single websites. There are litrally thousands of porn websites out there, so why don't they all have Wikipedia articles devoted to them? And as far as telling the story of Usenet is concerned, I think the <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a> article does that just fine. —<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgan_almighty_3d50.html" title="User:Gorgan almighty">gorgan_almighty</a> 14:17, 19 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I recall reading where Yahoo was being pursued by law enforcement because it was allowing its chat rooms to be used by pedophiles to pick up children. I suppose by that logic <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo.html" title="Yahoo">Yahoo</a> should be de-listed. By way of background, alt.sex.stories is a hierarchy, not a single group and most certainly <b>not</b> a website since it has existed before the Web was even invented (although you can now access the usenet through Google Groups). The subgroups include just about everything that you could imagine, just like Yahoo chat rooms have all manner of behavior. Within the alt.sex.stories groups, there are two main moderated hierarchies, alt.sex.stories.moderated (ASSM) and alt.sex.stories.gay.moderated (ASSGM), both of which have very strict policies on underage sex. I happen to be the moderator the latter and have been for six years (as well as being an assistant moderator prior to taking over). Just the mailing lists for our group includes some 30,000 people and that does not include the tens of thousands of people who read the stories off the web nor those who obtain through Usenet. Our "straight" counterpart, as you can imagine, has an even larger audience. There is no question of notability. I would again urge a <b>Speedy Keep</b>. <a href="../../../j/t/m/User%7EJtmichcock_d337.html" title="User:Jtmichcock">Jtmichcock</a> 16:10, 19 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes I noticed your connection to alt.sex.stories. So the alt.sex.stories Wikipedia article is written by the moderator of alt.sex.stories is it? That in its self has been cause for deletion of articles in the past. Please don't take my request for deletion as a personal insult against you, as its not. Your comment about Yahoo being pursued by law enforcement because it allowed its chat rooms to be used by pedophiles is very true. I'm just concerned about the same happening to Wikipedia. Can we get some comments from people who aren't directly connected to alt.sex.stories perhaps? —<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgan_almighty_3d50.html" title="User:Gorgan almighty">gorgan_almighty</a> 16:38, 19 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is no moderator of "alt.sex.stories", <a href="../../../j/t/m/User%7EJtmichcock_d337.html" title="User:Jtmichcock">Jtmichcock</a> moderates "alt.sex.stories.gay.moderated", and he is far from the only contributer to the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alt.sex.stories.html" title="Alt.sex.stories">alt.sex.stories</a> article here on Wikipedia. I have created a section on the ASS.* hierarchy to attempt to clear up this confusion. And for the record, I have no connection to alt.sex.stories other than appreciation of Usenet's history and impact in general. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 16:45, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>We've never deleted articles because of who wrote them. We delete advertising articles because they're POV, and vanity articles because they're non-notable, not because of who writes them. This article seems perfectly fine with regards to NPOV. As for the legal issues, I can't see any in regard to talking about a group that may or may not have a similar name to another group that may or may not be doing something illegal. Didn't a whole WikiProject dedicated to censoring Wikipedia to comply with Florida obscenity law get shot down not too long ago? I remember voting in the AfD on it but wasn't around when it was closed, and can't remember what it was called to look it up. (For the record, I have nothing to do with ASS. Teeheehee.) --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 16:47, 19 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think the proposer has some misconceptions about Usenet and how groups are formed and managed. I have the codes and passwords for the ASSGM Newsgroup and not any others. While I have some familiarty with the folks working at ASSM (our websites cross-promote each other), I don't have the authority or means to approve, delete or otherwise affect any posting in that group. As to the balance of the Newsgroups in the ASS hierarchy, I don't even check those unless I hear that someone's writing a diatribe about us. I'm not even sure how many other Newsgroups there are. ASSM and ASSGM were both chartered hierarchies set up years ago. Once you got your group, that's what you handle. Individual ISPs that carry your group or not, it all depends on the demand. Largerly, most ISPs won't carry Newsgroups with any sort of underage content designation; Google carries all sorts of groups without such restrictions, but refuses any binary files. As to whether or not Wikipedia should mention a hierarchy that might contains underage materials in a subgroup, I would certainly hope so. If for no other reason to caution people about what their children/spouses/other family members may be getting themselves into. <a href="../../../j/t/m/User%7EJtmichcock_d337.html" title="User:Jtmichcock">Jtmichcock</a> 17:41, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Written word is not illegal, and if that is the basis of its main argument for deletion it is inherently flawed.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. We may have 9/11 conspiracy theory pages, but that's because those nuts got a lot of them published.

<li>All we have is David Shyler's opinion, which can go at his own page. The Mirror source should be removed also, as it is not saying that the bombings were an "inside job". <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 21:49, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The fact that <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Rense_351f.html" title="Jeff Rense">Jeff Rense</a> has some theories about this, and he's notable to get his own article, I think, indicates this can be expanded beyond the Shyler quote. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> 21:51, 19 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That person, according to his article, is a "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theorist.html" title="Conspiracy theorist">conspiracy theorist</a>", therefore it is not surprising he has theories on a wide range of interest, no doubt motivated by commerical intent. Until a credible source show that there is any genuine conspiracy theory, the article should be deleted. Any nutter can make up a conspiracy theory, but it needs to well documented for it to be encyclopedic. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 22:00, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> is easily wrong, and completely false. For one thing, the film which it is supposidly based on (starring Bob Hoskins) was made in 1993, so no chance of a Gamecube release. Only thing on IMDB with Super Mario Brothers in the title is the film itself.</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> - per nomination. Non-notable group. The article is highly self-aggrandizing (qv. "orgasmic experience").

<p>Just becuase this D.Valued user does not have respect for the language of esperanto and obviously does not do research as the band Heroin Jake and the Crack Addicts is making progress in Atlantic Canada which has a culture and music which is different than the rest of North America does not give grounds to delete this article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Replies to User:JLEG: Well, I didn't win the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spelling_bee.html" title="Spelling bee">spelling bee</a>, only because I botched one vowel there as well. Esperanto hasn't got anything to do with it, save the fact that the only Web reference from Google with the name of the group as the search term - both with ampersand and with "and" - is a coincidental mention, not a mention about the band per se. In addition, based on your contribution history - solely limited to a vanity article and articles pertaining to this group, which apparently you've worked with - it is impossible to see you as impartial. Also, it is rude to not suffix your posts with your name (it's simple; add four tildes, <i>et voilá</i>.) <a href="../../../d/2E/v/User%7ED.valued_c9f9.html" title="User:D.valued">D.valued</a> 08:34, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This one's tricky, I would say Original research. There are lots of issues here:</p>
<ul>
<li>the article appears to be verifiable research, but is almost entirely self-referential. The majority of cites appear to be references to books/papers written by the wiki article author.</li>
<li>The other 2 cites in the article appear to be the only other people in this field.</li>
<li>Starting with the misspelled title, the article itself is incomprehensible, which seems suspicious for.</li>
<li>A wiki link to Antenarrative appears in the article, which seems to be a neologism created by the author</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Hey, I'm really new to this. I am the current president of Alpha Chi Epsilon and was more or less having fun with working on a site for us. It is the end of finals now, and I'll have time to fix it up. What I had put up was temporary. We are a local fraternity, not a national, which is why we wouldnt come up in the NIC. Rather than deleting the article, how about I just fix it up these next few days. I cant even edit it now. Hope to get more votes to let my article stay.

<p>A Google search reveals only five distinct hits for the phrase "Three's Company Effect". Only two of those hits reference the meaning mentioned in the article. One hit uses the term to reference watching TV shows as an adult that you enjoyed in your youth and discovering that they weren't as great as you remember. The 2nd hit refers to a strategy with a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collectible_card_game.html" title="Collectible card game">Collectible card game</a> that has no reference whatsoever to the TV show.

<p>This article describes a phenomenon which does not appear to have any reference besides the speculations of John Whatmough (creator of the Extrasolar Visions website).

<dd>Dear Monroe, my involvement in the <a href="../../../a/f/s/Afshar_experiment.html" title="Afshar experiment">Afshar experiment</a> page has been limited to ensuring the accuracy of the reports regarding my work. It would be negligent of me not to do so. The recent John Seigenthaler incident (see <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4534712.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4534712.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4534712.stm</a>) is warning enough for any prudent person to ensure that inaccuracies (as well as malicious attacks) do not survive on Wiki pages. To that end, rest assured that I will keep a watchful eye on the <a href="../../../a/f/s/Afshar_experiment.html" title="Afshar experiment">Afshar experiment</a> page and its contents, given it survives your mysteriously sudden deletion request! Please note that I have not voted here, but simply been forced to respond to criticism, which frankly belongs to the discussion page rather than here! BTW/ my paper is stil under peer-review...

<dd>Linas, the IP you mentioned belongs to the colleague User:Physicsmonk with whom I worked and used his computer last year before I had set up my own Wiki account. After my recent discussions with you I asked him to obtain an account as well, which is exactly what he has done. He retracted the anonymous vote after he realized I had posted his vote for him (see below for the reason). Please stop these unsubstantiated remarks.

<li>Dear Linas, You can't call anyone who supports my work a sockpuppet! User:Physicsmonkis certainly not a sockpuppet either, he is the Boston colleague I mentioned in my e-mail. I asked him to set up an account as you had suggested. He told me about the recent events with Monroe requesting a deletion and then you reinstating Monroe's attempt which I mistakenly understood as your own view. Sorry if I got confused on your vote! At any rate, User:Physicsmonk told me that for some reason he could not post his vote on the Wiki deletion page, which is what I did for him by copying and pasting his response to User:Hmonroe into the vote page. As you can see, I have not voted on the deletion issue myself as I deem that not to be ethical. I hope this clarifies the situation.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but it will be necessary to monitor this page closely owing to its peculiar history. I suggest strong disclaimers to alert the casual reader that Afshar's work cannot be considered established science. The many Speedy Keeps visible on this page are consistent with claims of sockpuppets. WP:Guide to deletion says "Speedy keep is rarely used. It implies that the user thinks the nomination was based on an obvious misunderstanding and that the deletion discussion can be closed early." Earlier versions of this page could easily be construed as original research, so deletion is at least a option worth thinking about. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_Kielpinski_13b9.html" title="User:Dave Kielpinski">Dave Kielpinski</a> 05:41, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think it would be completely against the spirit of science to even consider this article for deletion. Though there hasn't been much news on it, has this experiment not been repeated twice? If there are problems with the scientific establishment so deep that something challenging established ideas is censured(this isn't the only instance) let's hope wikipedia can at least be more open minded. A better suggestion: delete the article on string theory, at least there is an "afshar experiment." If the experiment were held to the same standards as string speculation then it would be infinitely superior. -- Anon <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 63.254.142.215 (<a href="../../../6/3/2E/User_talk%7E63.254.142.215.html" title="User talk:63.254.142.215">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.254.142.215_a12e.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.254.142.215">contribs</a>) 16:58, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, with strong misgivings. This kind of page can be seriously misleading. In particular, the current page tends to give the impression that the results of this experiment are important - in fact, the results are exactly what anyone would have predicted.

<li>I have no problem with the article size reduction, but have every problem with not being able to at least clarify what I have done, or why. It would be charlatanism to ascribe to me what I have not claimed, without a recourse to correct the allegation. After all, if the experiment carries my name, I should be able to explain what it is, or correct mistakes others make in describing its content and my claims. I will avoid directly editing the page given I can communicate my corrections and updates to a responsible, and unbiased editor who would then objectively update the article. I do not see how it could be done otherwise. BTW there is a Crossed beam version of the experiment that is much easier to understand without the need to go into Fourier optics.

<dd>I think you could be right. However, I'm not sure that moving the article to Johannes Reinke would be wise - if the author got the name wrong, the remaining details could also be incorrect.

<li><b>Delete</b> - unreferenced article seems to be off-base on a few details. It would be better to delete than to consider a redirect or a merge (if the material were accurate and referenced I'd urge a merge into the appropriate section of <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photosynthesis.html" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 15:46, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. If this really is Johannes Reinke, as I suggested above, it is better that somebody acquainted with his work starts a new, referenced article. As CLW points out, we can't trust a user who can't even get the first name right. It may well be one of those plausible hoaxes which sometimes stay around for years in the absence of flying Martian pigs or other obvious giveaways. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 21:11, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The nsg actually do meet a few of the criteria:</p>
<p>"Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city"</p>
<p>The nsg are one of the most appreciated and recognized artists in the north shore music scene. They have been mainstays since 2001, constantly attracting a visible and loyal fan bases.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that their popularity has not reached the world of certain wikipedia editors, however that should not detract from the fact that they deserve recognition.</p>
<p>"Is cited in notable and verifiable sources as being influential in style, technique, repertory or teaching in a particular music genre."</p>
<p>Theie evolving style has become quite influential in the north shore scene. many bands have attempted to emulate their songs, finding that their identity is one that is shared by many, however the nsg have consistantly remained atop the scene's heirarchy.</p>
<p>It would be total bullshit if NSG was deleted, they are certainly some of the most progressive innovators in the tristate area.</p>
<p><br />
The NSG are sweet as hell. no deletion!</p>

<p>My name is Marc Timothy Smith - the 'owner' of the Elsmar Cove.</p>
<p>I was shown several links here to my web site the other day. With all the fuss about this site and someone recently showing me some existing links I came and saw and signed up.</p>
<p>My field is quality assurance and business systems. I put in some external links to my forum in several topics (now all removed I see) because there are already existing 'commercial' links such as to isixsigma.com - I assume you are saying here that links to some "commercial" sites are OK but links to others are not OK.</p>
<p>I thought I would be helping here by adding some external links to the Elsmar Cove discussion forums in topic pages whose subject we focus on.</p>
<p>I added the Elsmar Cove page in part because it is the oldest quality assurance forum still on the internet.</p>
<p>BTW - If I was a "link spammer" I'd have been more discreet and put in many, many entries. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Marc T Smith (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarc_T_Smith_03a9.html" title="User talk:Marc T Smith">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marc_T_Smith_099c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marc T Smith">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>Royal patronage is quite common for UK charities; my concern is that accepting this will open the flood gate to large numbers of minor UK charities (I have the impression that the original Afc nomination was for PR purposes) --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Woolley_c02a.html" title="User:David Woolley">David Woolley</a> 10:22, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'd say it is not notable because it is very small and makes no claims, even on the full web site, to have made any real impact on the world. Given its age and the countries involved, I might have expected it to have been important in the second world war, but there is no mention of this. I can understand that the inclusion threshold for not for profits might be much less than for a for profit, but the turnover of this is less than that of a father and son company that could have a similar age. (I feel that WP:CORP needs expanding to give special treatment to not for profits, if this is notable.) Wrt to the royal patronage, from looking at the UK government sites on this (sorry I mislaid the URL), being old and not too controversial are exactly the things that get patronage, so patronage doesn't really add to the case. (That source suggested about 800 patronages each for the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, so I would guess about 3,000 to 5,000 for the whole of UK royalty.) Incidentally, it was only registered as a charity in 1972, although I don't know when the register started. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Woolley_c02a.html" title="User:David Woolley">David Woolley</a> 19:46, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd have to agree, the way it is going, especially as the only way people will find the article at the moment is likely to be the Afd listing, but I think one implication of this is that there needs to be a new guidline for charities (and the US equivalent of not for profit educational and scientific organisations) as this would have been thrown out as both a local social club or as a for profit business. As it is, I'm not sure why one shouldn't dump half the UK register of charities into Wikipedia. (For those not familiar with the UK charity concept, charities basically provide benefits for people other than those that provide their funds and, as a result, once registered, get special tax treatment. The Wiki Foundation could be a charity in the UK.) --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Woolley_c02a.html" title="User:David Woolley">David Woolley</a> 22:46, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Contreras is an Icon of that area, I found rellevance for it following the Stanley "Tookie" Williams execution last night. It follows the lines of an encylopedic entry. Name, date of birth, notation of importance or considerable notoriaty. I have been researching this man in particular since 2003. I attended the University of Miami law school &amp; attended the Miami-Dade Police introduction seminar. I heard his name brought up after the topic came up of the 1998 robbery of DEA agents and Drug trafficer Argeno Castillo in South Miami</p>

if you can merrit and allow other entires of silly and childish value then why is it a notorious criminal and his biography are booted. Also he just so happend to be a local football phenom during his highschool years, after his arrest his conviction was mention on ESPN2, he was in the herald...</p>

<li>Yes, they may be obscure, but that still does not warrant the deletion of it. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia of information, and this band does indeed exist. So my vote is to keep it up. By the way, I greatly wikified the article so it should at least please the casual viewer if nothing else.<a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurk_Ranma_e651.html" title="User:Turk Ranma">Turk Ranma</a> 20:58, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>In regards to the <i>copyvio</i>, I personally know one of the members of the band and he gave me permission to use the pictures. Of course, this can't be directly proven. The best thing to do is send a comment to <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeamguarden_086d.html" title="User:Beamguarden">User:Beamguarden</a> who started the article for proof.</li>
<li>If I may ask, what is the reasoning behind deleting an article just because it is obscure? So far no one has seemed to justify <i>why</i> exactly they have a problem with this fact. Sure, I could understand if it was a complete vanity article; simply showcasing some random person or thing. But this group does indeed fit a the ambient/instrumental genre of music and has released multiple records and songs fitting said genre. Lastly, (and believe me I'm not trying to gloat) the article does indeed fit the wiki requirements in regards to format and appearence. So at least, as I stated above, the casual passerby who does not intend to delete the article, will get more than their share of info on the band.<a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurk_Ranma_e651.html" title="User:Turk Ranma">Turk Ranma</a> 21:48, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom; despite the release of 3 CDs, they were on an indie label. The Influences section is now a black and blue wall of words that exhausts the reader by the time the fifth line is read.

<li><strike><b>Comment</b></strike> It's possible to search for this article by typing in with the correct input methods, and it doesn't require a special keyboard or hardware to input Japanese text. However, thinking about it, I don't know if this article can be useful or not. Having one extra article with not many words doesn't seem to make any difference. Also, I made a list of redirects of Japanese articles, such as <a href="../../../%E6%8A%98/%E3%82%8A/%E7%B4%99/%E6%8A%98%E3%82%8A%E7%B4%99.html" title="折り紙">折り紙</a>, <a href="../../../%E6%97%A5/%E6%9C%AC/%E6%94%BF/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C.html" title="日本政府">日本政府</a>, etc. They redirect to their English counterparts. But on futher thought, if a person doesn't understand English and types those characters onto "search", maybe they shouldn't be reading the English Wikipedia at all? --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamamoto_Ichiro_b986.html" title="User:Yamamoto Ichiro">Ichiro</a> 03:26, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Weak Delete</b> On the second thought, these articles may not even show up on most computer which doesn't have Asian font installed, so it will be useless for most people.

<dd><b>Redirect</b> - nothing wrong with redirecting this to a disambiguation page in English. Better yet, <i>move</i> the article to an appropriate disambiguation page title. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 03:41, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, regarding redirection in English, this title is written the same way in three languages, but are pronounced differently. It's mainly because the fact that we Japanese people, borrowed (and never gave it back btw ^^) Chinese characters and we are still using them today. We developed different pronounciations, but we write the word 漫画 in the same way it is written in both languages. So which one of the reason why I created this article, but right now maybe this article is pointless. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamamoto_Ichiro_b986.html" title="User:Yamamoto Ichiro">Ichiro</a> 03:46, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Another comment, the text 漫画 in both Japanese and Chinese, refers to the same thing, comic books. Japanese even uses the word manga to describe American Comic Books. However, in the context of English, the word manga (漫画), strictly refers to Japanese comic books and not comic books in general. So there is a difference.--<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamamoto_Ichiro_b986.html" title="User:Yamamoto Ichiro">Ichiro</a> 03:51, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, yes, I forgot about this subtelty. Well, as they say, 'redirects are cheap'&#160;:-) Would it be better to redirect to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a> instead then? --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 04:42, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I am happy for this as a disambiguation page. It is quite reasonable to suggest that a Japanese user might not know the English word for something and might type in the Japanese word (above) and then want the English words that it means (it is one word in Japanese, 3 words in English). They might be confused which word it means, so this is reasonable. They are looking for English words, but don't know the English words to look for. I can see the use for this. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 13:38, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into school district or town if article is both below three sentances and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture when AFD is closed. This school, like all others, is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on it's own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use.

<li><b>Keep article about NES game</b>. I believe this article began as a hoax - I haven't been able to find any info on a title with that home-invasion plot. The second editor categorized the game as an <a href="../../../n/e/s/NES_8d93.html" title="NES">NES</a> game and dated it 1991, clearly identifying it with the same game the article linked by the nominator is about.

<dd>Sorry to have gone about this in the wrong way, but, stupidily, I accidentally posted the article before I'd mentioned the most important aspect of Alfred Pitchcock - that is, his design for a more efficient type of stirrup. It has often been argued that the old design resulted in undune pressure on the instep area of the foot, and, over time, can lead to various medical problems, including excessive pronation of the feet.</dd>

<li>Well, yes I know neither of those mention Pitchcock, they're about the areas of the foot that the old stirrup design damaged, and that Pitchcock's design protected. As far as I know, Suffolk Church records aren't online at the moment, and so I can't provide a link to them. As for his similarity to Alfred Hitchcock - that's partly why I've mentioned him. One of the reasons there has been interest in Pitchcock is because his name is similar to Hitchcock. In all honesty, an alternative stirrup design is quite boring, and I would have ignored him, has it not been for the comical similarity of his name to Hitchcock, and it is in this way that most people will come across him. I'm sorry I can't provide more references, but he is quite an obscure figure, and there aren't many sites that contain obscure local history on the internet - Archibald Wednesday, 1:41, 20th December 2005

<ul>
<li>In reply to MisterHand: I'm sorry, but I do not agree with your last statement at all. I don't want to get too heated about this, but, I feel that I should defend myself by quoting Wikipedia's first of the five unchangeable pillars which states that "Wikipedia is an encyclopedia incorporating elements of general encyclopedias, specialized encyclopedias, and almanacs." I think the word "specialized" is important there, since it does suggest that Wikipedia goes beyond including every day knowledge that can be Googled and found anyway. Notability, on the other hand, is a controversial topic anyway - and indeed, the article you cite contains numerous references on why Pitchcock should be included as well as why he should not. As it states, if he is not important, no one will search for him, and, as such, will not constitude a significant server load. Indeed, having read that, I feel even more so that this is a valid entry for Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I'll admit that Pitchcock is an obscure figure, however, I don't see that as a reason for not including him, nor the fact that there is very little about him on Google - if anything that should be a reason FOR including him. Now, I also know that he is perhaps not the most important figure in the history of the world, but I still think he should be included:</p>
<p>1.) He is an historical figure in the town of Bungay, and is known in the surrounding areas. Indeed, he is viewed upon in rather a sympathetic life, as a voice of common sense that was ignored (despite being right about his alternative design), and this is something that many people in the surrounding areas feel they can sympathise with.</p>
<p>2.) His alternative stirrup design, although unsuccessful does present an interesting thought - after all, his design was superior, but, due to poor "marketing" if you want in the middle ages, it never took off. It's quite an interesting parallel to modern life and shows that "marketing" has always been important.</p>
<p>3.) The similarity of his name to Alfred Hitchcock presents him as a slightly humorous figure, and does provide a wider interest for people - I don't doubt Wikipedia is browsed by people looking for articles that attract their attention and curiosity, and I believe he does that.</p>
<p>4.) I also think his re-design of the stirrup is interesting in light of contemporary events, mainly the Peasants Civil War. It does reflect the contemporary attitude that things should not stay the same - admittedly, on a much smaller scale that the civil war, which believed the fundamental basis of society should change, but it does suggest that attitudes existed at many levels of the peasants psyche. - <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchibald_Wednesday_27fc.html" title="User:Archibald Wednesday">Archibald Wednesday</a> 09:05, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Proven to be highly relevant. See Google "Results 1 - 20 of about 145,000 English pages for ocean's origin (0.30 seconds)". The topic is also <i>distinct</i> from "Ocean(s)", in that it can be expanded with sub topics, such as "non-scientific theories" which would be inappropriate for a standard "Ocean" page. "Past Non-scientific theories" as to the origin of the ocean might reference examples of Greek Mythology, and "current non-scientific theories" might reference modern day religious belief(s). We should not force topics into mergers based on a common word, or into constrictive brevity as a result. Topics should be given room to grow where there might be interest. Good candidates for this might be topics that are 1) highly relevant and 2) distinct, by virtue of the types of sub categories that could possibly follow. This topic is both and has been prematurely put at risk for deletion. Moreover the user might not continue to contribute if they feel the environment is overly critical and has wasted his/her time. The user was correct in understanding the value of the topic as separate from "Ocean(s)". I have added a few additions to the topic to improve it. A reference and internal link should be placed on "Ocean(s)" to Ocean Origins --TikiWiki 05:00, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, but rename</b> - looks stubby, but at least it's a start (I agree with BL Lacertae's original comment though. What was there when she put the notice on looked rubbishy).

<li><b>Comment</b>It's relevance is a verified fact. Significance can be an opinion as it seems to be in your comment.

And the capitialization problem can be solved simply by moving the page. <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERoman_Soldier_f59e.html" title="User:Roman Soldier">Roman Soldier</a> 02:32, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
