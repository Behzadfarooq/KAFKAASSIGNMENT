<li><b>Delete.</b> I am not literary expert (that's why it's not important that I never heard about this man) but I seriously doubt he could be "the founder of literary cubism" because it existed several decades <a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5951" class="external text" title="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5951" rel="nofollow">before his birth</a>. Any ideas as to what else he supposedly "founded"? The article dubiously claims "founder of several literary movements", without being specific. Also, the sentence "His writings... are target of vandalism" doesn't make much sense to me. Should it be "target of parody" instead? --<a href="../../../f/u/x/User%7EFuxoft_6a92.html" title="User:Fuxoft">Fuxoft</a> 17:34, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>For all non-Czech users. Mr. Hedvicek is a well-known internet spammer, vandal, wannabe and Czech far-right exile living in the USA. See article on him on CS Wiki <a href="http://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Hedvicek" class="external autonumber" title="http://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Hedvicek" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. He is known for disparagement of the Czech Republic, his politicians, people etc. He hates country that gave him life and does everything here to damage its image. He thinks we all living here are communist indoctrinated filth and all exiles (even fraudsters) are heroes. - <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarwinek_e9a2.html" title="User:Darwinek">Darwinek</a> 20:22, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By writing this, you are kinda lowering yourself to his level of filth. It doesn't matter if it's true. It's enough for anyone to have a logical look at the article and on the defense Ross uses for its existence, to see who is right and who is not. Even as a psychopath, Communist or Nazi, Ross could've written a worthy Wikipedia article.

<li><b>Weak delete.</b> Two sources have been provided (I won't restart the discussion of whether two sources counts as "multiple") but they need to be checked for validity first. I am very concerned by the small number of Google hits for something that you'd expect would be overrepresented online. Also, not all sources are equal -- without seeing the sources, I would be willing to guess that these are tiny blurbs in a "News of the Weird" section or something like that. I agree with this quote, from the deletion review: "Is there no end to the overweening vanity of these "seduction community" people? The whole business is vanity built on vanity built on vanity." --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 00:34, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Instead of guessing, why not look up the sources and actually find out? (See list of sources below.) Is it so much to ask that people review the sources before voting in an AfD instead of just following their preconceptions? With Google hits, I am getting <b>22,600</b>; maybe that's small to you, but it isn't to me. As for the subject of vanity, I've already acknowledged in the earlier AFD above that "Part of the problem is that people affiliated with the company have often engaged in vanity-type whitewashing of the article." Yet disruption from those people doesn't mean that a balanced article cannot be written on the subject. --<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondSight_02d5.html" title="User:SecondSight">SecondSight</a> 02:22, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment.</b> I have looked up the sources. The two sources provided are copied (probably illegally, but that's not the point) to the RSD website and seem only to be available there. I agree that they don't appear to be "News of the Weird" items, but since the context is gone I can't be sure. Incidentally, simply searching "real social dynamics" may return extraneous sources; I searched it with names of the founders and found very few hits. And the comment on "vanity" was not meant to be a valid argument for deletion anyway, though the possibility of a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> has not been ruled out. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 02:45, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

I’m with Daniel, one of Mason’s assistants, and he explains how their techniques differ, as if they’re from a rival kung fu school. “We don’t try to entertain the girl as much.

<dd>The Times article doesn't mention RSD by name (it mentions Tyler Durden running a seminar, which can only be RSD), so let's throw it out for sake of argument. I agree with with an above comment that not all sources are equal, so let's say that <i>The Game</i> and the San Francisco Magazine article together are worth about one source (<i>The Game</i> is good for notability but not for verifiable information on the subject; the San Francicso Magazine coverage is non-trivial but admittedly small). Still, there are two other sources for the page: The Men's Health article, and the Edge Magazine article. The burden is on voters for deletion to explain how these sources are inadequate. None of the voters so far have done so. <a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">User:N Shar</a> above "guesses" that they are "tiny blurbs in a 'News of the Weird' section," but admits not having read them. Yet if you read them you will see that they are both men's magazine articles (<i>not</i> "news of the weird") which both have RSD as the main subject.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> How could I have reviewed the sources? They weren't linked to. As for their reliability/applicability, the two cited on RSD's site seem good, though the context is now unavailable. The other sources have been critiqued by other users, and in general do not satisfy the criteria because they do not feature RSD as their subject. As I've said above, not all sources are equal. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 02:45, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment.</b>I've added an "Ideology" section. It took me a few hours to write it up, and it keeps getting deleted. After reading this whole thread of debate on the spammish tone of the article, I took it upon myself to offer some tangible content. When I first wrote it the entire article had been deleted, so I offered this content as the start of a new article. If you wish to revert the article back to it's previous state that's fine, but please leave up the "Ideology" section which I have spent my time to contribute. Thanks very much.</p>

There are two more sources I mentioned about that have the company as their subject, the Men's Health article and the Edge Magazine article.

<dd>Please stop with the accusations. Stating that I'm merely ignoring them does <i>absolutely, positively nothing</i> to prove your point to me, and is, quite frankly, offensive. For the links to MH and Sunday Telegraph, you might want to provide links to the websites that the articles actually originated from - hanging these on the website in question raises eyebrows, and tends to speak strongly of conflict of interest. Finally, I should point out that the book you site - The Game, &amp;c - is itself lacking in resources to tout its notability. My vote, currently, stands, with my commentary above. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 03:43, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Earlier in the discussion, I made repeated requests that people voting for deletion address all the sources involved, not just one or two of the weak ones. Your above comment failed to address the relevant sources (though I guess I shouldn't speculate about whether you were ignoring them, or simply missing them, or... actually, I can't think of any other reasons why you didn't address them). I can see why you object to my tone, but it comes out of frustration due to my perception that many voters for deletion either aren't reading this discussion, or aren't participating honestly by addressing the proposed sources. As for links, the Men's Health and Sunday Telegraph articles are not available on their websites (at least for non-subscribers). It's unfortunate the RSD's website is the only place those articles can be found, but nowhere does wikipedia require that sources be linked to on the websites they originated from. The <a href="http://www.mensmagazineonline.com/mastering_the_game.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.mensmagazineonline.com/mastering_the_game.asp" rel="nofollow">Edge Magazine</a> article is available online, and its text appears to agree with the text on RSD's website. --<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondSight_02d5.html" title="User:SecondSight">SecondSight</a> 05:05, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>Stop removing the "Ideology" section. It's all common knowledge from the RSD community. If you like, I will email the RSD staff personally and ask if they ratify the ideology section as being, in fact, a synopsis of RSD ideology. If you want to delete it again, let me know what would be a satisfactory "sourcing" so that you would stop coming on here day in and day out and removing the section. The Mystery Method page has Mystery Method ideology on it and it has not been deleted. Shall we delete all ideology out of every seduction community based page? Why the double standard?

<dd>I always try to assume good faith.

However, it is also noted on there that reliable sources are needed to support articles - of which I and most (arguably) editors believe this is one of the main issues surrounding this AfD debate.

<li><b>Comment</b> Whether the existing content of the article is deleted or not is not my concern. I agree that it is somewhat spammish, which is why I took it upon myself to add some TANGIBLE CONTENT to this article. Why should a ceaseless debate about this article (some of which has been by people who shown emotional and possible commercial involvement) hold up the IMPROVEMENT of the article? Leave the "Ideology" section up. Unless you can offer me a valid reason for why it should be removed I will keep adding it. In the meantime I will email Real Social Dynamics and have them ratify this article so that it can be sourced.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Unfortunately, the page has been in the middle of an edit war during this AFD. A user has been adding a massive section that is not written from a neutral point of view. Even without that section, I agree that the article reads as an advertisement. As I mentioned before, we have had problems with people affiliated with the company white-washing the page. Still, POV alone doesn't mean the article should be deleted, just that it should be rewritten. --<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondSight_02d5.html" title="User:SecondSight">SecondSight</a> 08:06, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps merging to the article about "<i>Owen "Tyler Durden" Cook</i>"? Though really that isn't so much merging as renaming. I'd disagree greatly with your claim that they have not made "any great contribution to the art thereof". Plus having made "great contributions" is not part of what is required by wikipedia under <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>. For the very good reason that what is a "great contribution" can be highly subjective. Instead <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> basically requires coverage by others (newspapers, books, tv, etc...).

<b>Comment</b> I'll be continuing to re-add the "Ideology" section until someone can tell me why it doesn't add value to the article for the end reader. In the meantime, let's end the ceaseless debate and start improving the page. Come on guys, add some content. Don't be deleting the content that others like myself have spent time to provide. If you don't like it, edit it, improve it, add totally new content, but don't just go deleting it. That only hurts the end reader. Thanks.</p>

<p>Which recital/concert programs would you like? Would his 18 appearances with SLSO, 4 appearances with the LAPO, would his 11 appearances with the NYPO do? Or perhaps we should consider his recordings of the complete keyboard works of J.S. Bach and Couperin. Or would a list of his students since 1956 (including 2 Pulitzer Prize winning composers). Or would a list of journals in which his writings are published help? Again, it would be helpful if just one reviewer knew anything about the music world. I'm sorry, a degree in engineering does not qualify one to evaluate the notability of a musician. At the rate we are going, I'm surprised any musician has ever made it onto Wikipedia. And I'm rather perplexed by "I could not find any through the usual avenues." What are the usual avenues? Obviously, they are not music journal databases. Perhaps had Dr. Thaden pursued engineering instead of music he would qualify for Wikipedia. Fortunately for the music world, he did not do so. Perhaps we should re-evaluate Nadia Boulanger's article. She was only a music teacher.</p>

<p>Miss Jelly Roll, as I said, let's delete Madame Boulanger and every other teacher of music.... the sources have been provided, JOST will provide you with every citation to every article of Dr. Thaden. So what if he changed music in America. And certainly having recorded the complete works of JS Bach and Louis Couperin is not important... so let's delete Rubinstein and Horowitz. In fact, let's delete every musician and artist starting with JS Bach. In the mean time, let us inform the mainstream media that only nerds and engineers need apply to Wikipedia. God forbid should we permit an article of a teacher who has changed music in the world. Again, it would be nice if someone who know what the hell they are talking about would evaluate entries in Wikipedia. As of yet, no one with any qualifications has reviewed the Dr. Thaden article. What a sad day it is to find the Wikipedia is controlled by those who have no qualifications to determine what articles are or are not posted to it.</p>

I have a hard time believing he is more notable than the average long-time professor of music. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 02:40, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
God forbid if we might look to RCA Victor or CBS or Bell Telephone Hour or Groves Dictionary of Music and Musicians.... I think the appropriate approach for me is to advocating the deletion of all musicians because they are of obviously no importance.... a Google, Amazon, Alibris search is only as good as the searcher.... it's interesting that I find 11 references on Amazon.... again, it might be helpful if we had real musical authorities reviewing articles rather than self-appointed computer nerds... thus far, no one with any creditials has reviewed Dr. Thaden's article.... In the mean time, I believe this discussion would be of great interest to the NYT or to John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune who have both reviewed the performances of Dr. Thaden. Still waiting for someone who knows the difference between and accented grace note and an unaccented grace note in Bach's WTC to respond. At this point, I have to say my first experience with Wikipedia confirms everything negative published about it including its anti-arts bias.</p>

I have been nothing but friendly and civil with this user from the beginning. When he or she contested my first speedy by deleting the tag I nominated it for AFD and left a very friendly note on the user's talk page. I recommended then that Rpgbach take a look at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and did so again at the top of this discussion. It is obvious that this user has not read this or any policy as he continues to call into question the credentials of those who oppose him and refuses to offer any sources not to mention threatening to expose the monster that is an AFD debate to the NYT (I would like to see a story on this debate in the NYT though). Not understanding policy is very common problem for new users and I try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but Rpgbach hostility is not acceptable, if this user where to relax a little they would find Wikipedia to be a friendly and very reasonable place. There may well be a place for this article on Wikipedia, but there is no place for threats and hostility. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<li><b>Comment</b> I should also mention that there is no such thing as "Western Kentucky State University" - WK State College became WK University, and searching their web site gives no hits for Thaden. And neither does the web site of the University of Missouri at Columbia (which is what I assume is meant in the article). I assume that Prof. Thaden did teach at these schools, but it appears he is not memorialized there by scholarships, chairs, etc. - the sort of thing a distinguished professor generally leaves behind. And since you are so enthusiastically calling us art ignoramuses, I suppose the assumption of good faith here is suspended somewhat and I can point out that the most obvious notability that Prof. Thaden has is as the teacher of <b>R</b>andall <b>P</b>oshek-<b>G</b>lad<b>bach</b>, who is "widely known in the world of New Music", according to Rpgbach. I understand that you may have a great deal of respect for your former teacher, Mr. Poshek-Gladbach, but we can't accept your word that he is worthy of an article, or your word on your own notability. Please give us references, ones that we can check. Mr. Thaden may have been a very well-known performer at one time, but it appears his fame has faded. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 04:13, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>But Delta has five letters in the name, so it must be "Five." It also has two vowels, so it might mean "Two."

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, as another nominator said themselves <i>"a launch is a big deal"</i>. Add onto that this is one of the biggest launches of last year, you get an article that has had massive news coverage and is highly notabile. There is a already a section on the PlayStation 3 page, with a link to <a href="../../../p/l/a/PlayStation_3_launch_ee26.html" title="PlayStation 3 launch">PlayStation 3 launch</a> as <i>the main article</i>. Naturally the three newest would have articles about it, while older ones were launched in the early days of wikipedia (or even, long long before wikipedia existed). Thus this is just one reason why claiming "older consoles don't have and article for launch and thus this one shouldn't either" is not an argument at all. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 08:44, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Two issues I think we both agree on: the PS3 page doesn't need to become longer; if the two are going to be identical, then one or the other needs to change. Since the PS3 launch isn't even complete yet (lots of stuff happening in March), there is a chance the article could be improved and lengthened.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Grouping them all into one article doesn't make them any more worthy of being kept than they would be if sent to their respective articles. If they aren't good enough for those articles, they're not good enough for Wikipedia, period.

<dd>I do not think you understand the WP's you cited. The first one says "If you think another article is of equal notability to one being considered for deletion, you are welcome to nominate that article as well". And an example of disrupting wikipedia to make a point would be nominating an obviously notable article for deletion to try to leverage your vote AGAINST deleting another article.

<dd>Thank-you for assuming good faith. My comment was indeed in good faith. Above you say "clearly" as if it was clear. It is not clear to me at all. We often nominate several articles at the same time, sometimes in the same AfD... each article stands on its own merit, but reasoning used by the editors is often a spillover effect. How is this counter to the best interests of the project? For us to achive consistency and to have standards for inclusion that make sense, would be a good thing?

<li><b>Keep</b> (as I "voted" keep in the companion AfD). While I have mostly supported the current push to delete subtrivial presidential lists (both American and Filipino) and have personally carried out some merges toward that end, I think that these particular articles should stay. The articles on individual presidents contain their own facts but not the agregation of facts that this one provides. Much of this info is interesting and/or encyclopedic but doesn't fit well in the basic <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a> article and so splitting it out makes sense. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 09:18, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Looking more closely at a couple of comments above, I see a few Merge then delete "votes". This is not common practice (merged articles are kept as redirects) becuase it destroys the edit history and thus is incompatible with the GDFL which requires that proper credit be given. If sourced facts are incorporated into a plethora of individual articles or lists, it may be the only way forward, but if a significant amount of content is moved to a specific article (like the main president article) the history whould be <b>kept</b> behind a redirect. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 09:22, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My understanding of the GFDL as it applies to Wikipedia is that the wikipedia editors who contribute the article text do not have a license, and do not have protections for being credited for sourcing on subsequent use of the text within wikipedia. The concern you mention would only be applicable if the original article cited external documents as sources, republished previously-sourced external GFDL information, and such source citation did not occur in the article into which the content is merged. As long as the merging admin is privvy to the policies relating to merging content within wikipedai articles, I believe this concern will be addressed. But as I said, and as you pointed out: if User: SallyJaneDoe contributed significantly to this article, and we merge the content into another article, Sally has no evidence that she ever worked on it, and the merging admin would get all the "credit". But getting "credit" is not what wikipedia is all about, so its really a mute point. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 20:47, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

Thus Wikipedia is required to give me credit (in a history section) for any page in which my contributions occur. That this is a technical and pedantic requirement subject to <i>de minimis</i> exceptions is not in dispute, but it is still a requirement and should not be violated unnecessarily. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 08:47, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are similarities, as the last comment has said, but I think the terms are different enough that a simple redirect might be misleading. If the White Hat entry were expanded to include mention of an anti-hacker, that might be acceptable; but even then we are still dealing with a neologism. I still think deletion is the most reasonable option. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">◄</font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel">Zahakiel</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">►</font></a> 18:17, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I can appreciate your observation, however, all of the FEMA task forces are sponsored by localities or universities (Texas) and South Carolina's task force is one of the first to be declared necessary by <b>state</b> law (SC Law, Chapter 49, Section 23-49-10). Also, as one of the founding members of the State Urban Search and Rescue Alliance, which is a grass-roots organization with over 40 member states and Puerto Rico, this increases notability (especially as the inception of this organization happened as a meeting between South Carolina and New Jersey Task Force leaders). I also added references to non-TF sites to prove notability since this was all first posted. I am quickly learning. But thanks for the input.--<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruck6alpha_7e41.html" title="User:Truck6alpha">Mick</a> 23:09, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I'll have more, just give me a few minutes.I'm not trying to be smart, but I used the template established by the 28 FEMA teams listed on here. Since they don't seem to be in any danger of having their articles yanked, I thought I met the notability question first posed and apparently there's not sufficient evidence. I'll move all of the references over to the article, but since there should be enough here (which exceeds many of the FEMA team articles) I won't be moving the references tonight.

<li><b>Delete</b> until such time as the non-FEMA SAR teams have greater notability. FEMA only underwrites a limited number of these as part of the national callup system, other municipalities that want one have to self-fund or operate on a contract basis (layman's interpretation &amp; terminology here), limiting non-local deployments and thus notability. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:47, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can appreciate that observation as well; because of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, any asset that meets the requirements of the requesting state can deploy to that emergency and therefore, this state team (which was formed by legal mandate) can cross state lines to answer that request. The FEMA system underwrites those 28 FEMA teams, but there are over 40 states that are now members of the State Urban Search and Rescue Alliance, some of which have teams that meet the proposed NIMS typing requirements for task forces, and some who don't. If anything, this team does not respond to "local" incidents, because of the tiered response system; first the incident is handled by the local jurisdiction, then regional teams are summoned, then state, then federal. There are cases when the incident escalates quickly (a la Katrina) when federalization early on might have been more beneficial, but regardless, emergencies are supposed to follow that chain of events. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruck6alpha_7e41.html" title="User:Truck6alpha">Mick</a> 23:09, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why would anyone want to delete a state USAR team? State sponsorship isn't enough? You have to be a federal team to be notable enough for the wikipedia? That's shocking to me. SCFT1 was deployed after Katrina and did a hell of a good job. I need to read the deletion policy and see what the problem is, but I think you should reconsider. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoodyGroove_ec92.html" title="User:MoodyGroove">MoodyGroove</a> 22:19, 5 February 2007 (UTC)MoodyGroove</li>
<li>Here's what it says in <a href="../../../g/t/d/WP%7EGTD_93cd.html" title="WP:GTD">WP:GTD</a>: Non-commercial organizations: 1. Organizations are usually notable if the scope of activities are national or international in scale and information can be verified by a third party source. <i>SCTF-1 has been deployed on a national emergency (one of the worst in US history) and this is easily verifiable.</i> 2. Individual chapters of national and international organizations are usually not notable enough to warrant a separate article unless sufficient notability is established through reliable and verifiable sources. However, chapter information is welcome for inclusion into wikipedia in list articles as long as only verifiable information is included. <i>SCTF-1 is a state USAR team, and not a chapter of a different organization.</i> 3. Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable third party sources can be found. <i>By definition, state is not local.</i> It seems to me that your decision to delete SCTF1 is arbitrary and against the clear text meaning found in <a href="../../../g/t/d/WP%7EGTD_93cd.html" title="WP:GTD">WP:GTD</a>. I don't see the rationale, except perhaps a poor understanding of what FEMA is and what national v. state responsibilities are. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoodyGroove_ec92.html" title="User:MoodyGroove">MoodyGroove</a> 22:31, 5 February 2007 (UTC)MoodyGroove</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> I have two co-workers that were talking about this game today. I wanted to know more about it, so I came to Wikipedia and did a search. I was astonished that it's nominated for deletion. There's a lot of buzz surrounding this game and it's growing by leaps and bounds. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenaciousT_5d53.html" title="User:TenaciousT">TenaciousT</a> 19:55, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>sources for what? the game obviously exists/existed, so if you mean that the content of the article isn't sufficiently sourced, that's not a ground for deletion. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_A_865a.html" title="User:Bob A">Bob A</a> 22:36, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, yes it is. See <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification policy</a>. This isn't a question of whether the game exists or not- this is a question of whether there are reliable secondary sources about it. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 04:55, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>firstly, no it's not. i see nothing in WP:V suggesting that nonverifiability per se is grounds for deletion; if that were true, i could simply remove the unsourced material and we'd be done with it. secondly, what exactly are you saying isn't sufficiently sourced? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_A_865a.html" title="User:Bob A">Bob A</a> 05:28, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry, I meant <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">this link</a>, which states a lack of reliable sources and verification <i>is</i> grounds for deletion. If multiple reliable secondary sources about a topic do not exist, then the article will be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> or inherently <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">non-neutral</a>, or both (both of which are grounds for deletion). --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 05:47, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>wp:dp seems to say quite the opposite. it also says that it constitutes abuse of the deletion process to use it to protest specific content of an article which meets the criteria for existence on wikipedia. the relevant example given is that its central information be verifiable, which this one's certainly is. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_A_865a.html" title="User:Bob A">Bob A</a> 08:02, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Enough indents. I did look for sources - I did a Google search and did not find multiple <b>independent</b> reliable sources.

<li>The OMGN review is already in my nomination. Press releases are really borderline since they're basically a reprint of what a reviewer has been told to say from the company itself.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Technicalities. The game does exist. It's even free to play, so it's not hard for many to find out themselves how real the game is. But, if it helps any... There used to be a review of this game back in '03 on a site called player2player.net. The site is still technically around but hardly maintained. Archives aren't available past july '04. I don't know if it can be called a legitimate source today, but it used to be an active site with news and reviews like any other gaming site back in '02-'03. If the admin can be contacted, maybe she'll put up the older archives. 71.113.30.183 04:37, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Did anybody actually read the talk page before voting? Many people have voted to delete because there are no sources to support notability but the talk page clearly states that expert sources are available and were offered. The <i>Huntington Town Historian</i> and the <i>Long Island History Museum</i> have both stated notability so this shouldn't be an issue?.

<dd><b>Comment</b>, I advise you to read it again. I did say that the LI history museum only chose to add it to the archives, but I clearly stated that the Huntington Town Historian (the most reliable expert on this subject you can possibly think of) has indeed confirmed the map's historical notability, in writing. <a href="../../../f/i/f/User%7EFife_Club_901c.html" title="User:Fife Club">Fife Club</a> 14:41, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, as Nardman stated, the verifiable description of a map does not constitute original research.

<li><b>Delete</b> or 'transwiki' somewhere. To be 'notable' the map would need to have been written about in multiple publications. All we see is the map and someone's original research of examining it and writing about it. Having a bunch of real places on a map does nothing to make the map itself notable. Also, did the city grant permission to reproduce it? Otherwise it is a copyright violation, since a high resolution copy is not any kind of fair use exception. As for the previous comment about movie article having to be deleted as original research, feel free to nominate a bunch of them and see how it goes. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 22:52, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

I personally got written permission from the copyright holder, that fact was clearly stated on the files copyright section, and you decided to remove it without any discussion, which is your M.O.

This is a <b>very good idea</b> because it drastically reduces the size of the main articles. <b>AND</b> at the same time avoids duplication between the articles of having each popular culture reference being on <b>two</b> articles it is instead only on <b>one</b> article.

<li>Yes, I did look at the main articles before nominating this and I agree that <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">removing large trivia sections</a> from the main book and film articles is a very good idea. However, removing a trivia section from one article so that it may be relocated into another article is not a good idea. Passing references to every book or film or TV show that mention another book or film or TV show are not in themselves so notable as to require separate articles. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 13:41, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as a list concerning notable work<i>s</i>, especially relevant in this case as Fight Club is <i>about</i> popular culture. Any original research/fan interpretation problems can be cleaned up. Per <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a>, if it is deleted then cultural references will be unknowingly added to the main articles, which is counterproductive. The scope isn't so big that the list will become an unmaintainable mess. The nom's example "...especially in the form of a parody of the Rules of Fight Club" does sound like original research - can you back that claim up without the list? Would you argue that any "in popular culture" or "cultural references" article is an indiscriminate collection of information as well? If someone could please guide me to a policy that discriminates between passing references and notable references, then I will work on improving the article in that sense. <a href="../../../p/o/m/User%7EPomte_3bc0.html" title="User:Pomte">Pomte</a> 14:01, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not the sole basis for a decision, certainly, but when one makes the argument that a film's ten year history of cultural influence is justification for an article then it's reasonable to point out other examples of far more influential films who handle the issue differently. Moreover, I would argue that the article in question is not a documentation of the "cultural influence" of Fight Club. It's mostly a collection of one-liners from a variety of sources bunged together with things that likely have nothing to do with Fight Club at all (the aforementioned similar clothes item). <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:23, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>It's hard to argue for the deletion of <i>any</i> political party, but the Aruban Democratic Alliance (ALIANSA) really is not notable. The article itself says they won nothing in the election five years ago. An internet search turns up about 100 nonwiki ghits, which is too low even for a country where English is not the primary language. Maybe someone can check if there are notability criteria for political parties. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 05:06, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Follow up question</b> - One of the reasons I nominated these articles is I wanted to get a consensus of what constitutes a notable street.

<ul>
<li>My comment has nothing to do with whether the street is notable; the current status of the articles are not useful. As for your question, at the very least the streets that are wider than the norm, and probably the ones with crosstown bus routes, should be notable. --<a href="../../../n/e/2/User_talk%7ENE2_13fa.html" title="User talk:NE2">NE2</a> 19:54, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>W. 4th is definitely notable. The criteria should be historical, cultural as well as utilitarian. Not all Manhattan streets are notable, but quite a few are. There is probably a place for a List of Manhattan streets or <i>...minor Manhattan streets</i> if need be. <b>Delete</b> 1st/2nd/3rd, <b>Keep</b> 13th per NE2. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:43, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> See <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. If it were notable, there would be lots of published articles where it was specifically the subject. Notability is not about "All streets are notable" or "I firmly believe it is notable." Madison Avenue and Broadway in New York City are notable, because they have ben the subject of numerous articles in reliable sources. Other streets are too, They have been written about.

<li><b>Delete</b> Width and bus routes are hardly the criteria in Manhattan (or London or San Francisco, etc), though they may be in lesser places. I'm not aware of anything particularly notable about (or on) this one, and the article doesn't tell me of any. Place on the grid is NN, especially when the infor repeats for many streets without anything more to say.

<p>Tagged for speedy deletion as 'in bad taste', which is a bad speedy reason.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Besides being in bad taste, the article is unsourced. It's probably not a neologism (it's probably an old term), but it is not a notable phenomenon. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 06:38, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm all for deleting this article, but "the author didn't write anything else and never made a user page" is hardly a reason to delete something, and thinking that way is <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">a bad habit to get into</a>. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 07:07, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nothing wrong with new guys. But when it comes to trying to guess whether we should take a controversial page seriously or not, the fact that the user had only two edits and he hasn't been back in 11 months -- that seems like reasonable evidence to support that this page is not legit. It's not the <i>only</i> evidence, nor is it <i>sufficient</i> to justify deletion. But it should be considered. - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 07:17, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Note that the search by Mathmo leads to a novel and/or game called "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," hardly a reliable source for a claimed historical character. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 22:13, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> RTK is not "a novel"; check the WP article-- it is one of the great masterpieces of world literature and widely acknowledged as such. As for the history/fiction aspect, it's an historical novel, and its characters are the same as the historical ones, and the descriptions of their role apply to both the novel and the history. The game references appear because <i>multiple</i> games, video series, manga, etc. have been based on the story. It's quite a long WP article, with a long subsidiary article on the characters. Chen Ji is in the list. Most of the characters have separate articles, though it some cases they lead to other people with the same name.</li>

<dd>I wish people would not conclude that things arent real or important without at least searching Wikipedia.

<dd>To be honest, I can't seem to find a mention of uberfic in either one of the thesises you've supplied. Searching for "uberfic" or "Überfic" in the pdf of the Master's thesis comes up with nothing (mind pointing to specific page it's on?) and while I admire the reason the doctorate thesis is laid out the way it is, I can't seem to find a mention of the term in it. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> <font size="1">(<a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeoChaosX_4f26.html" title="User talk:NeoChaosX">talk</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NeoChaosX_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX">walk</a>)</font> 18:20, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Simply because an article managed to "survive" a previous vote does not give it immunity from deletion forever; such arguments are ridiculous.

A local newspaper and a magazine are not really nontrivial reliable sources. Try NYT or Time magazine or something with substance.

<li>Please refrain from bogus incivility warnings. Expressing dislike of bogus neologisms and wanting them removed from Wikipedia does not constitute incivility. Per the essay on incivility, "The word "incivility" is derived from the Latin incivilis, meaning "not of a citizen". I see it as a duty of a citizen of Wikipedia to express disdain for articles about non-notable neologisms.

<dd>I agree with the deletion proposal. I moved the page to Chinese Muslims studying overseas, as failing to capitalize the word 'Muslim' is disrespectful to the followers of Islam.

<p>From <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a>: "A <b>POV fork</b> is a content fork deliberately created to avoid <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> guidelines.... POV forks usually arise when two or more contributors disagree about the content of an article or other page, and instead of resolving that disagreement, someone creates another version of the article (or another article on the same subject) to be developed according to their personal views rather than according to consensus. This second article is known as a "POV fork" of the first. This is generally considered unacceptable. The generally accepted policy is that all facts and major Points of View on a certain subject should be treated in one article. As Wikipedia does <i>not</i> view article forking as an acceptable solution to disagreements between contributors, such forks may be nominated for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">deletion</a>."</p>
<p>And, in fact, this article was created at the same time as Marriage (post modern), about 15 hours ago, out of a content dispute at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">Marriage</a>, and the content needs no separate coverage besides that main article. The article author has said: "To re-iterate, the article <i>is</i> NPOV within it's own context.... I will edit the article to protect it's credibility, and will remove any edits that are attempts to push a POV and violate the NPOV of the subject matter."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWJBscribe&amp;diff=105477056&amp;oldid=105473788" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWJBscribe&amp;diff=105477056&amp;oldid=105473788" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> Apparently <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is going to be <i>different</i> inside of this article, and the article author will enforce this. Wikipedia does not allow <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walled_garden_%28media%29.html" title="Walled garden (media)">walled gardens</a>, nor <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">article ownership</a>, nor unnecessary content forking.

<li><b>Comment</b> Unlike the situation in the Marriage (post modern) AfD, "traditional marriage" as a phrase and a concept has a lot of notability, particular in legal writings in conservative jurisdictions and legal authorities. See, for example <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/michiganstatecases/appeals/0207/20070201_c265870_104_265870.opn.pdf" class="external text" title="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/michiganstatecases/appeals/0207/20070201_c265870_104_265870.opn.pdf" rel="nofollow">National Pride at Work v. Governor of Michigan, Mich. App. February 1, 2007</a>] ("We begin by noting the relatively significant public attention this case has received...The people, in an act of self-government, could rationally conclude that the welfare and morals of society benefit from protecting and strengthening traditional marriages, and this act of the people constitutes a legitimate governmental interest.") It is less clear, however that this traditional marriage concept deserves a separate article rather than being included in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">Marriage</a> article along with other perspectives. Furthermore, since the views of traditional Judaism and Christianity are not the only views involved in the concept of marriage, traditional or otherwise, it is unclear that the traditional concept, if presented in a separate article, should focus exclusively on the perspective of these religions particularly given that each religion already has its own article on marriage. Nonetheless, it's reasonable to argue that "traditional marriage" represents a distinct subject rather than a POV fork in "marriage", and Wikipedia could present things if the articles (and other articles with different approaches) were appropriately named and sourced, and if the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">Marriage</a> article linked to each appropriately. While I agree the article shouldn't stand alone, I believe the issue here is more one of pragmatism and avoiding reader confusion than strict policy. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 20:24, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think the problem here is that across the world different cultures have different views on what constitutes <i>traditional marriage</i>. Writing an article to encompass all traditions would be problematic. A series of articles on <i>Traditional marriage in culture X</i> might be possible, but I'm not they will add much to the <i>Religious views of marriage</i> articles. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 20:46, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>(Edit conflict) There's no need for a separate <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_marriage.html" title="Traditional marriage">traditional marriage</a> article unless and until the coverage in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marriage</a> article becomes so large it needs a subarticle, per <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a>. As <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenneth_Fisher_1907.html" title="User:John Kenneth Fisher">John Kenneth Fisher</a> noted in the previous AFD, such an article "<i>would involve same-race only, 10 year old brides, spouses meeting each other only on their wedding days, no divorce, kidnapping, spousal parents paying off the other, etc.</i>"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FTraditional_Marriage&amp;diff=98033856&amp;oldid=97917026" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FTraditional_Marriage&amp;diff=98033856&amp;oldid=97917026" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> We have barely begun to approach such coverage, so a subarticle is far too premature. If such coverage does eventually need separate articles, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_marriage.html" title="Traditional marriage">traditional marriage</a> is still the wrong title, as it's a neologistic POV-loaded term. There's no reason to give a neologistic term like <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_marriage.html" title="Traditional marriage">traditional marriage</a> undue weight by pretending it addresses a clearly defined concept throughout history. A (set of) timeline(s) of marriage practices in different regions would probably be much more encyclopedic, and an appropriate title for one of these might be marriage practices in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

<li>Personally, I see nothing wrong with either list. There are people out there who have an interest in Presidents and Prime Ministers and would like lists of Prime Ministers based on these things. For instance, we have tons of articles on members of the royal family and its lineage, because there is a tremendous interest in the royal family. For instance, the World Almanac has a many sorts of lists of Presidents, including one that lists the spouses and number of children. Surely we can include a similar list on Wikipedia? I mean, Wikipedia is not paper, while the Almanac is! -- <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> - <a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarl_Andrew_5969.html" title="User talk:Earl Andrew">talk</a> 19:26, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I suppose the issue is whether the list is useful or not. Insofar as it compiles a list of the children of a highly notable category of people - the heads of government of Canada - it saves time and effort scrolling through all twenty-two names to retrieve this specific item. There are thirteen lists related to the persons of the Prime Minister of Canada. There is no reason to suppose one is any more (or less) notable than another. Such lists are ubiquitous for heads of government for various countries. My question is whether or not the criteria for retention or deletion is random. Are the children of Canadian PM's any more or less notable than those of the United States? Is the category of children any more or less notable than the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Canadian_Prime_Ministers_by_place_of_birth_be2d.html" title="List of Canadian Prime Ministers by place of birth">birthplace</a> of the PMs? My concern is that deleting this article creates a slippery slope for a mass deletion of lists that many people who are, for instance, compiling bibliographal anthologies, find useful. In the absence of clear criteria, deleting this article is random and gratuitous. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishhead64_f25c.html" title="User:Fishhead64">Fishhead64</a> 04:04, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b>: First point taken. As I said, the consistency of your argument would be that relationships do not establish notability. The article about <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julia_Dent_Grant_ba2f.html" title="Julia Dent Grant">Julia Dent Grant</a>, for instance, does not suggest she did anything notable outside of her relationship to her husband. If one can achieve notability by virtue of one's relationship to a notable person, then WP standards are fulfilled.

<li>Just because you don't like it, Agent 86, doesn't mean it isn't important. Lists like this are hard to find on the internet. There are a lot of things on Wikipedia I don't think are important, but there is no reason for them to be deleted over opinion. I just don't view pages I don't care about. The page just needs more detail with information on the missing PMs. They probably didn't have kids like King. Being a child of a PM or a president of any country can put one in the spotlight which makes this list important.

<li><b>Comment</b> Some of these children become more notable then others, especially those put in the spotlight or have a political future because of their political parent's status. They would most likely be considered 'nobodys' if they were not children of PMs. They play an important part in the life of the PM. Look at the Bush twins, they have done nothing notable, yet because their father is President of the U.S. they have become notable. Take away his Presidency and his daughters wouldn't even have an article in Wikipedia. Same goes for Chelsea Clinton, no Bill and "who's that girl?"

<li><b>Delete</b> The meaning of "indiscriminate information" is not limited to the things on that numbered list. You hit it on the head with "children of." A list of the people themselves would not be indiscriminate information.

<li>I'm referring specifically to wikipedia's policy — <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENOT_aef6.html#Indiscriminate" title="Wikipedia:NOT">Wikipedia:NOT#Indiscriminate</a>. The policy simply does not apply to this debate. I'm not arguing the denotations and connotations of the word "indiscriminate." The policy doesn't say that anything that a reasonable person could consider indiscriminate has no place in wikipedia. The <i>policy</i> is clearly defined and not applicable here. And, correct me if I'm wrong, "Wikipedia is not Six Degrees of Separation" is not a real policy either. As for <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">fancruft</a> while you personally <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">may not be interested</a> in the children of world leaders, the media has in some sense made the decision for us. The children of world leaders are incessantly covered in newspapers, political magazines, television, biographies and the history books. You might not like it, but the children themselves, their role as children of world leaders, and the common bond they share as children of world leaders are <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBIO_f7ad.html" title="Wikipedia:BIO">notable topics</a>, not to mention easily <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>.

<li>You seem to be confused on the interpretation of that policy. It says that "indiscriminate information" <i>includes</i> the things on that list, not that it <i>includes and is limited too</i> the items on the list. The list is merely exemplary, not an exhaustive listing, of what is considered indiscriminate information. It has not been esablished that most of these people are indeed notable; most do not have their own articles. However, even if they were, that doesn't necessarily support collecting them in a list. I <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">never said I don't like the topic</a> and as for my reference to <i>Six Degrees of Separation</i>, you may want to review the article on <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humour.html" title="Humour">humour</a>. You might also want to look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELISTCRUFT_7e76.html" title="WP:LISTCRUFT">WP:LISTCRUFT</a>, which offers a good rule of thumb: Lists should only be created if the subject of the list is itself encyclopedic. Or, to put it another way, <i>Children of the Prime Ministers of Canada</i> is not a valid encyclopedic topic, so a list of all the children of Canadian prime ministers is not a good topic for a list. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 13:35, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Article creation comment</b> - A couple of people have now suggested that the (US) list is appropriate if an existing article is there to support it. I initially preferred a single article, with text and an incorporated list, and I wrote two paragraphs at the top of the current list that could serve as a stub. But now I see perhaps the virtues of a separate article: One article could explain the sociological aspects of being a child of a political leader, placing it into context with inherited nobility, economic class, personal life outcomes, and so on; and there could be short sections that discuss any specific national effects, national political history, or other specific national research that have been done, which would link to the relevant supported lists (children of Canadian PMs, children of US presidents, and so on). (Heck, we could probably cannibalize some of the arguments on this page to flesh out the text.) --lquilter 14:01, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I suggested transferring them to Wikinews. WikiNews would seem to be a good place for them, since newspapers and news web sites carry loads of sports results including season outcomes. I apologize for not knowing that we can't do that. If that can't be done, let's put them in the user's space; maybe he can repost them in WikiNews. (User:Sirasu is the only editor of all of these articles prior to the deletion proposal.) <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 08:00, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> User:Sirasu apparently speaks very little English (en:0 on his user page).

<li><b>Keep</b>. The major issue with these articles (and the others cited in the nomination that I also tried to save) seems to be the format of the information. Several "season of XYZ team" articles exist, and have normally withstood AFD. Admittedly, those articles also include info about a particular team's personnel changes, streaks, etc; however, they include the scores of games too (see <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rangers_F.C._season_2005-06_aa7e.html" title="Rangers F.C. season 2005-06">Rangers F.C. season 2005-06</a> for one example). Sports leagues are notable, for the same reason that sports teams are notable. Articles on a particular season of a profession sports league are commonplace as well. League tables are in those articles, and by extending the decision to include a team's scores on a team's season article, it is not unreasonable to include all scores from a league on the league's season article. However, that is unwieldy, and probably more than the 50KB recommended size. I don't know how big each of these monthly articles is, but, they can probably be merged to a single article for the whole season, and referenced from <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._League_-_2006_3b17.html" title="J. League - 2006">J. League - 2006</a>. It is not logical to delete the information just because it is compiled by week (which is a rational way to look up such info), when if it was separated by each team and split across (18 teams in J. League) differnt pages, it would be "acceptable". <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 13:23, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per my comments at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_La_Liga_2006_2007_results_December_2006_36fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/La Liga 2006/2007 results December 2006">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/La Liga 2006/2007 results December 2006</a>: <i>For plot summaries (see WP:NOT) we require that "Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot."

<li>I don't think you need to worry about <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, as you can see on his talk page, I warned him (in sloppy Japanese) in December about the other leagues' results pages getting deleted, and he stopped creating them (I'm pretty sure he was headed for 2005 next). I'm basically resigned to the fact that I won't see eye-to-eye on the concensus of these, but, I might as well add my dissent to every discussion that comes along. The barnstar was for the sheer amount of work he had put into Japanese soccer pages in general (before any of these results pages were created). <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 08:24, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'll be the odd one out. I don't see how this is an indiscriminate collection of information per above comments. Its verifiable and well laid out as far as I can see. Stats like this are not everyone's cup of tea but I'm sure there are media students for one that would find the article useful and interesting. Article could be improved with some interpretation of some of the data and more detail on the source of the information. The time slot immediately after the news IS incredibly important to network profits and media analysts DO dissect this type of data. Merging the data into either or both of the two current affairs programs misses the point as the comparison over an extended period is what's important. —<a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoondyne_51fd.html" title="User talk:Moondyne">Moondyne</a> 13:08, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>"an upcoming science fiction film <b>to be written and directed</b> by Kevin Smith" - First off, it's not really Wikipedia's place to commission a film. <i>Ranger Danger</i> is but one of the many story ideas occasionally entertained by Mr. Smith's fertile imagination, there was never any sort of official announcement or studio backing of the project. This article is comprised entirely of speculation fueled by random comments that Kevin Smith posted on an online forum. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 12:43, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This appears to be a spoof article. I've looked, and I dont't think that Maksim of Orenburg existed. The reference given, "Riasanovsky, Nicholas V. and Mark D. Steinberg. A History of Russia. 7th ed. Oxford University Press, 2004, 800 pages. (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0195153944</a>)", certainly exists, but Maksim of Orenburg is not in the index. <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArglebargleIV_fb51.html" title="User:ArglebargleIV">ArglebargleIV</a> 13:09, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Tentative delete</b>. Nothing I have been able to find, either. The stub article makes this sound like Maksim was a city-level ruler (a mayor or something like one), which makes his titling as "Czar" suspect in my eyes. <a href="http://www.orenburg.ru/city/history_eng.html" class="external text" title="http://www.orenburg.ru/city/history_eng.html" rel="nofollow">This</a> city history gives some names of provincial governors and the like, but nothing from 1757-1800, inconveniently enough. Maybe <a href="http://www.orenburg.ru/culture/encyclop/tom2/" class="external text" title="http://www.orenburg.ru/culture/encyclop/tom2/" rel="nofollow">This</a> would have some information for someone who reads Russian? However, <a href="http://ns.goobergunch.net/wiki/index.php/Pschycotic_Pschycos" class="external text" title="http://ns.goobergunch.net/wiki/index.php/Pschycotic_Pschycos" rel="nofollow">this link</a> in a wiki for <a href="../../../n/a/t/Jennifer_Government%7E_NationStates_7777.html" title="Jennifer Government: NationStates">NationStates</a> makes me wonder if this isn't a <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a> problem rather than "just" a hoax. Even if not, he seems little more than a late 18th century mayor or provincial governor, and I don't think that meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> anyway. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 14:02, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> I too have looked for both Maksim of Orenburg and Maksim romanov and combinations thereof.

<p>This appears to be a term coined by a character on a TV show. The only source is Urban Dictionary, which lists two different definitions, but both cite the TV show as their source. No reliable sources. Even ignoring that, it's a dictionary definition at best. Term gets a bunch of hits in Google, but no discussion of the definition of the term. Word doesn't appear in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_American_Heritage_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language_6be9.html" title="The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language">The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language</a>, Collins English Dictionary, or the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_Dictionary_of_English_86a8.html" title="Oxford Dictionary of English">Oxford Dictionary of English</a>. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 14:48, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Any way you dress it up, this is a dictionary definition of a neologism that has absolutely no sources. The sources suggested here seem to define the word differently than the article does. The article, it seems to me, defines a homosexualist as a person who, while not scared of homosexuals, discriminates based on sexual orientation, while it does not make it clear whom that person discriminates for or against. The sources here describe a homosexualist as a person who supports homosexuals as "the Elect" versus the "the Damned" who do not support them. I don't see any of that in the article. It would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to be kept, and even in that case I would suggest a merge into something else, possibly <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual_agenda.html" title="Homosexual agenda">homosexual agenda</a>. The argument for speedy keep is clearly untenable, and the sources mentioned as "evidence" seem to be sources for something else. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan"><font color="black">Tractor</font></a><a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETractorkingsfan_0b20.html" title="User talk:Tractorkingsfan"><font color="green">kings</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tractorkingsfan_5bb2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tractorkingsfan"><font color="red">fan</font></a> 23:09, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not been touched for yonks this article. I find it hard to believe that so many sorts of desks can be notable, but maybe that's because I am not particularly excited by desks. Still, the title "desk on a chest" sounds somewhat wrong - I can't describe why <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontchav_896a.html" title="User:Montchav">Montchav</a> 13:07, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Rename to Desk on chest</b>: If you do a Google search with the exact term option with "Desk on chest" you'll get a better idea of what I was reading about in a specialized book on antique furniture when I wrote that article. If you want to actually see one then do a Google image search on "campaign desk chest" . The first two in that image search are desks on a chest or desks on chests,(do a google image search with just "campaign desk" to see real campaign desks) the other ones are <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_desk.html" title="Secretary desk">Secretary desks</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedestal_desk.html" title="Pedestal desk">Pedestal desks</a> and <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slant_top_desk.html" title="Slant top desk">Slant top desks</a> that have been mis-tagged for a variety of reasons.

I wrote up the first versions of all the articles in that list, save one. All of them are based on my readings in published books or in Web pages for the desk forms (such as an armoire desk) which are not antiques, so they do not constitute original research. Original research would have meant going through manuscripts, going out in the field and taking photos of desks and measuring them and doing interviews with people. I've done nothing of the sort, always using Web pages (including antique dealer sites which you will not get if you just do a basic Google search, but which you will find useful if you do advanced Google searches) or printed books only. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlainV_3261.html" title="User:AlainV">AlainV</a> 02:28, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Did I forbid you from a POV? Course not, humans by their very nature will have one.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>: Seems to be a spam article. The only external source is YouTube, and that's not a reliable source. Furthermore, the YouTube link does not seem to be a "documentary", but rather an advertisement piece. (Either that, or it's a really, really favorable documentary.)

<li>Yeah, I guess I was thinking Google Video but put down YouTube. Anyway, the other sources are from this company. What we need are reliable, third-party sources.

<ul>
<li>If the company did put the Titan TV segment up on Google Video, it doesn't change the fact that the segment was made by a third party. Hence, it is an independent source. Do you think they fabricated the video entirely and are lying that it was ever a segment on TV? Or are you arguing that the company edited the segment or something to make themselves look better? Also, the article has two more sources. The fact that independent links aren't available to these sources doesn't mean that the sources don't exist or that they are not independent. Sources don't even need links anyway (many books are cited in wikipedia that don't have the whole contents linked to online). We could just cite the sources, and remove the links to their text on the company's website if that would make you happier. --<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondSight_02d5.html" title="User:SecondSight">SecondSight</a> 06:02, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Is there any proof at all this video was made by a third party? It doesn't have any logo on it that says "Titan TV", and the only source that says this is from Titan TV is Badboy Lifestyle. Also, this is not a documentary. This is a promotional piece. It shows the corporation talking about their infallible method, it talks about being a "player", it shows the price of the seminars, and then it closes with an advertisement screen: "Seduce any girl - badboylifestyle.com". This is an infomercial. If you were to remove the links and rather just cite the articles, it would still not fix the problem that the articles are unverified. Several of the sources are from Badboy, and two links are the same video.

<dd>The first reference is to a general "lifestyle" (i.e., glossy puff) article which mentions this company among a number of others. The second is to a similar (if more nauseating) article in a local magazine, though it does concentrate on this company. The third (by the PR Manager of a local student magazine) is the same sort of thing, more general than the second, but focussing more on this company than the first.</dd>
<dd>So the two references that focus more on this company are local mags, and the national newspaper mentions it as one among many. I'm not impressed; others may be. (Oh, the Cable television programme; isn't it more a mark of notability <i>not</i> to be mentioned by at least one of these? There are so many of them, and so little of real significance for them to talk about.) --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 22:35, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> The USA Today article mentions other companies, but it is clearly about PickUp 101 primarily. It has a sidebar with advice from them, and only them. It describes one of their workshops, not the workshops of other companies. It even has a picture of the founder of the company. This is an article in a national publication, and clearly establishes notability of the subject. As for the other sources, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> does not exclude local magazines nor student magazines. (<a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> currently excludes student publications, but the policy is still under development and this exclusion is controversial if you read the talk page. Even if the student published article was excluded in establishing notability, the page still has enough sources, and WP:CORP still says that student publications can be used as sources.) Terms like "glossy puff" and "nauseating article in a local magazine" are merely your personal characterizations of the sources. As for the news segment, just because you don't like those programs doesn't mean that it doesn't add to the notability of the subject. --<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondSight_02d5.html" title="User:SecondSight">SecondSight</a> 03:58, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

The sources themself. Naturally each of the sources mention PUA in general because the whole concept is completely foreign to most people. Thus the mention of pick up in needed for the context. <i>However...</i> all of these references mentioned start of by mentioning PickUp101/Lance Mason first and have them as the focus of the article.

<li>I basically agree, but the problem is moving the article and rewriting it completely isn't exactly "keeping" it, is it? Deleting/rewiting it from scratch and removing the text/rewriting from scratch are almost the same thing here. Far too often people vote "keep but rewrite every single word", resulting in the article being kept, but not necessarily rewritten. In cases like this the keep should be contingent on a rewrite. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:22, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Rather than arguing about the system, why don't we try and work out what to do with this article? If we can have some proof that it meets the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html#The_primary_notability_criterion" title="WP:NOTE">primary notability criteria</a>, (and perhaps <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>) then it can be moved and rewritten. The fact that you know people who have items made by the brand does not make it notable. Until we have that proof, and, preferably, someone willing to rewrite the article, it should be deleted. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 16:28, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This is definately a genuinely notable high street chain. According to an article in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a> <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,9074-2564990,00.html" class="external text" title="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,9074-2564990,00.html" rel="nofollow">25th January 2007</a> it has 106 stores in the UK and plans to open 100 more in 2007. I cycle past one every day on my way to work (possibly not enough of a reason to keep the article!). That said clearly the article as it stands is pretty poor and lots of the information in it is not really relevant for an encyclopedia article. It needs more sources, more relevant information and generally needs tidying up / wikifying. I can't agree that it should be deleted for non-notability though. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules1975</a> 12:29, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> That is one article, one more and it passes the notability requirements. Just to counter the argument being used by everyone else, I am English, and I have never heard of it. On the other hand, I live in a forgotton corner of the country, and I'm not exactly fashion conscious. Looking for more sources, I found <a href="http://www.whitewatersc.ie/index.php?id=25&amp;search_arg1=63&amp;search_arg9=&amp;cid=24&amp;cat=Ladies" class="external text" title="http://www.whitewatersc.ie/index.php?id=25&amp;search_arg1=63&amp;search_arg9=&amp;cid=24&amp;cat=Ladies" rel="nofollow">this</a>, the majority of Google hits are directory entries, and a few hits of various people of this name. Does anyone want to work on the article? <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 18:03, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It genuinely does have 106 stores. Is this not notable even if no-one has written about them in the press? One is in <a href="../../../b/l/u/Bluewater.html" title="Bluewater">Bluewater</a> shopping centre, one in the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metro_Centre_4ab3.html" title="Metro Centre">Metro Centre</a> in Gateshead. A quick search on <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yell.html" title="Yell">Yell</a> suggests there are at least nine stores in London.

<p>Notability is suspect. Most online references to this person are all from self-published sources (by her or on other people's blogs and message boards). Won a contest that might not be considered a general-interest contest. In addition, one of the contributors in this article (mikeabundo) appears to personally know this person based on some entries in his own blog (mikeabundo.com). I would say, unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitopao_212a.html" title="User:Titopao">Tito Pao</a> 16:41, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Very Strong Delete</b>. Absolutely no sources at all for a lot of the info (personal info) about subject of article. Non-notable and quite unencyclopedic. I mean, on-the-spot poster-making contests? I doubt that demonstrates notability. While she has won a lot of cosplays, that's hardly a reason for inclusion in wikipedia. Notwithstanding <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> but, how many articles do we have for cosplayers? That is her claim-to-fame (I'm willing to state that's her only real one) and that's no reason for a highly-detailed article. As for the art awards, three of those are for an in-school contest.

<li><b>Comment</b> from my own knowledge, and my peers in Ragnarok and cosplayers, she is well known but I agree that for Wikipedia she does not fit the standards currently.

<li><b>Comment</b>. "No notability whatsoever" is being rude. She is the editor of a journal and a columnist. fwiw, I think the enwiki has different notability standards; e.g. a radio traffic reporter (<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christina_Stoffo_69c5.html" title="Christina Stoffo">Christina Stoffo</a>) is considered notable due to notability within a locality. Here is the turkish Afd: <a href="../../../../tr/s/i/l/Vikipedi%7ESilinmeye_aday_maddeler_Arzu_Celalifer_1c4a.html" class="extiw" title="tr:Vikipedi:Silinmeye_aday_maddeler/Arzu_Celalifer">tr:Vikipedi:Silinmeye_aday_maddeler/Arzu_Celalifer</a>; does anyone know of a free turkish-&gt;english machine translator? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 22:08, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks. So <a href="../../../s/%C3%BC/h/S%C3%BCheyl_Batum_0837.html" title="Süheyl Batum">Süheyl Batum</a> is one of the editors? That should help assess this Afd on a locality basis.

<dd>Yes, <a href="../../../s/%C3%BC/h/S%C3%BCheyl_Batum_0837.html" title="Süheyl Batum">Süheyl Batum</a> is one of the editors. I have however my doubts about the notability of the journal. It is published by the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Strategic_Research_Organization_f727.html" title="International Strategic Research Organization">International Strategic Research Organization</a>, whose director Sedat Laçiner has written a number of articles on Wikipedia about several publications and employed in connection with his organization (including himself).

also since when is personal dislike a reason to wanna delete it, who the hell cares if you didnt like KI2 THAT DOESNT MATTER also this exists on Killer Instinct 2's page but it briefly explains the situation, how is this any different except for it being an elaboration on its own page?<br />

<p><strike>This appears to be a very vague description of a 'sub breed' of cattle that one farmer has developed.

<p>Actually, this was a very succesful breed and bred by an institution in Nicaragua that barely exisits anymore. It was not developed by one farmer. During the Nicaraguan revolution (or just after) a great deal of this breed was sold to a National University in Venazuela. I have just learned that they might still maintain this breed in a herd there. I will get some more information so we can add more support. It was an important breed to Nicaragua and very well developed. Economic strife has caused it's reduction. Let me know thoughts please.

Let me work on it a bit to see if I can come up with more detail. My source was the former Undersecretary of Agriculture in Nic. The first article loosley translated:</p>
<p>MANAGUA.- El gobierno de Nicaragua y la Universidad Nacional Agraria (UNA) acordaron un programa de mejoramiento genético del ganado reina, una raza bovina nicaragüense que fue declarada patrimonio nacional.</p>
<p><i>MANAGUA - The government of Nicaragua and the National Agrarian University (UNA) agreed to a genetic improvement program of Reina (Queen) Cattle, a Nicaraguan bovine breed that was declared National Patrimony</i></p>
<p>El propósito del acuerdo es elevar el rendimiento de esta raza criolla, explicó el rector de la UNA, ingeniero Telémaco Talavera, mediante implantes de embriones en los mejores vientres disponibles.</p>
<p><i>The agreement proposes to elevate the yields of this Creole Breed, explaned the dean of UNA, Engineer Telematico Talavera, through the process of implanting embryos in the best utersises available.</i></p>
<p>“El ganado reina tiene características especiales para el trópico, posee genes que le permiten resistir el calor y puede ser ganado de doble propósito: carne y leche. La UNA trabaja para mejorar los transplantes de embriones de este ganado”, dijo Talavera.</p>
<p><i>"The Reina cattle has special characterisitics for the tropics, it posesses genes which permit it to resist heat and they can be dual purpose: meat and milk. UNA work to better the transplanting of embryos in this cattle", Talavera said.</i></p>
<p>Financiado por el Ministerio de Agricultura, el Instituto de Desarrollo Rural y la Agencia de Cooperación de Japón, el proyecto incluirá capacitación a los productores y la distribución de ampollas de semen de mejor calidad</p>
<p><i>Financing will come from the Ministry of Agriculture, The Insitutue for Rural Development and the Agency of Cooperation with Japan, the project will include the training of producers and the distribution of ampules of better quality semen.</i></p>
<p>I'll still look for more information. The breed started in decline just as the internet was taking off (that could be why there is not much there).--<a href="../../../a/g/r/User%7EAgrofe_25fd.html" title="User:Agrofe">Agrofe</a> 18:47, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Contested <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>. "An alternative cruiser is a motorcycle cruiser that isn't quite in the big 5 category (yet)" is hardly an encyclopedic definition.

<p>"<b>Wikipedia has increasing power</b>" What an interesting and profound quote! I thought wikipedia was supposed to be a source of information, not an information broker.

<p>QUOTE: ""users want to use Wikipedia as a portal for knowledge creation"" Is this NOT the reason for an Encyclopedia&#160;? To use as a source of KNOWLEDGE&#160;? The comments made by the "EDITORS" make me wonder if many are nothing more than Harley Davidson "snobs".From the opening statement that has been added, to all the "editors" comments makes it clear that you do not really want anyone elses opinion. You should then just make this area unaccessable to the users of this site as it will and has made a bad impression about this site as a way to create and find information.</p>

</ul>
<p>The definition of "Alternative" is "Existing outside traditional or established institutions or systems" and "Espousing or reflecting values that are different from those of the establishment or mainstream" <i>Dictionary.com</i> Alternative Cruisers would thus be motorcycles that are not part of the mainstream brands everyone thinks of when you think of a motorcycle. Having a page for "Alternative Cruisers" would be beneficial as a source of knowledge for the general public who are not familiar with the alternatives. I understand that the reason you are requesting deletion of "Alternative Cruisers" is because there are not enough hits on a google search. However, as more and more people look into other options for motorcycles, "alternative cruisers" will become a more popular search. As an information resource, I would think Wikipedia would want to be the first to have this information available. In response to your quote, "it seems as if users want to use Wikipedia as a portal for knowledge creation, which isn't the purpose of wikipedia." This is not a "creation of knowledge." The knowledge already exists. It is just not readily available on the internet. Wikipedia can change that. In response to the quote, "If a manufacturer is notable, there is nothing preventing an article about that manufacturer, which may be linked from appropriate motorcycle-related articles. Creating an article that is basically "motorcycle brands you may not have heard of" and dressing it up with a name like "alternative cruisers" is promotional, which falls under our definition of <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>." This is a discriminatory statement. If you put brand names in your pages then ALL brands should be allowed. The fact whether or not they are notable is irrelevant. It is either considered Spam or not. Under your topic on Motorcycles you include many brand names including Harley, Honda, Suzuki, BMW, etc. Is that not spam? It is a list of motorcycle brands. Wikipedia needs to keep up with the trends. According to an article on TheAutoChannel.com, ""Motorcycles and scooters are simply better than ever, in performance, style and variety, and still very affordable," he said. "The latest Cycle World Buyer's Guide lists <b>more than 400 models</b>. And it's not just sportbikes and cruisers and touring bikes. <b>There are emerging niches between these broad categories, appealing to a wider array of personal taste in bikes</b>. There's a fun little $3,000 sportbike that gets 74 miles per gallon. There are beautiful big cruisers that cost $12,000 or less. There are many desirable bikes at these prices and beyond that Americans aspire to own and enjoy." One of these "emerging niches" are "Alternative Cruisers." I implore Wikipedia to keep up with the trend and not get left behind. Muriel Russo</p>

<dd>Muriel Russo, I'm sorry that <b>you</b> do not understand. Wikipedia has a responsibility to its own policies, not to "keeping up with the trend" or allowing non-notable material simply out of some fairness guideline (we do not have a fairness guideline). We only allow <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> topics in the encyclopedia (guideline), and notability must be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> (policy) through <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. A few google results does not meet these guidelines. All you've done is present evidence that there are lesser-known manufacturers of bikes, but you have not presented anything that verifably proves that they are known as "alternative cruisers" generally or that this is a meaningful classification for any type of vehicle or product. We are not objecting to the brands listed in the article, we are objecting to the fanciful grouping of them, apparently for promotional purposes. We are not a webhost for essays or would-be magazine articles. Please familiarize yourself with our policies and guidelines. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:00, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This appears to be an indiscriminate list of books about the American Board of Commisioners for Foreign Missions. It does not appear to have any encyclopedic value, as it conveys no useful information about the organization or anything else. Moreover, Wikipedia generally does not contain pages devoted exclusively to references. For these reasons, I suggest deleting this article. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Submillimeter_7547.html" title="User:Dr. Submillimeter">Dr. Submillimeter</a> 18:17, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Non notable except in the small communities with which they interact.

Their references seem to be a mixture of self links, a "screenshot of the week" style site, a gaming site (<a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultima_Online_c3a6.html" title="Ultima Online">Ultima Online</a>) with 150 such articles about the same types of events with different groups, an "interview" by a member of the group with their leader (The Only-War link) and an article on a minor WoW fansite. A quick google search brings up 534 for "shadowclan guild" (no quotes), 1440 for "shadowclan warcraft" (no quotes) and 1380 for "shadowclan ultima online" (no quotes).

<li><b>Comment</b> - FWIW my understanding of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is that multiple and reliable sources are required. No argument with Dummies reference. However, I gather from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> that blogs are only reliable if written by journalists or acdemics and Raph Koster is neither. Also, I don't think Ultima Online or Dark Age of Camelot are reliable publishers. The terranova reference is another blog and I couldn't find the article when I <a href="http://www.massive-magazine.com/index.php?searchword=Shadowclan&amp;option=com_search&amp;Itemid=" class="external text" title="http://www.massive-magazine.com/index.php?searchword=Shadowclan&amp;option=com_search&amp;Itemid=" rel="nofollow">searched</a> Massive Magazine. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 23:23, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>She's having a third baby... this makes her notable? It suggests to me that the tabloid newspaper in question was having a slow news day. And you miss the point about the BBC; companies often put profiles of their employees on their own Web pages — that isn't a sign of notability.<br />
Note that I'm not trying to do her down; I'm sure that she's an excellent person, good at what is doubtless an interesting job, pleasant to be with, a good mother, and so on.

<ul>
<li>Not true. <i>The News Letter</i> is more than a "blurb" or "trivial mention" as the free preview shows 262 of 1,759 characters. Plus <i>The Daily Mirror</i> article is also more than a "blurb" with that free preview showing 94 out of 677 characters, and the <i>Fresh Magazine</i> article is even more than both. And <i>The People</i> is still a published work satisfing WP:BIO notability guildlines - "The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. This criterion includes published works <b>in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles</b>, books, scholarly papers, and television documentaries except for the following: Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that just mention the person in passing, telephone directory listings, or simple records of births and deaths." Whether it's a tabloid or not, it's still a published work. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 04:37, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Right, the <i>News Letter</i> is the only source of any length for this. 677 characters is under a hundred words. <i>Fresh</i> magazine is put out by the Health Promotion Agency and its brief interview was about her childrens' eating and exercise habits. And you are ignoring the part of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> that says that the sources must be reliable. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 13:28, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are confirming that the <i>News Letter</i> article is more than "just mention[ing] the person in passing." 100 words is well beyond "mentioning in passing". And the <i>Fresh Magazine</i> is a published work under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and doesn't fall under any of the "exceptions". Who publishes the magazine is irrelevant as the "source is independent of the person." As for the reliable sources, that refers to accuracy of content, not notability. If the National Enquirer writes several article about someone, that someone is notable, no matter how light weight the articles are. And there are two new published works from the national charity <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodland_Trust_0154.html" title="Woodland Trust">Woodland Trust</a> that are primarily about her <a href="http://www.treeforall.org.uk/NorthernIreland/News/Autumnwatch+with+Angie.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.treeforall.org.uk/NorthernIreland/News/Autumnwatch+with+Angie.htm" rel="nofollow">[89]</a><a href="http://www.treeforall.org.uk/NorthernIreland/News/CelebritySupporters/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.treeforall.org.uk/NorthernIreland/News/CelebritySupporters/" rel="nofollow">[90]</a>.

<ul>
<li>I confirmed it in my first post and in each subsequent post. The problem is we still don't have multiple articles of which she is the subject that are longer than blurbs (and yes, 100 words is just a blurb). The Fresh magazine piece is just one in which she, along with other minor celebrities are asked questions about their children's diets. A typical example is "Do your children like fruit and veg.?" It doesn't provide any information about her. Honestly, how are we supposed to use that as a source to write the article: "Angie Philllips, whose children like fruit and veg., is a weather presenter for the BBC"? The Woodland Trust pieces similarly do not talk about her, but contain quotes from her in support of its mission. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 19:07, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks for the confirmation of the confirmation&#160;:). A 100-word peice, whether someone labels it a "blurb" or not, is beyond <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s "passing mention." Even if you feel like excluding all three of <i>The People</i> articles about her, plus the <i>Fresh Magazine</i> and the Woodland Trust articles, there's still two published works (i.e. "multiple") cited that are primarily about the subject.--<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 21:24, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, sources are supposed to be reliable — but more importantly, many of those sources are saying no more about her than that she had a third baby... If this were an article about someone notable for having three babies(!) then I suppose that those sources would provide verifiability and notability. Any presenter on local radio or television is likely to have been the subject of mini-article in newspapers on slow news days (I've been the subject of a couple — one in the <i>Times</i>, one in the <i>New Statesman</i>, because even academics get this sort of thing — should there be an article on me? Articles on academics are constantly being deleted on grounds on=f non-notability, because it's deemed that what they've done doesn't raise them sufficiently above their peers. Apparently they don't need to have written a successful book, just had an artcile about their child-bearing capabilities in the <i>Sun</i>); are we to have articles on every such person? They're not even micro-celebrities. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 09:01, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe there should be an article on you, Mel.&#160;:) (unless your real name is different, you didn't come up on a G-news Archives search like Angie Phillips did several times). Articles on academics are also constantly being kept because they pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. But you're missing the point. WP:BIO is passed here. Whether an editor is assuming a news outlet is "having a slow news day" is irrelevent. How do you know that major events weren't occuring on those days anyway? It's 100% speculation and that is in no way a basis for deciding if a subject is notable. And as stated above, even if you feel like discounting 3 of the published works about Angie Phillips you don't like, there's still 2 more non-trivial published works about her that are not just "passing mentions". --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 10:11, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I do come up (my real name is a dark and deadly secret, known to a very few...). The point is, though, that those articles on me wouldn't demonstrate my notability (and neither or them was a passing mention). Note also that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> only offers guidelines; editors are free to delete an article that meets the criteria there, and to keep an article that doesn't. (And I wasn't saying that my belief that it must have been a slow news day was grounds for ignoring it, incidentally.) Do you think that she's more notable than all the other presenters, newsreaders, weather-reporters, <i>et al.</i>? If not, should we have an article on each of them? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 16:42, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But the primary criteria of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is met. If you want to arbitrarily ignore official policy guidelines on specific subjects you don't like, well, editors are free to have their opinion, but that's not in line with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> or WP:BIO, with the exception of <a href="../../../i/g/n/WP%7EIGNORE_187e.html" title="WP:IGNORE">WP:IGNORE</a> of course. And many news anchor persons and weather reporters/metorologists do have their own articles when they fit the notability criterion. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 18:15, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Have a look at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, notability isn't newsworthiness and sources must be reliable. Tabloid journalism doesn't, in my view, qualify. 23:23, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Its a real tool that sys admins who seldom to never contribute to Widipedia use. It does need editing, but assuming an encyclopedia should cover <b>the world</b>, then this is very much part of sys admins world. Google for Cfg2html produces a page of results. The question is what should the authors and users (a small group) do to make this encyclopaedic? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.8.109.254_f769.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.8.109.254">65.8.109.254</a> (talk) 19:47, 5 February 2007 (UTC).</small>

<li>Yes, we cover the world. Yet, we've decided we cover only the part of the world that everyone needs to know about and that everyone knows. This article a) doesn't explain why the thing is <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">notable</a>, and if we remove all of the stuff you normally won't find an encyclopaedia article, there's really no reason we should even have a stand-alone article about it. I've been a Linux user for over a decade and have never heard of this program - and I can't quite find it if I do <tt>apt-cache search cfg2html</tt>. (nope, external apt repos don't count.) Inclusion in a major Linux distro might make this utility sound a lot more interesting, don't you think? At best, it's mergeable material: I don't really think that random bits of infrastructure are necessarily worthy of their own article either, but they may be comment-worthy somewhere else. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 10:40, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> cfg2html is not only a real tool but - as the article is trying to say - the "Swiss Army Knife" for any system administrator when it comes to system documentation of any server running one of the OS'es covered. However, as previous comments suggest the article doesn't meet yet wikipedia standards I'd be more than happy to adjust where neccessary. Any pointers to existing articles covering a similiar topic highly appreciated. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tbrix (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tbrix_b21a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tbrix">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>Well, take a look at any of the articles about *nix utilities. You'll see we don't have a whole lot of usage details in articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> cfg2html is really useful. The only things I don't like are the License and the Homepage of the tool: It's not GPL, and you must register at Yahoo to download. SCC (System Configuration Collector, <a href="http://www.openeyet.nl/scc/" class="external free" title="http://www.openeyet.nl/scc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.openeyet.nl/scc/</a>) was inspired by cfg2html, as mentioned at <a href="http://www.linuxsecurity.com/content/view/117330/49/" class="external free" title="http://www.linuxsecurity.com/content/view/117330/49/" rel="nofollow">http://www.linuxsecurity.com/content/view/117330/49/</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 193.26.226.4 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_193.26.226.4_877b.html" title="Special:Contributions/193.26.226.4">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>Please see <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> "It's useful" is not really a particularly good reason to keep an article. Also, the case of SCC is irrelevant here. (A rhetoric example: We have an article about Thomas Edison, but not the guy who said "damn, it's dark here", thus inspiring Edison to do something about it. =) And even if it was, I can't seem to find any indication SCC is really all that notable either, but that was just a cursory check. LinuxSecurity.com article appears to be mostly about SCC in any case and the reference to cfg2html is a trivial mention. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 21:34, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> cfg2html is an extremely powerful tool for building, templating and rebuilding systems from scratch.

<li><b>Comment</b> There <i>is</i> however, have an article on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Christianity_studies_dec5.html" title="Islamic Christianity studies">Islamic Christianity studies</a>, which is the field in which these scholars are engaged. That article describes its subject as and attempt to "study Christian religious texts and religious traditions according to an Islamic view." So the people on the list clearly have a point of view. That does not mean that the list itself does, though. Were there an analogous field of studying Islamic texts according to the Christian viewpoint, we could do an article (and possibly a list) on that topic.

<li>I've seen lesser-populated categories. The fact that there aren't many people with articles to put into the category is not an argument against the category. The argument for the category is that this is a distinct genre of writing that doesn't fit easily into other already-existing categories. The Category:Muslim scholars of Christianity category should be a subcategory of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Category%7EChristian_scholars_addf.html" title="Category:Christian scholars">Category:Christian scholars</a>, and it will nicely parallel the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Category%7ENon-Muslim_Islamic_scholars_f7dd.html" title="Category:Non-Muslim Islamic scholars">Category:Non-Muslim Islamic scholars</a>. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 03:12, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Appears to be a real existing phenomenon. Do also note that the relations that Christians have with Islam and Muslims has with Christianity are not identical. Muslims considers Jesus, Abraham, etc. as prophets and considers that the Bible and Torah were revelations that were distorted.

<li><b>keep</b> "extremely limited interest" amounts to IDONTLIKEIT and is not a criterion. It's an essay because its merely one of a great number of inappropriate reasons, so inappropriate that it has not been necessary to make a guideline out of it, or any of the 100s of other other inappropriate reasons that have been offered from time to time. As JChap says, find a case where limited interest was used as a criterion and supported by the consensus. If there is real content, RN, V, and someone to write the article, that is enough. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:42, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The article on the artist may have potential if improved (both references and grammar--and I do realize that the main author is not a native English speaker, so others should go in and help). The "Personal Structures" movement or group is more of a problem--it is mainly speculative at this point, and has not been established as anything notable (the first symposium related to it is from 2005). Can we separate the two within this AfD? I'd vote for a <b>Weak Keep</b> on the artist, pending improvements, and a <b>Speedy Delete</b> on "Personal Structures". <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 23:05, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

This is nothing but vandalism tied to an alleged person actually named Lantz that attended AVSS, and furthermore, Image:Lantz.jpg was originally a photograph of him sitting on the toilet in the guys bathroom at AVSS. The creator of the article, Sharkbyte08 (<a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7ESharkbyte08_3e1c.html" title="User talk:Sharkbyte08">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sharkbyte08_2a32.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sharkbyte08">contribs</a>), also uploaded <a href="../../../j/a/m/Image%7EJamestown.jpg_dba8.html" title="Image:Jamestown.jpg">Image:Jamestown.jpg</a>, which is most likely bullshit, as its description is "James Lantz at the Battle of Jamestown. 1622", but the article states James Lantz's spouse is <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Monroe_4162.html" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>. The picture actually depicts pillaging Vikings, which is another tie to AVSS as the Viking is the mascot of AVSS.

<li><b>Keep</b> Significant shopping centre within the northwestern suburbs of Sydney. I tend to hold the view that corner stores and neighbourhood centres, unless highly notable, should not have articles at all, while regional shopping centres, often critical to the growth and development of a region, should have articles written according to WP:NPOV and other appropriate Wikipedia policies. Alternatively, we can have a Wikipedia devoid of interesting content which presents the facts in other articles without context. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 15:20, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>article seems intended to promote the brothel. Doesn't seem to be particularly notable in and of itself.

<li><b>Keep.</b> (Article was tagged with db-spam, then deleted, then restored by me and referenced.) Casual literature search reveals about 30 hits in the international press; almost all articles introduce the club as the "best-known" or "most exclusive" brothel of Amsterdam or even the Netherlands, establishing notability. I don't think a business has to be "particularly notable" to deserve an article. The charge "the article seems intended to promote the brothel" is too vague to allow for an answer. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 00:04, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
