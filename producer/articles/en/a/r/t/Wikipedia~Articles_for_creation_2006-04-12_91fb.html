<p>3D-Worm Game</p>
<p>3D Worm can be likened to the previous snake games that were developed in previous years. The only difference is that the player controls a worm instead of a snake. Nevertheless, the said games have the same objectives. The player needs to make the worm grow bigger. Making the worm grow can be done by eating the red and green apples that are displayed on the screen before they disappear from the play area. It sounds easy enough. However, the player has to make sure that the worm does not bump its own tail. Also, the player should avoid hitting the corners or any side of the play area. Hitting the worm's tail or any part of the play area will forfeit the game.</p>
<p>The player, naturally, has to start again if he wishes to continue. Another thing, the player has to make the worm eat ten apples before he can proceed to the next level. Each level gets more challenging as the game progresses. This is because the worm gets longer and longer for every apple that it eats. Also, the worm moves faster every time it progresses to another level. Thus, manipulating the worm through the play area can get really challenging for the player.</p>
<p>3D Worm is a flash arcade game developed by URGames. It has a file size of 45.79 KB. As a result, the player is assured that the game will load in just a short time. Lastly, as the name suggests, the game is played in 3D mode.</p>

<p>Escape from Elm Street will ask the player to click on either the Play or Instructions button. Those who are unfamiliar with the game's control keys are advised to click on the Instructions button before they start to play the game. Afterwards, the next screen will ask for the player's name and birthdate. The plot moves on to tell the player that during a ride home from school, the player has taken a dare from his friends to enter Freddy's house.</p>
<p>Inside the house, the player has to collect scattered weapons and items to place in his inventory. The Krueger house is a mess. The player has to navigate through all parts of the house to decipher what secrets lay behind the Krueger residence. Besides, collecting clues and weapons is a vital part of the game. The items that will be collected can help the player find a way out of the horrifying house. There are chances that the player will feel that he is stuck in a certain level of the house. Therefore, the player is advised to take note of small details. This is because such details can prove to be crucial components in the game, too.</p>
<p>Escape from Elm Street is inspired by the movie, Nightmare on Elm Street. This detail is quite obvious because of the graphics and the storyline that the player will see during the game. Freddy Krueger even makes an appearance for the introduction part of the online game. On a more technical note, the said adventure game took about six months to be developed by Afro-Ninja Productions. The developers made some cutscenes available whenever the player has uncovered something significant. Incidentally, the engine for Escape from Elm Street is actually inspired by Shadowgate. Furthermore, the game is rated PG-13 because of the violence, blood content, and/or language that is featured in the storyline. Lastly, the said game is not just a demo version. It is a full-length game, which may end in two possibilities. Of course, the ending depends on how well the player has navigated his way while inside Freddy Krueger's house.</p>

<p>The title says it all. Kung-fu Fighter is an action game which features a character that looks like Bruce Lee. There's not much of a plot for Kung-Fu Fighter. The excitement all lies in the action that will ensue between the player and the opponents.</p>
<p>The player will be asked to choose between two players that he would like to use for the game. It is important for the player to dodge and escape the blows that the AI opponent will blow. AI enemies in Kung-Fu fighter are quite strong. Also, it is possible to be beaten up repetitively by the opponent once the player is cornered. Being knocked out several times can definitely happen if the player does not plan his actions well. Some of the AI opponents can be challenging as they tend to move a lot. Plus, the AI opponents can actually sweep the player off his feet with the use of their special powers. However, the player should not worry too much. The player also has some special moves up his sleeves. The player just has to press a combination of keys before the special move can be carried out. Furthermore, there are several minor opponents that the player has to defeat before he can advance to the boss of the kung-fu ring. Some parts in the play area interact with the game play -- tables or barrels get broken when either of the kung-fu characters hit them. Each match has two rounds. A match ends when either of the character's life bar reaches its limit. The life bar can be located at the topmost part of the play area.</p>
<p>Kung-Fu Fighter is developed by Sony Classics. The game is 3.15 MB in size. Therefore, players should not be surprised if it takes a long time to load. Instructions regarding the keys will be found in the game. Basically, the player has to make use of the arrow keys and some letter keys to be able to navigate through the game.</p>

<p>Nerd Quest requires its players to use the arrow keys in order to move the character around the play area. Furthermore, the player also needs to click on the play area before the controls can be used. The objective of the game is to reach the end of the caves. However, the character must throw caution in the air. There are some dangerous things lurking in the dark caves. Rats, ghosts, and bats must be avoided at all costs. Gold coins can be found in some parts of the cave. The player should grab the coins. Also, the player is advised to collect all the keys that are scattered all around the caves. These keys are essential for the player to reach the end of the cave alive. Also, it is possible for the player to go from one place of the cave to the other. This is because some keys, which are to be used for a certain door, are located on the other side of the cave. Therefore, the player has no choice but to make the Nerd return to the other side of the cave. The player's scores will depend on the number of gold that the Nerd collects in the caves. Scores for the game are displayed on the lower right side of the play area. There is also a timer at the bottom of the screen. The said timer shows how long the Nerd has been engaged in his quest inside the caves.</p>
<p>Nerd Quest is a flash adventure game developed by Pedantic Pontificator of Software Sophistry. It is 97 KB in size. Thus, it may take between 10 to 30 seconds to load depending on the player's internet connection speed.</p>

<p>The game starts with a cutscene used to tell the introduction of the game. The video shows two friends who meet during the calm of the night. One of them brings a sleeping child with him. The other man Hattori, who turns out to be the father of the boy, tells his friend to bring his son to the mountains. From there, Fujin will teach the boy, Sinjid, the different ways of the warrior. Incidentally, Sinjid is destined to battle with the Fallen Army when the time is right. Twenty years living in the mountains has taught the young Sinjid different techniques, skills, and strategies that he may use against the Fallen Army. However, Sinjid still has to learn the final part of his training. He has to kill all the guards that are located in the Shadow Temple. Meanwhile, Fujin is making his way in the misty parts of the highest mountains. Only Fujin knows the reason why he has left Sinjid behind.</p>
<p>The next scene will ask the player to choose the type of warrior that Sinjid will become. Players can either choose the Balanced, Spell Caster, Shadow ninja, and the Warrior class. Each class features several techniques and skills that Sinjid can become an expert of. Afterwards, the player can purchase potions, food, and weapons from the merchants that can be found in the different parts of the Shadow Temple. The player must then fight his way to the top of the levels to complete Sinjid's last training as a warrior. Level ups are available every time Sinjid defeats a certain number of soldiers. After Sinjid completes his mission to kill all the guards at the Human Gateway of the Shadow Temple, then he is ready to face the challenges that the Fallen Army has in store for him.</p>
<p>Sinjid: Shadow of the Warrior is an online flash game developed by InfraRift Entertainment. Shadow of the Warrior is the second chapter for the Sinjid series that InfraRift developed. It took almost a year before the first game, Sinjid: Battle Arena, had an addition to the series. The Sinjid series is like the series of Legend of Zelda games. However, it has a different storyline. The said games are similar because the player has to fight monsters and humans alike to save the community that the protagonist is located in. According to the developers of the game, players of the Sinjid series can expect a more twisted plot in future chapters of Sinjid. The portal system may possibly be replaced by a full-on RPG system since InfraRift is quite certain that the game's engine can handle the technical features that they would like to add to the Sinjid series.</p>
<p>The game is essentially a hack-and-slash type of game. The player and the AI take turns to battle it out. The player has the option to either attack, use mana potions or drink life potions. Every action that the player makes is equivalent to one turn. The main objective of the game is for the player to help Sinjid win the battle against the Fallen army. Hattori's death will be avenged if Sinjid is able to defeat the Fallen Army from taking over the lands.</p>

<p>Aoyagi Ritsuka is one troubled 6th grader. Two years ago, he mysteriously lost his memory and developed an alternate personality. His mother constatly berates (and occasionally beats) him, asking what happened to the 'real' Ritsuka, and his only defender and friend, his older brother Seimei, was recently killed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Seimei's apparent 'friend,' Soubi, appears. Soubi tells him that Ritsuka's true name is 'Loveless,' and that Soubi was assigned by Seimei to take care of Ritsuka and protect him. Ritsuka soon gets sucked into a bizzare underground society where teams of people, a 'Fighter Unit,' and a 'Sacrifice,' battle using elaborate and beautifully-phrased spells.</p>

<p>Fris-Nok is an outdoor game originating in <a href="../../../g/i/m/Gimli%2C_Manitoba_6db1.html" title="Gimli, Manitoba">Gimli, Manitoba</a>. The pastime has caught on with locals and cottagers of the region, and its popularity has been boosted by the Fris-Nok competition at the annual Icelandic Festival held in Gimli. The object of the game is to serve the disk so that it will hit the post on which the bottle stands, or the bottle directly, such that the bottle is nocked off the post. Due to its intense yet laid back nature, Fris-Nok makes for an excellent spectator game, and cabin-country pastime.</p>

<p>Fris-Nok was invented by Cam Arnason and his friends in their spare time while on hunting and fishing trips in the Manitoba Interlake. It has spread by word of mouth and through its exposure in the Iceland Festival. The game has since spread to many areas of Southern Manitoba and Ontario.</p>

<p><b>PLAYERS</b>: Fris-Nok may be played either singles or doubles. Doubles is the popular form. In either case, the court and rules are identical.</p>
<p><b>EQUIPMENT</b>: Two Fris-Nok posts, two empty bottles (prefferably beer bottles), and one Fris-Nok disc.</p>
<p><br />
<b>COURT</b>: Fris-Nok posts are placed in zones 30 feet (9.15M) apart. There must be room for vigorous activity in the area surrounding the zones. A bottle is placed on each post. In windy conditions it may be necessary to add some water or sand to the bottles. The distance between the two posts may be reduced to 20 feet for children or inexperienced players. The posts, preferably two inches by two inches, should be driven into the ground approximately six inches to give the post some wobble when the disk impacts it. Bottle stands may be nailed to the top of the posts if the bottle does not stand on its own.</p>
<p><br />
<b>OBJECT</b>: All games are to five points. A point is scored when:</p>
<p><br />
<b>1</b> The Bottle is struck and the defending team fails to catch both the bottle and the Frisbee.</p>
<p><b>2</b> The Fris-Nok disc strikes the post and the defending team fails to catch the bottle. In the case of a post hit, it is not necessary to catch the disc.</p>
<p><b>3</b> A player accidentally knocks his/her bottle to the ground.</p>
<p><br />
<b>PLAY</b>: A coin is tossed to begin play. The team who wins the toss has the choice of end of court or first throw. Each team takes up its position behind the post in the zone it is to defend; players alternate throws A1, B1, A2, B2.</p>
<p><br />
<b>PENALTIES</b>: When throwing (serving the disc) a player must not step over the foul line. If he/she does the throw is dead. If the Fris-Nok disc strikes the ground before the foul line, the player net to throw on the receiving team is awarded an extra throw. He/she throws twice instead of once. If the receiving team fails to catch the Fris-Nok disc before it touches the ground, they must return the disc to the thrower, who is awarded an extra throw.</p>
<p><br />
Note: No penalty is assessed if the throw is unreasonably high or wide. A throw is unreasonable if neither receiver can reach the disc by extending his/her arms to full length while remaining in bounds (both feet in receiving zone).</p>
<p><br />
<b>GOALTENDING</b>: A player may not catch the Fris-Nok disc before it crosses the foul line. If he/she does, a free throw is awarded to the player who made the throw. If it is likely that the disc would have hit the Fris-Nok bottle or the Fris-Nok post, a point is awarded instead of an extra throw. A player must not touch the bottle before either the bottle of post is struck. If he/she does so, a point is awarded to the throwing team.</p>
<p><br />
The judges decision is final. If the game is not being judged, a consensus must be met between opposing teams.</p>

<p>Fris-Nok can be played in various ways. The first, and possibly most common variation, is the incorporation of alcoholic beverages. This variation usually involves the team which a point was scored against having to consume one drink. In this variation, the penalty for being scored against has a positive feedback effect, as the more points are scored, the easier it is to score. Another variation includes playing the game in shin-deep water. A plastic bottle is preferred for this variation.</p>

<p><b>R</b>etablos. Retablos are known as laminas and are intended for private and personal devotional use. They are votive paintings on rectangular sheets of tin that illustrate holy images such as Christ, the Virgin Mother, or one of the hundreds of saints. Ex-votos, which means “from a vow,” are also votive paintings on tins. However, they are different from retablos in that they artistically tell stories. These stories recall dangerous or threatening events that actually occurred. Both retablos and ex-votos are devotional paintings that can be left behind at shrines or kept at home. One can conclude that retablos and ex-votos are indications of a votive painting on some sort of sheet of tin (Durand, 9).</p>
<p>Retablos are multi-colored and spiritual forms of folklore that recall different situations in which a particular saint or religious figure is remembered. For example, if a framer needs rain for his crops he might pray for rain. After the rain comes a retablo might be created to praise thanks to San Ysidro Labrador, the patron saint of farmers. He is “venerated for good weather, agricultural issues and prosperous crops (Eddy, 1).” That figure would most likely be kept in the farmer’s house. Each time rain was needed in the future, that farmer might pray in front of that retablo (Eddy, 1).</p>
<p>An ex-voto requires certain elements in order to be considered part of the votive tradition. They are made as a way thanking the gods for protection in precarious situations. These situations could be returning a lost family pet or overcoming an illness. It is a physical way of thanking them for a miracle or an act of kindness. They must display humans physically doing something. They must include divine images, like saints or spirits. They must also have an explanation of events that occurred. The explanation must include the date and location that the event occurred (Eddy, 1). The way a retablo and ex-voto look are basically entirely up to the person designing it, as long as it contains the necessary basic elements. The most important part of the retablo is the representation of the miraculous event. That is why most artists try to using bright, vibrant colors to portray the supremacy of the event. An ex-voto is more often than not, reduced down to a smaller size. It’s usually about half the size of the original, while still maintaining its rectangular shape. The largest size was about 280 square inches. The smallest was about 18 square inches. Some of the most common sizes include; 140 square inches and 70 square inches (Durand, 9).</p>
<p>The original meaning of retablos referred to sculptures or paintings that were placed behind alters of Catholic churches. Labeling ex-votos as retablos can be traced back to the early 18th Century from a man named Robert Montenegro. He published a collection of votive paintings that was dated 1781. He was thanking Nuestra Senora de Dolores de Xaltocan for renewing the people’s health after a severe illness. On the bottom of the retablo left, he inscribed a message that read “en cuia memoria dedica a su Magestad este Retablo” [which means] in whose memory he dedicates to her Majesty this retablo (Durand, 5).”</p>
<p>Retablos are important to Mexican folk religion because they are a physical representation of holy images such as Christ, the Virgin Mother, or one of the many saints. Creating retablos or ex-votos are extraordinary ways of showing appreciation to the gods for bringing rain or helping certain crops grow. It comes from the need humans have to interact on a personal level with divine transcends. Retablos are evidentiary support for communication between the gods and humans (Wroth, 2).</p>

<p>Genelyn Pty. Ltd. is manufacturing and selling less toxic, more advanced and non-flammable embalming Fluids. Through our constant laboratory experimentation and field trials, a new range of less toxic, nonflammable, reduced hazard embalming chemicals has been developed. Extensive testing has proved beyond doubt that this New Form series is equal to, and in most cases far superior to, the 'traditional' embalming products currently available, with a much higher degree of safety! New Form series embalming products have greatly reduced fuming. A significant portion of fuming normally originates from flammable agents. Replacement of these agents results in a far more pleasant embalming environment.</p>
<p>The benefits of our new range go far beyond immediate usage. The non-flammability of our products ensures simplicity in storage and transportation. Traditional, flammable ranges of embalming product are Dangerous Goods and require Dangerous Goods declarations to be transported legally. Almost all New Form series embalming products are not considered Dangerous Goods. Flammability of embalming products is a major concern in the design of the modern embalming facility. Storage of flammable chemicals presents an immediate safety risk. The New Form series greatly reduces this risk, allowing a much larger quantity of product to be stored on-site.</p>

<p>Their is a limited amount of controversy that exsists surrounding the exsistance of homosexuality in the Star Trek universe. Much of the debate surronds fan speculation of characters that may have exhibited such qualities.

<p>Ink Pen is a newspaper comic strip that premiered in November of 2005 and is syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate.</p>
<p>By creator Phil Dunlap, a Tufts graduate and Massachusetts native, Ink Pen focuses on a cartoon employment agency owned by Fritz the Dog. His only employee (if you don't count the drumming frog, Flippy) is former child star Bixby the Rat (fka Li'l Bixby Buzz, the Cutest Mouse That Ever Was). The regular clients include Captain Victorious (fka as Captain Victory until the Jack Kirby estate contacted Dunlap) a chain-smoking, martini drinking dysfunctional super hero; Ralston the Rabbit, Hamhock the Pig and Mr. Negato (Capt. Victorious' arch enemy).</p>
<p>The art is reminiscent of Marvel and DC and the ensemble cast harkens to Bloom County and Doonesbury.</p>
<p>See samples at www.ucomics.com/inkpen. Early clients include the Atlanta Journal Constitution and the Detroit Free Press.</p>

<p>Memphre is a sea serpent said to inhabit Lac Memphremagog in Southeastern Quebec, Canada. Sightings of Memphre go as far back as the 1800s, when Native Canadians began telling local settlers of a snake-like monster which guarded the lake. Sightings have continued right into the 2000s, and every summer locals and tourists alike see the sometimes snake-like, sometimes whale-like monster with a horse or goat shaped head.</p>
<p>Memphre has been researched most by Quebec historian Jacques Boisvert. Boisvert began researching the rumoured creature decades ago, and explored the lake through countless scuba diving expeditions, which included famous oceanographers such as Jacques Cousteau, drawn by the mystique of Memphre. Boisvert dedicated much of his time to the search for Memphre, founding "La Société Internationale de Dracontologie du Lac MemphrÉmagog," a group dedicated to studying any evidence of Memphre's existence, while documenting the numerous sightings which come each summer. The examination of evidence by this group continues today, despite Boisvert's passing in late 2005.</p>
<p>Today, Memphre exists not only as a threatening monster, but also a tourist attraction for the local town of Magog, and draws thousands of curious onlookers each year. Memphre is rumoured to live in the cavernous depths under the mountain known as Owl's Head towards the southern end of Lac Memphremagog. Memphre starred in his first television appearance in 2004, as a feature on CTV's "Creepy Canada."</p>
