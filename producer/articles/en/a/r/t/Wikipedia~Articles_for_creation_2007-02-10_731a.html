<p>When Galileo claimed he had discovered mountains of the Moon, Cremonini was one of the scholars who sternly refused to even check through the telescope, because Aristotle had definitely demonstrated it impossible.</p>
<p>His main books are:</p>

<li><i>Biatyposis naturalis Aristote Ecce philosophiÅ</i></li>
<li><i>De anima</i></li>
<li><i>De Sensibus et facultate appetitiva</i></li>

Actually these were not churchmen at all but two of Galileo's scientific rivals, the scholastic natural philosophers Cesare Cremonini and Guilio Libri, who embraced the then popular view that telescopic observations were a superfluous amendment to the complete adequacy â or so they thought â of Aristotle's physical system.</i></li>
<li>"Venetischer Aristotelismus im Ende der aristotelischen Welt: Aspekte der Welt und des Denkens des Cesare Cremonini (1550-1631)"&#160;: <i>Cesare Cremonini (1550-1631) enjoys today the dubious distinction of having declined to look through Galileo's telescope because he already knew from Aristotle everything that could be known about the heavens. Galileo clearly had him in mind when drawing his portrait of Simplicio, the Aristotelian stalking horse in his two great dialogues. Yet at the time, Cremonini was considered one the greatest philosophers of the age, commanding a salary at the University of Padua double that offered to Galileo after his spectacular telescopic discoveries.</i>

<p>While many people go unnoticed, there are the several few that deserve the right of being famous. This man has done some great things, though many people are easily distracted by continueing animosties of the world. Alfredo has had many excrusiating ours of pain and suffering to allow others to continue living.</p>
<p><b>The right of passage that was truely earned</b></p>
<p>Once while meandering through farm land with a friend, they came across a ranch with llamas; which were still rare in the surrounding area. Nathan (his friend) was curious to find out the nature of the animals, at first glance they seemed to be docile and calm. As Nathen approached the llamas, they were spooked and some started to attack him, this is where Alfredo first had his moment of heroism. As the llamas were attacking his friend, Lopez took action by running head on to the attacking llamas to scare them away from his friend. He then started to fight his way into huddled animals to pull his friend out, but only being 13 years old he didnt have enough strength. He remebered about the pocket knife that was given to him by his grandfather, which was given to him earlier that year for his birthday as a right a passage. As he started to slash with small amounts of damage to the llamas, he was able to atleast make one small window of opportunity to save his friend; with the chance that was dwindling down, he grabbed Nathen and pulled him to safety while keeping the llamas at bay. The farmer, who was alarmed by the screaming, ran to the two boys to aid. Nathen was taken to the hospitol and recovered within months, Alfredo was a hero amongst his peers for the unselfish deed.</p>
<p><b>The second run-in with fate's decision</b></p>
<p>While fate decided that Alfredo will leave his hometown of Minonk to head towards Colorado because of his father's drunking rage. At the age of 17, his father decided to move but with out the mother because of rough times. It was decided to drive towards Idaho to start a new life; ofcourse not by choice. As he is walking the woods before they camped out for the night at a park; he met a new friend named Jeremy Bryant. They both had troublesome times and they knew it right away as they found out they had more in common. While sunlight was fading fast they didn't pay attention to their surroundings and had ventured deep into the woods, they knew of warnings about animal attacks and were frightened as they were walking into a situation they will never forget. From the last situation Alfredo was in, he started to collect knives and always carried one at all times. Luckily for him he was carrying a large K-Bar knife, he would sharpen it every night as to be ready for anything. Jeremy was startled by a growl, as Alfredo was already slowly reaching his knife he new that they were into some trouble. A smaller younger bear was prowlling the area in search of food, as they two parties crossed and came to clash for survival. Alfredo was pinned down fighting the bear, Jeremy was in shock as he started to think he too will not walk away; then Jeremy was struck with courage and started throwing large rocks and branches that he could find. With the sun setting, they had limited light; a large adversary that wanted them as food; and the chance of not finding the camp site if they were to escape. With the bear tearing at Alfredo's skin and clothes, he reached for his knife and slashed the bear under its left arm slicing the skin making a huge gash. At that time Jeremy was pulled Alfredo and tried to run, they ran around 60 meters and saw light amongst the night horizon in the woods which was the camp site. They notified Park Rangers and were taken to the nearest hospitol (St. Jude) that was 35 miles north. Once Alfredo was stabilized, it took weeks to finally get him recovered to full health, but had nightmares of the night he almost lost his life.</p>
<p>Story was recovered from archives in Minonk, from family members that took care of Alfredo after the last incident, the local news paper "Minonk Talk" was the origination point of the article. Ofcourse they're skeptics, but the journeys that man went through are the same stories of unknown men doing more than a famous actor/actress being drunk while out in the town.</p>

<p>Dwight Lewis (Born October 7, 1987 in Metairie, La.-present) is a 6-foot-5, 200 lb. true freshman shooting guard known for his versatility on offense and defense at the University of Southern California from Metairie, La., near New Orleans.</p>
<p>Lewis did not begin his USC collegiate career as an impact player like fellow freshmen Taj Gibson, considered a top Pac-10 freshman of the year candidate, and Daniel Hackett, who was thrust into the starting point guard role with the untimely murder of would-be sophomore Ryan Francis and fall semester academic ineligibility of junior Gabe Pruitt, last year's second-leading scorer. Lewis was USC coach Tim Floyd's first recruiting visit; from Metairie, he continued to Baton Rouge to recruit 4A standout Francis.</p>
<p>Yet through hard work, Lewis worked his way into a regular starting role, both at home and on the road. His defense was particularly notable in a close win at Oregon, and he made key offensive contributions during the second half of the series with the Oregon schools at home at the Galen Center. Against Oregon State, his timely trey broke a tie at 29 and triggered an 11-0 run in the second half. He made another clutch three-pointer against then-No. 9 Oregon two days later at the first-half buzzer to extend the Trojans' lead.</p>
<p>Lewis is averaging 6.3 points and 2.4 rebounds in 20.5 minutes, and has 29 assists and 16 steals through 24 games, having played in every game including eight starts.</p>
<p>A La.-native, Lewis was displaced by Hurricane Katrina. He spent his senior year at Katy, Texas 5A James E. Taylor, where he led Taylor to a 23-12 mark, tied for third place in District 18 while averaging 20.8 points, 4.5 rebounds, 3.0 assists, and 2.0 steals per game.</p>
<p>He had a bigger impact on his hometown high school, Metairie Archbishop Rummel. Lewis holds Rummel records for career points (1,820) and single-season points (960). He set his career mark in just three years at Rummel. He led Rummel to a 26-12 record his junior year, when he set the season mark, averaging 27.5 points, 9.7 rebounds and 4.5 assists a game. He earned a first-team All-State selection by The New Orleans Times-Picayune, and was named a 2005 Parade All-American. He was one of only six underclassmen to make the prestigious list that year. Current Los Angeles Laker Andrew Bynum, UCLA guard Darren Collison, and Trojan signee O.J. Mayo, who was only a sophomore at the time.</p>
<p>Lewis gave an oral commitment to Kansas twice, but renegged to sign with USC and Floyd. He was also interested in LSU because of its proximity to his hometown, but LSU chose not to pursue him following his seemingly wishy-washy behavior. There was speculation that he wanted to follow his Amateur Athletic Union summer circuit teammate DJ Augustin to Texas, but it proved untrue. Lewis' stock had dropped, however, after a subpar showing on the Houston Westside All-Stars and New Orleans Jazz while battling the after-effects of mononucleosis; he fell from No. 84 overall to No. 132 on Rivals.com. Still, he was ranked No. 44 at his position by Rivals.com and a Scout.com three-star recruit. He also had offers from Baylor, Miami, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas A&amp;M. Florida, Illinois, and Wake Forest had been in the mix early.</p>
<p>Lewis is one of a group of core Floyd-recruited freshmen at USC that have spurred the resurgence of the men's basketball program, which after knocking off Oregon for the season sweep, broke into the AP rankings for the second time in 2007, the first time since 2002, with a No. 19 ranking and reached the ESPN/USA Today coaches poll ranks at No. 21 for the first time since 2002 as well.</p>

<p>History</p>
<p>The âDeta Beast Crewâ is a group of talented, young individuals who are gradually making their way up through the hip hop scene in Ireland. The rap group came together in March 2006 through the influence of the current lead rapper Gianni Kapele AKA âMurkaâ. Gianni who is from Congo had some relations in the hip hop game, O-Shot Crew (which is French based); he split from the crew in early 2006 and decided to journey to Ireland. While experiencing the âsouth sideâ life in club scenery, he was approached by fellow crew rapper Michael Nelson AKA âM.I.K.Eâ. Michael introduced Gianni to his network of friends, âSouth side boysâ. While drinking and partying one night Gianni started free styling and showed his friends his talent and ambition for rap. Later on that week he was introduced to DJ Cross AKA Mario who was bent upon making shows to give Waterford (Co. Waterford, Ireland) a âBlackâ experienceâ¦ Cross announced an up-coming show, which was to take place at the end of the week (24th March, 2006). As Gianni practiced, the other boys were eager to join in and also agreed to rap at the show two days prior. With little time to rehearse this is where the element of free style, uncoordinated rap became involved. Deta Beast has accomplished many dreams and aspirations. But overall they are credited for transforming a group of âLocal thugsâ to a hardcore rap group! Most likely to bring a new face (Change) to hip hop world wide.</p>

<p>Wolmerâs is not only the oldest school in <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamaica.html" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> but also in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Indies_8d74.html" title="West Indies">West Indies</a> having been founded on May 21, 1729. This was at the request of John Wolmer, a Kingston goldsmith, who made his last will and testament by which he left the bulk of his estate for the foundation of a free school in the parish in which he should happened to die. The sum of the legacy was 2,360 pounds sterling.</p>
<p>The law which established the Wolmerâs school made no distinction in respect of colour, class or creed of the students, nor was there discrimination between boys and girls. In 1782, we have a record of 64 boys and 15 girls on roll. The staff consisted of a Chief Master, a writing master and accountant, a teacher of mathematics and a teacher of the French and Spanish languages.</p>
<p>The Wolmerâs school was originally situated in downtown Kingston at what is still known as the Wolmerâs yard, now a parking lot and vendorsâ arcade beside the Kingston Parish Church. In 1896, the schools were separated and independent heads appointed for the Boysâ and Girlsâ schools. After 1907 earthquake, when most of the school buildings were destroyed, the schools were moved to its present site north of Race Course or what is now the National Heroes Park.</p>
<p>In 1941, at the instigation of Miss Skempton, the then headmistress of Wolmerâs Girls, the Preparatory school was established to âfeedâ the girlsâ school. It opened its doors in the area which now houses the canteen and art room with six little girls.</p>

<p><b>Wayne State University Press</b> is a distinctive urban publisher committed to supporting its parent institutionâs core research, teaching, and service mission by generating high quality scholarly and general interest books of global importance. Through its publishing program, the Press disseminates research, advances education, and serves the local community while expanding the international reputation of the Press and the University.</p>
<p>Wayne State University Press is an established mid-sized university press that publishes approximately forty new books and six journals per year, making it the largest publisher in the city of Detroit. The Press is located on the main campus of Wayne State University in downtown Detroit, MI. and had been publishing books since 1941.</p>
<p>WSU Press has a staff of professional book marketers, editors, and designers who are passionate about disseminating great scholarship. We know how to shape and refine books, and we understand the business of bookmaking and bookselling. The press shares the knowledge of its staff with WSU students through its internship program, and it provides would-be publishing professionals a place to learn and work by hiring student assistants. The Pressâs relationships with other university units such as the library system and its book club and the Childrenâs Bridge initiative foster a university-wide scholarly communication system.</p>
<p>University presses publish academics who would not otherwise get published and who would not otherwise receive tenure.

<p>Godahl, Minnesota is a very small country town, 15 miles north of St. James. The population is aproximently 10.</p>
<p>Godahl was founded by Alexander Knudson-Godahl. He came from Norway in the 19th century. When he arrived in Minnesota, he dropped his last name (Godahl) and gave it to the small town.</p>
<p>The small town consisted of two gas stations, a baseball field, recreational center, creamery, and a store. Today, there is still the recreational center, baseball field, and the store. In 2005, the creamery was torn down. The store is still running, though it's not very busy. At the Godahl Store, almost everymorning you'll find the local farmers having a donut and a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Godahl is mostly known for it's celebration, however. This celebration is called "Godahl Days". There is a parade, great food, bingo, entertainment, peewee baseball, and small games.</p>

<p>Morgan Dirk Flinchum (April 1988- ) At the ripe age of 17 Morgan Finchum has already snatched the 2006 Pan-American Junior Karate Championship Title for the 70 kg division in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles. He fought four mathces for the title with the last going into overtime and it looked like all hope was lost but Morgan re-established his obvious dominance over his wealkling opponent and won with a reverse punch. Morgan also took a medal home from a championship in Hungary, ask him, it's true. He is a 2nd degree blackbelt and staff instructor at Florida Karate Academy in Vero Beach; he's getting real paid. Morgan has been karate-ing since 1996 and when asked about future Olympics possiblilities he said, "I've got to start training". Florida Karate Academy made a champion out of Morgan Flinchum, what do you think that means they'd be able to do for you? That's right... champion...</p>

<p>The Granite spire is a faction in the county of Nicolshire in the kingdom of Praelia. To many it is just a joke. To those that fight in it it their duty. All except for a few treacherous dogs named Patrick Bailey, Christopher DeFazio, Alex Hammonds and Brian Henson. These four men have conspired against The granite spire and plotted its downfall. The leader of The Granite Spire is a man named Fank Friedl. But at Nicolshire he is known as Stephen Kelly. Stephen Kelley is a man who, although very skilled in combat, has few followers. Thus the end of the granite spire had begun before it was even conceived. To have a faction you must have a considerable amount of gold, the dukes blessing, papers signed and must be able to field at least six men every time Nicolshire meets. Stephen Kelly has eight men but only a couple regularly show up including Stephen Kelly.</p>

<p>71.204.117.233 has gigantic fangs. Some people might call him "Obnoxious." THe Ben CHestler has an abnormal head which its 3 times a normal humans size. His gaping mouth shall never close and he ussually dazes off into the state of reverie every so often. SOmepeople might think his theoriews are wrong, but he is actually more intellectual then the the teacher him or herself. The Ben could bitw off your arm in a mouthful. His short non mobile arms fly wearily into the air and has no control. HEs movements are like a man that can't walk. When he doesn't understand the nonintellegent teach he starts spazzing out. He puts his fingers on this head and rubbs them in a mismorizing way.</p>

<p>Benjamin Thomas was born on January 29, 1990 to his happy parents Lafonda and Steven Thomas. One of the most notable track stars in Pennsylvania State history began his career his freshman year in high school while attending the prestigious Spring Grove Senior High in Spring Grove PA, a local town outside the city of York, PA. Thomas has made it to state and even the national level of high school track finals during his high school career. Running the 5k, Thomas has won two district titles as well as a national and state silver medal. He has also had a small stint on the local swimming team only to be plagued by a rogue pebble that caused him to wreck his car while driving to a meet. Since that accident in 2006, Ben has retired from swimming to due an eye injury suffered from the car accident that caused him to have color blindness. Ben has been noted as a great track star but is also a great humanitarian. Having a black mother and a white father was difficult for Thomas but he used his family history to create awareness for multiracial families. Thomas holds offivce as class president and was voted second most likeable person in school. He remains the sole possessor of the key to the town to Spring Grove given to him by local Spring Grove Mayor Albert K. Barnsworth for his civil service awareness acts for the town.</p>

<p>The M47 airsoft shotgun is a spring replica of a sawed off shotgun. This airsoft gun comes in four different types of handle variations; pistol grip, adjustable stock(similar to that of an M4 Carbine), full stock, and sawed-off stock. The gun is made of primarily black plastic although it does have some metal parts including the two lead weights inside the tube, and in the handles. If you are a beginner or even more experienced person with airsoft this is an affordable primary gun that is also very powerful. There are many companies that make this gun but some of the versions are less reliable than others. Three of the big airsoft names behind the production of this gun are Double Eagle (a less reliable but more affordable version), CYMA, and probably the most reliable company to make the M47 is UTG. Here are some of the stats of an m47</p>
<p>Operation:Spring Muzzle Velocity: 270 w/ .2g bbs Effective range: 100-130 ft Weight: 4 lbs Mag Capacity: 20 rounds, and 180 with the high capacity wind up mag</p>
<p>NOTE: If you buy this gun do not remove the orange tip, it's illegal in some states due to its likeness to a real gun</p>

<p>A magnet is an object whose molecules are ordered. You might think that increasing a magnet's temperature would increase the magnets strength because increasing an object's temperature makes its molecules be more active and move faster, which in many other phenomena increasing power, but when dealing with the magnet's organized molecules, when the molecules move faster and less methodically, it decreases the amount of order with the molecules, therefore, because a magnet's power is built around the order of the molecules, decreasing the magnet's power. If you increase a magnet's temperature high enough the magnet will demagnetize and lose all magnetic properties. If you return the magnet's temperature to room temperature, the magnet will regain its magnetic properties, as long as it has not been severely damaged by the intense heat. However, decreasing a magnet's temperature does not increase a magnet's power because the molecules of a magnet are already perfectly ordered, you cannot make them even more organized.</p>

<p>The .416 is a new sniper round produced by the company Barrett. It will be released in the upcoming year. Since it is smaller then the .50 BMG round and larger then the standard 7.62 NATO round, it can reach similar distances as of the .50 with a punch stronger than the 7.62 round. Since it has less surface area than the .50 BMG it can travel at a higher super-sonic speed with less drag. The increased super-sonic speed also depends on the new gunpowder developed by Barrett.</p>

<p>Ki Kta Cha Lo Wan Un, a Lakotan name meaning "When Awake, He Sings" was born, May 19, 1940, in Pittsburgh PA to a part Lakotan Father and a Czech American mother. At birth, his name was not registered by the State of PA because of a bureaucratic refusal to allow "unusual" or "frivolous" names. At age 12, his mother finally registered the name "William Foss Baker." Ki Kta Cha Lo Wan Un showed an early interest in music and became a symphonic Tuba and Bass Viol player in different orchestras around the San Diego, CA, area and the Vancouver, BC, Canada, area. His recent CD, Ki Kta Cha Lo Wan Un Plays Native American Flute is in its second pressing. It has world-wide circulation: Africa, Austral Asia, Middle East, Europe, North and South America. His music is all self-composed and original and evocative.</p>

<p>Introduction:Advent Peter is an excepetional piece of writing made by a person named Dennis Nguyen. This work is very exceptional because Dennis Nguyen is a 7th grader that is only 13 years old. There is no one up to date that can create a work of literature at the age of 13. It was created On October 17, 2006 and was ended on February 7, 2007. The creator, Dennis Nguyen, is currently working on the 2nd book. This is a visual literature book known as a comic book. It is about 5 friends who try to restore order to the world and they endure hardships from other friends as well as their own hearts. Characters: Dennis L Nguyen: This is one of the main characters of the book. He is gifted with extraordinary powers that includes an eye that can copy other techniques of his enemies. He was trained by the King of Mice when he was young and is very powerful. His best friends are Peter, Brooke, Steven, and Sean. He is one of the Advent Peter squad. Peter Nguyen: He is the leader of the Advent Peter squad and was also trained byt he King of Mice with Dennis when he was young.He possesses an eye that can allow him to copy other techniques and see in 360 degrees around him. He is the most powerful Advent Peter squad member. Steven Ninh: He is a football fanatic and can do special powers that involve footballs. But he is a great friend and will fight to save his friend's life at any moment. He has not yet been shown any extraordinary powers as of yet, but will be shown in the next book Sean Nguyen: He is the key to the power of the world. He has a demon eye that can transform him into a demon. If his demon powers get out of control, he will turn into a full-demon sean that can take over the world. Morgan Bilbruck: She is part of the group called Red Dawn that was originally evil and tried to take over the world, but the encounter with full-demon sean and her bring forced with the Advent Peter squad made her change her beliefs.

<p>One of my sources is from the hit Japanese movies "Advent Children" from Final Fantasy VII. Another source is from Naruto from Masashi Kishimoto. Seeing I am 13 years old, I cannot have many sources, but I hope you take this page into consideration because I am the creator, and i submitted this page. It has taken a lot of time and I assure you I did create a comic book.</p>

It is my job to negotiate solutions satisfactorily. My expertise has allowed me to develop an empathy with my clients and to achieve the ultimate result.â</p>
<p>Having grown up in South Africa and then spent several years in Portugal Leonard has developed an instinctive appreciation for the diversity of inner Melbourne communities and housing styles.</p>
<p>All spare time is spent at the beach where Leonard likes to relax and unwind. Most weekday mornings youâll find Leonard at the gym, which helps balance â family, health and property.</p>
<p><b>Pain and Charity:</b><br />
Leonard knows first hand about the pain of birth deformity as he was born without reproductive organs. Several operations have resulted in disaster, further complicating his tragic situation. Leonard remains hopeful "You have to think positive. You can't beat yourself up about what you can and cannot do, especially if it is not your fault." Leonard devotes much of his time putting back into the community, particularly working with disadvantaged Aboriginal and Afghani children. "I like to help the disadvantaged and for me it is more than just sacrifice, it is what I love. I can only hope that through my pain I can find the strength to keep helping others overcome theirs" Leonard has won several community based awards such as the milligan's cross and recieved commendations from many city councils.<br /></p>
<p><b>Humble</b><br />
Leonard remains humble and chooses not to acknowledge his achievments. He chooses not to higlight his nobility, even going to the extent of almost denying it to most people who ask him. "I'm just a normal person" he says.<br /></p>
<p><b>Controversy:</b><br />
One incident remains set to muddy up Leonard's credibility. A child at a Fitzroy centre Leonard volunteers for, Mogl an Afghani refugee who has been in the country 3 years claims Leonard struck him one play time. Unfortunately Mogl lost most of his hearing in a landmine explosion just outside his village near Kandahar, which also kileld his father and sister. Leonard remains hopeful, proclaiming his innocence "I only patted Mogl on the shoulder and explained the consequences of not paying attention and respecting the commanders".</p>

<p>Dental Amalgam Panics have erupted frequently since the early 1800's and are caused be a fear of amalgams, which contain mercury, as a dental filling. Belief in the safety of amalgams started officially in 1859 with the formation of the American Dental Assocation, and today over 90% of practising USA dentists are ADA members. ADA bylaws, designed to prevent further panics, currently state that any dentist who advises the removal of amalgam fillings for health reasons is unethical and can be expelled from the ADA. Only a minority of dentists have ever been publicly opposed to the use of amalgam in dental fillings for these reasons. When the ADA reversed itself in 1983 and said mercury leaks out of fillings, this eventually led to widespread panic culminating in 1990 with the 60 Minutes Television investigative report "Is There Poison In Your Mouth". Millions of Americans and patients worldwide rushed to dental offices demanding to have silver amalgam fillings removed. In order the quell the panic, the ADA introduced the following bylaw:</p>
<p>5.A.1. DENTAL AMALGAM AND OTHER RESTORATIVE MATERIALS. Based on current scientific data, the ADA has determined that the removal of amalgam restorations from the non-allergic patient for the alleged purpose of removing toxic substances from the body, when such treatment is performed solely at the recommendation or suggestion of the dentist, is improper and unethical. The same principle of veracity applies to the dentistâs recommendation concerning the removal of any dental restorative material.</p>
<p>This large panic subsided by 1992 and any dentists who continued to remove amalgam for health reasons were expelled. The belief that amalgam fillings are safe, first publicly announced by the ADA in 1859, pre-dates the discovery of bacteria in 1863. The discovery of bacteria is considered to be the formal start of modern medicine, and hence the ADA's belief in the safety of amalgam pre-dates modern medicine itself. All of the science of the past 150 years has not changed the ADA's belief, regardless of whether the science is pro or anti-amalgam in nature. and many panics have resulted. The ADA is adamant that amalgam is safe, even though in September 2006 an independent panel of experts convened by the Food and Drug Administration voted 13:7 to not endorse amalgam as safe/unsafe. The panel stated there are too many unanswered questions about amalgam, and was also mindful of the panic that had happened in 1990. A small panic has started again because of this finding.</p>
<p>There are many people who claim to see health improvements from removing dental amalgam, and alternative dental assocations like the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology (IAOMT) have formed out of the belief that amalgam is unsafe. For these patients and dentists, seeing is believing and the results of amalgam removal and health improvement have been documented and presented to government agencies. The ADA calls reports of recoveries "anecdotal" and states they are causing panic.</p>
<p>The current state of Dental Amalgam Panic is that the ADA believes it is safe, the FDA panel of experts voted 13:7 that they cannot say it is either safe or unsafe, and the IAOMT says it is unsafe. The American Medical Assocation has no official position on the safety of amalgam fillings. The Food and Drug Administration has never tested amalgam for safety, but has a webpage which says that amalgam fillings are safe "except for a small minority of patients who are allergic". The amalgam panics will continue, historians have divided the controversy into 3 "Amalgam Wars", covering the 150 years of the widespread use of this material.</p>

<p>the Spheroidizing of steel is any process of heating and cooling that produces a rounded or globular form. High-carbon steels are spheroidized to improve their machinability especially in continuous cutting operations such as performed by lathes and screw machines. In low-carbon steels, spheroidizing may be used to meet certain strength requirements before subsequent heat-treatment. Spheroidizing also tends to increase resistance to abrasion.</p>

General Jizzle was born Ajay Nair on the 3rd of April 1991 in the heart of East London. He was the youngest child of Anitha Nair and his late father Radhakrishnan Nair. The three along with his elder sister, Jaina, resided in the London borough of Newham. The family led a happy and prosperous life, even owning their own business. Tragically however Ajays dad passed away in the summer of 99, leaving his 8 year old son behind. Seven years on, the family has moved on, Jaina has recently got married and Anitha has remarried. Jizzle began writing at the tender age of just 12. He was heavily influenced by UK garage and hip hop, although you can hear Indian influences in his music due to his Indian heritage, his love for music developed at an early stage in his life. "I remember watching top of the pops every Friday. I was the only one in my class who did!". Jizzle was fascinated by music. Around the same time he started writing, he started to learn how to play the drums, in time his musical ability and poetic skill excelled to another level. By the time he reached year 9 he was involved in almost every type of instrumental lesson, he learnt how to play guitar, bass and piano, this is how he got into the production side of music. He attended after school music classes for most of the week for 2-3 hours, his dedication and will to learn has got him where he is today. He's an MC, songwriter and producer, all at the age of 15. All of his accomplishments were not handed to him on a plate, he worked hard to establish himself as an artist, "being an Asian MC is hard, people hate".</p>

<p>Auckland has been a populous city of New Zealand for a while. It was established in the 1840s. By 1843, 3,000 people lived in Auckland, depending on the port that it was. By about the 1860s, Aucklands population had more that quadrupled.</p>

<p>Tourism is very popular in Auckland today. Most people go there to see the beautiful sights, and to stay at the port. There are many hotels all across the city, as well as shops and entertainment&#160;:)</p>

<p>The name Rechtman itself is also a source of dispute. The immediate association is Austrian or German. Indeed, begining in 1667 King Casimir of Poland gave the city of Suwalk to the Catholic order of the Kamadulan, Jews from Austria and Germany emigrated to the area. Most were merchants who were limited in their choice of vocations. The name Rechtman can be itself translated in several ways. First, the straight-forward translation means Righteous man, a man of good deeds. This might have been the name the family adopted circa 1807 when the Napoleonic Code was adopted in East Prussia(or earlier in more eastern parts of Europe). As the Rechtmans were evidently considerably well off at that time, and as the wealth of a person sometimes determined their eligibility to adopt a "nice name,â it is plausible that the family paid a higher fee to receive a legal "beautified" name that meant "Righteous," rather then a mundane title dictated by their vocation, such as Fisherman or Baum. The practice of paying for a new last name was presumably common at that time.</p>

<p>Dana Ewell</p>
<p>Fresno - Final Inheritance</p>
<p>To hear residents tell the story, murder doesn't happen in Fresno - at least not in the well-heeled suburbs. But the comfort of that municipal myth was shattered on Easter Sunday 1992, when the story of the Ewell family unwound into an Oedipal tragedy.</p>
<p>To their friends and neighbours, the Ewells seemed the ultimate Fresno success story. Born in the Depression, Dale Ewell joined the air force, then later took a job selling airplanes. He eventually ran his own aircraft sales company and bought several farms - assets worth almost 8 million dollars. His wife Glee was an energetic woman, whose family had made money in the oil boom before the war. Rounding out the perfect family were their children: the smart, pretty daughter Tiffany and their son, Dana. Much like his father, Dana was ambitious and competitive. But unlike his father, Dana's ambition became obsession - an obsession that would destroy his entire family.</p>
<p>On Easter Sunday 1992, Dana Ewell became a millionaire. After returning home from an Easter dinner with his girlfriend's family, Dana made several attempts to contact his family to see if they had returned home safely from their weekend trip. Tuesday, he contacted a neighbour of the Ewell's to go check on them. The neighbour found the Ewell's cleaning lady hysterical and shaking. She had found the house ransacked, and Tiffany Ewell lying in a pool of blood in the kitchen. The neighbour found Glee's and Dale's bodies, and called the police.</p>
<p>Because of the sizable family fortune, Dana Ewell was immediately considered a suspect. But he had been 100 miles away at the time of murders. However, the burglary scenario didn't sit well with the detectives. The house had been tossed, but nothing was missing. Three years passed, without any breaks in the case, until police began investigating a good school friend of Dana Ewell's, named Joel Radovich.</p>
<p>After months of surveillance and extensive ballistics study, police had enough to arrest Dana and Radovich. At the trial, prosecutors painted a picture of a young man obsessed with taking over his father's place in the world.</p>
<p>The jury was quick to convict Radovich of first-degree murder, and Dana of conspiracy to commit murder. They received mandatory life sentences, and the citizens of Fresno could perhaps rest more easily, knowing that a random killer had not been responsible for the deaths of Dale, Glee and Tiffany. The truth was much darker and harder for the community to deal with. No amount of money or social privilege could insulate anyone from murder.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_25.html" title="September 25">September 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, the area presently known as Marine Corps Air Station, Camp Pendleton, California was designated an auxiliary landing field and served as a sub-unit of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marine_Corps_Air_Station_El_Toro_ad22.html" title="Marine Corps Air Station El Toro">Marine Corps Air Station El Toro</a>. The airfield consisted of little more than a dirt runway and provided landing facilities for such aircraft as the <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beechcraft_Model_18_8fdd.html" title="Beechcraft Model 18">Beech C-45</a> and the Sikorsky <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikorsky_H-19_d02f.html" title="Sikorsky H-19">HRS-1 &amp; 2</a>. During the early 1950âs, the airfield was used for the filming of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flying_Leathernecks_6bc9.html" title="The Flying Leathernecks">The Flying Leathernecks</a> starring <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wayne_22ff.html" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a>. The first permanent squadron stationed at the airfield was formed in the late 1960âs. This became a composite squadron consisting of OV-10âs and UH-1s.</p>
<p>Through the years, aviation began to play an increasing role in Marine Corps tactics, creating a need for modern facilities. To meet this need, the auxiliary landing field was re-designated a Marine Corps Air Facility (MCAF) on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_1.html" title="September 1">September 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> serving as home to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marine_Aircraft_Group_39_3bdf.html" title="Marine Aircraft Group 39">Marine Aircraft Group 39</a> (MAG-39). Since 1978, the Group expanded to a strength of four tactical helicopter squadrons, one helicopter training squadron, one observation squadron, and an aviation logistics squadron. This increase in aircraft and personnel established once again the need for improved facilities.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_13.html" title="March 13">March 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, MCAF Pendleton was re-designated as Marine Corps Air Station effective <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>. Today, the Air Station supports over 180 helicopters assigned to MAG-39, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marine_Aircraft_Group_46_ba67.html" title="Marine Aircraft Group 46">Marine Aircraft Group 46</a> Detachment A, and a wide variety of other Marine Corps units and visiting aircraft from other branches of the Armed Forces. The closure of <a href="../../../m/c/a/MCAS_Tustin_e518.html" title="MCAS Tustin">MCAS Tustin</a> and <a href="../../../m/c/a/MCAS_El_Toro_a944.html" title="MCAS El Toro">MCAS El Toro</a> were a result of <a href="../../../b/a/s/Base_Realignment_and_Closure_08f4.html" title="Base Realignment and Closure">Base Realignment and Closure</a> legislation which saw MCAS Camp Pendleton expand its facilities again to support three additional helicopter squadrons. The first medium lift helicopter squadron joined MAG-39 in January 1999, and the final one came in June of that same year.</p>

<p>â Dhillonism was created by Mehtaab Dhillon, a student at Briar Woods High School in 2006. First beganing with a question of what religion he was, Dhillon asked himself why he must fit someone else's category. He then created Dhillonism as a way of saying he believed in his own philosophies.</p>
<p>As Dhillonism grew in popularity, Dhillon along with his disciple Trent Reed expanded the definition. Being a Dhillonist meant attempting to follow what you believe in without outside influence dictating your thoughts. This intails questioning the set norm (including tradition and new trends), authority that is assumed to be right, and everything that is taken for granted to be true. Dhillonists in no way have to believe the philosophies and ideas of Mehtaab Dhillon himself.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-02-10_731a.html" title="Edit section: Saltwater and Freshwater Sport Fishing in Pakistan">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Saltwater and Freshwater Sport Fishing in Pakistan</span></h2>
<p>Hidden away in the northernmost tip of the Arabian Sea lies one of the worlds last few undiscovered angling destinations.</p>
<p>In the South, Pakistan's vast coastline is even today; largely unexplored and sport anglers have only scratched the surface of this pristine sea. Saltwater game fishing in Pakistan has developed in its own unique way over the last 20 years in terms of tackle, techniques and boats. A century old Pakistani boatbuilding and seafaring tradition, with the new generation of conservation minded anglers, technology and tackle has combined to make angling in Pakistan a truly unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>The variety of saltwater gamefish is astounding and may favourably be compared to Australia or New Zealand. In fact Pakistan has just beaten Australia's record of Talang Queenfish (16.5kg) to become the world record holding country for this species. The snubnose pompano world record has also been broken in Pakistan. Two world records in as many years! The unique feature of our offshore fisheries are the sheer number of species of potential world record size that can be regularly caught. Cobia and narrowbarred mackeral are two species of note which are on the verge of being broken in Pakistan. Cobia of near world record size are caught each year in Pakistan and the record has unofficially been broken a few times. The same applies for narrow barred mackeral (or tanguige as it is known in Australia), with the Pakistan record falling mere pounds below the current world record. A glance at the list of species available to the saltwater angler makes one relaize why comparisons may be made to the great Australian and New Zealand fisheries. All three marlin species plus swordfish, yellowfin, bigeye, dogtooth, longtail and a host of the smaller tuna species abound. Mako, hammerheads, tiger, bull, lemon, and white sharks also feature prominently. Offshore waters are also full of the mandatory dorado. In addition to this the near shore waters hold cobia, tanguige, groupers, amberjack, snappers, rainbow runners, barracuda, and four species of trevally (including GTS) to complete all the requirements of a world class fishery. All this in the tiny secton of our extensive coastline where sportfishing activities are currently being conducted.</p>
<p>As one travels north from the coastline the terrain changes to extensive mangroves and saltwater estuaries. Barramundi, giant threadfin salmon, red and black drum, mangrove snappers, flathead and a host of other inshore species abound here and reports of massive barramundi and threadfin salmon are commonplace. The saltwater environment then gives way to Pakistanâs fantastic floodplains, and finally into freshwater lakes and rivers. The extend of flora and fauna in this region is now becomes apparent as this region is one of the worlds seven major migration routes for waterfowl. Thus, heavily fertilized, world famous lakes and dams such as Keenjhar lake, Haleji lake, Ranwal dam, Hab dam, Tarbela dam and a host of others provide exciting freshwater game fish. Topping the quarry list are the mighty mahseer, elusive snakeheads, numerous large catfish species and of course many carp species. These provide the course angler and freshwater plug caster with all the action he can possibly ask for.</p>
<p>The floodplains are finally interrupted in the extreme north of Pakistan where the mighty stretches of the Karakoram and Hindukush mountains boast thousands of streams and lakes. Here lies some of the worldâs most exciting wild trout and Mahseer action. Given the remoteness of the best of the hot spots freshwater fishing in Pakistan is an adventure that involves not only world class fishing, it guaranteeâs to âtake your breath awayâ. Itâs a time portal, which grants every angler the opportunity to once again revisit his real reason he started fishing.</p>
<p>However these unique and relatively un-exploited destinations do not exist without their setbacks. Without any active regulatory body, sport fishing in Pakistan is rapidly becoming a meat collection race, with no bag limits, undefined seasons and no concept of catch and release. Fishing continues without a thought for sustenance, no thought for the future.</p>
<p>In order to preserve the essence of sport fishing and ensure development, not degradation, it is pivotal that we, the anglers, develop and practice ethical parameters within which we conduct our sport.</p>

<p>The Indus river and its tributaries are the lifeline of Pakistan. Running from the highest mountain ranges in the world in the Himalayas down to the vast Arabian sea. Along the course of this mighty river lies some of the most exciting freswater angling in the world - both course and game angling.</p>
<p>AS the glacier laden mountains give way to the blistering subcontinent heat, the months from may to september provide one of the best brown trout fisheries in the world. Loch Leven trout, the eggs of which were brought over in ships more than a century ago have thrived in northern Pakistan's rich rivers and deep, crystal clear lakes. Here the story of brown trout is much the same as that of the rainbow trout in New Zealand. Often compared to Chile and Germany in terms of the average size of the brown trout caught, the difference lies in the altitude and scenery one an angler casts his fly in. The Himalayas are the tallest mountains in the world and flyfishing against such a backdrop is truly an experience to remember. While rivers provide lighter tackle fun, the hidden lakes are the true treasure. Wild stock, brilliantly coloured, and in fantastic sizes are waiting to be fought. Reports of 5 to 10lb fish are commonplace and a confirmed 18lb brownie has been caught! Rainbow trout in Pakistan are restricted to farms and have somehow not adapted to our local waters. This is perhaps just as well. Just about all fishing is done with spinners and the trout are completely unaware of flies. This makes flyfishing in Pakistan one of the last true frontiers in the gameanglers "must fish" list of locations.</p>
<p>Saltwater fly fishing is still virgin territory in Pakistan. It is safe to say that gamefish have hardly ever seen a fly and are simply waiting for an adventurous angler to try his hand at this pinnacle of sportsfishing. All the sought after saltwater fly fishing gamefish are present in our waters. Giant trevally, barracuda, mackerel, cobia, tuna, milkfish, bonefish, barramundi, threadfin salmon and a host of others are available in the various inshore and offshore fisheries. So the gamefish are there, waiting for those up to the challenge for catch the first official saltwater gamefish on the fly. Who will take up the challenge?</p>

<p>FIDC stands for <i>Fundo de Investimento em Direitos CreditÃ³rios</i> in Portuguese. This financial instrument is wideley used in Brazilian credit markets and has been traded frequently by international investors and hedge funds. A FIDC is a type of fund composed of receivables (<i>direitos creditÃ³rios</i>) from different types of issuers. Mostly Brazilian banks lend to individuals or companies, pack these receivables in the format of a FDIC fund and sell to the public. Many of these funds are created with assets with tranches, where the bank keeps the equity tranche, or the first defaults, and thus the credit rating of the FIDC is better than that of the original loan. The majority of FIDC in the market today come from loans to public and private pension beneficiaries (guaranteed by the pension plans), real estate receivables and not so often credit card receivables.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-02-10_731a.html" title="Edit section: Syko-G">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Syko-G</span></h2>
<p>Informally known as âThe Godfather of Electronicaâ, Syko-G is a DJ Producer based in the Kuala Lumpur city of Malaysia.</p>
<p>Warning: This artiste has a robust profile that dates back to the good old days. It makes a fascinating read, and covers the Malaysian music industries advances into dance music. So get comfortable, and be ready to take a journey through timeâ¦. a walk in the life of Syko-G:</p>
<p>By the late 90âs Syko-G was backed by 10 years of DJ experience. He claimed 2nd prize in the DJ Open Competition 1994 held at Beetlenut, Kuala Lumpur. A competition organized in search of the top 3 DJs in Malaysia.</p>
<p>After winning that competition, he was presented the opportunity to work in a remix studio called Infinity Music Workstation. He then got into producing under the watchful eye of Mr. Ronnie Lim, a respectable producer who took it upon himself to mentor Syko-G.</p>
<p>A fast learner, Syko-G worked hard to open his very own first studio called Cut Cre8 Audio Station. He ventured into songwriting, producing and remixing local artists of all genres. Even Tamil! He produced the first Non-Stop Tamil Megamix album in 1995 that sold 250,000 copies nation wide and sold in Singapore, India and Canada too. He went on to produce Joe of 4U2C. Syko-G wrote the music and lyrics to Joeâs hit titled âMimpiâ. The track went on to be nominated for the AIM Music Awards in 1996.</p>
<p>On the side he made his own remixes of recordings, eventually earning assignments from record companies allowing him to pursue his hobby professionally. He has worked with bands like XPDC, Search, Headwind, Alleycats and singers like M.Nasir and more, fusing their music with electronica elements and his signature breakbeats.</p>
<p>In 1995, he started creating his own music, and formed his 1st project act called Loope. Their music was labeled industrial electronica and experimental. Finally in 1998 he started his own recording label Metaldogg Records and embarked on making his ambitious 1st album Attaque the Megaphone. His 2nd collaboration project act called Discomafia.</p>
<p>Itâs fair to say that all Malaysians ravers know what went down, at the famous Melawati Jungle Rave back in 2000. The newspaper headlines squealed âParti Liar di Atas Bukitâ, âMafia Attackâ. Such was the commotion that Discomafia made at that event! If you made it there you would have heard Discomafia recording their debut album, âAttaque the Megaphoneâ -under Metaldogg Records. Discomafia performed the ground breaking set for German superstar DJ Sven Vath at the jungle event.</p>
<p>The album reached the top charts in Malaysia. Track No. 1 Looking Forâ¦ rose to claim 2nd place in the Malaysian Top Ten Charts 2001. The act was also voted #3 by Urban Malaysiaâs TOP 30 in Tone Magazine.</p>
<p>âwhile they might not exactly be household names,you can bet theyâde be on a short list to produce Madonnaâs next albumâ, Razali Rasheed, TONE Magazine on Discomafia.</p>
<p>Playing almost all over Malaysia, Discomafia was famous for their live acts and hard beats. Discomafia shook the nation with their different idea on how music can be expressed through grooveboxes, mixers, samplers and other gadgets and devices.</p>
<p>When the POKOMM organizers received and listened to Attaque the Magaphone , they invited Discomafia to KÃ¶ln to perform on the main stage and represent Malaysia. The POPKOMM Music Festival is the worldâs largest music conference in Europe and is an annual event. Itâs a place where people in the music business come together once a year to exchange ideas, promote new types of music and even exchange technology. From KÃ¶ln Discomafia moved on to perform in Berlin, and then Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Back from Europe geared up with fresh ideas, Syko-G reconfigured himself for a new appearance in December 2001, started a concept recording label called Rolling Eye Recordsâ¦ and embarked on a new solo journeyâ¦. as Syko-G. âthe experiment continuesâ says Syko-G. Major music maker Roland Â© played an important role in keeping Syko-G at the cutting edge with their fantastic digital toys. In 2001 Roland Â© officially endorsed him exclusively under the electronic Groove Gear section, making him the formal Roland Â© electronica ambassador throughout South East Asia. Yamaha Â© and Korg Â© were also supporting his projects and music; as he had earned the title: Malaysiaâs Electronic Music Pioneer.</p>
<p>By this time Syko-G was well known for his LIVE electronic music performances, and his technical rider comprising of the latest hi- tech electronic music gear.</p>
<p>In 2002 Syko-G opened a new outlet under Rolling Eye Records, called Groove Syndicate â The DJ Workstation. Says Syko-G âGroove Syndicate is the first DJ school in Malaysia to cater to all the DJs needs and dreams from A to Zâ¦ from learning how to be a DJ, to producing your own tracks, right up to cutting it onto vinyl and releasing it under Rolling Eye Recordsâ</p>
<p>Syko-G feels that the young generation has a lot to offer and we should not waste the talent. âAchieving your dream is the best thing you can do for yourselfâ he said.</p>
<p>In 2003 Syko-G founded the monthly Enter Electronica Parties, where music combines with the latest technology. Rolling Eye Records has created a platform for Malaysiaâs electronic music producers to showcase their music creations live on stage. The objective of the parties is to educate and introduce new music technology to party- goers, producers, electronic music fans, audio/ music students and the general public; as well as to encourage and support home producers in their electronic music career.</p>
<p>His future plans is simple: to make it internationally. He wants to take Rolling Eye Records and the Groove Syndicate members to an international level. He feels that anything is possible if you put your heart, mind and soul to it. Watch out for his debut solo act album coming soon. Look out for it in stores near you because this G is syko!</p>
<p>Music</p>
<p>Syko G's "type" of music has been described as a crossbreed of breakbeats, electronica and of course Syko G's favorite ethnic tribal sounds. In describing his music Syko G states that " I'm definitely more into the deep dark sound. I enjoy playing the groovy breakbeats, funky progressive and breaks - but nothing too clean".</p>
<p>Syko G catches many people off guard with his massive beats and soothing rhythms throughout his captivating 1 hour set. It surprised everyone who thought that dance music couldn't be clever, challenging and musically astute. He wants to make music that will last... something that isn't disposable, something that people will want to listen to over and over again.</p>

<p>Tyler Randall Sizemore was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1989. His parents are Larry and Patricia Sizemore. Patricia sometimes goes by Patti for short. Patti and Larry were struggling potato farmers. In the year 1997 a devastating drought hit their farm and forced them to move to the United States. Once here, they both had tough times in finding work to feed Tyler and his brother Derek. Tyler had one dream in life. This one dream was to become a major league pitcher for the New York Yankees. In his childhood, he could never afford a baseball glove, let alone a ball to throw. His first job was to sweep the floors of a disgustingly rich fat slob who paid him mere pennies. It took him the first 10 years of his life to earn enough money to buy a baseball to pitch with. Once he got to highschool he tried out for the varsity team but was cut by his coach. However once the coach heard about Tyler's upcoming he decided to keep him on the team as a back up whose main job was bat boy. In the first game of the year Tyler was still soar about not starting but things changed fast in a hurry. Both starting pitchers ahead of him got injured in warmups so Tyler got the start. This was the happiest moment in his life. Tyler proceeded to pitch a perfect game against the number one ranked team in the state. Since they were playing the number one team in the state there were many MLB scouts there, one of which was a New York Yankee. The scout liked his stuff so much he went right up to Tyler after the game and gave him a contract to pitch for them after he finished high school. Sadly though Tyler's baseball career tradgically ended when a car hit his arm and broke it. Today Tyler resides in Spring Grove, PA as a local weatherman.</p>

<p>Born in 1874 (Turin, Italy) and died in 1935 (Dijon, France). Jacques Theodore SACONNEY was a French Army General (4 stars), a scientific and a military balloonist. He foresaw the future developments of the French military air force and was an innovative scientific. He mainly contributed in the development of the modern meteorology and in the creation of the French military and civil aviation.</p>

<p>His family, having its roots from Saconnex (Switzerland) immigrated to France in the XVI century escaping the Protestant revolution. His forefathers first moved in Lyon where a few members of his family left some traces including Henri de Saconey (1396-1445), who was sent to the Concile of Constance in 1414.</p>

<p>and Gabriel de Saconnay, who denounced the protestant reformation. Jean Calvin wrote a response to his attacks âCongratulations to the Venerable Presbyter, Lord Gabriel of Saconay, Precentor of the Church at Lyon for the Beautiful and Elegant Preface that He Wrote for the Book of the King of England"</p>

<p>Then Saconneyâs family settled in Burgundy where they cultivated wine in Gevrey. During the XIXth century, Jacques Theodoreâs grandfather became prosperous in the hotel industry. In fact, he followed the construction of the train between Dijon and Turin, and he ended up earning many estates in Turin, Italy, in Dijon and Aix-les-Bains, France.</p>

<p>Jacques Theodore SACONNEY was educated at the prestigious High School Henry IV in Paris, France, and was admitted at âlâEcole Polytechniqueâ, Paris, in 1895.</p>
<p>Officer in 1897, he was affected to the 4th regiment âdu GÃ©nieâ in Grenoble where he became a military balloonist. At first, his main interests lied in kites. In 1902, captain Saconney was successful in creating a kite system which was capable of carrying a camera that allowed the establishment of mapping. In 1909, a competition to determine the most suitable man lifting technique existent at that time was launched. the prize was won by Captain Madiot but he died shortly in a Flying accident. As Captain Madiotâs system was not fully developed, Captain Saconneyâs man lifting system was adopted by the French nascent Air force. Saconneyâs man lifting system contained a motorcar, trailer, and a winch that was driven by the carâs engine. The system was also installed aboard the ship The Edgar Quintet in 1911. In November 1912, Saconney became head of the laboratory of meteorology and aerial photography of Chalais-Meudon.</p>
<p>During the 1st World war, he was in charge of the observation of the enemy. At first, he integrated a Balloonist Company, and in August 1914, Captain Saconney took the command of the Automobile section of the balloon and kite military section which was based in Epinal, Vosges.</p>

<p>After the war Commandant Saconney became President of the Commission for the Application of Meteorology to Aerial Navigation, which later became the International Commission for Aeronautical Meteorology. This Commission provided guidance and coordination to international aeronautical meteorology. This Commission was part of the International Meteorological Organization (IMO), the predecessor of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which was established in 1919. At that time, he was reckoned to be the finest specialist in his field.</p>
<p>Then he was in charge of organising the French civil aviation. Between 1919 and 1922, Colonel Saconney was the director of the civil aviation. In a report from the National Advisory Committee for aeronautics, entitled âcommercial aviation in Franceâ (1922), it was said that the first step of the creation of the commercial aviation in France was realised by Colonel Saconney. The report states that between 1919 to 1922, the French commercial aviation acquired its first experience and its supremacy by setting permanent air routes between Paris-London, Paris-Brussels, Paris-Strasbourg-Prague-Warsaw, Paris-Geneva, Bordeaux-Toulouse-Montpellier, Nimes-Marseilles, Toulouse-Casablanca, Bayonne-Bilbao.</p>
<p>In 1922, he rejoined the army. Became member of the Council of the French Air Force and went up in grades.</p>
<p>Saconney died in Dijon the 14 July 1935.</p>

<p>Frederike Goose (born 1985 in Bremen, Germany) is a well known German pornographic actress. She has appeared in such amateur films as "Freddy gets Fingered", "The White Ghost", "Me, Myself and Gcobai" (her first african feature) and most recently "The Rodfather" where she appeared alongside fiance Dayle Von Streeten (born 1980 in Algoa Park, South Africa).</p>
<p>With Von Streeten she has opened a string of brothels and a sex club known as "Double Trouble" where she and Von Streeten welcome guests. Von Streeten is known for his preferences of young males whilst Goose likes her males old and hairy (a fetish that can be seen in many of her movies).</p>
<p>There are plans in the pipeline for a 50 man gang-bang series in which her and South African born Von Streeten are planning on an attempt to become the first bisexual couple to fornicate with 50 men in each of Europe's major cities.</p>
<p>Although unknown in the mainstream "Rike" as she is known plans to launch a website and set up her own production company with her fiance.</p>
<p>The two see their work as art more than pornography although this has been disputed by stoic pornographers. Their work has been kept underground as they call it and they are hoping to bring their brand of "couple vs the gang" styled pornography into the mainstream.</p>
<p>Von Streeten has claimed to have slept with over 500 men and over 200 woman during his career and personal life whilst Goose has chosen not to disclose her exact number however the estimate is the number is well into the later hundreds perhaps early thousands.</p>
<p>At one stage there was a fear of chlamydia spreading around the sex club the two owned where Von Streeten was blamed for bringing the disease from Africa where he is known to dabble in unprotected sex amgost the local native population, Von Streeten however has strongly refuted these claims citing over-zealous competitors with ulterior motives for spreading the apparent false rumours.</p>
<p>Whether you love them or hate them the "gruesome twosome" as they are known in the underground swinging community are here to stay and with their new production company and live website showing off their sexual exploits set to open in early 2009 we could be hearing alot more from the two.</p>

<p>AKA... Dail Ernheart</p>
<p>Lillian Yua (666BCE-present) was born in the sparkling metropolis that was Pittsburgh before the arrival of the English colonists. She is known for her victories against the Aztecs in Italy and the imperial reformation that overtook Southeast Asia in the 33<sup>rd</sup> century ACE.</p>

<p>Being born into an affluent family, Lillian Yua was a person doted with numerous opportunities and offers of positions of power within the city-state of New Antartica. However, Ms. Yua did not feel content with the frivolous quandaries that overtook her homeland and decided to travel the world looking for a cute and furry animal to hug. Upon arriving at the shores of Cuba, she was revered as a deity by the natives, and these swore fealty until the end of times to her. This event sparked a deep thought within her mind: "Why take only one cute and furry animal when I can have them all?". Thus began the Panda Empire of New Africa.</p>

<p>Later on, Lillian proceeded on to Europe, where she met the hostile and barbaric Aztec people whom she conquered with the aid of suicide donkeys, the staple unit in her infantry and took all their furry animals at the Battle of Montreal. She proceeded to Turkey where she had some turkey and moved onto Ehiopia where she found some cute cheetahs to complement her rabbits, minks, foxes, deer and kitties. Being displeased with her lack of furry cuteness after hearing a rumor of a specimen called a bear, she decided to head south onto Russia, where she trained a bear to fly and be her buddy. He would be called Bobolicus. She kept pushing onwards, taking the Panda stronghold of Hong Kong, taking them as their pets, using their name for her Empire's, and making the city her capital. Her most recent campaign has been the invasion of Western Oregon, where she took Paris Hilton captive and forced her to scrub her palace's floors until she stops being a skank.</p>

<p>Currently, Ms. Yua finds herself within her Palace of the Red Panda off the shores of Hong Kong where she basks in animal cuteness. however, given her patterns, is soon expected to go looking for more furry animals throughout the world. She has designated an armada to attack the Moon in the near future, under the command of the Earl of Texas, Richard Schell.</p>

<p><b>Who Stole the Half-Life Source Code?</b></p>
<p><br />
Arrests have been made in several countries stemming from the October 2003 theft of computer source code for a Half-Life 2, a much-anticipated sequel to the popular computer game Half-Life.</p>
<p>Tips from an online gaming community led to the arrests after an eight-month investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation into the theft, according to a statement released this week by Valve of Bellevue, Washington, which makes the game.</p>
<p>"Within a few days of the announcement of the break-in, the online gaming community had tracked down those involved," says Gabe Newell, Valve's chief executive officer, in a statement. "It was extraordinary to watch how quickly and how cleverly gamers were able to unravel what are traditionally unsolvable problems for law enforcement related to this kind of cybercrime."</p>
<p>Valve did not reveal details about the arrests and referred questions to the FBI's Northwest Cyber Crime Task Force. The FBI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p><b>Game Details</b></p>
<p>Half-Life is a popular computer game in which players take on the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist at the fictional Black Mesa Federal Research Facility. After an experiment goes awry, a doorway into another dimension is accidentally opened and Freeman is called on to rescue the facility from a horde of unearthly beasts.</p>
<p>Originally released in November 1998, Half-Life won awards from computer game aficionados and the gaming press and spawned a popular online version, Counter-Strike, that allows multiple players to compete against each other on the Internet.</p>
<p>The sequel to the original game, Half-Life 2, was scheduled for release in September 2003, but then delayed under mysterious circumstances. The company has still not set a date for the release of the game.</p>
<p><b>Hackers Attack?</b></p>
<p>While few details of the theft have emerged since October, Newell said at the time that the source code was stolen in September by hackers who systematically compromised the company's computer systems by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft's Outlook e-mail client on Newell's computer, installing key stroke capture software to acquire passwords and other security credentials, then stealing a copy of the Half-Life 2 source code.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed reports last month suggested that a Unknown man recently charged with creating a ubiquitous Trojan horse program named "Agobot" or "Phatbot" may have been behind the Valve code theft as well.</p>

<p>Krotch the Sasquatch is a cartoon created in 2004. Offered as tee shirts and other collectables, The Adventures of Krotch the Sasquatch became popular for its tongue in cheek double entendre humor. The series begins with a buxom young park ranger named Kelly who spots a pair of large footprints and follows them to find Krotch. The cartoon has been called campy for its use of subtle offensiveness and simple artwork. It has been compaired to the Big Johnson tee shirt line for its similar sexual based humor.</p>

<p>On August 25, 2003, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule to reduce hazardous air emissions from miscellaneous organic chemical manufacturing facilities . The final rule requires facilities to install emissions controls known as "maximum achievable control technology" or MACT for process vents, storage tanks, equipment leaks, wastewater systems, and transfer operations at facilities covered by this rule. The rule also includes provisions that allow industry to comply through an alternative, pollution prevention-based standard. The alternative standard requires significant reductions in the amounts of toxic air pollutants used during the manufacturing process. The rule allows facilities to focus on improving processes by reducing solvent use. The final rule will remove 16,800 tons per year of air toxics. The annualized cost of this rule is estimates by USEPA to be approximately $75 million.</p>
<p><b>BACKGROUND</b> The Clean Air Act requires EPA to identify industrial categories that emit one or more of the 188 toxic air pollutants listed in the Act. For major sources within each source category, the Act requires USEPA to develop standards that restrict emissions to levels consistent with the lowest emitting plants. Major sources are those sources that emit 10 tons per year or more of a single air toxic or 25 tons per year or more of a combination of air toxics. The "Miscellaneous Organic Chemical Manufacturing" MON source category covers 22 categories on EPA's initial list of source categories. It includes source categories generally known as miscellaneous chemical production and polymers and resins. Chlorinated paraffin production, rubber chemical production, polyester resin production and alkyd resin production are examples of processes covered by this rule.</p>
<p><b>Final Ammendments</b> In response to petitions and the resulting Court of Appealsâ ruling, the USEPA proposed amendments to the MON MACT on December 8, 2005. These amendments were finalized in the Federal Register on July 14, 2006, and are designed to reduce the burden associated with demonstrating compliance without impacting emissions control or the enforcement agenciesâ ability to ensure compliance, as well as to clarify questions, correct errors, and respond to the Courtâs ruling. With these changes, the USEPA has extended the compliance deadlines for existing MON sources (operational as of November 10, 2003) as follows:</p>
<p>November 10, 2007: Pre-Compliance Report due May 10, 2008: Final compliance date October 7, 2008: Notification of Compliance Status Report due</p>
<p><b>MORE INFORMATION</b> For further information about the proposal, contact Randy McDonald of EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards at (919) 541-5402. EPA's Office of Air and Radiation's homepage on the internet contains a wide range of information on the air toxics program, as well as many other air pollution programs and issues.

<p>Joe Monks' (c.1923âDecember 6, 2006) was an influential Hindu cleric and leader of The Van Buren Boys. He was assassinated by Lebanese forces in 2006.</p>
<p>Monks was born in the town of Zoeville in the Sesame District of Wales, and studied in a religious school in Kathmandu, Nepal. He was seen by many as the leading voice of the radical Hindu movement.</p>
<p>In 1991, The Van Buren Boys chose Monks as its secretary-general. Monks was seen as a moderate, relative to others in the organization, replacing hard-liner Sheikh Ali Kenneth bin-Rabb al-Hyeah. Monks was notorious for his trademark wrestling utilized during his interrogations; Monks was known to spear suspects with his extra-terrestrial head, which was the size of 15 1/2 football fields. Monks' head was actually made an emergency landing strip for 747s for the Van Buren Boys.</p>
<p>On December 6, 2006, Chinese helicopters attacked a motorcade in southern Wales, killing Monks, his wife, son, and a bunny. China said the attack had been planned as an assassination attempt. A group called "Sesame Street" carried out the Big Bird Bombings in retaliation for Monks' death. Unfortunately, the bomb did not detonate, but released 5 megatons of yellow feathers, instead.</p>

<p>Wolmerâs is not only the oldest school in <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamaica.html" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> but also in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Indies_8d74.html" title="West Indies">West Indies</a> having been founded on May 21, 1729. This was at the request of John Wolmer, a Kingston goldsmith, who made his last will and testament by which he left the bulk of his estate for the foundation of a free school in the parish in which he should happened to die. The sum of the legacy was 2,360 pounds sterling.</p>
<p>The law which established the Wolmerâs school made no distinction in respect of colour, class or creed of the students, nor was there discrimination between boys and girls. In 1782, we have a record of 64 boys and 15 girls on roll. The staff consisted of a Chief Master, a writing master and accountant, a teacher of mathematics and a teacher of the French and Spanish languages.</p>
<p>The Wolmerâs school was originally situated in downtown Kingston at what is still known as the Wolmerâs yard, now a parking lot and vendorsâ arcade beside the Kingston Parish Church. In 1896, the schools were separated and independent heads appointed for the Boysâ and Girlsâ schools. After 1907 earthquake, when most of the school buildings were destroyed, the schools were moved to its present site north of Race Course or what is now the National Heroes Park.</p>
<p>In 1941, at the instigation of Miss Skempton, the then headmistress of Wolmerâs Girls, the Preparatory school was established to âfeedâ the girlsâ school. It opened its doors in the area which now houses the canteen and art room with six little girls.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-02-10_731a.html" title="Edit section: Prospective on Teresa of Avila">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Prospective on Teresa of Avila</span></h2>
<p><b>Teresa of Avila (1515-1582)</b> was known as a mystic during the sixteenth-century. During this time, the Catholic Church was standing firm against Luther and other Protestant believers. In this effort, The Council of Trent, which was made up of Catholic Church leaders from all over Europe, came together to strengthen their foundational beliefs. At this time, the Catholic Church took on a renewed strength that ignited passion in people such as Teresa. Teresa felt the need to run off to become a nun although her father was against it. She was determined to use her newfound passion for Catholicism in her efforts to bring about reform for women. She did this by assisting in the opening of new convents that would further promote the faith and passion of the Catholic Church. Teresa was deeply devoted to God and spent her lifetime trying to serve Him through prayer, work, and obedience.</p>
<p>Teresa most likely gained her recognition through a book she wrote called, The Way of Perfection. It was a mystical writing that brought about the title of âDoctor of the Churchâ for Teresa. In essence, it was a book of prayers. It was well received by the Pope and deemed worthy of studying. Another one of Teresaâs writings was called, The Interior Castle. She wrote this book after being inspired by a Carmelite Friar, also known as John of the Cross.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, Teresa served God in the Carmelite Order and St. Josephâs Convent. All throughout her life, she remained focused on her calling to a lifetime of service, and was a great example to all women, Spain, and the world.</p>
<p><br />
<b>The Council of Trent</b> (1545-1563) was made up of Catholic Monarchs. As leaders, they gather in Trent, Italy to discuss all religious questions. During the Catholic Reformation, leaders had been working to reform such things as abuses, indulgences, and bring new insights into textual criticism. Therefore, this council would meet periodically to bring about reform in order to build a stronger church. Of all the issues the Council had to address the most pressing would be the theological debate between the Catholic Church and the Protestants. There were debates over things such as those being dead being able to help the living prayer someone into salvation. Other important issues for the Catholic Church were their position on the Virgin Mary, purgatory, and indulgences to free a soul. It was during this time, those in the Catholic faith, started to renew their passion for the church and express their faith even more. Teresa of Avila was one of those people who decided to be heard.</p>
<p><b>The Early Years for Teresa</b> were spent in indecision over becoming a nun. Teresa realized that she could possibly find her destination being hell because of her lifestyle and she did not want to suffer this fate. This helped in her decision to become a nun but is was also due to her sickness that she decided her life had to change. She suffered from heart problems and fainting spells. This led Teresa to being passionate about making a difference for her and others. Teresa was 21 years olds when she entered her first convent. At that time convents were more open about visitors, and dress codes. If your family supported you, which Teresaâs did after her father came around, a nun was able to have a private room, wear jewelry, and nice clothes. Over time, Teresa became very ill to the point of paralysis, which took many years to recover from. During that time, she also lost her father. At 40 years of age and having dealt with all of those things that brought Teresa to the realization that she, along with a handful of nuns, needed to distant themselves from frivolous things. She sought a place where they could live a life without luxury. This would be a place of prayer, study, and helping the poor. This is the Teresa of Avila who at a young age became passionate about her faith.</p>

<p><b>Teresa of Avila</b> (1515-1582) was known as a mystic during the sixteenth-century. During this time, the Catholic Church was standing firm against Luther and other Protestant believers. In this effort, <b>The Council of Trent</b>, which was made up of Catholic Church leaders from all over Europe, came together to strengthen their foundational beliefs. At this time, the Catholic Church took on a renewed strength that ignited passion in people such as Teresa. Teresa felt the need to run off to become a nun although her father was against it. She was determined to use her newfound passion for Catholicism in her efforts to bring about reform for women. She did this by assisting in the opening of new convents that would further promote the faith and passion of the Catholic Church. Teresa was deeply devoted to God and spent her lifetime trying to serve Him through prayer, work, and obedience.</p>
<p>Teresa most likely gained her recognition through a book she wrote called, The Way of Perfection. It was a mystical writing that brought about the title of âDoctor of the Churchâ for Teresa. In essence, it was a book of prayers. It was well received by the Pope and deemed worthy of studying. Another one of Teresaâs writings was called, The Interior Castle. She wrote this book after being inspired by a Carmelite Friar, also known as John of the Cross.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, Teresa served God in the Carmelite Order and St. Josephâs Convent. All throughout her life, she remained focused on her calling to a lifetime of service, and was a great example to all women, Spain, and the world.</p>
<p><br />
<b>The Council of Trent</b> (1545-1563) was made up of Catholic Monarchs. As leaders, they gather in Trent, Italy to discuss all religious questions. During the Catholic Reformation, leaders had been working to reform such things as abuses, indulgences, and bring new insights into textual criticism. Therefore, this council would meet periodically to bring about reform in order to build a stronger church. Of all the issues the Council had to address the most pressing would be the theological debate between the Catholic Church and the Protestants. There were debates over things such as those being dead being able to help the living prayer someone into salvation. Other important issues for the Catholic Church were their position on the Virgin Mary, purgatory, and indulgences to free a soul. It was during this time, those in the Catholic faith, started to renew their passion for the church and express their faith even more. Teresa of Avila was one of those people who decided to be heard.</p>
<p>The Early Years for Teresa were spent in indecision over becoming a nun. Teresa realized that she could possibly find her destination being hell because of her lifestyle and she did not want to suffer this fate. This helped in her decision to become a nun but is was also due to her sickness that she decided her life had to change. She suffered from heart problems and fainting spells. This led Teresa to being passionate about making a difference for her and others. Teresa was 21 years olds when she entered her first convent. At that time convents were more open about visitors, and dress codes. If your family supported you, which Teresaâs did after her father came around, a nun was able to have a private room, wear jewelry, and nice clothes. Over time, Teresa became very ill to the point of paralysis, which took many years to recover from. During that time, she also lost her father. At 40 years of age and having dealt with all of those things that brought Teresa to the realization that she, along with a handful of nuns, needed to distant themselves from frivolous things. She sought a place where they could live a life without luxury. This would be a place of prayer, study, and helping the poor.

<p>An <b>OHLC bar chart</b> is a type of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar-chart.html" title="Bar-chart">bar-chart</a> typically used to illustrate price movements of an financial instrument over time. Each bar on the chart represents the price movement in one unit of time, e.g. one day or one hour. OHLC stands for Open, High, Low, Close, referring to the opening price (e.g. for a daily bar chart this would be the starting price for that day), the highest price reached during that time, the lowest price reached, and finally the closing price for that time period.</p>
<p>The Japanese <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candlestick_chart.html" title="Candlestick chart">candlestick chart</a> is simply another way of visualizing an OHLC bar chart. Both charts show the exact same data, i.e. the opening, high, low, and closing prices during a particular time frame. Some traders find the candlestick chart easier to read.</p>

<p>Research Process Automation (RPA) is the automation of tasks in the research and writing lifecycle. This automation is typically accomplished through the use of information technology and can encompass many types of tools including <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagiarism.html" title="Plagiarism">plagiarism</a> detection, <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engines.html" title="Search engines">search engines</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_encyclopedia.html" title="Internet encyclopedia">internet encyclopedia</a>, <a href="../../../e/-/l/E-Learning_2cb8.html" title="E-Learning">e-Learning</a> software, research <a href="../../../d/a/t/Databases.html" title="Databases">databases</a> (such as those provided by <a href="../../../e/b/s/EBSCO_Industries_6d73.html" title="EBSCO Industries">EBSCO Industries</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/x/LexisNexis_2d15.html" title="LexisNexis">LexisNexis</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_Citation_Index_e8b6.html" title="Science Citation Index">Science Citation Index</a>), <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_processors.html" title="Word processors">word processors</a>, and <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reference_management_software.html" title="Reference management software">reference management software</a>.</p>
<p>The term was coined by James D. Beasley in 2003 while he and a colleague, Jeffery D. Reynolds, developed a software tool they called a Research Development Environment (RDE) (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031013082454/http://www.powerresearcher.com/download/PR_RPA_plagiarism-031007.pdf" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20031013082454/http://www.powerresearcher.com/download/PR_RPA_plagiarism-031007.pdf" rel="nofollow">Beasley, 2003</a>). RDE was described as an âintegrated, multi-function software that enables or facilitates the creation of research work productsâ across the research process phases âeducation, research, writing, citation, submission, review, and publicationâ (<a href="http://www.jiscpas.ac.uk/2004abstract_3.php?s=8" class="external text" title="http://www.jiscpas.ac.uk/2004abstract_3.php?s=8" rel="nofollow">Beasley, 2004</a>). An RDE has similarities to an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Integrated_Development_Environment_6edd.html" title="Integrated Development Environment">Integrated Development Environment</a> (IDE) used in software development.</p>
<p>Benefits from RPA and RDE tools may include increased productivity, enhanced focus on higher-level tasks such as concept development and critical analysis (as opposed to repetitive, administrative tasks), and easier communication and sharing of information between research team members or students and their instructors. Another key anticipated benefit is the reduction of internet plagiarism. This was described in Beasleyâs paper entitled âThe Impact of Technology on Plagiarism Prevention and Detection: Research Process Automation - A New Approach for Preventionâ.</p>
<p>A similar approach to combating plagiarism is used by Peter Vamplew and Julian Dermoudy of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Tasmania_5084.html" title="University of Tasmania">University of Tasmania</a> with their Anti-Plagiarism Editor (APE) and Gorilla audit software combination. This is a two-tiered approach which âmonitors the studentâs actions during the development of their submitted work, and one which audits the work after its submissionâ (<a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1082435" class="external text" title="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1082435" rel="nofollow">Vamplew &amp; Dermoudy, 2005</a>).</p>
<p>This âmonitor and auditâ approach is in contrast to software tools that only attempt to detect plagiarism in submitted works. The 'post-submission' approach has several limitations and, at best, can only detect potential instances of plagiarism after they have occurred (Beasley, 2004). Most 'post-submission' approaches utilize content-matching software to detect potential plagiarism. Content-matching software, such as the popular <a href="../../../t/u/r/TurnItIn_63c4.html" title="TurnItIn">TurnItIn</a>, have several limitations including the inability to access all possible sources (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050209104502/http://webdisk.berkeley.edu/~Weinstein/Weinstein-JobMarketPaper.PDF" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20050209104502/http://webdisk.berkeley.edu/~Weinstein/Weinstein-JobMarketPaper.PDF" rel="nofollow">Weinstein &amp; Dobkin, 2002, p. 26</a>) particularly 'deep web' sources in password protected, limited access, databases. Accurate detection of plagiarism is particularly problematic in technical content where similar words are expected to be more prevalent (Huges, Brown, Jakobson, Phipot, Dwight-Moore, Jarret, Grainger and Short, 2002).</p>
<p>The approaches described by Beasley and Vamplew &amp; Dermoudy indicate that a more effective, preventative, path to plagiarism reduction can be realized by applying RPA and using RDE software.</p>
<p>Some of the types of functionality described in this article can be found in the APE/Gorilla software and Thomson ResearchSoftâs <a href="http://www.endnote.com/eninfo.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.endnote.com/eninfo.asp" rel="nofollow">EndnoteÂ®</a> product.</p>

<p>'The Breakfast Monkey' was a cartoon created by Gerard Way, now the vocalist for My Chemical Romance. He tried to sell it to Cartoon Network in 2001, but it was turned down as it was too similar to Aqua Teen Hunger Force, already in production.</p>
<p>The Breakfast Monkey is a magical flying monkey with a red beret and white coat, who tries to make everybody eat breakfast. In the cartoon 'Cruising For Crazy' there is a quote written next to him in one particular scene, saying 'Breakfast is important and tasty!' The storyline of 'Cruising For Crazy' is that a Spanish Wrestler visits the Breakfast Monkey's cafe, and asks for grilled cheese. The Monkey then tries to make him have similar things, but with a breakfast theme, such as Omlette and toast or French toast and buttered sugar. The wresler gets angry, and starts destroying the city. And that is when The Breakfast Monkey meets Crazy Boy and Tinkle Fish. With their help, he wins over the wrestler and spreads breakfast to the world.</p>
<p>Gerard Way made this cartoon with Joe Boyle and Barb Nash. This was because he aspired to be a comic book artist, after graduating with a bachelor of fine arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York City. That was in 1999.</p>

<p>The Country Mile is a New Hampshire State Agency Liquor and Convenience store on NH Route 31 in Greenville, NH. It is the only gasoline station in the town of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenville%2C_NH_52b4.html" title="Greenville, NH">Greenville, NH</a> and has had numerous community events such as the Country Mile Customer Appreciation Day. It has been in operation since the 1970's and has brought much business and reputation to the small town it resides in. People from <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> often come for the tax-free lower prices on products such as cigarettes and alcohol which are highly-priced and taxed in MA. It provides things that otherwise, people would have to travel out of town to obtain. It is what puts the small town on the map.</p>

<p>In 1787 Matthew Lock was changing his lodgings to be more conveniently located nearer his work when he was accused of stealing from his landlord.

<p>The December of 1792 saw the departure of the Govenor, Captain <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Phillip_b5da.html" title="Arthur Phillip">Arthur Phillip</a>, back to England. His replacement, Captain <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hunter_%28New_South_Wales%29_90bd.html" title="John Hunter (New South Wales)">John Hunter</a>, would not arrive until 1795 during which time the colony was run by Lieutenant-Governor, Major <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Grose_%28Lieutenant-Governor%29_b809.html" title="Francis Grose (Lieutenant-Governor)">Francis Grose</a>. Within a year of taking up the post Grose had placed settlers on the banks of the Hawkesbury River, among which was Matthew Lock. With the settlers firmly established on their farms Grose made out grants of 30 acres in the district of Mulgrave Place. The first twenty of these grants were registered on 3 November 1794, and two, eight days later on 11 November. Lock received a grant of 30 acres at Mulgrave Place on 19 November 1794, which lay isolated on the left bank below <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windsor%2C_New_South_Wales_e189.html" title="Windsor, New South Wales">Green Hills</a>. Close by lay the farm of John Cobcroft and a little downstream that of Thomas Reibey. On 22 July 1795 a grant of 30 acres was given to John Francis Molloy, a bush doctor who trained under Thomas Arndell, for the land lying between the farms of Matthew Lock and Thomas Reibey.</p>

<p>Two years after Lock arrived in the colony came the arrival of the convict transportation ship, <i>Pitt</i>, carrying 410 convicts of which 58 were women. Among the 58 women on board was 19 year old <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> native Eupham Graham. Not long in the colony, Eupham settled with Matthew Lock and although they never married they lived as man and wife. on 2 June 1794, while living on the banks of the Hawkesbury River, Eupham gave birth to twins Thomas Graham and Elizabeth Graham. The following year saw the birth of a daughter, Mary Graham, on 16 September 1795. The children always went by their mother's surname due to the fact their parents weren't married. Two years later, on 27 April 1797, Eupham Graham died at the age of 25 leaving twins Thomas and Elizabeth, aged 2 years 10 months, and daughter Mary, aged 1 year 7 months, without a mother. The problem of raising the children was short lived when on 17 July 1797, less than 3 months after the death of Eupham, Matthew Lock married Alice Burrows at St John's Church in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parramatta%2C_New_South_Wales_dab2.html" title="Parramatta, New South Wales">Parramatta</a>.

<p>By 1802 Matthew Lock was the privileged owner of a horse and had received a further land grant of 50 acres at Mulgrave Place on Robinson's Lagoon. In 1803 he aided his good friend Constable Andrew Thompson in the round up of 15 Irish escapees from <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castle_Hill%2C_New_South_Wales_b537.html" title="Castle Hill, New South Wales">Castle Hill</a>.
