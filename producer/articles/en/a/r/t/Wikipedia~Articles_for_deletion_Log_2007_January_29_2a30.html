<dd>Sure it does. Articles are frequently deleted in part or in whole because they are unreferenced. The fact that it <i>might</i> be verifiable simply means that it will be easier to recreate the article properly at a later time.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I know some folks don't care for the use of the word "cruft" in discussing articles to delete, bu this is cruft. A list of various superhero franchises by how long, if all filmed components of the franchise were run start to finish, it would last. Thoroughly unencyclopedic, and any bits of data that might actually be useful (like the number of episodes in a series) should be included in the articles on the series themselves. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:06, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - 'Cruft' is not a wikipedia policy, nor is the fact that a single editor finds the information useless a reason to delete. Certain readers may well find it interesting and informative to compare the depth of several canons. (After all, why is number of episodes so clearly more useful? Long 1 hour per episode series cannot be compared to a series consisting of 10 minute shorts. From internet downloading to buying dvds, and given multi-episode arcs, episode number has little meaning after original broadcast, whereas total length does.) The info is verifiable, and besides, has passed AfD before (see first nom on the scifi listing). Nothing has changed to warrant reopening that decision.--<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFangz_eec0.html" title="User:Fangz">Fangz</a> 01:08, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The nomination for the scifi one is mis-linked on that article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is an indiscriminate collection of information without coverage in independant sources. The BBC article mentioned several times above talks about Doctor Who as the "longest running" such series, but they are <i>not</i> talking about cumulative run time.

<li>As further comment, there doesn't seem to be any real criteria for what material is counted toward these "total running lengths". While the disinclusion of Corman's 1994 ashcan <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fantastic_Four_%28film%29_5900.html" title="The Fantastic Four (film)">Fantastic Four</a> is perhaps justifiable, the Superman listing is missing substantial material, including any of the animated material (the 17 <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_%281940s_cartoons%29.html" title="Superman (1940s cartoons)">Fleischer cartoons</a>, the 68 <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Adventures_of_Superman_%28TV_series%29_6332.html" title="The New Adventures of Superman (TV series)">New Adventures of Superman</a>, the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_%281988_TV_series%29_6aa7.html" title="Superman (1988 TV series)">1988 series</a> or the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Superman%7E_The_Animated_Series_7a6c.html" title="Superman: The Animated Series">1996 series</a>) as well as the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_%28serial%29.html" title="Superman (serial)">1948</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atom_Man_vs._Superman_1fb1.html" title="Atom Man vs. Superman">1950</a> serials or the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_and_the_Mole_Men_967b.html" title="Superman and the Mole Men">first theatrical feature</a>. As further evidence of the difficulties involved with actually computing running time, that first theatrical release was re-cut as the pilot for the first TV series, which is counted. Should the movie be counted separately? The Batman material suffers from similar arbitrary standards of inclusion (missing, for example, the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legends_of_the_Superheroes_dca8.html" title="Legends of the Superheroes">Hanna-Barbera live-action specials</a>, the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%28serial%29.html" title="Batman (serial)">1943</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_and_Robin_%28serial%29_1831.html" title="Batman and Robin (serial)">1949</a> serials and several animated runs). <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 11:40, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>However</b>, this isn't something that I can fix by editing. The problem is that I can see no way to come up with a total runtime number without resorting to original research. So many of these sources exist in versions with different lengths, that an effort to list all the possible totals would itself approach article length for some of these franchises. Let's look at Superman. <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_and_the_Mole_Men_967b.html" title="Superman and the Mole Men">Superman and the Mole Men</a></i> had a 58 minute runtime. It was recut and retitled into two 26 minute TV episodes. Do we count 58 minutes, 52 minutes, or 110 minutes? The <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_%281978_film%29.html" title="Superman (1978 film)">1978 film</a> had a 143 minute theatrical release, a 188 minute International Edit, a 182 minute ABC television broadcast, a 151 minute DVD cut, and a 127 minute VHS/Laserdisk compressed version. Then there is <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_II_cbf4.html" title="Superman II">Superman II</a></i>. Do we add 127 minutes for the original release, 151 minutes for the television premiere, 144 for the ABC recut of the television premiere, 116 minutes for the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Superman_II%7E_The_Richard_Donner_Cut_0e82.html" title="Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut">2006 official studio recut</a>, or some combination of those values. Now our total -- from just three movies! -- might be 295, 301, 306, 311, 312, 317, 319, 322, 323, 325, 328, 329, 330, 336, 339, 345, 346, 347, 350, 352, 353, 354, 356, 360, 361, 362, 364, 367, 369, 373, 377, 378, 380, 381, 384, 385, 388, 390, 391, 397, 404, 405, 408, 412, 414, 419, 425, 436, 442, 443, 449, or more if we count the Donner cut as a separate movie from the Lester film. When we add the 68 6-minute <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Adventures_of_Superman_%28TV_series%29_6332.html" title="The New Adventures of Superman (TV series)">New Adventures of Superman</a></i>, do we just add 408 minutes?. They were not broadcast as standalone programs. 36 of them bookended <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adventures_of_Superboy_5267.html" title="The Adventures of Superboy">The Adventures of Superboy</a></i> short in the <i>New Adventures of Superman</i> program, while the rest were broadcast along with non-Superman material in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Superman_Aquaman_Hour_of_Adventure_46bc.html" title="The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure">The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Batman_Superman_Hour_a87c.html" title="The Batman/Superman Hour">The Batman/Superman Hour</a></i>. Does the entire runtime of these programs count? If not, do the Superboy shorts from the first season count as Superman content anyway? What about material that includes Superman alongside other characters? <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Friends_75d8.html" title="Super Friends">Super Friends</a></i>? <i>Nearly every</i> franchise has this problem. Without a means to reconcile it, I cannot envision a way to assemble these articles in compliance with WP policy. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 06:23, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Seems fixable to me. I would include either the longest length or the length of the most widely available version, or the original version, or all three, depending on the circumstances. If I was unsure, I'd bring it up on the talk page, or just include it all with the proper annotations. You do not, however, total two presentations of the same material just with different cuts. It should only be included once in the total, even if you can get different totals depending on what cuts you use to create the sum. The same with your questions about the Superman animated material. If you're not sure it should be included, bring it up on the talk page, get the consensus of other editors as to the proper presentation of the information. To me, your arguments make for a good reason to present this information in the fullest and most complete manner possible, not a reason for deletion. Sure, you can get different numbers, but you can get different numbers talking about casualties of war, or the costs of natural disasters. Or even the census. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:51, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>BTW, I felt I should add that your concerns are also going to apply to the articles of the material in question anyway. There is no doubt in my mind that articles on movies/tv shows should include run time information. This is information that's included on the box of the movie/television show. Yet there will be problems like you mention in the article itself. Thus your concern also applies there, and since it will have be resolved for those articles, I don't see it as a particular problem for this article either. Might be difficult at times, depending on the circumstances, but it can be done. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

It refers only to specific classes of information that have already received consensus among editors to discriminate against inclusion. Statistical lists, however, are not currently included under that section of policy.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Now, that being said, I do have some concerns about the list possibly having arbitrary inclusion criteria, since it says it includes "popular" shows and films. It seems likely that there are numerous other shows that <i>should</i> be included, but aren't (eg where are all the Spiderman shows? Flash?). Not to mention that I'm not sure why the list is focussed narrowly on superheroes to begin with. Why superheros and not "sci-fi/fantasy"?</dd>
<dd>I'm also concerned about upkeep of this list. It seems to me this information is only useful if it can be kept current. But the current list is only as of May 26, 2006. So it appears that noone is updating the list, and even if someone <i>does</i> update it that's no guarantee editors will keep updating it over and over regularly every week (as would be necessary to keep the information accurate.</dd>
<dd>So even if you assume the information might be <i>useful</i>, it looks like the list has somewhat arbitrary rules for inclusion, is oddly framed as just a list for superheros, and can only be kept useful by constant, regular editorial updates. Sounds to me like a recipe for problems - I unfortunately recommend deletion. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:41, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Just to reply to Josiah and Otto -</dd>
<dd>Otto, sorry we aren't seeing eye to eye since, if I recall correctly, we usually go the same way on afd/cfd. Guess we can't agree all the time, eh? Either way, feel free to post your comments on the WP:NOT talk page where there are a couple of discussion threads on the topic of just how broadly to interpret WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE. I've made similar arguments there that I did here, and it is an interesting policy topic in general beyond just this article.</dd>
<dd>Josiah, normally I'd agree that it's better to improve an article than delete it. However, my concern is that this particular type of article is only useful if it is intentionally and regularly updated. "Incompleteness" isn't a deletion criterion, but articles and categories do get deleted on occasion if they are determined to be too difficult to <i>properly</i> maintain or their information is determined to be inaccurate or misleading. In this case, the list in question hasn't been kept properly up to date, having sat for a year with no updates at all. I'd be more inclined to recommend Keep if I felt comfortable that the article could maintain its information in a timely and more complete fashion. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:57, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Just to put it one more way, if I thought the maintainence problem was short term and could be fixed in a reasonable amount of time, I'd be ok with the article. But my concern is that the lack of maintainence is due to a long term, systemic problem with the list that probably can't or won't be corrected. But hey, if someone can prove me wrong, go for it! <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:00, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

The fact that the superhero list hasn't been would therefore seem to be more a question of whether there are wikipedians with the interest and inclination than an intrinsic problem with this type of list. If regular updating is the concern, the superhero list should be deleted and the science fiction one kept. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 21:22, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I still believe this could be a useful collection of information, and it's not, properly speaking, an "indiscriminate" collection. It does require cleanup. It's true that the facts can be found in various other articles, but I think there may be some value to collecting them in a single place for ease of comparison. That value admittedly seems rather limited to me (hence "weak" keep), but that's just me. Serpent's Choice presents the best argument for deletion, but I feel the key points could be addressed through consensus among the list maintainers -- in fact, by defining precisely what is included and how, they'll also be making the article less "indiscriminate."

So I am discounting those arguments. However, I do have concerns about upkeep, since this list requires constant upkeep to be useful and accurate. Given that the list hasn't been updated in almost a year, I'm skeptical it will be updated as consistently as it needs to be. I'm also concerned about the list's arbitrary inclusion criteria. How do you decide which shows to include and which not to include? It seems like this list is particularly small and probably missing a number of fantasy shows. So with a seemingly arbitrary inclusion criteria and a problem with ongoing upkeep of accurate information, I'm reluctantly recommending deletion. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:56, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Killing Molly does exist as a publication. It is currently a literary property under development with a Detroit film production company called Thought Collide. The selling of 3000 copies, which is hard to verify when a press is independent, is a pass on a criteria of notability. The hurdle is selling 1000 copies of a work of art, such as a compact disk of music. I understand the difficulty of verifying all of this independently from where you are executing your wikipedia duties. Not a hoax. Nowak is a keep, and the Killing Molly article will be reposted with easier aids for verification. <a href="../../../w/m/j/User%7EWmjuntunen_a4ce.html" title="User:Wmjuntunen">Wmjuntunen</a> 01:36, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>To take these objections in turn is important.<br />
I read 1000 copies in a guideline. It's a good number; some limited editions of undoubtable notability are published in lower numbers. The guidelines you mention are proposed guidelines, as you say. Until these proposed guidelines go into effect, kindly adjudicate by the ones that are current. Any reason for the exclamation point on your no? I thought this forum is a learned, genteel discussion, with no need for yelling, 'No!'<br />
Much valuable literature is published without an ISBN or a Library of Congress call number. I wonder if Abby Hoffman's 'Steal this Book' had an ISBN number at first. Why should the Wikipedia be bound by the decision of the board that issues ISBN or Library of Congress's call numbers as a gauge of notability.<br />
The Killing Molly article failed a AfD probably because of improper writing of the article, so the book didn't fail an AfD. An article about the book failed an AfD.<br />
Saying that "Self-styled as The Bad Boy of Literature" is the saddest thing you've read on Wikipedia is an unusual statement. Many authors self-style themselves one or another monicker. Heck, one of the fine points of <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassius_Clay_89de.html" title="Cassius Clay">Cassius Clay</a> is the way he self-styled himself, especially when preparing for a prize-fight. Any one who follows publishing knows that many authors self-publish and self-promote books. The latest example is <a href="../../../e/r/a/Eragon.html" title="Eragon">Eragon</a>, which came to the attention of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Hiassen_f77e.html" title="Carl Hiassen">Carl Hiassen</a> in its self-published, self-promoted, un-ISBN-ed form.</li>

<li>Hey, I just checked Amazon. Killing Molly is there&#160;! Did you really chase down any of those ghits?<br />

<li>One of my greatest complaints about this adjudicative process is the process starts to resemble a mob far too quickly. More, it seems I've rarely found bulls wasting time participating in these put-down sessions. The article for deletion process seems to attract a bearish kind of person, most irresponsible of all those who write the argot, 'nn'.

<dd>but in the AfDs the mobbing can also work the other way--once the consensus seems to shift, people come and agree with it, though they may not have contributed much to the actual discussion. --just compare the beginning of any long AfD with the end. It would, however, not be in the traditional spirit of WP to ask that people read the article before voting. The first step might be to automatically delete the comments/vote of anyone who used the word: <b>per X.</b> --its just as meaningless as nn (sort of a smile) <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 07:35, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Can someone verify any of these sources? Maybe a rewrite of the text would make the article more appealing. It's not improper grammer, but it just doesn't work for me. This could be a keeper with some help. I do agree with the author that too frequently the AfD looks like a mob, at first blush, but if you fix your article and recontact the mobsters you will find that each of them is a thoughtful and understanding person who will reconsider.

<p>Ah. I would like to point out that I never self styled myself as the "Bad Boy of Literature" that was a given nickname from Living for Sundance Group and Thought Collide Films and members of Detroit Synergy. Also I appreciate the debate on if I should or should not be in Wikipedia. If the article stays I would appreciate the addition of thedetroiter.com and/or mrbellersneighborhood.com for reference purposes. I have written for both online magazines. Thank you Eric C. Novack</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> References so far are unconvincing/insubstantial. Wikipedia is not a free publicity and advertising platform. We need significant, reliable evidence of encyclopedic notability. So far we have a local newspaper event promotion article of uncertain significance, a review from a website which Mr. Novack is himself involved with as the website's literature section editor<a href="http://www.thedetroiter.com/sept05/shame.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thedetroiter.com/sept05/shame.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and a couple of small reviews in obscure publications of uncertain reliability and significance printed on the book's own website . And yes, the title "Bad Boy of Literature" needs referencing as well if its claimed that his fans call him that rather than it being self-styled. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:14, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why? If I am involved why would it go more toward "vanity-spam". As far as I am concerned if the article is to be in Wikeipedia then it should be correct is all. And to be accurate the review of "Killing Molly" came months before my work at thedetroiter.com, the editor in chief called me and asked to work on the Lit section because maybe he felt I had a passion for the written word, who knows. And obscure lit reviews? HA please, they are probably the only reviews in Literature today that aren't bought and paid for. HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAH. You guys make me laugh. And why wouldn't I print the reviews on my website. Hey maybe I should put blurbs on the back of the book too, damn author trying to give a perspective reader an idea what the book is about. What could I be thinking? (for you slow people this is called sarcasm.) Now as far as my validity of being in Wikipedia, let me ask is Marc Spitz or Jame Frey (what a piece of crap that was) in here or the author of "twelve" (one of the worst books ever written to get "big" time reviews that were complimentry. Again I don't mind that I might be up for deletion, but please when you make an argument for deletion, please make it valid and speak of something you know about.

<li><b>Explanation</b> I'm author of original articles. I'm just started with Wikipedia but my goal was not to write spam articles. I agree that content of article must be improved. But many of other successful articles on Wikipedia started with worst content. If you can help me with my work, I would be very glad. And also, the company and products are not oriented for mass-market. But I don't think that this argument cannot be applied as reason for deletion. Company and products can be world-wide significant. So I guess that non of the article meet the criteria for deletion according Wikipedia deletion policy. So please, remove deletion tag from articles and rather help me to improve articles.

<dd>Evidence of one of these must be found, or the assumption will be that the company is not yet notable enough for Wikipedia.

<li><b>Why not delete</b> I will try to describe what should improve given articles to meet Wikipedia criteria.
<ul>
<li>Ardaco is company from Slovakia. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Slovak_companies_ddfe.html" title="List of Slovak companies">List of Slovak companies</a> is the list of Slovak company on Wikipedia. Ardaco is second IT company from Slovakia on Wikipedia. First is <a href="../../../e/s/e/Eset.html" title="Eset">Eset</a> and I think Ardaco has more useful article.</li>
<li>Ardaco is security oriented company, it cannot be world-wide widespread, but it's widespread in security and research oriented areas.</li>
<li>Ardaco is member of Nessi (European Technology Platform on Software and Services) - <a href="http://www.nessi-europe.com/Nessi/JoinNESSI/Members/MemberPresentation/tabid/165/Default.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nessi-europe.com/Nessi/JoinNESSI/Members/MemberPresentation/tabid/165/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.</li>
<li>On December 2006 SecureCall was certified by <a href="http://www.nbusr.sk" class="external text" title="http://www.nbusr.sk" rel="nofollow">NBU</a> (Slovak National Security Agency). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Securecall_cert.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Securecall_cert.jpg" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is scan of certificate.</li>
<li>There are many independent articled about SecureCall but most of them are in slovak language (one of them <a href="http://www.mobilmania.sk/Bleskovky/AR.asp?ARI=4834&amp;CAI=2097" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mobilmania.sk/Bleskovky/AR.asp?ARI=4834&amp;CAI=2097" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>).</li>
<li>Few weak ago at many internet IT magazines was published article about new technology from India (original article - <a href="http://www.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=88962&amp;d=18&amp;m=11&amp;y=2006" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=88962&amp;d=18&amp;m=11&amp;y=2006" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>). It was world-wide widespread article. PDMark is based on same principles. It can store less than GB of data but it's real technology which is used in many countries (most distant can be Peru).<br /></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This and many other information I would like to add to articles but it takes me more time. So I hope you should be more patient and allows me or better help me to improve content of articles. It's really not fair from you because some of you never improve more articles on Wikipedia then me. And I admit that I'm novice on Wikipedia and need help or some more time.</p>

<li><b>Keep but rename</b> - as I said in the last debate, it would be very unfair to describe much of this article as "trivia" - "miscellany" might be better as most of this is of genuine interest, some may even deserve their own article. Again, to repeat what I said last time,the comparison was with an article about <a href="../../../k/e/a/Keane.html" title="Keane">Keane</a> that included such glorious nuggets as "they love food" and this article is of a totally different nature.

<li>WP: Not (indiscriminate collection of information) is specific not elastic. It does not encompass anything or everything that is difficult to categorize/poorly organized/I don't like/has trivia in the title/I don't understand/I think is pointless,useless,stupid etc. It specifically proscribes: (i)FAQs; (ii) travel guides; (iii) memorials; (iv) instruction manuals; (v) internet guides; (vi) textbooks; (vii) plot summaries; (viii) lyrics databases; (ix) things made up in school. It only proscribes these when the article in question is "simply" one of these nine categories- i.e. it does not go beyond the parameters of the archetype.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> Apart from issues of labeling, I can't believe this unfocused pastiche of an article is on wikipedia and somehow managed to survive a previous AFD (and to the extent WP has formal deletion criteria, this article violates it and thus the fact it was previously up for deletion shouldn't matter). It has no subject but merely presents various bits of information that relate to the Beatles, with the loose theme of presenting "trivia" (or however you wish to say "random bits of information") about the Beatles. The loose format permits a lot of POV material to slide through. Why can't this material be merged into the main Beatles article, or articles about Billy Preston, James Taylor, etc.? <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 09:12, 30 January 2007 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I must state that this article is definitely not "random bits of information". 1. Every section has a <i>definite connection</i> with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>—every single section. 2. It would be impossible to merge the various pieces of information into The Beatles' articles without making them too confusing to read. 3. The Beatles' articles (and especially this one) are a stepping-stone to many other articles about artists/politicians/places, and institutions. 4. Have you ever tried to navigate your way around a city without a map? 5. Change the name of this article to something else, please... <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 19:00, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course there's a connection to the Beatles - that's the only logic behind the article. Apart from that, there is simply no logic at all behind it. It's random, you could reassemble it in any way you like and it wouldn't make it any more or less coherent. And the point that you keep making about navigation makes no sense - we use categories to provide a navigation framework, not extra articles of random information. Finally, the problem with this article is not the title, it's the style and content. Whether you call it Beatles miscellany, Beatles stuff that no-one has bothered to edit properly, A stream of consciousness written by Beatles fans or whatever, the point is an encyclopaedia article does not just assemble random bits of information in a haphazard order. It's about <i>synthesising</i> the information, <i>editing out</i> extraneous details, <i>describing</i> the subject of an article in a logical way, <i>informing</i> the reader. This article does none of those things. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 19:36, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>1. You say that the article is logical, but, "apart from that", you say that it is not logical at all. 2. It is not random—the sections are grouped under their respective headers (in alphabetical order, BTW.) 3. You say I <i>keep making the same points</i>, but you have nominated this article for deletion twice in six months. 4. Style and content is something that seems to fluctuate every month on Wikipedia, I'm sorry to say. 5. Editing: Look at the history page, and you will find there have been one or two changes made. 6. "A stream of consciousness" does not apply, and I find that wildly inaccurate. 7. "Haphazard"? (I refer you to point #2) 8. I find the article extremely logical, although it does refer to subjects that have no connection with each other (like <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Wilson_2456.html" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cher.html" title="Cher">Cher</a>, for example) but they do have a connection with The Beatles. 9. This article definitely informs the reader, and that is why it is still here (hopefully...) 10. Last point (thankfully&#160;:) Would you object to an article detailing the "Seven highest mountains in the world" because they are on different continents? I wish you well. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 20:06, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>There is no logic to the article; its structure is completely haphazard. If you chopped the first section out and put it at the end, it would make no difference at all to the overall sense of it. You couldn't do that with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>, because that's an encyclopaedia article. This one is just an <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate collection of information</a> about the Beatles.</li>
<li>However many times I've nominated this for deletion is not relevant to whether your argument about navigation makes sense. It doesn't, honestly. What do you think all the links in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> are for, and all the categories? How is this article supposed to be of any use when only three other actual articles link to it?</li>
<li>What is in this article, if it is important to the story of the Beatles, should go in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>. If it's important to the story of someone or something else, it should go in their article. If it's not important enough to be mentioned in either <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> or another proper encyclopaedia article, then it's not definitely not important enough to be mentioned in an article that's not about anything.</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> any useful and referenced information into the relevant articles, much like what happens when the content of trivia sections in articles is trimmed and merged into other sections. (See <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_trivia_sections_in_articles_c909.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid trivia sections in articles">Wikipedia:Avoid trivia sections in articles</a>.) Delete the real trivia as, well, trivia. In their current state these articles resemble (as any trivia section in an article would) "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate collections of information</a>". Now, I'm not saying none of the information is useful - it's the format in which the information is currently presented that's the problem. The Beatles trivia page is essentially just a list of distantly related facts, some of which hardly have anything to do with the Beatles. For example, the mention that the video for Supergrass's "Alright" was filmed in Portmeirion - what is the relevance of this? I agree with the editor above who it an "unfocused pastiche of an article". There appears to be some serious <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> problems with the <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink_Floyd_trivia_3cc7.html" title="Pink Floyd trivia">Pink Floyd trivia</a> article as well.

<p>This article documents a horrible thing which was a tragedy for all involved, and I don't in any way seek to diminish that. But sadly, the fact is that there are two or three murder victims a week in this country, and only rarely do the circumstances of a murder generate the kind of long lasting impact on society that would demand an encyclopaedia entry. The <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moors_murders.html" title="Moors murders">Moors murders</a>, <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire_Ripper_e6ba.html" title="Yorkshire Ripper">Yorkshire Ripper</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Shipman_a6d7.html" title="Harold Shipman">Harold Shipman</a> and occurrences like that warrant an article, but I do not think an article on every murder victim is appropriate or desirable. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> states that subjects of encyclopedia articles must be notable besides being fondly remembered. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 01:15, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> In the U.S it is "missing white girl" stories which get the big disproportionate big news play, and apparently in Britain it is "murdered lawyer" which dominates the airwaves. He is still just one man, otherwise apparently non-notable, who was the victim of a street crime by extremely non-notable robbers. He got his 15 minutes (in this case 3 months) of fame, but in the long run this is still material for Wikinews, not Wikipedia. Wikipedia is no the tabloid murder news, and is not a memorial.

<li><b>Comment</b> - people seem to be thinking that because something is verifiable it must be encyclopaedic. Wikipedia is not Wikinews and just because something has made news headlines does not make it encyclopaedic. Also, people seem to be overestimating the impact this had in the UK. Tony Blair talks about a lot of things and his word does not bestow notability on something. There are many comparable incidents which do not have articles and which rightly should not have articles. The cases of Margaret Muller, Jonathan Zito, Mohammed Parvaiz and Michael Menson spring to mind. And to better judge the overall impact of this event you may wish to look at this BBC news search result: <a href="http://search.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin/search/results.pl?tab=ns&amp;q=murdered&amp;recipe=all&amp;scope=all&amp;edition=d" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin/search/results.pl?tab=ns&amp;q=murdered&amp;recipe=all&amp;scope=all&amp;edition=d" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.

<dd>Was Tom ap Rhys Pryce himself notable? Would he have merited an article if this terrible thing hadn't happened? Think forward a year - will the 700 or so murders that will have happened in the UK in that time have spawned 700 murder victim articles? Does someone automatically become notable if someone else kills them? How about the 15,000 US murder victims? 25,000 victims in Baghdad? 17,000 Colombians? All the references in the article cite news sources. To me that strongly indicates that this is a suitable subject for a news website but not for an encyclopaedia. Likewise with the other cases I mentioned, where if you read what I said you'll say I certainly didn't say I thought they deserved articles. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 11:48, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Whilst not perhaps meeting criteria of notability if it had occurred in the US, this was a significant event in the UK and led to questions in the House of Commons and House of Lords regarding increased serious &amp; violent crime in the UK, particularly in areas of London previously considered 'safe'. It also meets all <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> criteria with regard non-trivial coverage from a number of media sources, where the commentary was based not just on the event, but its social &amp; political implications. '15 -minutes' point covered by 'permanence of notability' of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. No-brainer, in my opinion.

The inherent problem with newsworthy topics is that they are <i><a href="../../../d/e/_/De_facto.html" title="De facto">de facto</a></i> the subject of "multiple non-trivial 3rd-party reliable sources". Even items of merely provincial/state-wide importance (which is not the case here) fall under this description. Also, there are MANY issues which politicians or prominent figures comment on every day, if only for the sake of making a statement to the press and/or to the public. Following the <a href="../../../l/e/t/Letter_of_the_law.html" title="Letter of the law">letter of the guidelines</a> then, EVERY news item covered by multiple newspapers in EVERY country EVERY day should by rights have an article in the 'pedia, which I'm sure all but the most vehement inclusionists will agree is inappropriate. At its heart, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a news service, and in the absence of a news notability guideline, common sense somehow has to prevail. That said, <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabrib_0c03.html" title="User:Fabrib">user:Fabrib</a>'s points no. 1 and 3 (but IMHO not the others) <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Prima_facie.html" title="Prima facie">prima facie</a></i> indicate why this particular murder <b>case</b> is notable <b>from a legal perspective</b> and is encyclopedia-worthy. All the other points just add to its newsworthiness, which is irrelevant to the discussion. <b>Delete unless rewritten</b> to focus more on the encyclopedia-worthy legal aspects of the case/trial, which IMHO are the only things <b>encyclopedically</b> notable about this event. The problem with this article is that it is majority focused on the <i>news</i> aspects such as: 1. the life details of the victim and murderers (remember: none of whom were notable in and of themselves), 2. the murder itself (this could be summarised, it is presented in FAR too much step-by-step detail), 3. politicians' quotes and 4. memorial funds and such-like. None of these things are out of the ordinary for slightly-above-average murder cases (heck, its not out-of-the-ordinary for "lesser" newsworthy events than murder) and do not contribute to raising this article from news to encyclopedia material. <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange">®</font></a></b> 14:22, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. OK, you've come up with two latin legal terms, but still no guidelines that actually exist. That said, it probably is high time a <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28news%29_d447.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (news)">Wikipedia:Notability (news)</a> is created - you make some excellent points (although, in reality, I don't believe it very likely that anyone is apt to waste the time to make articles for "every news item" as you said, and such topics that are actually covered by <i>multiple</i> sources probably have merger potential for an existing article). Now, as for your delete vote - I still don't see any actual deletion criteria being applied here, as even you admit that this subject is encyclopedic in its way, and that the encyclopedic elements are present, although diluted. If you feel the article should be cleaned up, then tag it as such, discuss the issue on the talk page, and/or take a try at reworking the article yourself. Deletion of this article, at this point, would be little more than laziness. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntepenultimate_a059.html" title="User:Antepenultimate">Antepenultimate</a> 15:11, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that there are currently no deletion criteria to apply to newsworthy topics. In the absence thereof I (and I'm sure many other editors) have to resort to long-winded arguments such as the above to explain our rationale. Remember the guideline are prescriptive, not descriptive and exceptions are allowed. This swings both ways: articles may be kept <i>despite</i> failing guidelines, and so too may articles be deleted <i>without</i> obviously failing any guidelines. My point about "every news item getting an article" isn't that editors will spend time creating them, it is that once created there is no possibility, via the current guidelines, for deleting them. As for your cleanup suggestion, my personal POV is to never&#160;!vote "keep and rewrite" on AfD's as far too many articles end up being kept without getting the subsequent rewrite done to them (there was some discussion about what to do about "keep and rewrite" on the <a href="../../../v/p/p/WP%7EVPP_9f2a.html" title="WP:VPP">Village Pump</a> quite recently which touched on this very problem). <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange">®</font></a></b> 09:46, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The conflation and confusion of news notability with encyclopedic notability is a major issue. I agree with Zunaid - almost all articles or reports in news channels are covered by multiple sources so even the most trivial or sensationalist human interest story can get a technical pass of current weak general notability guidelines. On another level we also need guidelines (I'm skeptical about leaving anything to "common sense") to start distinguishing between serious news items that are only of news notability and those that are also encyclopedically notable. These are <i>not</i> the same thing. News organizations have different functions and rationales from encyclopedias. Every murder or other major crime is serious and a "notable" event for police, the victims, the crime reporters - yes may even be asked in parliament or raised by some politician but that is a routine function of political systems (especially democratic ones) and not automatically an indication of encyclopedic notability. Wikipedia is not a news report archive or a police report archive <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 05:31, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. It's becoming clear to me that the real problem isn't neccessarily this article, but the lack of applicable guidelines for this type of article. Something should be done about that. In terms of <i>this article</i>, however - comparing this with a trivial or sensationalist "human interest" story isn't really fair, and I say that because this doesn't clear the "multiple independent source" requirement by having only two references - it has upwards of <i>thirty</i>, and there's no reason to assume that the list is exhaustive. Yeah, I know this could fall under "sensationalist" except for some items written above (and if sensationalism is a problem then we're going to have to start cocking our eyebrows at a lot of content within celebrity articles) that Zunaid admitted could have value. Now, as per the no Keep and Rewrite policy Zunaid has adopted, that is fine and it is his right to do so. I haven't had time to peruse the discussion at the Village Pump, but my opinion on this matter is that if less people simply stopped at giving instructions and more tried to follow through themselves - rather than expecting someone else to step up to the plate and do the dirty work - this would be less of a problem. If you feel strongly that something should be changed, I see no reason why you can't Be Bold and work on it yourself. Anyway, if someone would like to start up a discussion pertaining to getting a <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28news%29_d447.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (news)">Wikipedia:Notability (news)</a> policy put together, I would be happy to chime in. Some good discussion (IMO) has already taken place here, and if Zunaid can find other instances of similar AfDs, we may already have some precedents. Perhaps we can save everyone from having to resort to these long-winded explanations in the future. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntepenultimate_a059.html" title="User:Antepenultimate">Antepenultimate</a> 16:44, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep (maybe to change to "strong keep" later?)</b> This proposition is much weaker than the fundamental theorem of algebra. You don't need the fundamental theorem of algebra to prove it. So even if it is a corollary to that theorem, it silly to regard that as being an important fact about it. To say "Since when do corollaries merit articles on there own?" is also silly; that depends very much on context. <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra.html" title="Fundamental theorem of algebra">Fundamental theorem of algebra</a> is not the right place to merge it into if it is to be merged. Really, the comments above are silly, silly, silly, silly. If you believe, just because this article says so, that the main thing to be said about it is that it's a corollary of a theorem not needed to prove <b>this</b> much simpler theorem, then you are gullible and I can offer you a really great deal on some real estate in Florida. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 23:34, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. This page may be small, but it states a frequently used fact that deserves to stand on its own. The fundamental theorem of algebra asserts that every polynomial in <b>C</b>[<i>x</i>] has a root in <b>C</b>. The theorem under discussion does not assert the <i>existence</i> of a root, but merely the fact that any complex root of a real polynomial, <i>if</i> it exists, is accompanied by its complex conjugate as (another) root. As a corollary, it asserts that a real polynomial of odd degree has a real root, perhaps because the complex roots occur in pairs. Without checking the reference I do not know how it is proved there, but it is common to use the fundamental theorem of algebra to show that a polynomial of degree <i>n</i> has <i>n</i> roots; still, that dependency may be non-essential. It is true that the brief <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complex_conjugate.html" title="Complex conjugate">complex conjugate</a> article devotes one sentence to this theorem, but if I were to cite this theorem I predict my readers would find a devoted article more helpful. --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 02:05, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Withdraw nom.</b> Michael Hardy is right, this is not a corollary of the FTA. I was frankly a bit surprised to see the assertion that it was, and I was a bit too willing to trust that assertion. The problem is that I'm not a good enough mathematician to be able to say that just because <i>I</i> can't see how it's a corollary, it isn't. Also, I grabbed the nearest algebra text (which was a high-school level text) and checked, and found this theorem listed, unnamed, as a corollary of the FTA, but without a satisfactory proof. These are the factors that influenced that statement, but clearly calling it a "corollary" is silly. The article has, in any case, been much improved by Michael Hardy and others, and sources have been provided which (presumably) verify that the name is in widespread use, which was what I was getting at with the Google hits test. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 00:10, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Independent documentation of this program has been featured in the Orlando Sentinel on Sunday, October 8, 2000. A scanned copy of this article can be found on FPS's own web site at: <a href="http://pawpet.tv/index.php?press" class="external free" title="http://pawpet.tv/index.php?press" rel="nofollow">http://pawpet.tv/index.php?press</a> and can be obtained independently by request at www.orlandosentinel.com It has also been recognized in the "Folkmanis Puppets in TV and Video" section of the Folkmanis manufacturing web site. Additionally, the program's self described 4 hour format coupled with its recent 320th show (1.28.2007) translates into a remarkable 1280+ hours of recorded program time. The cast has indicated on air that the bulk of this material has been archived and still exists. This would make FPS a program with more original air broadcast hours than the full run of most network television programs. Coupled with its interactive net-based chat function with its audience, and its documented licensing to legally use ASCAP/BMI/SESAC licensed music (in itself a rarity among net-based broadcasts), I would strongly suggest retaining this article. --<a href="../../../j/c/_/JC_f666.html" title="JC">JC</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.188.190.35_a4b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.188.190.35">72.188.190.35</a> (talk) 20:01, 29 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<dd>Oops, forgot to sign, sorry.

Such a mindset is, by explicit description, <b>not</b> a valid reason to delete. I apologise to the nominator if this is not the case, but your contrib history this week certainly raises that as a valid concern. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArakunem_454b.html" title="User:Arakunem">Arakunem</a> 17:04, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and rewrite</b> If this is a verifiable fact, then maintaining consistent production for over 6 years does seem to point to a level of notability.

<p>This "Cambridge Seventy" movement seems to utterly fail notability. Its best claim seems to be that a poster was hung in a residence dormitory. Google Search (after removing mirrors) seems to reveal nothing whatsoever that is relevant. If someone can actually find some sources proving that this even existed, that'd be nice, though I suspect it would still be non-notable. <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 02:05, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Having the potential to grow indefinitely is not the same as being excessively broad in scope.

The main problem with this article is that it is, basically, a dictionary of words that have no relationship to one another because they originate in unrelated works of fiction. There is no encyclopaedic analysis of the concept of protologistic expletives from works of fiction, and to what extent they have escaped the various works that they originated in, to hang such a list from. A simple list of aviation jokes does not make an encyclopaedia article on aviation jokes (cf. Aviation joke (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aviation_joke_4ccd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aviation joke">AfD discussion</a>) and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant_joke.html" title="Elephant joke">elephant joke</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Elephant_joke_%282nd_nomination%29_5ef0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Elephant joke (2nd nomination)">AFD discussion</a>)), and a simple list of innovative expletives from works of fiction does not make an encyclopaedia article on such expletives. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:33, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, but not really because I don't think the list doesn't "belong" here. Get rid of it because it's unsourced, most of it is non-notable, and because nearly everything that -could- be used as an expletive is on here, fictional or not. If this list were pared down about 95% and only included the <i>real</i> notable ones that aren't just variations of "ass" or "fuck" then I'd feel differently. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 20:43, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

However, as UsaSatsui points out, this list is virtually unreferenced, with little to no assertion of actual published notability. So unless/until the entries on the list can be properly referenced, and non-notable examples pruned to keep the list to a reasonable size, I'm recommending deletion. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:53, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>very crufty page for an upstart wrestling promotion. Had prod attached, but was removed. I can understand somewhat why TNA/WWE/WCW may have ratings pages (although maybe those should also be considered for deletion), but this promotion just started, and it just isn't needed. TV shows in general don't always have pages just for their ratings (not including those episode guides that have ratings intertwined. This page just isn't needed. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 02:30, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete, possibly Merge with Wrestling Society X</b> Seems to me this doesn't need to be in a seperate article. There is also an issue with maintaining week-by-week ratings information for television shows in general. That information is only useful if it can be kept current, and most of the ratings information isn't at all notable. When something requires week-by-week updates that is a negative factor, in my opinion. Moreover, even assuming you keep the ratings up to date, you can easily include that information within the television show's main article. Why have a huge subarticle just for ratings information? <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:01, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep, possible merge.</b> I'm a Gundam fan, but I don't think we need a separate article on every single suit.

<dd>Eric, I realize you haven't been at wikipedia for long, but you have a strange idea of how it works. I know you have put a lot of effort into removing spam links, and that's part of what it takes to keep wikipedia on an improvement trajectory. Removing unsuitable articles is another part. I have no intention of dedicating a lot of effort to it, but if I did, I might follow up your suggestion, since I agree that most such departments and organizations are in fact not notable according to wikipedia criteria. But the large number of articles presently escaping scrutiny should not in any way influence the action on these that are currently nominated AfD. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 03:28, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Band's main claim to notability is the theme song for a barely notable television show. When I Googled the band (a process complicated by the common nature of the name), I found one media mention which is mirrored on some other sites.

<li><b>Delete.</b> I'll let someone else do the search engine test on these folks. I applaud the nominator's good judgment in separating this article because of its length. In the final result, though, the article is totally unsourced, and serves the purpose of its religious cult, not of the information-seeking Wikipedia community. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 05:29, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Hi. I'm still not sure whether I'm for keeping this, but there are actual sources in the "References" section, so calling it "totally unsourced" is a little strong.

<li>Good call. What I should have said was that the article content, as relates to the individual shows (not the network as a whole), reads like an advertisement. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 20:48, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fixed. Note that bad content is not grounds for deletion. If you don't like the content, change it or add a warning notice at the top of the article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. As the guy who saved this from the dumpster the first time, I'm concerned that things like the Google test and the "I haven't heard of it" test are prone to <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">systemic bias</a> for regional items in countries where English isn't the primary language. Although I have an admitted bias against both cults and spam, I think articles on spammy or culty topics shouldn't have to meet a higher bar than other topics. My take is that they have press coverage, transmitters in two major Phillipine cities, and a presence on dozens of Phillipine city cable systems. Were this, say, a Texas religious broadcaster, I think we'd cover them, so this one should stay, too. Further, I don't think they have become less notable than the last AfD, which was a keep. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 19:33, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> firstly, it is sourced. Considering it is in the Phillipines, it certainly passes a Google test (which is a guideline at best). Just look past the wikipedia mirrors. Also "reading like an advertisement" is not cause for deletion. —<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo">siro</a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESiroxo_a930.html" title="User talk:Siroxo"><i>χ</i></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Siroxo_49da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Siroxo">o</a> 08:57, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and clean up. Consensus is that radio/TV broadcasters and channels are notable. There are sources provided that confirm these channels exist so what's needed is the turning of the current article into something encyclopaedic. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 13:44, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> to list of mecha from Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack. The article definitely needs a rewrite to pass WP:WAF, but the subject itself is notable. It's essentially the antagonist in the movie Char's Counterattack. Also appears in other, unrelated media such as the Super Robot Wars series of games by Banpresto, and it has a lot of model kits/toys based on it. Also appears in another book or two set in the Universal Century Gundam universe. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 17:16, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable figure skating competition. Marshalls Winter Event is what is commonly (and disparagingly) known to figure skating fans as a "cheesefest". It is a non-qualifying competition that does not matter except for TV ratings and so the skaters can make some money. It's a popularity contest, pure and simple, and its format, if you can call it one, depends entirely on what the TV executives want. It is not judges or scored by ISU rules and it is not a figure skating competition. It is a figure skating tv show, like Brian Boitano's Skating Spectular or Kurt Browning's Gotta Skate. The only difference is that this one has eligible skaters and pretends to be a competition. It should be noted that the spring event sponsored by Marshalls has given up the pretext of being a competition and has been just a showcase for the past two seasons. <a href="../../../a/w/a/User%7EAwartha_adf6.html" title="User:Awartha">Awartha</a> 06:50, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> on each article for several reasons. Firstly, I've checked through them all on various online places. Each seems notable in English, online, let alone in their native language and offline. I have provided verifiable sources (foodnetwork, newspapers..) for a few, but I don't have the time to provide one for each. Secondly, a point on "recipes". None of these article is a recipe, the fact is that any salad has a few basic ingredients. These will be mentioned in the article, so its a good place to start the stub. Thirdly, each article is different. They are not simply all Salads out of a cookbook, they are foods from varying cultures, that exist in the English-language-cookbook-canon to varying degrees. Therefore they should each be relisted separately before deletion is even considered. Lastly, note people's different votes on which to keep, and which to delete. This is an example of differing sets of knowledge not overlapping enough leading to systemic bias in Wikipedia. We must be very careful before deleting any of these for that reason. Based on this, and considering other reasons for keep, I believe the "burden of proof" falls on those who advocate deleting to provide explicit reasons for each article on why to delete.

<p>Yet another paraphilia. Under a thousand Google hits, Google Scholar gives one passing mention (a single sentence in a single paper which alludes to it), Google News has nothing, Factive has nothing, the links at the bottom are not to reliable sources (only to forums and other cruft). So: a neologism, a fantasy fetish, and one which has little if any documentation in the relevant academic community. Sounds like sexcruft you say? You might think that, I couldn't possibly comment. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 10:45, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> First of all, Vore was not just a passing mention in one single sentence in that paper Guy found, in addition. There have been several books published by Willing Levy about this matter. Further more. "Vorarephile" is a much more popular word phase to search, which returns over ten thousands results on Google. It is evident that effort have not been made to properly verifies this entry before called for a deletion. EkaMei 22:11, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

The ref I was referring to was in fact on that page. Although the rest rings true here for this article that doesn't mean the article escapes the criteria for deletion. While the paraphilia no doubt exists it is too fringe (or maybe just to young) to create <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> in order to provide the mandatory level of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> for any article on wikipeida. This means that until reliable sources can be found this article cannot support itself here. Of course many people are registering accounts here to "vote" on this AfD (no doubt after being recruited to do so at vore community sites) this AfD is not a vote and "I'm real and I'm into this stuff" is not a valid reason to retain this article. This article fails to meet policy requirements and should be deleted as failing <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and very possibly <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> since no objective coverage is available as all the knowledge of the subject is coming from people intimate with or involved in the subject material's "community".

<li><b>Keep</b>. Reasons stated above - but I do have a personal comment to add for Seifer. In the first case, though it's quite obvious vore <i>exists</i>, Seif, it's much harder to prove whether or not it belongs in Wikipedia. Online stuff is tricky - for example, there are games on Newgrounds with upwards of eight million hits. That's way more members than Eka's Portal or any other vore message board out there has got - though I'd not judge on how many 'hits' the main pages have received. However, such games do not fall into the category for inclusion into Wikipedia - because, in the first case, they aren't that notable. True, eight million hits have been archived - but that just means someone's clicked on a button eight million times. There are message boards and letter-groups about it, you say? True, but I don't think there are eight million people on those message boards or letter groups.<br />
Wikipedia exists in order to help educate people about subjects - it is an online encyclopedia. True, there are a lot of things that aren't notable enough for a real encyclopedia here, but there has to be some cut-off. There hasn't ever been, to my knowledge, a scientific study conducted about vore. Yes, it exists - but where's the reliable information to put in an article? The <i>worst</i> source for an article is the person or people being talked about. That's why the Neo-Nazis don't get to put their version of the Holocaust into that article, that's why the politicians aren't allowed to edit their own articles - it's because information that comes from someone <i>about</i> that someone is inherently unreliable. We can't use the vore community itself for documentation ABOUT the vore community - because we'd be getting a biased, unscientific view.<br />
All that said, I still vote for 'keep'. Wikipedia is intended to educate people - and there's certainly enough information present to merit a stub article for vore. As long as the page doesn't cause an edit war about what should or shouldn't be in there, I really don't see a reason that it should stop existing - True, there's a rule on Wikipedia about 'no independent research', but surely there's a NPOV way to include this article. The fetish it alludes to isn't going to simply go away, after all. This kind of thing is certainly not a Wiktionary article, but it's certainly good enough for a 'pedia that uses three counts of "Pelican eats pidgeon" as references for another article. On a rather amusing note, I never expected my Wikipedia profile to be used to comment on something like this... --KaoruNagisaThe Angel 01:24, 30 January 2007 (UTC) <small>— KaoruNagisa (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KaoruNagisa_237f.html" title="Special:Contributions/KaoruNagisa">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Those who are pushing for the deletion of this article claim that the community which I find myself a member of, even if a non-contributing one, does not exist. This issue has actually propelled me to it's defense. While I personally believe the request to delete this page is simply the product of someone unhappy with the existence of such a thing and is attempting to "cleanse" their world of what they view as an undesirable aspect, I have no proof of such and therefore cannot make the claim/accusation. What I will say, is that all science and writing is based on some sort of observation. We know what we do about the Pygmy tribes from watching them, and then writing about them. Just because at first before they were well-known there were no books or articles on the Pygmies did not mean they did not exist. I say keep this article, and let it be managed by those who know the subject best: voraphiles themselves. As a matter of fact, I'm going to go digging for articles and information right now to add to the article and try to make it better fit the (voluntary, I must point out) standards which these people claim to be "enforcing".

The problems claimed in this article, including original research, exist in other Wikipedia articles which have never been up for deletion. Besides, I’d love to hear the rationale for keeping so many, many articles devoted to anime, characters, concepts, and even objects and individual episodes—most of them are almost completely original research, derived from watching said anime. —<a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFrungi_bd0e.html" title="User:Frungi">Frungi</a> 05:57, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. You will have to forgive me if I am editing this page improperly. My input into Wikipedia thus far has been limited to the comments sections. As such, I may be seen as a "single purpose poster", merely because I usually prefer to watch than comment. I also do not yet know the proper coding to "tab" the other paragraphs below to line up properly, my apologies.<br />
That said, thus far I believe the "standards" at Wikipedia are not being held as rigorously as some may claim. This article, not it's existence, but rather the threat of removal, is proof of that. For a web site that can dedicate massive articles are such topics as "Lightsaber Combat", giving extremely in-depth accounts of something that appears in a series of movies, created for no reason other than "it looks good", but at the same time will go out of their way to whittle down articles such as this astounds me. Look at the History of this particular article, and you can see how it went from discussion of a relatively new "field" in fetishes to being stripped of nearly all content, and only then, cited for deletion. It is if somebody wants this subject to simply go away. And given the number of other, highly questionable articles on Wikipedia, especially those that have no relevance to anything except the small fictional worlds in which they exist, it is obvious that Wikipedia truly is nothing more than a massive popularity contest.<br />
Does this fetish exist? Without a doubt. It is quite obvious to anyone who spends more than 30 seconds punching a word they don't even know how to spell into Google that there is indeed information of this fetish out there. It has been defined, various sub-branches have been identified and defined, there even is discussion on the psychological reasons for it (Fight or Flight reactions, dominance/submissiveness, etc.) The fact that it hasn't moved into the "main stream" yet is largely in part because the "main stream" is always a few decades behind, at least. And it is a case of "I don't want to see it, therefore it doesn't exist."<br />
Does this article deserve deletion? In it's current state, probably. However, it would be far more appropriate for this article to be edited, to be put back into a state of completion, discussion and information about the subject and about the branches within the subject, by those who know what the subject is, and what they are talking about. The "experts" in this field currently are those involved in the community. Another thing that needs to happen is for people who DON'T know what the subject matter is to leave it largely alone, unless they are willing to spend the time to truly look it up for themselves first. 75.167.30.149 18:15, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

While the external links listed in the article might have some use in the article, the text of the article makes no reference use of these links.

<li><b>Keep</b> Just happened across this article by accident while following wiki-links, so gave the discussion a read. Voraraphilia, or voraphilia as it is sometimes termed has an extremely active community of the internet. Wikipedia is full of articles about things like internet communites and pop-culture memes that have little to no acedemic coverage and hard sourcing. This topic is no different. Just because there is not a lot of academic sources of information about this topic, it does not mean that it doesn't exist or that a sizable and active community does not exist. If we're willing to write about and not bat an eye at keeping "<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base are belong to us">All your base are belong to us</a>," or the "<a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Kid_6b75.html" title="Star Wars Kid">Star Wars Kid</a>" or all the stuff related to the #chans which are all sources of internet memes and lack a lot of "academic" coverage, why not this, which is at least as significant to a large number of people and generates a great deal of art and writing that is easily accessable and found? The article needs to be rewritten, yes, but to delete it would be an unfair application of wikipedia's policy given all the other stuff on Wikpedia that no-one bats an eye at and is similair in scope. --<a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELendorien_d245.html" title="User:Lendorien">Lendorien</a> 20:01, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I'll start off by admitting that I am a vorarephile myself. I have been for over 30 years, when I first found myself becoming aroused at scenes in stories or movies, where someone was being eaten alive. The term itself, is what I have known this fetish by for the past 10 years, when I first came online and found others like myself. I have found no other psychiatric term that could define this fetish for me. Just because I am not aroused by other fetishes, does not mean that this one does not exist. The reason there is a lack of scientific research on vorarephilia, is because of one: the apparant small percentage of the population who has it; and two: for all intent and purposes, it is a harmless fetish that has no real-world interaction. Researchers have no desire to spend time and money on a condition that threatens nobody. Though it is often classified as a fantasy fetish, because people don't go around swallowing others or getting swallowed themselves, that has nothing to do with the physical reaction of an arousal that occurs. Yes, the entry should make it clear that this fetish has not been scrutinized by psychiatrists yet, and the term itself should be considered as 'slang' because of this fact; but to ignore something that has existed as the common terminolgy for over a decade is putting blinders on. Instead of asking where the scientific evidence is, ask instead where the facts of this article can be proven as wrong, before deleting it. -- A university lecture document that discusses similar fetishes, making only a reference to 'vorarephilia' in its online resources listing, can be found here: <a href="http://faculty.ncwc.edu/TOConnor/428/428lect13.htm" class="external free" title="http://faculty.ncwc.edu/TOConnor/428/428lect13.htm" rel="nofollow">http://faculty.ncwc.edu/TOConnor/428/428lect13.htm</a> Amberax 22:41, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

This is called a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a>. Wikipedia has rules and guildlines for dealing with <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologisms</a>. The guidline in a nutshell as covered at the top of the page and states: <i>New terms don't belong in Wikipedia unless there are reliable sources about the term</i>. If you follow the rabbit hole a little deeper you will also find the definition of what wikipedia considers to be a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>.

<dd><b>Follow-up</b>. Given the definition of neologism (I particularly like: 'A meaningless word used by a psychotic.') and Wikipedia's guidelines towards their usage, I must unfortunately recant my previous <b>keep</b> request and agree with the <b>delete</b> option. While I personally believe that a decade of usage should be more than long enough to raise a term from being considered as 'new' to accepted, I could find no definitive rule to follow as to when a word would no longer be considered a neologism (despite a websearch of various online dictionaries). Therefore, it is up to the individual to make that decision and Wikipedia has the right to decide that for themselves. I am always quick to use Wikipedia as my initial reference source for information, often forgetting the encyclopedic nature of these services. For now, terms such as vorarephilia would probably be best left for dictionaries, despite my wishes for it to appear as an entry here. My only question would be on the validity of having entries for all of the other 'fetishes' listed at the bottom of the entry on Vorarephilia, where most of those have no scientific validation either.

<p>Little to no support for the claims of notability made in this article. Gerson has founded a MySpace group with 17,000 members - what do people think of this? The group's name, "People Helping People," is pretty generic and therefore hard to search for, but Google searching for <i>"People Helping People" Hayden</i> or <i>"People Helping People" myspace</i> doesn't turn up anything to show that the group has made an impact outside MySpace. Beyond this, the unsourced claims that this 23-year-old <sup><a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=6811493" class="external autonumber" title="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=6811493" rel="nofollow">[22]</a></sup> real estate agent/mortgage broker is an "industry leader" and "an opinion leader in the field of finance" seem a bit exaggerated.

<p>Unsourced stub concerning a neologism used to describe a sex position.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - well, really, anybody who is in broadcasting is technically a Peabody award candidate, all you really need is $150 for the entrance fee. There's no announcement of finalists for the awards, so unless she wins, we have no indication of how she ranked among all the other entrants that year. I looked at the sources, and of the ones that are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>, she is only briefly mentioned - in fact, from what I can tell, she has just as many direct quotes printed in USA Today as I do, and I can tell you unequivocally, I'm not notable. She is certainly on the cusp of notablity, so don't be afraid to re-create the article when she gets a bit more media coverage under her belt (or of she does happen to win the Peabody, since thats instantly notable). - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 22:29, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

They are much less noteworthy, have zero articles written regarding their work (via blog, newspapers, magazines or other). Nor do they cross professional, activist and artistic lines; yet they have been approved and warmly received on wikipedia. Let me know if you would like me to list their entries so that you may lobby to have them deleted, also.

<p><b>Also, she is an independent filmmaker.</b> I thought that I pointed that out earlier, but this info must have slipped through the e-cracks because clearly there is an overabundance of information that proves that JC Lamkin is wikipedia-able (yes, I just made up a new word, but it fits right&#160;:-).</p>
<p>But, seriously...her most recent film "The Struggle for Safer Streets" is an entry in the Blacklily Film and Music Festival in the category of social change documentary. Here is a link to the Blacklily site for fyi purposes: <a href="http://www.blacklilyfilm.org" class="external free" title="http://www.blacklilyfilm.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.blacklilyfilm.org</a></p>
<p>I probably should have mentioned that earlier, too; but frankly, she has so many achievements that I am an not quite certain which achievements I should list and which achievement will just piss off the editors (btw, she is a candidate for the Peabody in <b>two</b> categories, Public Service and Documentary&#160;;-)</p>

"A commonly seen argument at AfD is "Subject has x number of y, that's notable". In fact, editors are fooling themselves if they think they know how many subscribers makes a notable journal on calligraphy, how much revenue makes a notable cardboard box producer, and how many pandas make a notable zoo. Not to mention the other 97 different 'big numbers' that could be used to justify arguing 'keep' in an AfD every day." and 4.2 Google test "Although using a search engine like Google can be useful in determining how common or well-known a particular topic is, these arguments should never be the only criterion for a deletion."<br />

<li><b>Commment</b> Ken, you are obviously enthusiastic about this article, and I hope you keep that enthusiasm as you embark on your wiki-career. You are correct that the number of google hits is not a strict indicator of how notable somebody is, but in this case it is making it difficult for us to verify the information in the article. I took a few minutes to look over the sources again, and unfortunately, I have to stand my my&#160;!vote - there was <a href="http://www.naturalorganizedwomansororityincorporated.com/2006AwardsLuncheon.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.naturalorganizedwomansororityincorporated.com/2006AwardsLuncheon.htm" rel="nofollow">an awards lunchon</a> put on by a group who's home page featured a story about Anita T. Conner, but the website lists no further information nor does it mention the name of the award, and nowhere is Lamkin's name associated with the award, so unfortunately, that bit of info is completely unsourced. The film festival info is also unverifable, as the link you posted doesn't list the name of the movies participating, and Google provided us with no reliable verification that the movie "The Struggle for Safer Streets" was produced by Ms. Lamkin. I did find a story in this local/regional newspaper <a href="http://www.scoopusanewspaper.com/ScoopAugust0406.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scoopusanewspaper.com/ScoopAugust0406.pdf" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> about Ms. Lamkin (page 8), and besides noting that the 4th paragraph of the wiki article was a borderline copyvio of the story, it did not appear to me that this is a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, nor could I find any other mentions of Ms. Lamkin winning those awards. It is quite obvious hat Ms. Lamkin is a powerful force within her community, but there are many, many people that are powerful forces in their communities around the world - and while thats admirable, if others aren't writing about their accomplishments, then we cannot verify them, and if we can't verify them, then they can't be here. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 04:29, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I previously deleted this article as a hoax. The original creator insists that it is not a hoax, so I have undeleted it and am bringing it here for discussion. The "pastor" of this "church" is "Darwin Fish", which is the first clue that it is a parody church (like <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landover_Baptist_Church_f80d.html" title="Landover Baptist Church">Landover Baptist Church</a>), not a real church. At any rate, the church's website gets 249 g-hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2003-37%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=www.atruechurch.info" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2003-37%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=www.atruechurch.info" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> and "A True Church" along with "Darwin Fish" gets 103 g-hits, mostly self-generated <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2003-37%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=%22a+true+church%22+%22Darwin+fish%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2003-37%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=%22a+true+church%22+%22Darwin+fish%22" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> because it is notable and not a hoax. You have judged it by its appearance rather than actually checking out the sources:

<li>His name is, indeed, Darwin Fish. He <a href="http://www.atruechurch.info/archivedblog.html" class="external text" title="http://www.atruechurch.info/archivedblog.html" rel="nofollow">writes</a>: "The name Darwin is not evil, as you erroneously state. An evil man had this name (it was his last name, not his first name), but the name itself is not evil. I also reject what the man taught. [...] I will not dishonor my parents by changing my name, as you wickedly want me to do." He also <a href="http://www.atruechurch.info/darwin.html" class="external text" title="http://www.atruechurch.info/darwin.html" rel="nofollow">writes</a>: "Yes, Darwin Fish is my real name. It is the name my parents gave me when I was born in 1961. At the time, to my knowledge, there was no "DarwinFish" symbol made up at that time. My father's last name is "Fish," and my mother liked the name Darwin. So, this is my name. Some have suggested that I should change it, but I don't believe that would be honoring my father and mother (Exodus 20:12)."</li>

<li>Interesting ... the Post article about Graham that mentions this guy still doesn't give me any confidence there is actually a church there. It looks like he was out there holding up a sign and a reporter said, "ok, I'll bite, what are you up to".

<li>How ever much <i>confidence</i> you have in the church's existence does not really constitute that the article ought to be deleted. If it is indeed real, you are playing a cruel game by trying to delete the article just because Darwin Fish's parents gave him a name that nowadays would be considered ridiculous. I have spoken to <a href="http://www.albertsoto.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.albertsoto.com/" rel="nofollow">Albert Soto</a>, the guy who made the website for Darwin, and I've watched their <a href="http://www.atruechurch.info/video.html" class="external text" title="http://www.atruechurch.info/video.html" rel="nofollow">documentaries</a>. You associate this church with the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landover_Baptist_Church_f80d.html" title="Landover Baptist Church">Landover Baptist Church</a>, but if you go to the <a href="http://www.atruechurch.info" class="external text" title="http://www.atruechurch.info" rel="nofollow">A True Church</a> website, you won't find anything vaguely satirical as you will on Landover's. The <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westboro_Baptist_Church_20ea.html" title="Westboro Baptist Church">Westboro Baptist Church</a> has <a href="http://www.godhatesfags.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.godhatesfags.com/" rel="nofollow">a less credible website</a> than A True Church, but is just as notable for the controversies it has stirred up. As a matter of fact, they once both protested at the same <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Graham_526a.html" title="Billy Graham">Billy Graham</a> crusade, and people were confused by who was who because the signs they held up were equally offensive. (The Westboro Baptists and ATCers hate each other, by the way. <a href="http://www.atruechurch.info/godhatesphelps.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.atruechurch.info/godhatesphelps.html" rel="nofollow">[40]</a><a href="http://www.albertsoto.com/godhatesfags_al.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.albertsoto.com/godhatesfags_al.html" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>) --<a href="../../../q/r/c/User%7EQrc_11e9.html" title="User:Qrc">qrc</a> 16:34, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>P.S. If you're still not sure whether or not it's real, call the 800 number and have Darwin Fish preach to you in a recorded message. 1-800-HOW-TRUE.

<li>Indeed, Pastor David, it's not a question of what we believe. The sources, if you check them, do verify the validity of the article.

<ul>
<li>I don't question that the website really exists. I don't question that there is really some buy out there who is calling himself "Darwin Fish", be that a given name or a pseudonym. But is there any actual evidence that there is any real church building I can drive up to and that this whole thing isn't just a single guy's creation? --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 17:52, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>As an aside, switchboard.com says there is an individual named "Fish, Darwin" in Temecula, CA, but that's 134 miles from Lake Hughes, CA, which is the alleged location of this "church". --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 17:58, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I guess when he changed the name from God's Word Fellowship to a true church, he moved as well. Also, on the usage of the word "church": Biblically, the location of a church is the pastor's house. That's building you'd be driving up to. A "church" actually means a group of believers; it is not a building. --<a href="../../../q/r/c/User%7EQrc_11e9.html" title="User:Qrc">qrc</a> 18:35, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> - although it looks like a hoax, there are some references, and I think we have to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> in relation to the author's intentions. I've made the mistake in the past of labelling articles as hoaxes when they turn out to be bona-fide; I don't want to repeat the same mistake here. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 17:05, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, come to think of it, I'm not convinced it's notable enough - individual religious congregations don't usually get their own articles, unless they have demonstrable importance outside of the local area. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 17:07, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONG_d5cd.html" title="WP:CONG">WP:CONG</a> proposed guideline on this matter lists the following as a qualification for notability: "The church's teachings or theology is considered unique or notably controversial. The teachings should be of the individual church, not its denomination." As long as the congregation has accompanying external publications, which this one does, it appears it meets the notability requirements, since these external publications show the uniqueness of the congregation and the controversy that it stirs up. The Reformed Evangelist <a href="http://reformedevangelist.com/?p=224" class="external text" title="http://reformedevangelist.com/?p=224" rel="nofollow">wrote</a>: "If you live in the California area or have attended a Christian conference in CA there is no doubt that you have run into the “Fishites”, these Stormtroopers in sunglasses with huge signs reading – “God Kills”, Billy Graham Leads To Hell”, etc." So indeed, it does appear that this congregation has influence outside of its local area, assuming you believe the state of California to be a suitably wide influence. --<a href="../../../q/r/c/User%7EQrc_11e9.html" title="User:Qrc">qrc</a> 17:27, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The article intro itself would seem to assert a lack of notability.

From the sources that <a href="../../../q/r/c/User%7EQrc_11e9.html" title="User:Qrc">qrc</a> has provided, it's obvious that there is a person out there calling himself Darwin Fish and about whom there are at least some non-trivial media mentions. So even though the existence of this church is questionable and if it does exist, it isn't very notable, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin_Fish_a00a.html" title="Darwin Fish">Darwin Fish</a> might be a worthwhile article. If the decision here is to keep, we could move the article to <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin_Fish_a00a.html" title="Darwin Fish">Darwin Fish</a> and change it to be more about him and less of a copy/paste of his doctrinal beliefs. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 18:13, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>True, but it proves that he exists, and this existence is expanded upon in greater depth in other, albeit less reliable, sources. But I still really don't understand why you question the church's existence just because there are no big publications to prove it -- the Wikipedia guidelines for reliable sources should not act as guides for your own mind.

<li>You state that Mr. Fish actually exists, but this is not enough for the article to be kept. Notability is a central guideline -- mere existence is not enough. I exist, for example, but I am not the subject of an article. This is as it should be, despite the fact that you could find documentation proving my existence. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 19:10, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The reliable source proves he exists, and the allegedly unreliable sources show that it's not just him, but a whole controversial group of believers. That's how it is, and there's nothing more can possibly I show in defense in the article. --<a href="../../../q/r/c/User%7EQrc_11e9.html" title="User:Qrc">qrc</a> 19:13, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Your comment suggests that you have not read my comment. I stated that notability is the central criterion in the case of this article. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> states: "All topics must meet a minimum threshold of notability in order for an article on that topic to be included in Wikipedia." You may be able to attest to the truth of the information in the article, as you have repeatedly stated, but the debate is not about whether that information is correct, but whether the organization is notable. "A whole controversial group of believers" may be notable, or not, depending on the extent to which multiple non-trivial, reliable sources document them. You have provided one non-trivial, reliable source independent of the subject. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> requires "multiple" sources, and states that "The 'multiple' qualification is not specific as to number, and can vary depending on the reliability of the sources and the other factors of notability. " In this case, definitely <i>at least two</i> and probably <i>more</i> reliable sources are required. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 20:38, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Although the other sources are clearly not reliable, doesn't at least the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cincinnati_Post_f80a.html" title="The Cincinnati Post">Kentucky Post</a> qualify as a reliable source in addition to the Washington Post? --<a href="../../../q/r/c/User%7EQrc_11e9.html" title="User:Qrc">qrc</a> 23:17, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Though the source is indeed reliable (at least I think it is), the subject is really Mr. Graham, not Mr. Fish. Fish is quoted in the article as a commentator on the subject -- he is not himself the subject. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 00:19, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> does not seem to exclude reliable published works on the mere basis of who the subject of the article is. It talks about non-triviality, but in that arena it only excludes mere directory listings. Two articles quoting Darwin Fish and/or his church-goers as commentators on the Billy Graham crusade is more than a mere directory listing, and for this reason I think it checks out as mildly notable. Plus, the San Diego CityBEAT article addresses A True Church directly, and even quotes one of its members rather than just Darwin Fish. However, I am unsure of San Diego CityBEAT's reliability and could use help determining it. --<a href="../../../q/r/c/User%7EQrc_11e9.html" title="User:Qrc">qrc</a> 00:35, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>With all due respect, please note that <a href="../../../l/a/w/WP%7ELAWYER_7fd4.html" title="WP:LAWYER">lawyering</a> is not going to change our minds. My suggestion is to find other reliable sources that talk specifically about Mr. Fish, not talk specifically about somebody and Mr. Fish is simply being quoted about it. Like I pointed out in my&#160;!vote below, making a lot of noise isn't notable unto itself - it's just making a lot of noise. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 04:24, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You don't think that A True Church's staunch opposition to Billy Graham through protest is an accurate representation of the church in itself, and its beliefs? They are practically founded on exposing other people they believe to be false teachers. The Billy Graham protests are the best testimonies to the church itself.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Perhaps not a hoax, but we have only one reliable source -- the Washington Post article -- and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> requires multiple sources.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> The references prove nothing. The WashPost article proves the reporter bumped into a man calling himself Darwin Fish who claimed to be affiliated with "something called A True Church". There's no verifiable evidence of notability. If Fish and A True Church exist, has anyone noted it? I was once interviewed before voting in 2000, and got my name in the paper, just because I was standing line at the polling place. It doesn't prove I exist and certainly doesn't make me notable. If a reporter asked me to meet with him to talk about my great idea and the editor put that story in a notable periodical, THEN there's some evidence of notability. Has any reporter gone to A True Church to talk about what happens at the church? If so, cite it. --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 00:39, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Another reporter who bumped into a stranger in the parking lot at a Billy Graham event. The reporter also bumped into Yediydyah of The 12 Tribes of the Commonwealth of Israel. That doesn't make either church or person notable.

<ul>
<li>I disagree. Reporters bump into strangers every day, but they only write about the ones that matter. Darwin Fish and/or A True Church were considered notable enough for the Washington Times, Kentucky Post, and San Diego CityBEAT. And again on notability: A True Church is clearly not notable enough for <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, but it is still notable enough to fit the standards described in <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONG_d5cd.html" title="WP:CONG">WP:CONG</a>. --<a href="../../../q/r/c/User%7EQrc_11e9.html" title="User:Qrc">qrc</a> 21:04, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree. Reporters often mention the name of a single protester they bump into while covering a large protest, that doesn't mean that person is notable. The question is, would any of the papers picked up the stories if not for the Billy Graham context? I doubt it. Can you find a story in a notable publication that is ABOUT only A True Church? --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 03:09, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wow. Very unorthodox. But the only problem I seem to have is that the only notability they have is in that they are pretty much all about making a lot of noise. In reviewing the links, I find little more than that - and hey, I can make a lot of noise too, so that can't be all that notable. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 00:57, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The newspaper articles come close, but each, when read in full, is primarily about either a Billy Graham crusade or protesting at a Billy Graham crusade, and this group/guy just happens to be a current example. In the Washington Post article, only paragraphs 2 and 3 of 23 discuss it - this is a passing mention. Similarly in the Kentucky Post article, three of 23 paragraphs mention this group - again a passing mention. San Diego City Beat, relatively in the groups backyard, comes the closest to focusing on the group, but again is more focused on the issue of protesting. OnDoctrine.com is a single person's self published website, so not a reliable source by our standards - see their about us page. The FactNet link is a forum, not a reliable source by our standards. A Voice in the Wilderness is also a single person's website, self published, so not a reliable source for our standards. No non-trivial, reliable, independent, published sources primarily about the group have been demonstrated. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:31, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Some humor web site. It had been around since 1998 and is defunct since 2004. Was tagged with a speedy deletion tag, but I figured since there were lots of editors and the article has existed for almost a year (and, 1998 is moderately old for a website) I should move this to AfD because with a wider audience, someone may be able to clarify. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 13:38, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Ah, okay, there we go. This was nominated for a <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webby.html" title="Webby">Webby</a> award in 2003 in the Humor category. There were 5 nominees; the others were <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theonion.com.html" title="Theonion.com">Theonion.com</a> (winner), <a href="../../../g/e/t/Get_Your_War_On_0b55.html" title="Get Your War On">Get Your War On</a>, <a href="../../../o/d/d/Odd_Todd_2831.html" title="Odd Todd">Odd Todd</a>, and <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitehouse.org.html" title="Whitehouse.org">Whitehouse.org</a>. This is probably the most obscure of the 5, but that's a pretty impressive group. There are loads of categories of Webby awards, but the humor one has got to be one of the most competitive, so I think this getting a nomination is impressive. And I verified it: <a href="http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/winners-2003.php?y=2003" class="external text" title="http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/winners-2003.php?y=2003" rel="nofollow">look in the humor section</a>.

<li><b>Transwiki.</b> It's funny, I came across this article several months ago because I like reading about chess, and I thought it was fine. That being said, the rules are the rules, and it can't stay. (One significant problem is that it's a made-up game from textbook analysis, and wasn't actually played between two masters.) It could fit in Wikibooks in the context of chess. There are some real master games that are in Wikipedia and should stay there: for example, the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_of_the_Century_71eb.html" title="Game of the Century">Game of the Century</a> and the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immortal_game.html" title="Immortal game">Immortal game</a>.

<li><b>Transwiki</b>. WP is not a game guide. There are a couple of existing master games in WP, as noted above, and that seems appropriate. This made-up game does not belong. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 18:57, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>It is surely not <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> nor "made-up game" - most of it (perhaps except few last moves) is one of the oldest chess analyzes in existence, done by <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedro_Damiano_0199.html" title="Pedro Damiano">Pedro Damiano</a> already 500 years ago and since then cited without substantial changes. The whole game is probably taken from a chess book and looks like a standard introductory text without newly researched pieces of information. In fact it is not a "game" from the today's point of view, but rather a well known trap, already repeated thousand times against unexperienced players. I personally played the first moves for White at least three times, and the result was always similar.</li>
<li>This article is not a self-containig article, of course, but an important supplement to other articles. Let me allow to cite from its talk page: <i>Some paper encyclopedias have full pages which are not mostly text: maps, or diagrams of the legislative process, or little picture galleries with examples of eight different kinds of lace, or whatever. In the more vertical (and more nonlinear) format of a web browser it makes sense to put things like this on their own pages, rather than break up the main text column with them (and they won't necessarily fit to the side of it). So not every Wikipedia page has to be exactly an "article". The page Sample chess game does not belong on Wikibooks because it is not a textbook or part of a textbook. Rather, it is a supplementary document for the encyclopedia articles Chess and Rules of chess. Such supplementary documents should probably never be given featured article status, since they are not encyclopedia articles per se (thus I oppose this nomination), but there is no good reason to delete them, or to transwiki them to other Wiki projects whose stated criteria they are equally unsuitable for, either. (If anyone wants to get gung-ho about every Wikipedia page being an article per se, rather than some pages serving subsidiary functions, they will have to delete or transwiki all "List of" and "Timeline of" pages, to begin with.)

<li>Regarding YechielMan's idea to replace the game with a well known master game: In my opinion it is better not to overload the excellent master games with comments for beginners. I think that this old trap, repeated thousand times against unexperienced Black players, is well chosen for the purpose.--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 19:03, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>My opposition to keeping it rests with the original research problem. Providing reliable sources would remove that problem. If the article were trimmed down and sourced, it could be saved. Here are two sources: <a href="http://www.chesscafe.com/text/mcgrew11.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.chesscafe.com/text/mcgrew11.pdf" rel="nofollow">1</a>, and <a href="http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1271142" class="external text" title="http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1271142" rel="nofollow">2</a>. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 19:35, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>A few article have links to wikibooks. I don't see how moving it their would be a problem. The only problem I have with this page is that it is not sourced and doesn't seem like something that should belong in any encyclopedia. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Placebo_Effect_8620.html" title="User:The Placebo Effect">The Placebo Effect</a> 21:06, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is just as much an example of what you can and should to do IF someone plays the opening. I feel that the source is stated, it's not going to be found at master level because it is known not to play that. It isn't in many books because the same can be said. Just because it doesn't fit like most articles/example on chess is because black has very limited amount of possiblities. It is still a very accurate and detailed example of how white must play to effectively get a checkmate without black balancing out. I vote to keep this article. I am teaching chess to children and beginners and there just isn't other sources out there that have this information. It is not a sample of any chess game that I'd want to play as black. It is obvious to even a beginner chess player that it isn't inaccurate. I vote to keep this article (not delete it completely) and allow it to be edited as needed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.18.144.101_a87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.18.144.101">12.18.144.101</a> (<a href="../../../1/2/2E/User_talk%7E12.18.144.101.html" title="User talk:12.18.144.101">talk</a>)</small> 31 Jan 2006.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. My 'Transwiki' vote is already entered above. Those who are wondering if Wikibooks is really a good place to go for chess information should look at <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess/Basic_Openings" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess/Basic_Openings" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>. That page has nothing yet for the Damiano Gambit. Any links to the present article could be converted into links to the transwikied version at Wikibooks. One enhancement I would suggest is to explain that the Black moves in the present article are a terrible choice. Since the Damiano Gambit is a strategy for Black, he should at least play his best moves. I'm sure the article could be enhanced to point this out. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 23:32, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Also, merely having an HF station is not sufficient to establish activity at a national or international level, as required by WP:N.

<li><b>Keep</b> And expand, i think maybe there is more to Gwinnett ARES and many of the other ARES and even RACES. I think the scope of this delete is unfounded. I think we should be asking why delete rather than why keep. There seems to me to be plenty of documentation attached to this article of "national" even "international" interest. Is the goal of wikkipedia to be complete Not necessarily. Is the goal of wikkipedia to be as short and succinct as possible, maybe, but without loss of generality. I think by leaving this and other such groups out it devalues the hobby, by not allowing the recognition to be seen. ARRL is a national organizaion, to say not to use because it's articles are by hams (often about hams) is ludicrous. I dont think wikkipedia's intention is to dissallow all publications by hams in reference articles about ham radio. The scope of that is rediculous. Its like saying all articles about science cannot be written by scientists. I think i'd need to see some more convincing reasons to delete or merge. c8h10n4o2 17:59, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This page is very useful, but it could be better if it were split up into a bunch of pages by geographical regions and interest group categories. Obvious categories include HF, DX, VHF/UHF, Repeaters, Microwave, EME, Digital Modes, RTTY, PSK31, CW, etc. It is far too long as a single page. Its usefulness will improve if it is split into a bunch of pages.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Borderline case at first glance as it is mostly external links. But this is an encyclopedic topic, this is useful information, and a list like this does have a place in Wikipedia but would take up too much space in a more general article on amateur radio. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragomiloff_1fd6.html" title="User:Dragomiloff">Dragomiloff</a> 00:23, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Meets the criteria of being "encyclopedic" in that it provides broad based access to the scope and variety of Amateur Radio Organizations, Worldwide. It appears to have suffered from lack of knowledge by the organizations which should be listed, and secondarily the limited ability by those organizations to enter data in the required formatting. I suspect that now that many who were previously unaware of the page are aware of its existence and utility, it will gain entries with improved formatting and linkage as users learn to use the editing process more effectively. Perhaps the ARRL (American Radio Relay League) could assume a proactive role in better organizing and maintaining the data. RoyRetreat</li>
<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> It's a useful reference list and avoids cluttering the main article.

<p>Originally started out as borderline db-spam material but has since been reworked. However, it still shows little evidence of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>; <i>kernun firewall</i> returns just 74 unique Ghits. All but one of the links provided in the article are to the makers' websites and sites only marginally related. Article creator User:Trustednetworksolutions was blocked shortly after creating the article due to a commercial username, but appears to have created a new account User:Pepino Vavra to continue editing, which brings up <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> issues.

Other than being fairly wide spread across multiple sectors it is used by a number of major online publishers who (amongst others) take advantage of the unique theme engine which provides manual, semi automated and automated semantic relationships between content meaning extrememly high search engine visibility for content out of the box which has had a dramatic ROI implications (300% increase for www.moneyweek.com in subscriptions year one) - is that functionality notable enough?</li>

A company insider comes with the purpose of featuring their product in the best light, which clashes with the experienced editors' goal of building a neutral encyclopedia, leaving everyone involved unhappy.

The material there is basically similar to a press release and it appears that companies add their own information to that site. What is needed (and the time is running short) is something that is clearly produced by a disinterested third party.

<li><b>comment</b> The supplier directory at e-consultancy is indeed supplied by the companies, it is however moderated by e-consultancy staff pre-publication and is subject to strict editorial guidelines. The content managment report 'Web Content Management: the complete guide' is reserached, compliled and edited internally by e-consultancy staff, much like the CMS watch report, which is a trusted impartial resource. E-consultancy is indeed a disinterested third party, they are the leading UK online publisher covering online marketing and services and are of significant repute . You will also note that WORKSsitebuilder is a featured content managment provider at the e-consultancy site, this is again an e-consultancy compiled list. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_89.168.40.60_30c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/89.168.40.60">89.168.40.60</a> (talk) 13:00, 3 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: It is traditional that the Serbian Radical Party wins plurality in the parliament (it had before, it has now and it will probably have in the future).

<p>It's silly to delete this article. I just found it while doing research on sex workers. There's not a lot on Wikipedia on the topic and most of it is "up for deletion" because people have political problems with one side of the issue or another. I imagine that's what is going on here. There are many magazines and for-profit entities that are listed in Wikipedia. Why not this one? It won the Utne award, so it must be relevant in the indy scene. It's noteworthy in and of itself that prostitutes are producing it.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - nomination doesn't give any genuine policy reason for deletion. You could argue the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a> article was a violation of <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> using this nonsensical argument. The magazine has won an award, which is usually considered good enough.

<p><b>Strong keep</b> I have recreated this article again, however it gets speedily deleted sometimes within minutes of creation. Catriona Grant is a well known political figure in Edinburgh and socialist politics.

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree this should be kept. You could help its chances by wikifying it (links to <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Socialist_Party_334a.html" title="Scottish Socialist Party">Scottish Socialist Party</a> and other links would establish credibility). Then properly stubify at <a href="../../../s/t/u/WP%7ESTUBS_682a.html" title="WP:STUBS">WP:STUBS</a>. Then properly categorize to avoid an {{<a href="../../../u/n/c/Template%7EUncategorized_8ec2.html" title="Template:Uncategorized">Uncategorized</a>}} tag.

The article is basically a "Criticism of the Book of Mormon with regard to the KJV" (with only one source and serious POV concerns).

<dd>No, sorry, I disagree. I've looked at the articles listed above and my general conclusion is that the article nominated for deletion is not a POV fork (i.e. it is not an article created to push a POV that is not included in another article). The POV (that there are similarities between the Book of Mormon and the KJV) is represented in all relevant articles and this article is a subsidiary article to <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistics_and_the_Book_of_Mormon_c94b.html" title="Linguistics and the Book of Mormon">Linguistics and the Book of Mormon</a>. Thus, this is not a POV fork.</dd>

<dd>I don't particularly like the naming conventions used in the various titles and I suspect some restructuring of content between articles might be an improvement.

<dd>Alrighty, I'm fine if we keep it, I just wasn't sure if sufficient third party sources had written about it to justify its inclusion as a separate article. It's not so much a POV that there are similarities between the BofM and the KJV but what these similarities might mean/how they got there that is a little slippery in my mind... the article seems to exist merely to provide more detailed arguments against the historicity of the BofM based on these similarities... While I think the content could be covered more lucidly and in better conformance with NPOV in the body of <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistics_and_the_Book_of_Mormon_c94b.html" title="Linguistics and the Book of Mormon">Linguistics and the Book of Mormon</a>, I wouldn't have a problem with a well-sourced and more detailed article (emphasis on the well-sourced). If sources can't be found for the body of this article, I think that it should be shortened substantially (to avoid the appearance of a usenet discussion with little more than unsourced arguments/counterarguments). <a href="../../../g/l/d/User%7EGldavies_ddfc.html" title="User:Gldavies">gdavies</a> 01:57, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - the article certainly needs clean-up, but that's not a reason to delete. Agree with Richard that these articles need to be better co-ordinated as far as content, but this article seems to be an expansion of detail from other articles, rather than a POV fork. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastordavid_9d78.html" title="User:Pastordavid">Pastordavid</a> 23:42, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>If that's the case, I have no problem with keeping it. The problem I see is that it's sort of a side issue that hasn't gotten a lot of attention (only a handful of edits since it split off) and by its nature is difficult to find sources. <a href="../../../g/l/d/User%7EGldavies_ddfc.html" title="User:Gldavies">gdavies</a> 19:31, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>if not now, later someone will make an article about the Linguistic Analysis of the two texts (or more specifically, about the first text and its sources in the second text). The subject matter discussed is valid, interesting, documented elsewhere, and worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia, i.m.o.</p>

<p>I used a ProD tag, but it was contested by a IP user. My reason for nominating this page is simple: It reads like a game guide and is a list of monsters from a minor series of video games, which <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a>. Lists like these have appeared on the game's articles before, and are always deleted for the same reasons, so why should an article be made for it? <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperDT_9076.html" title="User:SuperDT">SuperDT</a> 19:14, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Doesn't seem like there's a sufficient assertion of notability for this publishing company. Author correctly points out that <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell_Magazines_5df3.html" title="Dell Magazines">Dell Magazines</a> could use more sources, but that company is an offshoot of the well-known major US publisher <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell_Publishing_066d.html" title="Dell Publishing">Dell Publishing</a>. No independent sources given for this one. <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 19:19, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
"...a sufficient assertion of notability" might have been addressed in recent changes to article deletion notes. In short, no Internet search (using various terms/phrases) on either firsts mentioned in proposed article resulted in any company or entity other than Punzhu Puzzles. I agree that Dell Magazines is indeed a large and well known U.S. publisher, and through their Wikipedia article you may visit their site to purchase their magazines, but is producing a product for profit (their firsts) more notable than providing various puzzle magazines for free? Or more notable than providing a copyright grant to freely share/copy puzzle magazines with others? I don't know. --Nanaimobar 21:34, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> right, sorry I have no idea how this is supposed to work. I'm the author of the article, Poslanik. there's plenty of info on the band on their official website (it's listed on the article you're about to delete) it's just in Russian so I guess that's a problem. The label for their albums is Sound Age Production but I'm having trouble finding their website. However, I have found a page on an online music dealer site that lists a few of the albums released by Sound Age Productions (<a href="http://www.redstream.org/Sound+Age+Productions_Label.php" class="external free" title="http://www.redstream.org/Sound+Age+Productions_Label.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.redstream.org/Sound+Age+Productions_Label.php</a>)

<li>Though I'm not convinced as to Sound Age being a particularly legitimate label, looking at <a href="http://www.last.fm" class="external text" title="http://www.last.fm" rel="nofollow">last.fm</a> it seems that this band has a popularity similar to those of other Russian bands that no one's deleted, such as <a href="../../../k/i/p/Kipelov.html" title="Kipelov">Kipelov</a> or <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epidemia.html" title="Epidemia">Epidemia</a>.

<p>The publications in Russian are so abundant that I won't even list it here. The point is: the band is known worldwide.<a href="../../../%C3%B3/%C3%B0/i/User%7E%C3%93%C3%B0inn_524f.html" title="User:Óðinn">Óðinn</a> 08:32, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Alex, don't be fooled by this Metal Archives Encyclopedia which User:Odinn refers to. It's like Wikipedia, registered users can add their own bands, if you read it carefully enough you'll notice&#160;:). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../k/n/e/User%7EKNewman_9692.html" title="User:KNewman">KNewman</a> (<a href="../../../k/n/e/User_talk%7EKNewman_5e52.html" title="User talk:KNewman">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KNewman_ca5f.html" title="Special:Contributions/KNewman">contribs</a>) 06:20, 1 February 2007 (UTC).</small>
<ul>
<li>Your point being? Yes, users add their own bands, so what? Their only criteria for inclusion is that the band in question is stylistically metal and that it has released its work. Now, the person who started this debate claimed that there is no evidence that Arkona's albums were not self-released. I provided such evidence in a clear and unequivocal fashion. The Metal Archives is a notable and reliable source as far as WP is concerned. Not only that, I also provided evidence of qualifying under two more criteria. Care to challenge them? <a href="../../../%C3%B3/%C3%B0/i/User%7E%C3%93%C3%B0inn_524f.html" title="User:Óðinn">Óðinn</a> 06:49, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article poses all sorts of problems with <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> because it was written by the website owner. It is also an attack site. However, in my view the test is notability. The URL has some notability because Shell went to court to try to obtain it and lost, which was reported widely. Does this mean that the WEBSITE on the url gets automatic notability and inclusion? Problematic: on one hand it had to have some content to win the court case, on the other hand I cannot see much discussion of the website itself as opposed to the URL case. Opinions welcome: especially if we keep this article advice on whether it should discuss the site the URL or both! <a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 20:08, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am the co-owner of the website and author of the article which is the subject of this proceeding. The website, its owners, and the domain name have been mentioned or the subject of numerous news or feature reports by major news organisations and news publishers e.g. The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Times, MSN Money, Yahoo, Reuters, The Gulf Times etc, plus many other publications and major websites around the world operating in many languages. The site has also been recommended by Fortune Magazine/MSN Money as one of two websites for information about Royal Dutch Shell Plc: the other site being shell.com. I will supply links tomorrow. The reports and the content of the Royaldutchshellplc.com article provide information on which a judgement over notability can be made. A further extensive article about the website and its owners is due for publication in a global specialist magazine within days, hopefully in time to be taken into account. It appears that the site will receive over 2 million hits this month. I will provide the exact figure on Thursday and will be able to provide proof on request. The website is also involved in multiple High Court Injunctions brought collectively by eight Royal Dutch Shell companies against a Shell reserves whistleblower Dr John Huong in respect of articles published under his name on our website. The defamation and other proceedings are not against us. However, a High Court hearing is due on 8th February when an application will be heard for my war disabled father, Alfred Donovan, who will be 90 in April, to travel to Malaysia to be cross-examined. The hearing will also deal with an application by Shell for Dr Huong to be imprisoned for contempt. I am not sure if the court proceedings are relevant, but I thought it best to disclose this in view of the imminent hearing. The vast majority of articles about Shell posted on our website are from major news organisations. I will try to calculate a percentage figure but it is probably above 97% overall. We have a Live Chat box which is used frequently by site visitors. Some Live Chat postings are anti-Shell. Some are anti-Donovan. All remain on display. Shell has an open invitation to supply rebuttals to any articles authored by us which we have promised to publish unedited. The site is entirely non-profit with no adverts, no subscription or any other fees; no donations are sought. We have operated websites relating to Shell for many years and have never approached them to sell domain names or anything else. Even if much of this information is not directly relevant, it might be of some assistance in considering issues. User JohnaDonovan: 23.55, 29 January 2007.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Kudos to John for his persistance but only one news article I can find that is ABOUT rather than just mentioning the site (<i>Rise of the gripe site</i> Prospect Magazine, UK - 23 Jan 2007). Nothing except the domain battle ( of which there are a great many ) seems to have caused a great stir and that is more worth an entry in the Shell article than a separate one . Site allegedly created as the founder had a grudge against shell where he has accused them of stealing business ideas and appears to be using the site to carry on a vendetta. No one <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> seems to be talking about the site, and also given the <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> issue, not an article for here. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">Peripitus</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeripitus_05d5.html" title="User talk:Peripitus">(Talk)</a> 00:05, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thank you for your friendly way of dealing with this matter. I had returned just to mention for the record that we publish all news stories about Shell, positive and negative. However, I will briefly respond to some of the points you have made. I will later today provide links to other articles mentioning or focused on the website. With regards to alleged stealing of ideas, Shell settled our first three UK High Court actions against them for 260,000 UK pounds plus costs. We also received a letter of apology from a Shell Chairman, Dr Chris Fay, for the way we had been treated. I doubt if you want to know more, but I will happily supply further information on request regarding why we still feel aggrieved and continue to exercise our right to criticise Shell on our website. Unfortunately it is a long drawn out saga stretching over a decade. Shell is free to sue us for libel if anything we allege on our website is without foundation.

<li><b>weak keep</b>.

<p>As the record on the article discussion page shows, I was up front from the outset in June 2006 in admitting bias and have on at least two occasions requested that someone else should redraft the article. There was mention at that time of it being deleted. I do not recall how far the process went. If it did go to a vote, that presumably is on the record somewhere. I said that I would accept a decision to delete without rancour and that remains my position. I will post the promised links later today. User: JohnaDonovan. 08.44, 30 January 2007.</p>

<p>This is an extract from the comments of "Stephen Parnell" on 27 January: <i>"I am not a Wiki editor and am relatively inexperinced as a contributor so I will leave further comment and action to those who are. But I would hope and expect that those who run this excellent website would remove your trivial and prejudiced entry as soon as possible."</i> It appears that he has decided - assuming he is a male - that it was not safe to leave it to more experienced contributors. Of course he is perfectly entitled to vote, but anyone who has read his less than diplomatic comments on the Royaldutchshellplc.com discussion page would have no doubt about how he would cast his vote, no more than they would about how I would vote. It is regrettable that he has still not had the good grace to apologise for his ill-tempered accusations against me which he now knows were completely untrue. I find it very disappointing in view of the universal good tempered, often constructive dialogue which I have previously found in encounters with all other Wikipedians. It seems fair to say that he and I do not get on. User: JohnaDonovan. 13.15, 30 January 2007.</p>
<p>Rather than clutter up this page with a list of links, I have compiled a list on a <a href="http://www.shellnews.net/blog/links.html" class="external text" title="http://www.shellnews.net/blog/links.html" rel="nofollow">separate webpage</a>. Apologies at the time taken to provide the links promised above, but other events intervened, coincidentally including a long interview with a journalist from a quality national newspaper. The contact results from the Prospect article. The intention is to publish a story about the website and the Sakhalin-2 connection this weekend. I have the emails confirming this development. However, on past experience the story could be spiked for any number of reasons, so both this and the other pending article mentioned above should obviously be entirely discounted from consideration at this time. I assume that if a collective decision to delete is made, then I could resurrect the article at a later date and provide evidence of further publication of major articles to support the claim of notability. If on Thursday the preparation of the weekend article is progressing and is likely to be published, I may ask for a delay in the decision process until Monday so that the article can be taken into account.

<p>Promised website stats for January 2007: Traffic viewed: Pages: 1,211,211: Hits: 2,046.347. Articles about Shell and related matters from independent news sources published on website since its inception: 12,800 approx. Articles authored by the Donovan’s which could therefore be considered biased: 300 approx. I estimated that our articles accounted for 3% of all articles published on the site. That was about right.

<p>NN college student/climber. Main assertion of notability is that she died relatively young in a climbing accident. Fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and WP is not a memorial. Very few of the external links are about her, and only sources are death notices from local and college newspapers. "Nicole Bloom" michigan gets around 120 Ghits. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 22:14, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> I think the notability is just barely enough. The coverage by her student newspaper and local newspaper verifies that the accident happened, and the dedication by the Nature Conservancy shows that, three years later, somebody still cares. I took out the irrelevant links. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 01:35, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Look at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> more closely, does she meet any of it? Not even close. College students die all the time, and memorials are up for just about anyone. This is not even close to being notable. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 03:07, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response.</b> A couple of points need to be clarified. First, what consitutes a "non-trivial" publication? We articles from a student paper and an unaffiliated local paper. Also, what is a newsworthy event? A hiking accident may or may not be newsworthy, depending on factors such as where it occurred. Third, what is the relevance of the biographical material? You see it as a memorial, but maybe it's appropriate context for the accident and the Nature Conservancy memorial. To some extent, I'm playing Devil's Advocate, because by a strict reading of the rules it should be deleted. However, I'm leaning more toward a "no consensus" approach. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 05:02, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete.</b> as clearly not passing <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, as there are only two articles published by a (very local) independent source about her demise (which, incidentally, has been pulled). I would also cite <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#MEMORIAL" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#MEMORIAL</a>. Perhaps she would have gone far had she not met with the mishap, but <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a> would enter into play here. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 04:30, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I think YechielMan makes a nontrivial argument regarding WP:BIO.

After I'm done, if it's still not up to standards, remove it with my permission. If I wanted to self promote, I wouldn't choose Wikipedia to do it with.

<li><b>Comment</b> WWE &amp; TNA have WP pages because they're the premiere organizations of a huge industry. They have high-rated cable TV shows. They sell PPV buys in the six-figures. Other promotions, like <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stampede_Wrestling_a63e.html" title="Stampede Wrestling">Stampede Wrestling</a> and <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Valley_Wrestling_f697.html" title="Ohio Valley Wrestling">Ohio Valley Wrestling</a> are notable for their history and/or associations with big promotions. Show us something worth keeping and we'll consider it. All we have now is a few storylines from two years ago and absolutely no verification that your promo exists outside of your backyard. Demonstrate noteworthiness, then worry about the plot details and character bios afterwards. <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECaknuck_4acf.html" title="User:Caknuck">Caknuck</a> 05:26, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Reply</b>I'm the person that runs the league, yes, but if you read, you will notice that I haven't bashed any other promotions or been biased in any manner.

<li><b>Comment</b> It's a possible conflict of interest in that you might be trying to include an otherwise obscure organization that you're personally involved in. (I have no idea if WKWL is of widespread interest or not, but nothing in the article itself indicates it's <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">notable</a>. Fixing that should be your first priority.) <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaligron_d32d.html" title="User:Saligron">Saligron</a> 01:57, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Reply</b> These WKWL pages hurt no one and are informative to the people in the Fulton County, KY area. They just don't happen to be important to anybody debating this on here, therefore they must be deleted. There's no article on Fat Krakker because I haven't had a chance to edit it yet. It WAS coming. If you notice, the article on Hickenbottom isn't finished yet, nor is the official article on the WKWL. Just because we don't sell out huge arenas doesn't mean we don't deserve a spot on this website. No, we're not listed under independent promotion lists because I don't have a promoter's license, however, I can still operate under conditions of law because I don't charge admission. I come from a small town, therefore the newspaper doesn't have an archive of news articles, but I have a feeling that even if it did, it wouldn't matter. I could post a link to a scan of the newspaper articles from the area, but it wouldn't really matter.<a href="../../../h/b/k/User%7EHBKidJr_5f96.html" title="User:HBKidJr">HBKidJr</a> 23:59, 29 January 2007<br />

Just let me say that Wikipedia is the encyclopedia that ANYONE can edit...that needs to be changed. It's not anybody's encyclopedia. It's the people that need to feel special.

<li><b>Comment</b> It is all very well to say that "the argument from free will" appears to be a well established philosophical viewpoint or "I'm sure sources can be found" but unless and until sufficient properly notable sources <i>are</i> found <i>and added to the article</i> this article really shouldn't be there. We can't have unreferenced un-sourced articles in Wikipedia on the basis that some editors believe that it would be possible to write an article that did meet the criteria for inclusion, unless someone actually does. The main reason I listed this as AfD is because an anonymous editor keeps changing it (in a mindbogglingly philosophically naive fashion) to what (s)he considers "the original version" of the argument but neither (s)he nor anyone else (despite the refs tag) has put in any references at all. Unless proper notable sources <i>are</i> found <i>and inserted into the article</i> we really should delete this. <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 06:50, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A lack of sources is not a reason for deletion (see <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDeletion_policy_5007.html#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_be_needed" title="WP:Deletion policy">WP:Deletion policy#Problem articles where deletion may be needed</a>). Note that WP articles <b>must be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a></b> and <b>should be verified</b>. If an article is unsourced, but there is no reason to question its truthfulness, and it is verifiable (as is the case here, where sources are readily available), then the appropriate action is not deletion but adding {{unreferenced}} to the article (unless the article makes controversial, libelous claims, in which case, those claims should be removed). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:33, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> NBeale, your comment makes no sense. “Unless proper notable sources are found and inserted into the article, we really should delete this”? If the article were deleted, it would be a lot harder to add sources, wouldn’t it? A simple Google search has proven that the article is not OR, so the next step is adding sources, not deletion. As for my edits being “philosophically naive,” they are nothing of the sort. You took a well-established argument based on specific definitions of omniscience and free will, then started qualifying and modifying those definitions, which had the end result of completely changing the argument. The argument from free will should be some form of the argument from various referenced pages, which includes (but is not limited to) the premises “an omniscient being knows the actions of individuals” and “an individual has free will to choose from multiple actions.” If you change either of those premises, you change the argument. 75.17.113.113 09:00, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Agree with above. I would also note that the argument for deleting articles for lack of sourcing is strongest where there is reason to suspect that the factual claims of an article may be untrue. I think this nomination should be withdrawn by the nominator. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 09:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the author of the article. I can confirm that the contents of the article is exclusively based on a summary, review and synthesis of earlier publications and thus is not original research. I have reread the article and removed or "hedged" anything that goes beyond the evidence. The reader will note that every single statement of fact is supported with references from peer-reviewed scientific journals. As for the limited point of view, the evidence marshalled is from many different sources and using many different techniques. Furthermore, where relevent caveats are clear. For instance, the sentence, "...a stream of diverse anatomical areas subserves motion perception" is followed by "However, the extent to which this is ‘pure’ is in question: with Akinetopsia come severe difficulties in obtaining structure from motion (Rizzo, Nawrot, Zihl, 1995). Thus the article does not argue for visual modularity but reports the evidence from the scientific literature, noting where the science is still unsure ("in question"). As for looking like a research article, I agree it is too much like a research article and I would welcome efforts to make it more encyclopedic.--<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeuropsychology_3e7f.html" title="User:Neuropsychology">Neuropsychology</a> 10:51, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I can hardly imagine, that an article about a single aria out of a larger opus would meet any notability criteria - though <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a> does not even mention arias. Yet: <i>Lyrics belong in WikiSource, but tend to be copyright violations</i> and <i>Songs are not generally notable, and should be listed under album or artist as appropriate</i> (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html#Music" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents#Music</a>) <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFordPrefect42_ba82.html" title="User:FordPrefect42">FordPrefect42</a> 23:29, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't know about Wiki policies (deletion, notability, etc.) but I found this article to be very useful. It was exactly what I was looking for: technical discussion and lyrics. I hope it stays somewhere (Wiki or WikiSource(?)), as long as it's easy to find again, at least with a hot link from a non-deleted, more notable topic page ("Magic Flute"? "Der Holle Rache ..."?). As far as copyright is concerned, isn't a libretto from 1791 out of copyright? I suppose a particular translation might be copyright protected (if less than 95 years old) but I don't know the source of the one supplied on the main article page.AdderUser 13:16, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I started and wrote most of this article. I believed (and still do) that the lyrics fall under fair use, but if not, I'd be willing to get rid of the translation. The lyrics themselves are no longer copyrighted, as noted below. Many musicians, myself included, find it very helpful when an article about an aria (especially on wikipedia) includes the lyrics. Musical scores normally do not have the lyrics organized aside, only under the appropriate notes. This format makes it easier to study, analyze and perform better. Also, I believe that the aria is famous enough to deserve its own article. True, the gist of it could be put into the Magic Flute article, but when an aria is famous enough, it deserves its own article. There's a reason why there's an entire "Arias" category in wikipedia. In short: 1) This arias is famous enough to have its own article 2) This aria is sure complex enough to be analyzed in much greater detail, thereby needing more focus by future editors to expand it which I believe can only be done in a stand-alone article 3) if the translation of the lyrics is indeed copyright violation and not fair use I'd be happy to remove it, perhaps supplying my own translation. This article should <b>not</b> be deleted. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn1987_cd2f.html" title="User:John1987">John Holly</a> 19:04, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Question</b>. Can you find a non-copyright or appropriately licensed (GPDL, Creative Commons, etc)? Can you provide some references showing its notable place as a distinct piece in and of itself? <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVassyana_7573.html" title="User:Vassyana">Vassyana</a> 11:33, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Non-copyright or appropriately licensed version of the lyrics translation? I guess that scouring the library for at least a distinctly old libretto translation could help; I myself cannot do that any time soon. The rest of the questions refers to references indicating the aria's notability? I'm afraid I cannot at the moment. Given enough time I could reference at least a couple of books. It'll be easy to just point out that every musical dictionary enlists this aria (along with Der Hölle Rache, Isis und Osiris and Die Bieldnis as notable arias) under The Magic Flute as a notable aria. Musical dictionaries might also mention this aria as an entry, being the first classical aria to use the F6 note. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn1987_cd2f.html" title="User:John1987">John Holly</a> 14:47, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Declined speedy A7 because he's apparently designed games and won an award. Looking closer, it turns out that the games are redlinked, and the award was from some film school.

<li><b>Strong delete.</b> The arguments for notability are unconvincing. More importantly, the article history reveals a clear <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>. The entire article was created by User:Diplodocusbones. The same user is also the sole creator of Edgar Lopez: Janitor of Souls, which links to the Leventhal page in several places. That article also has no other contributors, nor has Diplo made any other contributions at all. <b>For this reason I am adding Edgar Lopez: Janitor of Souls to this AfD nomination.</b> <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 01:24, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Both articles written by Diplodocusbones, are written in a neutral manner. If linking related articles is against your policy, then all links can be removed, it is not a problem. The reason Diplodocusbones created the Edgar Lopez: Janitor of Souls article immediately, is because you were complaining about all the red links in the Jonathan Leventhal article. <small>— Diplodocusbones (<a href="../../../d/i/p/User_talk%7EDiplodocusbones_d942.html" title="User talk:Diplodocusbones">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Diplodocusbones_3de8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Diplodocusbones">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The article is about one phrase in one computer game. It has no independent sources other than the game. Wikipedia is not a game guide, and should not have articles on every particle of dialogue in every computer game. Fails <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. "ILIKEIT' is not a substitute for meeting of the minimum standards for notability and multiple reliable independent sources. If kept, the article should be renamed to show the article relates to the game. If the article were rewritten to be about "a phrase dockside hookers use" it might be appropriate for Wiktionary, but probably not for Wikipedia, which is not a dictionary. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:25, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This topic may be notable, but there's no evidence the emphasis on its use on the Zork computer game is.
