<p>The result was <b>delete both</b>.

Honestly, this is all terrible <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">crystal-balling</a> and both articles contain almost nothing but unsourced speculation (every single sentence in the 2022 article has a {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tag!).

<li>Alas, the 2024 article actually has citations and some relatively meaningful discussion. The Olympics-unlike, say, the next Steven Spielberg movie-do get put into motion 15 years or more before the fact and articles like this should be dealt with as such. It isn't really ridiculous crystal balling.

<li>If the world explodes in 2021, none of this will happen. If it hasn't happened yet, it's inherently counter-factual. That kind of defies "fact".</li>
<li>The fact that a country is considering a bid is not really relevant. Countries which <i>make</i> bids may be relevant, but <i>considering</i> a bid is not particularly of interest, and only in the loosest sense verifiable.</li>

<li>Well, I appreciate your opinion, but I don't understand why a sourced statement that a city is considering a bid is not worth including here. If the world blows up tomorrow then there won't be any movies released in December but we still have articles on movies that haven't been released yet. --<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 07:07, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because saying "such-and-such is considering an Olympic bid" isn't really saying much at all. <i>Events</i> are relevant; <i>thoughts</i> are not. If they actually make bids, then that's relevant. Until they do, there's no real information here, even if that lack of information is well-sourced. If the world blows up tomorrow, then movies scheduled for release in December will still have been written, shot, and cut, and <i>that</i> is the information which goes into their articles. Until there are actual <i>events</i> related to future Olympics -- that is, until <i>actual bids are made</i>, there is no real meaningful content to these articles. - <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_65d1.html" title="User:CheNuevara"><font color="#F0B400">Che</font> <font color="#004411">Nuevara</font></a> 17:21, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Strong Keep</b> per Dmz5. Somehow, someone actually managed to put some helpful encyclopedic material in these articles. <i>Helpful</i> being the key word. And the words "if the world explodes in 2021" don't work with crystalballing, because then WP could never write about anything past, um, December 1, 2006. I am going to include an exact copy from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, because I think it's relevant here, and these articles clearly pass these criteria: <i>Individual <b>scheduled or expected future events</b> should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place. If preparation for the event isn't already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented. Examples of appropriate topics include <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_presidential_election%2C_2008_b6e0.html" title="United States presidential election, 2008">2008 U.S. presidential election</a>, and <a href="../../../2/0/1/2012_Summer_Olympics_3ebe.html" title="2012 Summer Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a>. By comparison, the 2028 U.S. presidential election and 2032 Summer Olympics are not considered appropriate article topics because nothing can be said about them that is verifiable and not original research.

<dd>So, then, you think 2022 and 2024 are more similar to the 2012 Olympics (whose location and schedule are known) than to the 2032 Olympics?

<dd>Even if the 2022 Olympics never happen, if we get close enough that <i>actual events surface</i>, ie, that <i>actual bids are made</i>, then that is relevant. <i>Making a bid is significant, but that hasn't happened yet</i>.

<li>Bzzzt, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">Straw man</a>! The 2008 US presidential elections is the next US presidential election. The 2022 Winter and 2024 Summer Olympics are <i>not</i> the next Olympic games. They are <i>next-but-three</i> Winter and <i>next-but-four</i> Summer games. My argument is that these events are <i>too far</i> in the future for us to reliably know anything about them other than the fact that they're pencilled in. In fact, if you look at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CBALL" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#CBALL</a>, it actually states that the next election and the next Olympics are appropriate topics, but that anything much further down the line than that is explicitly not appropriate. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_The_Wiki_Factor_8283.html" title="User:Chriscf/The Wiki Factor">cheese</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">whine</a></small> 03:57, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
