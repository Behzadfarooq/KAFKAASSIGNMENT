<li><b>Keep</b> - Ahem, but did you check out the actual web site? Here it is if you haven't bothered: <a href="http://s7.invisionfree.com/Whopper_Buzzes/index.php" class="external free" title="http://s7.invisionfree.com/Whopper_Buzzes/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://s7.invisionfree.com/Whopper_Buzzes/index.php</a>? You've got sections with 700 topics and 20,000 replies and you are saying that it's not notable? If you add up all the replies total, you are up to 91,606 posts. Now, if you were to compare this with, say, Encyclopaedia Dramatica, the comparisons would be favourable. It also has a second claim to notoriety besides mere popularity. Its also a word to mean a heightened state of bliss. I don't think we have any choice here. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 01:57, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why, yes. As a matter of fact, I did visit the site. Whatever made you think I wouldn't go look for myself? Yes, they do have lots of conversations and replies, but they only have about 500 registered members, which seems small for forum to rate inclusion here. As for the second "claim to notoriety," why would the name they chose have any effect on the importance of the forum? What source says it means "a heightened state of bliss"? <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_Stovall_1ade.html" title="User:Joy Stovall">Joyous</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/y/User_talk%7EJoy_Stovall_f76f.html" title="User talk:Joy Stovall">Talk</a> 02:43, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Message boards on the Web are a dime a dozen; this one needs some reason for notability beyond a narrow community to keep. (And "Whopperbuzz" sounds like it ought to be the feeling you get when you eat a <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger_King_5522.html" title="Burger King">Burger King</a> Whopper!) <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 02:21, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Whopper Buzz is a slang word in common useage in Dublin Ireland. Not only as its described on this page i.e. that was a whopper Buzz, meaning that was a good time, but also just as an exclamation of pleasure (for example... Jim: Here's the keys to my new Porsche Bob: WhopperBuzz!) I hear it all the time I dont think you can delete it its a real thing. As for the forum definition I'd make it a secondary meaning. What can I say... its a Dublin thing essentially. I never knew its origin so this page has done exactly what wikipedia's supposed to do. Share the knowledge! Llogic 03:15, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: It's really of no consequence that the board is active or not, at least to me.

I suggest you should remove the Vfd until someone with some knowledge about it can make a more informed decision, especially given that most Vfds end with articles being deleted. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 02:46, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

I spend a substantial amount of time on Vfd, and I can tell you that this article is definitely worth its nomination. I live in Monroe, and it's nice to know that someone's trying to get our city out there, but this article fails to accomplish anything and it offers no information in itself.

<li>Nominating something on AFD and admitting you don't know should attract experts. Anyway, if you're not sure and Googling doesn't help, the creator didn't do their job in starting the article properly with definition and useful sources. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:36, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Whoa, I think you're jumping to conclusions there. The fact that most AfDs result in deletions does not automatically mean that the deletion process is broken! It might, on the contrary, mean that most articles that are nominated for deletion do actually fail to meet official policies. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 13:07, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I live in Monroe; in fact, I live a mile from the complex mentioned in the article. If I don't care about it, what are the chances someone who doesn't even know where Monroe is will care about it? The way the article is written in first-person makes it sound like a self-promotion.

<li>Delete: 1) It's not an article, per MGM. 2) It's a purely local matter of purely local concern and therefore below the radar of an encyclopedia. 3) It's a bit of trivia and could conceivably be mentioned (in prose, discursively) in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monroe%2C_Michigan_45ee.html" title="Monroe, Michigan">Monroe, Michigan</a>.

But I wouldn't object to a keep, or to expanding this into a broader article on "Buddhism in London", or anything of that sort; to avoid bias, the bar for inclusion should naturally be set a bit lower for minority religions like Buddhism. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 13:19, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Please calm down. The restaurant exists and is verifiable. Last time I checked, there are no "restaurant inclusion guidelines" in Wikipedia. The text needs POV-cleanup, stubbing and categorising. If you don't want to do it, then just put {{advertisement}}{{importance}} tags and move on. --&#160;<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerfecto_bf9a.html" title="User:Perfecto">Perfecto</a> 01:06, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> advertising. Yes, Perfecto, there are no "restaurant inclusion guidelines", but Wikipedia is not the Yellow Pages, and while notability is not a criterion for inclusion, there is nonetheless a consensus of sorts that institutions of extremely local interest, such as single restaurants serving only a tiny district, are not actually encyclopedic. There are also no "limb inclusion guidelines", but that doesn't mean that I could write an article on my left elbow (it's verifiable, and it has appeared on television and in newspapers on numerous occasions!) — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 13:25, 2 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why can't you, if it's verifiable and received mention in reliable sources? Haeleth, a "consensus of sorts" is not a guideline or policy. The above shows that none of you are familiar with the topic to say the restaurant is unimportant — that's what the {{importance}} tag asks for. I've put the tags in. I hope someone with more sense can expand the topic before the AfD deadline. --&#160;<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerfecto_bf9a.html" title="User:Perfecto">Perfecto</a> 14:59, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>This is a bit of a strange one for AfD, but who knows where else to put it?

<li><b>Keep</b> It seems to me that the article's only problem is a Point of View issue, because of some of the writing in the main body paragraph being a bit too 'positively' biased. This however, according to Wiki rules, is not a problem that requires deletion. Moreover, if the group was advertising with wiki then we would find many links through search engines pointing to the wiki page; however we do not, and as stated previously the page has only had 40 hits. This to me does not represent an active attempt on the part of the film persons, (or whomever created the Rabbit Film Company article), to actively advertise the wiki article. Additionally, I also believe wikipedia in particular is supposed to be encompassing enough for even potential 'upstart' companies. Also, if the company truly had notieriety, then we wouldn't need Wikipedia to inform persons about that which they already know. Those are just my thoughts on the matter. So, in summary, this is all why I believe that the page, <b>not breaking any of the cardinal rules</b>, should stand relatively as is, except with a comment or a message somehow to fix the main paragraph bias.--<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillermz_dd6d.html" title="User:Millermz">Millermz</a> 02:24, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is very much a suprise to me that Wikipedia is supposed to be "encompassing enough for even potential 'upstart' companies". My understanding is that this is compendium of notable subjects, not a listing of two-guys-and-dog companies... and then, "Also, if the company truly had notieriety, then we wouldn't need Wikipedia to inform persons about that which they already know." I THINK you're saying that Wikipedia should NOT have articles on, say, IBM, because people already know about IBM?

<p>A search of the archives of 1500+ newspapers using the Newsbank database finds one mention for this party. The article was on obscure third parties and expended no more effort than quoting from party websites--should be noted that this party no longer even has a website. The "party" probably has one member and is not involved in any visible political activity. By its own admission: "has had virtually no success since its 1995 founding. It has no local chapters anywhere, no candidates for office, and no prospect of running a presidential candidate. . . . There is little to no prospect that we [sic] will be able to hold a convention anytime soon. . . .

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure of the qualifications for deletion for this kind of thing. If these were well established, then this would be an easy vote. If it says, for example, that every legitimate political party should be included, then this is an automatic keep. However, if it says that there is a certain membership requirement, then this would be an automatic delete. This kind of thing makes me think of <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_reform_5862.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion reform">Wikipedia: Deletion reform</a> and perhaps we should clean up how we do this. In my mind, personally, all political parties are legitimate, so long as they have ever stood for office, which this party has. But that doesn't mean it meets wikipedia requirements. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 05:09, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think that the only policy that really applies in such cases is that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. AFAIK there are no criteria for noteworthiness of minor political parties like there are for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">minor bands</a>. A political party that actually fields a candidate has met the basic good-faith test. Any political party, however quixotic, is inherently worthier than a garage band.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I've nothing against obscure political parties (even Jesus-worriers), but we delete bands that haven't had a certain amount of success because they're a form of vanity-by-proxy for their members. Same for books published on vanity presses. Self-confessedly tiny political parties shouldn't be treated differently. And no, political parties aren't 'worthier' than bands. Quite apart from the POV issues which that value judgement implies, a few guys (if it's more than one) that rant about Jesus clearly aren't worthier than a few students abusing a guitar and singing about how cheerleaders won't go out with them. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 09:58, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment: Good points there. But there is a thing that in Australia we have 2 very obscure parties, both with basically 1 member each, that are probably the 2 most well known parties in Australia - because everyone hates them. One is the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Nile_59b2.html" title="Fred Nile">Fred Nile</a> party and the other is <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Nation_326a.html" title="One Nation">One Nation</a>, which is basically just a dummy spit for <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pauline_Hanson_2918.html" title="Pauline Hanson">Pauline Hanson</a>. Nobody ever votes for either of them. Fred Nile is a jesus warrior who says some of the most ridiculous things ever heard of, while Pauline Hanson is a racist who thinks that aborigines should be "sent home" (they are the natives of Australia). So I don't think that we can absolutely say that 1 member parties are not relevant. Oh, and that's not to mention our little 1-person greenie, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Brown_5419.html" title="Bob Brown">Bob Brown</a>, who is seen as probably the most ethical politician in Australia. However, Bob Brown, unlike the other 2, actually got elected (and keeps getting elected). I know, this is probably different (slightly) but I don't know if we can say such things absolutely. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 10:43, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

However, what the guide says about the party doesn't lead me to think that the party is viable: "CAP founder Frank Creel wrote Politics1 in January 1999 that the CAP 'has had virtually no success since its 1995 founding.

There is little to no prospect that we will be able to hold a convention anytime soon. ...

<li><b>Delete</b> as unverifiable (I can find no evidence that supports the actual claims in the actual article, like the "oxford professor" stuff). An article on High Voltage Syndrome would be interesting, and I encourage someone to create it - but I don't think this is very useful as a starting point, as about 80% of it needs to be deleted anyway, which would leave the new article with one dubious sentence and a redirect from a misspelt name. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 13:39, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just for the record, there is no possible reclassification of Pluto in the works.

<li>Actually, I'm afraid you're incorrect.

<li>I beg to differ, but 4,000 members, even if verified, does <i>not</i> meet WP:WEB's criterion #2 of <i>5,000</i>. This is a low threshhold, since one expects most notable websites to have far more participation. And the <b>first resort</b> is criterion #1, "having been the subject of national or international media attention within the last 2 years", with "particular weight given to off-line sources of news". Slashdot, as its WP article points out, is a dubious source of accurate information, although it does have credibility in Madshrimps' domain. It would help establish this article's notability if other sources (especially print sources) were cited. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 09:15, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: First, what does a forum have to do with anything? The article concerns the site, which is a hardware site. They tell you how to overclock (woo-hoo! I have a molten pile of silicone, but I got an extra 2 hz!) and just do the regular advice thing. The site has a poor Alexa rank, and, again, Wikipedia is <i>still</i> not a web guide. This isn't about good websites and bad websites: it's about whether a site is so astoundingly famous that it's mentioned <i>outside of the web,</i> as things like Slashdot are. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:46, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable. My own forums have almost 1000 users and over 58,000 posts and we don't belong on Wiki either. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERasputinAXP_290b.html" title="User:RasputinAXP"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="background: maroon;">&#160;RasputinAXP&#160;</font></a> <a href="../../../r/a/s/User_talk%7ERasputinAXP_2a9a.html" title="User talk:RasputinAXP"><sub>talk</sub></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RasputinAXP_8e7a.html" title="Special:Contributions/RasputinAXP"><sub>contribs</sub></a> 22:02, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - this is an article the same as that one available for <a href="../../../h/a/r/HardOCP_c23c.html" title="HardOCP">HardOCP</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anandtech.html" title="Anandtech">Anandtech</a>. Alexa rating should NEVER be used to measure sites popularity as it can easily be cheated, the rating is based on users who use the Alexa banner, and visit your site. If you load up Alexa banner on ~12 PC's and keep a site open &amp; refreshed every 5 minutes then their Alexa rating will BOOM from 60.000 -&gt; 12.000 within a few weeks time. The article is about the WEBSITE, not necessarily the forums; they are but a part of the equation. It's not about size, but about quality and content. This IS the web, and not a webguide but an information collection, WIKI. Still have to see the first PC which became a (molten pile of silicone) just from overclocking, the guides are there to PREVENT you from doing damage, and to do it in a safe and controlled manner. For that alone the Overclocking guide on A64 is worth a spot in the wiki as being the most complete and step by step explanation on the subject. 14:15, 29 November 2005 (UTC) <a href="../../../2/0/4/User%7E204.124.198.28.html" title="User:204.124.198.28">204.124.198.28</a> 13:20, 29 November 2005 (UTC)Gamer</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Several things.... First of all I noticed you are a major contributor to the wiki page (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_204.124.198.28_263f.html" title="Special:Contributions/204.124.198.28">Special:Contributions/204.124.198.28</a>), but the fact that the majority of the work you've done is add the Madshrimps URL to other articles raises some red flags to me. Furthermore, <i>their Alexa rating will BOOM from 60.000 -&gt; 12.000 within a few weeks time.</i> -- that is why the suggested recommended guideline is 10,000 ranking, not 12,000. Finally, are you sure you meant <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicone.html" title="Silicone">Silicone</a> and not <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon.html" title="Silicon">Silicon</a>? I still fail to see why this is noteable even with your arguments. <a href="../../../h/a/c/User%7EHackJandy_33ec.html" title="User:HackJandy">HackJandy</a> 17:23, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> the Alexa example I gave can be found <a href="http://forums.silentpcreview.com/viewtopic.php?t=8897&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc" class="external text" title="http://forums.silentpcreview.com/viewtopic.php?t=8897&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc" rel="nofollow">here</a> and it was just that, an example of how easy it is to "cheat" Alexa ranking, take 20 persons who can get 100-150 PC's visiting your site every day and your ranking will be above 10.000, sadly, it's as easy as that, and with more people becoming SPYWARE/MALWARE aware, the Alexa banner is only installed by PC novists. The website discussed here is one where the average reader uses Firefox or a spyware free Internet explorer, in the eyes of Alexa those people don't count. While in fact, they do. <a href="../../../2/0/4/User%7E204.124.198.28.html" title="User:204.124.198.28">204.124.198.28</a> 11:39, 1 December 2005 (UTC)Gamer</li>

<li>"Famous" hasn't been a requirement since every elementary school this side of Pokemon started getting a consensus to keep. I'm a general deletionist but I won't allow state highways (even minor state highways) to be seen as less noteworthy or important or encyclopedic than the private K-8 school I attended a decade ago. Yes, I'm biased, I like roads and highways and I think their impact on our culture is underrated. This half-mile state highway has as much claim to encyclopedicity as <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addison_Elementary_School_136c.html" title="Addison Elementary School">Addison Elementary School</a>.

<li>Copyright Search working this morning, the author for <i>Smells Like Teen Spirit</i> is listed as " words &amp; music: Virgin Songs, Inc., employer for hire of Kurt Cobain, Chris Novoselic &amp; David Grohl. Which means Virgin owns the copyright and the guys were the authors. Copyright law requires the actual authors be listed, regardless of who owns the copyright, so we have to assume it is correct unless there is some evidence of a conspiracy.

<p>This is a pop-culture website that apparently has an Alexa rating of 65,000 and no cited print references, suggesting it hasn't risen to an adequate notability level based on our draft <a href="../../../w/e/b/Wikipedia%7EWebsites_fbda.html" title="Wikipedia:Websites">Wikipedia:Websites</a> policy. I suspect at least one of the participants in the site content (<a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Valdronius" class="extiw" title="q:User:Valdronius">User:Valdronius</a>) is also editing its corresponding <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/SydLexia.com" class="extiw" title="q:SydLexia.com">Wikiquote article</a>, which isn't strictly against policy but further makes me suspect its true notoriety.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know anything about it. I just always check things before voting. I think too many people make ill informed votes and it upsets the voting process. I did re-write the article a little though. But it does appear to be a very popular anime series. All of the google hits are about it. It has its own product range, at least 20 fan sites, is well and truly published. Rather than a speedy delete, it should be the opposite, a speedy keep. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 08:27, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Just going to make another comment here. This article is a perfect example of the difference between a poorly written article and a topic that is of no encyclopaedic value. The article was terribly written (still is, really, its just a stub after my partial rewrite). But people voted on it because they didn't check. Simply google search finds it. Rather than a Vfd, it should have been asked for a cleanup and some stubs. Yet the first 4 votes were all for speedy delete. This says to me that we have to rethink how we go about the voting process, if this was nearly speedied. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 08:30, 28 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think it was entirely wrong to want to speedy it since it qualifies under the no context category, and it was hard to figure out what to do a google search on when the article was almost complete nonsense. If people don't want their articles speedied, then they should write them according to Wikipedia guidelines. By the way, good job with the cleanup.&#160;:-)--<a href="../../../a/l/h/User%7EAlhutch_2589.html" title="User:Alhutch">Alhutch</a> 08:35, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, just out of interest here, the article in its original form, was describing the latest episode, from what I could gather from the references. It was saying the latest thing that happened. Anyway, but the thing is that the topic is encyclopaedic. If it had been speedied, and then someone later on had created it, as a valid article, then it'd be deleted as vandalism (assuming that nobody thought to make a request for undeletion). IMO that's the problem. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 10:04, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Not so. If an article is recreated afteer a deletion, and it is substantially the same, ie, a recreation, it will simply be re-deleted. If the article is substantially different, it counts as a new article. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green">☯</font></a> 05:31, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually, just to comment on this. I created an article on Mediacrat a while ago, not realising that it had previously been deleted, and the content was entirely factual, something which was patently not the case in its original creation by a person who was trying to smear his name. The article was speedy deleted with no vote and I was warned for vandalism - in spite of not realising it had previously been deleted, and secondly creating an entirely different article, and one that was sourced. So its not actually true then. If I can be warned for vandalism for recreating an article that I didn't realise was deleted, for creating it in an accurate manner, and for creating it in a manner 100% different to the original article, then ergo what you say is plainly not true in practise. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 08:54, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

The information you pulled about unique visitors was from the HEXUS website as well, which does not really strengthen its case.

<li><i>Comment/question.</i> What would qualify a web comic for inclusion in Wikipedia as "notable"? What would be the minimum for a "traditional" comic strip to be considered for consideration for inclusion?</li>

<p><i>Is</i> a high/low Google search hit a valid criteria for the definition of 'notable'? 6 of the hits on the first page of Google search for <b>Panda Xpress</b> are relevant. The webcomic is notable because of its format which offers something different and firmly "untraditional". My opinion. YMMV. --Trishtrash 14:25, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The high/low Google search hit is only an additional criterium. The comic has only been around for a few months and it only amounts to 75 strips. THe strips aren't half bad, although they are far from great. I would think that maybe in a year's time when the comic proves its longevity it can be considered notable. I just simply don't think that just because something was published it is notable. I for one used to run a blog that was visited by more people than this comic.....does that warrant a Wikipedia article? <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChelman_8a03.html" title="User:Chelman">Chelman</a> 18:56, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Perhaps it would be worth allowing the entry time to grow into something 'notable' before crying for the entry's deletion? It does take time to type in thing like character summaries, history, storyline and whatnot. A wikipedia entry is a valid outlet for a webcomic, as evidenced by the existing entries for such 'cult classic' gems as Casey and Andy, Sluggy Freelance and Queen of Wands as well as the more mainstream webcomics like User Friendly and Penny Arcade. 67.168.36.17 16:20, 28 November 2005 (UTC)Eleri, Queen Pimper of Panda Xpress</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm still unsure whether 'readership' is fixed as a policy for keeping a webcomic-related article... if I may put the system on trial for a moment here; an encyclopedia is where one turns for the obscure and interesting as much as the widely known (I came to Wikipedia looking for an entry on Panda XPress, and decided to start one when it couldn't be found) As a web-based resource, Wikipedia should be courting this natural turn-to position as an authority on everything within its own medium. 'Notable' may be up for discussion, but 'not enough people know about it' sounds like faulty reasoning for an encyclopedia entry. Again, my opinion only. --Trishtrash 10:47, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There's enough unique about Panda Xpress' graphics, layout, story and characters, not to mention it being the first 'self-writing webcomic' (as referenced on <a href="http://www.digitalstrips.com/2005/10/podcast-digital-strips-show-43.html" class="external text" title="http://www.digitalstrips.com/2005/10/podcast-digital-strips-show-43.html" rel="nofollow">"Digital Strips show 43"</a> to make it noteable in its own right as an emerging webcomic, without needing a high readership.</li>

<li>I don't believe it should be deleted - those posting for its deletion clearly do not know much about kick boxing.

<p>non-notable vanity. Subject is apparently a semi-successful memory act; no doubt he can remember how many other such acts exist (although perhaps not, since he claims to be notable mainly for forgetting things). Biggest claim to fame is trying to remember Pi to 42,000-odd places and falling short by some tens of thousands. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 11:47, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. His claim to fame got him on the BBC news website - and 'mentioned' is a bit harsh, he got a whole article to himself. So it's above the normal standard of vanity pages. That said, there are huge numbers of people have <i>failed</i> to break records, and huge numbers of people that have been on news websites as an 'oddly enough' story. Still, IMO, worth keeping to break up the identical articles on local buildings and roads. Oh, and also keep Denni's Uncle Hector if he has a BBC news article about him. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 09:54, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's verified that he exists and that he's been noted as a humourous loser by external sources. Maybe it's unverified that he's a vaudeville act and has appeared on 'numerous' television programmes, but it appears far short of some guy making stuff up about himself. What tips the balance for me is that I actually <i>enjoyed reading about the guy</i>, which beats Jason Gastrich and his ilk. For me to vote delete on a subject I enjoyed reading about and has a claim to notability, if small in this overlarge world, would need much more than the fact he's only had '15 minutes of fame' (which is more than <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_UK_series_6_8d5d.html" title="Big Brother UK series 6">Big Brother contestants</a> get). Really, IMO he seems noteworthy as the <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_%27the_Eagle%27_Edwards_e26d.html" title="Eddie 'the Eagle' Edwards">Eddie the Eagle</a> of vaudeville, part of the grand tradition of British noble losers. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 00:18, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was No consensus, defaults to keep. I was tempted to re-re-list this, since even after two trips through AfD, it got precious little participation, but I suspect it won't get any more attention the third time. If anybody feels stongly that this should be deleted, don't even bother with <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>, just go ahead and relist it on AfD again. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 02:20, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I would support the merge with <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Friday_29ef.html" title="Black Friday">Black Friday</a>'s entry. It's been well used (as BD2412 points out) in media outlets this past week. It doesn't seem likely that the internet or internet shopping will go away anytime soon. Note: Cyber Monday, as NPR and others have explained is due to the fact people shop online from work on Monday because broadband access is not yet universal. With the continued decline of dialup and increase of cable/dsl it is likely that "Cyber Monday" will only remain as a historical term used for a short period of time. Could be that next year enough people have broadband at home (and don't need to use the resource at work) and the Cyber Monday effect will be greatly reduced.Jon@bostonist.com 19:07, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm not a usual poster here, and I'm not sure if I'm posting correctly on this page - but I'm a television producer with the FOX owned station in Greensboro, NC. I've spoken with Scott Krugman, a PR guy with the National Retail Federation's website shop.org. Krugman told me the Executive Director of shop.org coined the phrase 3 months ago to describe a trend first noticed last year. I pressed Krugman about "Cyber Monday" being completely manufactured by the NRF. He says NRF is hesitant to talk about coining the phrase, because it doesn't want "Cyber Monday" to appear to be a "Hallmark Holiday." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 216.237.209.32 (<a href="../../../2/1/6/User_talk%7E216.237.209.32.html" title="User talk:216.237.209.32">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.237.209.32_7a9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.237.209.32">contribs</a>) 19:19, 28 November 2005 (UTC).</small></li>

As I have never heard of this term prior to this year, it seems like its some random term coined by the major retailers to have an excuse for a sale. I think wikipedia should take a stance against this and just merge it with Black Friday. The faster it dies, the better.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This is a flash-in-the-pan term that only has legs <i>this year</i>, because of an easily rebroadcast story in the media. It's a fake meme, based on the faulty assertion that shoppers are flocking to online sales after they return to work. <i>No one has even substantiated that the phenomenon actually exists</i>. This to me is a red herring marketing term that has no reality outside the stupid media story that generated it. This is especially clear from ludicrously dated use of <i>cyber</i> which itself is deprecated among the online community. Wikipedia should delete this one with extreme prejudice. <a href="../../../r/c/h/User%7ERcharman_55dc.html" title="User:Rcharman">Rcharman</a> 17:32, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Rcharman, it is precisely BECAUSE this meme has grown so quickly and so fast that Wikipedia must address it. I for one only learned Cyber Monday was a gimmick from Wikipedia. Wikipedia can have urban legands and "false memes," as long is it debunks them. It's an important role for the pedia to play. 64.59.209.89 18:01, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Unfortunately this term has legs, and because of its...*sigh* notoriety we'll have to hear about it until the end of the year.

<li><b>Keep</b> The term exists and will likely not go away. As long as the article reflects the true meaning of the word and misleading history behind its adoption (as I think it does now), it should stay. 18:22, 29 November 2005

<li><b>Comment</b> Can it be proven that it will stick around? Other internet-coined turns have since gone the way of the Dodo (Information Superhighway anyone?). From what I can tell Googling it, most discussion seems to be of the "WTF, where did this term come from?" variety, as well as many news articles talking about this sudden new term.

<li>It's a name taken from a already widely used name. It's trying to play off the popularity of Black Friday. That's the connection.

<p>Was tagged for speedy, but doesn't really qualify. What we have here is a subliterate rambling on something from Mortal Kombat. "Character" is a bit of a stretch as characters tend to have character, which it seems this does not. Maybe if rewritten it's suitable for a merge somwehere. But to have articles on stuff like this when we don't have any on many, many major characters from significant works of fiction (nor on many major works of fiction themselves) is stupid. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:20, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are 2 problems with the argument "we can't find any evidence of the term's widespread usage":</p>
<p>1. At some point in the history of every word/phrase only one person used the word or phrase and there existed no widespread evidence of the term's usage. Consider, "If the shoe fits, wear it." The term is fairly common, but at one point it wasn't. It was at the time of it's inception a term with a concrete meaning none the less. SGGF has a concrete meaning and we established its meaning. It is a very real thing and a very real phrase. We are the sources, right here. We've verified the term's existence.</p>

<p>2. Saying, "because we can't find it being used on the internet", seems silly because the users of the term are all in graduate school or work full time jobs. They don't have time to sit around blogging their daily lives. It's only now that I've turned in all my term papers that I've got time to type anything. Now, consider that the people we are most likely to spread the term too are our classmates and coworkers who are all just as busy as we are, and what you see is a term whos "target audience" is a non-blogging community. Perhaps if we were all 10 years younger, or all dot com wizards the situation would be different.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless someone can quickly provide the objective reference (reports on polls, perhaps?) for each entry demonstrating why each person on the list is objectively determined to be "a hero."

<li>A fictional "hero" is not the same thing as a non-fictional "hero". It is possible to identify in a reasonably objective manner whether a character fulfils the role of "hero" in a work of fiction. In real life this is not so easy, and is inevitably subject to POV. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyano_6ec4.html" title="User:Ryano">Ryano</a> 13:22, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think the main difference between the two is that references to fictional characters as heroes, anti-heroes, or villains can be found in scholarly journals and cited within those respective lists, whereas no such thing is even theoretically possbile for this one.

<li>Not necessarily. The American Heritage Dictionary lists the following applicable definitions for the word "hero":</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>In mythology and legend, a man, often of divine ancestry, who is endowed with great courage and strength, celebrated for his bold exploits, and favored by the gods.</li>
<li>A person noted for feats of courage or nobility of purpose, especially one who has risked or sacrificed his or her life: <i>soldiers and nurses who were heroes in an unpopular war.</i></li>
<li>A person noted for special achievement in a particular field: <i>the heroes of medicine.</i> See Synonyms at celebrity.</li>
<li>The principal male character in a novel, poem, or dramatic presentation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Under the first definition, you'd only have a list of people from mythology whose existence can be verified by historical record. Under the second, you'd add soldiers, diplomats, and political activists. Under the third, it'd consist of almost everybody notable enough to merit a bio on Wikipedia. Under the fourth, you could add any real person who's ever been the subject of a fictional work, be it <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Manson_8fd5.html" title="Charles Manson">Charles Manson</a> or <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedict_Arnold_6b5d.html" title="Benedict Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a>. Furthermore, under the traditional usage of the term, it is impossible for a woman to be a "hero", as the term was at one point applied exclusively to men. Without extensive clarification and codification, it's an unmaintainable swamp, and that's looking beyond the obvious and inevitable POV issues if/when someone decides to add a problematic or controversial figure like <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasser_Arafat_cf67.html" title="Yasser Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a> or <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Robeson_b580.html" title="Paul Robeson">Paul Robeson</a> to the list.

<dd>As you mention, you could include many many people under these definitions in the American Heritage Dictionary. However, in reality, when people refer to heroes in their own country, or who they can think of, relatively few names comes up. In other words, the people set higher criteria. As far as women are concerned, there are plenty of examples, eg, <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madonna_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna</a> (pop star), who is listed, and from fiction, who better than <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunhilde.html" title="Brunhilde">Brunhilde</a> riding through the clouds on a white horse to the theme of <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalypse_Now_a6a5.html" title="Apocalypse Now">Apocalypse Now</a>. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWallie_96b2.html" title="User:Wallie">Wallie</a> 21:10, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Easy. They are all heroes. Stalin was considered by nearly every allied leader towards the end of WW2 to be a hero for his defeat of the Germans in many major battles including Kursk. Naturally he was a hero in the Soviet Union itself at the time. To put him off the list because of subsequent events is revisionism. The list as it stands at the moment is very good.

<li><b>Strong delete</b>, inherently POV, lacks any useful inclusion criteria. Jesus and Stalin do not belong on the same list; nor do the designer of the Titanic and mythical figures like Aeneas. Hardly any of these people are "non-fictional heroes" in any sense - some because they were probably fictional, others because they are considered villains by a vast number of people, others because they are universally respected but not considered "heroes" as such. Sorry, but this is just irredeemable listcruft. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 18:21, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This vile Beast Man "rapper" named The White Dawg seems to be merely a continuation of the vulgar racism of the sad "minstrel shows" of past times. I was distraught when I saw this article which suggested that his filth was being peddled to schoolchildren in an attempt to corrupt the youth. However, upon some investigation of my own, it seems that there is no evidence whatsoever that the information here is even true, and perhaps this is just a hoax spread by The White Dawg himself, who maintains a wikipedia account at <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrowardPlaya_b00a.html" title="User:BrowardPlaya">User:BrowardPlaya</a>.

<li>There are a number of ideas that a small number of authors have discussed that have very little to do with Jewish history, and much more to do with Christian history. The other article is a very good article on Jewish scholars' writings. I would like to set this article up to represent various arguments among Christian scholars. It will be controversial enough among Christians. There will always be references to the other article due to the fact that the history is longer, and Christian theology is a derivation of Judaism.--<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevhorn_10b0.html" title="User:Kevhorn">Kevin</a> 19:06, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>But if these ideas branch off from the general concept of Noahide Laws, that article would still be the most appropriate place for it. I suspect the number of Christian scholars that has seriously looked at the Noahide Laws is vanishingly small. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 22:35, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>The problem arises when a Christian, searching for information on Christian history of observance, must read through a long list of Jewish thought and history. Most of the writings are C.E., and therefore not really pertinant to Christians. Most Jewish subjects are primarily referred to the Hebrew (as in Brit Noah); Why is this one different? What if a user searching for Jewish thought on Brit Noah, had to wade through several paragraphs of Christian writings? What if the editing were done by mostly Christians, who refused to understand or allow anything that violated Christian thought on the subject?--<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevhorn_10b0.html" title="User:Kevhorn">Kevin</a> 22:53, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You were the one who wanted to tie early Christian history in with a Jewish concept. The reader will need to read about the context anyway. And for the user searching about Brit Noah, the Christian stuff is at the end of the article. We don't split articles for perceived reader's convenience.

<li>You are correct JFW, there is a lot of obstinate editing going on around here. Christians aren't the only editors expressing a definite POV. Yet, rather than split hairs, I think the article is less about Noachian Law than is about Primitive Apostolic Christianity. So I have moved the article to that title. I know it will not satisfy the majority POV crowd, but it may better fit the description. Have and will add more quotes, and bibliography as time permits before being edited.--<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevhorn_10b0.html" title="User:Kevhorn">Kevin</a> 21:48, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Grins at being called obstinate</i>. I'm not sure if you should call the majority here a "POV crowd". Most of us can spot original research fairly well.

<li>This a democratic (or perhaps more of a representative republican) process, so majority rules, and the majority have their own point of view about what constitutes <i>original research</i>. What makes me smile is that there are plenty of articles on Wikipedia that have little or no documentation from other sources, and express an opinion. Original research, and POV are in the eye of the beholder's paradigm.--<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevhorn_10b0.html" title="User:Kevhorn">Kevin</a> 23:45, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That is indeed a big problem on Wikipedia, and we're working on it. In the meantime, new additions to potentially controversional articles get the scrutiny they deserve under Wikipedia policy. You are completely incorrect about POV and NOR being in the eye of the beholder's paradigm. They are not, and that is why Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and not a blog. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 00:56, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>There you go again, JFW; I think it would be better to leave out the superlatives, and say that Wikipedia strives to be an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevhorn_10b0.html" title="User:Kevhorn">Kevin</a> 01:29, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What was superlative about that? And you were really very wrong about NOR and NPOV.

<ul>
<li>It would be beneficial for you to observe things from beyond your own paradigm, JFW. <i>Completely</i>, <i>very</i>, and <i>really</i> are often used as superlatives and in the cases above, yes. I would admit to being partially, or maybe incorrect; yet, I think even the POV majority would agree to me being correct at times.--<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevhorn_10b0.html" title="User:Kevhorn">Kevin</a> 02:02, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Like you, I don't really like being patronised. Part of being human is being incorrect, and sometimes this is due to paradigm. But leaving epistemology for what it is, NPOV and NOR demand exactly that: being impartial and factual. This is hard. I know from personal experience. Anyway, we have strayed (<i>substantially</i>, to use another nice superlative) from the subject of this discussion, so I'm going to do something else. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 02:41, 1 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am in almost total (a conditional superlative) agreement, and yet I would say, just do not leave epistemology for what it is. For without understanding the origins of our thoughts and our words, we will always have difficulty understanding each other. What NPOV and NOR demand is far from what is practiced, and I can give examples as I have in the past of violations even in the Noahide article. If we can agree on this, then we may even agree on most. This is not a necessary discussion, and yet it is essential to understanding!--<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevhorn_10b0.html" title="User:Kevhorn">Kevin</a> 03:10, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>So you're saying that Wikipedia cannot be a primary source, do I understand that correctly? However, wikipedia is promoting it's own research about Wikipedia itself. The main difference is that they are more than one person, and they run the site. Once somebody adds to the article, and yes they can add references, so can I. Then it's no longer just a proposal, instead, it becomes an article that is rigrously grounded in references and examples. The "proposal" should be turned into an "example". --<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmarinas86_d325.html" title="User:Kmarinas86">Kmarinas86</a> 00:45, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>One of the several things that our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:no original research</a> policy addresses is the fact that Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia. It isn't an academic journal or a thinktank. It has no facilities for performing peer review of new research, new ideas, new concepts, new analyses, new interpretations of data, and so forth. Wikipedia is not the place for you to write up your idea for a new tax and then ask for other people to review that idea and to add to or to modify it. It's an encyclopaedia. Its articles deal with ideas for which that process of review and refinement has <i>already</i> taken place <i>somewhere else</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:49, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia does not require the references to be "peer reviewed" references as in peer review by scientists in a certain field. But they can be from legitimate sources, such as books or magazines which dicuss the same issues. There has been a problem with the corruption of Coroporate Welfare by the government. The equation:<img class='tex' src="../../../math/6/9/6/696ce97ac19d1aa5f0214ef6806d4f79.png" alt="\frac{profit}{sales}*\frac{profit}{expenses}*\frac{x}{100} = Corporate Tax" /> <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i><i>e</i><i>r</i><i>s</i><i>o</i><i>n</i><i>a</i><i>l</i><i>a</i><i>n</i><i>d</i><i>F</i><i>a</i><i>m</i><i>i</i><i>l</i><i>y</i><i>I</i><i>n</i><i>c</i><i>o</i><i>m</i><i>e</i><i>T</i><i>a</i><i>x</i> = 0%</span> Is one possible <i>example</i> for solving the problem of "corporate taxes" and how they influence inflation by <i>not</i> adjusting to the financial demands of employees' (expenses). I'm sure there are more Economics sources for which this has been discussed for before. When a concept is supported by more than a few, then it can no longer be considered as new as it once was. Newness is rather temporary, and eventually this article will not be new anymore, and it may have people making references to it, further justifying the article's existence. You realize that this encyclopedia "Wikipedia" is not finalized, as all encyclopedias are edited and reviewed before they are published. Wikipedia cannot be compared exactly to an book encyclopedia simply because the fact is that editing and reviewing by other members doesn't stop unless access to the website is unavailable. There is no point where we go, "Let's publish Wikipedia it's finished".

<p>This article appears to be an uncommon neologism at best, and nonsense or a hoax at worst. Googling does not show any sign of this usage, although it does, for example, mention "rubber ceiling" in the sense of a [literal] ceiling made of rubber, or a career obstacle in the path of balloon artists <a href="http://www.balloonhq.com/column/mkenyon/oct05/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.balloonhq.com/column/mkenyon/oct05/" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>. Indeed, a Google search for "rubber.ceiling handicapped" shows no usage other than that of a literal ceiling made of rubber (for safety), and copies of this article, or links to it in other articles. As a relative of someone who is severely mentally handicapped, this seems like a poor subject for a joke. The mentally handicapped have problems greater than "unofficial barrier[s] to [...] upper management or other prominent position[s]". <b>DELETE</b> -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 23:39, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>of which all the first 20 seem to probably really be him. I see him, so far, as the kind of probably very highly trained professionals who do extremely important and high-responsibility work without making significant independent decisions in any areas that are controversial within their professions. The single thing that i've seen so far that goes beyond that is that he has authored at least one op-ed-sounding piece for a newspaper that's world-class or nearly so, suggesting that his work in the trenches may have equipped him to be an opinion molder.

Here is a sample, his mention only in footnote 101, which i copied from p. 45 of <a href="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:Svd0Xh6FP8sJ:trade-info.cec.eu.int/doclib/docs/2004/february/tradoc_115936.pdf+%22Abdulqawi+Yusuf%22&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:Svd0Xh6FP8sJ:trade-info.cec.eu.int/doclib/docs/2004/february/tradoc_115936.pdf+%22Abdulqawi+Yusuf%22&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">the Google-cache of # 75 of about 208, a PDF headed "EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES – CONDITIONS FOR THE GRANTING OF TARIFF ..."</a>:

<dd>Commenting upon Paragraph 3(c), Abdulqawi Yusuf, (op.cit. p.91) notes that Developed countries wishing to accord preferential treatment are required to do it in such a way as to respond positively to their development, financial and trade needs. Moreover, in view of the evolving nature of such needs, and the different degrees of development of the beneficiaries, preferential arrangements must be modified, if necessary, in order to meet the varying requirements of developing States. In other words, the specific circumstances and the degree of development of each country must be taken into account in such arrangements.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>More typically his hits are simply citations of legal technical works that he is editor, co-author, etc. of.</dd>
<dd>I've also now read the op-ed i mentioned above:
<dl>
<dd><a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/01/21/edyusuf_ed3_.php#" class="external free" title="http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/01/21/edyusuf_ed3_.php#" rel="nofollow">http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/01/21/edyusuf_ed3_.php#</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It is not the beginning of a sustained role as an opinion molder, inasmuch as it apparently stands alone as his sole op-ed work, 22 months later. IMO it is unremarkable: an expression of concern that makes no claim to have uncovered anything previously unknown, and expresses no startling views.<br />

<li><b>Procedure</b>. I may be responsible for the sparse and diffident response here, by withholding my vote, failing to offer research, and listing the AfD just before what is for many of the large American contingent of editors a long-weekend holiday. I'm putting this down for another 5 days' consideration, i.e. thru Dec. 2 UTC, in hopes of a better basis for decision.<br />

<li><b>Delete</b> as not notable enough. There are tens of thousands of fairly senior civil servants and officials who are not notable enough for wikipedia <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:54, 29 November 2005 (UTC).<br />

<li><b>Keep</b> due to notability. Considering the fact that he is a member of the Institut de droit international which is a body which many consider consists of the best international lawyers in the world, his qualification to be a member of such an organization is in itself reason to keep the article. After researching him further, his substantial work on the African Yearbook of International Law seems to be very respected, and quite accessible suggesting a popularity. A quick search on amazon will provide results for many of his other works. Regarding google results their are 820, the majority of which relate to him directly regarding his work on international law, development law, or even intellectual property. As a founder of the African Foundation for International Law he seems to be more of a molder than some contributors discussion make out, due to the fact that african international law is in need of much development, and he seems to be a significant contributor to it. He is even part of the Contemporary African Database. I would certainly vote to keep the article but would suggest some editing of the article to ameliorate it, and perhaps expound upon his importance as well as that of his work.</li>
