<p>"Scientology as a business" is somewhat of a POV title, and indeed POV subject, to the point that I cannot see how this article could be worded neutrally. The article is rather anti-Scientology in POV at present. As a consequence I think it should be deleted, perhaps also merging to other Scientology articles in part. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 21:59, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> as POV fork. Information is well-sourced, but this belongs in <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a>.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> (<a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JChap2007_84c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/JChap2007">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li>In response to JChap2007, unless I'm very much mistaken, <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> is exactly where this material started, making this the opposite of a POV fork. Respectfully, I have to disagree with Nicholas; I agree that looking at the issue of "Scientology as a business" may be exploring a particular POV that is not shared by all sides, but so is looking at the issue of "Scientology as a religion", which is a POV not shared by all sides either, but which is explored in detail at <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a>. There's a lot of responses I think we could consider -- merging back to <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a>, renaming to Scientology as a financial entity, merging with other "Scientology as a ______" information -- but I can't defend the idea of deleting it because it's too POV a concept to explore, not when other equally POV conceptions of Scientology are given not only space but much more prominent placement. So, I might change my vote if someone suggests a better plan, but for now I really have to vote <b>Keep</b>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:50, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speey Delete</b> per <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> A6=&gt; "<i>Attack pages. Articles that serve no purpose but to disparage their subject or some other entity</i>". --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:19, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This article doesn't meet that description. This article serves to document the fact that Scientology, particularly as represented by the Church of Scientology, functions to a very real extent as a business. This is the conclusions that multiple courts of law and several government reports have come to; to lump discussion of a subject that <i>those</i> inquiries have treated seriously in with "Rob Jones is a total meathead" attack pages is just ... really, a very grotesque abuse of the system. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 04:39, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The whole article was in fact written to disparage the subject. No, its not like most other attack articles, but it is still an attack article, as definied in the policy. If a similiar article were written about a religion with less opposition at Wikipedia, the word "grotesque" would be used to describe that article. Wikipedia should not favor or disfavor any individual religion. Your POV on Scientology seems to have the votes on your side. But votes can't change policy. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 11:32, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, in short, you want to rewrite the A6 criterion, and replace the very limited "serve no purpose but to disparage" criterion with the far broader "is perceived by some to disparage no matter what else it does." You state "votes can't change policy" as if it were those voting <i>other than</i> speedy delete who were advocating a change in policy. I agree that Wikipedia should not favor or disfavor any individual religion, and if any other religion were to be noted so many times in so many legal actions and government reports to be operating more as a money-making enterprise than as a religious institution, then it should be noted about <i>that</i> religion as well. But what you are proposing is that Wikipedia should <i>favor</i> Scientology over other religions by hiding this information, which we would not do for any other religion. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 13:59, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article is part of the Scientology series, and has a valuable place in Wikipedia. "Scientology as a business" is not really a POV title, IMO. --<a href="../../../n/e/v/User%7ENeverborn_598a.html" title="User:Neverborn">Neverborn</a> 08:23, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The title of the article is not an allegation - every religion has certain financial activities that make it a business (in broad sense). Plus information about financial activities of the "church" of Scientology is widely accessed and confirmed. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuturix_f1b9.html" title="User:Futurix">Futurix</a> 09:42, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Documenting the business aspects of the complex group of Scientology companies is hardly meant to "disparage the subject", and the costs to members are part of that. It's less subject to editor interpretation than arguing Scientology theology. As for the "grotesque" angle, well .. <a href="../../../v/a/t/Vatican_Bank_69c3.html" title="Vatican Bank">Vatican Bank</a> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroidCat_71d5.html" title="User:AndroidCat">AndroidCat</a> 13:38, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> When the Church of Scientology <b>proves</b> it is a successful business, then it would deserve such an article and not until then. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 15:42, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Weren't you the one arguing that the correctness of the Church of Scientology's doctrines could be inferred from the millions of dollars it has in real estate? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dianetics&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=48605049" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dianetics&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=48605049" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 15:54, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>And you'll be happy to know that the Church of Scientology says that it operates 3000 churches, missions and groups in over 120 countries around the world, and in just the publishing business, has sold many millions of publications translated into 65 languages. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroidCat_71d5.html" title="User:AndroidCat">AndroidCat</a> 15:57, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Scientology is a business, since it charges money for services rendered. Therefore, it is useful and encyclopedia to include an article about this side of the thingy. --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 20:52, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The article is well sourced and factual. Given that the majority of countries still view it as a business and the US did up until 1993, it is a perfectly acceptable article. --<a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliotyork_ee52.html" title="User:Eliotyork"><font color="#3300FF">Eliotyork</font></a> 02:28, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. In what sense is this POV? Check Wikipedia's own definiftion of 'business'. The content of this page is a truthful, useful and valid resource. It is my own POV that scientologists are wilfully undermining reason, logic and semantics in order to promote an incredible confidence trick.

<li><b>Incredibly weak keep</b> - I was content to see this article deleted, but think it does add some information which the Scientology article perhaps does not- maybe a <b>merge</b> would be more effective here? <a href="../../../e/v/o/User%7EEvocativeIntrigue_50ee.html" title="User:EvocativeIntrigue"><font color="black"><b>EVOCATIVE</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/v/o/User%7EEvocativeIntrigue_50ee.html" title="User:EvocativeIntrigue"><font color="black">INTRIGUE</font></a> <small><a href="../../../e/v/o/User_talk%7EEvocativeIntrigue_a2c9.html" title="User talk:EvocativeIntrigue"><font color="black"><b>TALK</b>TO<b>ME</b></font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_EvocativeIntrigue_100c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/EvocativeIntrigue"><font color="black"><b>EMAIL</b>ME</font></a> | <b><a href="../../../e/v/o/User%7EEvocativeIntrigue_Feedback_4a53.html" title="User:EvocativeIntrigue/Feedback"><font color="black"><b>IMPROVE</b></font></a></b><a href="../../../e/v/o/User%7EEvocativeIntrigue_Feedback_4a53.html" title="User:EvocativeIntrigue/Feedback"><font color="black">ME</font></a></small> 16:02, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> it could, perhaps, be renamed Perspecties on Scientology and expanded but then it would tend to dwarf the main Scientology article. Probably best to keep it as daughter article dealing with specific facts and issues like <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Coca-Cola_26b7.html" title="Criticism of Coca-Cola">Criticism of Coca-Cola</a>. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 14:01, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This article needs to be further developed. Hubbard himself sometimes stated Scientology was not a religion. Scientology doesn't present itself as a religion everywhere it offers its service. Hubbard's infamous quote "make money, make more money..." etc. The business aspect of Scientology is important since it helps understand the undisputed controversial nature of the Church. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_Hill_2635.html" title="User:Raymond Hill">Raymond Hill</a> 14:50, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
