<p><s>Very nice looking article but unfortunately the subject seems to be rather non-notable. Possibly merge (if notability is established) to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> or UGOPlayer, sites to which the subject frequently contributes material, but I don't believe this subject warrants a seperate article.</s> --<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticBacon_4090.html" title="User:CrypticBacon">CrypticBacon</a> 05:20, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> interesting how u couldnt find the link to the IMDD, considering i put it on the knox wiki page. also, this means i can delete that "deletion pending" notice thing, right?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> No, you can't (well, shouldn't) remove the AfD notice. An administrator will do that soon. Remember to sign your comments, please. And by the way, you should probably change the IID"D" link to the page about the person, not some video he worked on. --<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticBacon_4090.html" title="User:CrypticBacon">CrypticBacon</a> 06:33, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well another flash artist, Legendary Frog, has his own page, and hes made much less of an impact. Knox not only invented the genre of Flash Claymation, but has made dozens of klaymations and other films and has even made a feature length movie that has sold over 3000 copies, and is working on 3 more full-length films. Legendary frog did not invent a new genre of Flash cartoon, he hasnt made nearly as many films as Knox has and has never made anything close to a full-length movie. I believe that Knox is worthy of his own article if Legendary Frog is. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeBlowfromKokomo_79c0.html" title="User:JoeBlowfromKokomo">JoeBlowfromKokomo</a> 05:30, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think if you were to provide verifiable evidence that this person "invented the genre of Flash Claymation", and then also establish that that were a notable feat, you would improve the chances of this article surviving AfD. --<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticBacon_4090.html" title="User:CrypticBacon">CrypticBacon</a> 06:16, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also Knox has been viewed nearly twice as much on UGOplayer than Legendary Frog has. LF's movies has been viewed a total of 7,063,311 times, and Knox's movies has been viewed a total of 14,309,407, as of 9:57, 3/11/06. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeBlowfromKokomo_79c0.html" title="User:JoeBlowfromKokomo">JoeBlowfromKokomo</a> 05:58, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Userfy</b>. Not notable yet, but he's managed to get on IMDB and may become notable <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2020142/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2020142/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Suggest moving this to a user page and waiting a year or two. As the author notes, Legendary Frog is less notable, so there's another candidate for deletion that has been missed. <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 06:06, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>thats not my point. i think both legendary frog <b>and</b> knox are notable. they're probably the two most important flash animators of all time, or at least in the top 5. i dont think either of them should be deleted. I mean, c'mon, theyve been viewed together about a total of 21,000,000 times on UGOplayer alone, and UGO is far less popular than Newgrounds. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeBlowfromKokomo_79c0.html" title="User:JoeBlowfromKokomo">JoeBlowfromKokomo</a> 06:11, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd also like to point out that the numbers above mean little. Knox has many, many more animations than Frog, so logically has more hits. We are all quite aware that quantity does not equate to quality. To me though, the article reads like a grade school essay, and the personnel bit is rather superfluous, but he <b>is</b> notable in his field, and I would have suggested to keep. -<a href="../../../d/a/w/User%7EDawson_517d.html" title="User:Dawson">Dawson</a> 06:31, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I would not be opposed to someone else relisting this for AfD. I withdrew it for the reason that "since it's on IMDB it's notable enough for me", figuring that if someone's on IMDB then they are notable enough for Wikipedia (is that generally true or not?). However since I've already withdrawn my nomination I don't feel right reinstating it so soon. But you're right, this guy doesn't really seem that important. --<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticBacon_4090.html" title="User:CrypticBacon">CrypticBacon</a> 06:36, 12 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> after looking over everthing again I would support another nomination for AfD, based on lack of notability (IMDB isn't cutting it for me). The external links seem a bit, crufty? --<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticBacon_4090.html" title="User:CrypticBacon">CrypticBacon</a> 06:43, 12 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> i can fix the external links, thats easy. and why is IMDB suddenly not good enough for you? --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeBlowfromKokomo_79c0.html" title="User:JoeBlowfromKokomo">JoeBlowfromKokomo</a> 06:57, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I would endorse a relist (or do so myself) based, if nothing else, on the fact that the previous (or shall I say, "latest") page about this subject (Knox (animator)) was deleted barely a month ago, and I doubt that his notability has skyrocketed in such a short time. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 06:47, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I agree that he isnt important in the big scheme of things, however, in the field of Flash hes one of the most important people. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeBlowfromKokomo_79c0.html" title="User:JoeBlowfromKokomo">JoeBlowfromKokomo</a> 06:41, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>For what it's worth I would <i>strongly</i> support another AfD nomination. Being on IMDB doesn't cut for notability purposes. --<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticBacon_4090.html" title="User:CrypticBacon">CrypticBacon</a> 06:49, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I still think that he is important enough for his own page. Regardless of how many films he has altogether, 14 million people is still 14 million people. Plus, let me point this out:<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis%2C_Duke_of_Joyeuse" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis%2C_Duke_of_Joyeuse" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis%2C_Duke_of_Joyeuse</a><br />
No one is ever going to search for this guy. Nonetheless, he still has his own page. Even if you think that one obscure duke is important for, say, a report on dukes from that time period, then why not combine <b>him</b> to one giant article about French Dukes? But I know that people will search for Knox because he is popular. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeBlowfromKokomo_79c0.html" title="User:JoeBlowfromKokomo">JoeBlowfromKokomo</a> 06:53, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>and for what its forth, he has a podcast on itunes too. search for "KnoxKast" and u should be able to find it. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeBlowfromKokomo_79c0.html" title="User:JoeBlowfromKokomo">JoeBlowfromKokomo</a> 07:07, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>He is popular at the moment, if theres anything I've learned in my time online it's that popularity wanes fast, and internet fads are quickly forgotten. The Duke above was probably popular in his time too...but as I asserted above, he is an artist whose works will endure as much as any painter or sculptor. Btw, I have a listing on IMDB too, but no one has written an article here about me yet, and if someone did, I'm sure it'd be up on AfD just as fast.&#160;;) -<a href="../../../d/a/w/User%7EDawson_517d.html" title="User:Dawson">Dawson</a> 07:10, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
