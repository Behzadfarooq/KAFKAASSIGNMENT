<dd>I'm not certain there's enough info out there to be worthy of expansion, which was part of the question. The wikipedia page already seems to have as much info on her as you can find in all the references on the first several pages of google -- basically, that she's an executive VP, and that she's listed as coproducer on a couple of movies. Oh, and she was quoted talking about BattleBots to some press outlet. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesup_c788.html" title="User:Jesup">jesup</a> 21:35, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just don't see why "greenlighting southpark" makes one notable in and of itself. Does the bean-counter who gave South Park the ok 'deserve' a bio page? The key grip? Everyone who appears in the credits of every episode? Every executive at the company? Sure, greenlighting South Park is a counter towards notability, but I don't see it as a full payment. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesup_c788.html" title="User:Jesup">jesup</a> 17:22, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I see a simple difference of opinion. I favor verifiable fact as the primary criteria and notability is secondary or less. Notability is inherent in the <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7Everifiability_9db2.html" title="WP:verifiability">verifiability</a> of the topic, and I don't see any particular problem if the bean counters, key grip, or any other credited staff have articles here, as long as they're researched and documented properly with references cited. I'm not concerned at all with impressing the "Random Page" surfers, nor do I care if a topic is "too dry" or "too boring". However, this person's influence in a major media corporation has far more impact on society than almost any published musical artists who have sold the roughly 5000 copies of their work that is "notable enough" in that field. Definite keep if verifiable. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 18:17, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see your point, though I think your take on this heads towards a collision with <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">'Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information'</a>. Even more directly, which of the entries in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> does this article fit? Also, does it pass the <i>expandability</i> test? (Can it be expanded past a stub.)

<dl>
<dd>Note that nominations were general SouthPark episode nominations, not individual - all people working on it and executives involved are included. The articles inserted were basically "she left Comedy Central". Those publications are RS, but mention there doesn't mean notability per se. And those are trade mags that report on "so-and-so was made under-VP-in-training". More to the point, those searches basically show lots of "title, executive producer foo, writer bar, director xyzzy", etc. The only links not like that were "she left CC", and a single quote about SP. (In the Variety search). <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesup_c788.html" title="User:Jesup">jesup</a> 16:27, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Daily Variety and The Hollywood Reporter and very important news sources read by almost everyone in the entertainment business and not in any way excluded from WP:RS. I actually agree that some of those articles are "mentions" of Liebling, so I inserted three articles that she is the "primary subject of" into the WP article. Very much passing <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. As for the Emmy nominations, if you don't feel an Executive Producer nomination is notable, that's your POV. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 16:38, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As I said, those are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, but being mentioned in them doesn't necessarily mean that the subject is notable. It depends on how they're mentioned. WP is an encyclopedia, but not a list of all facts, which is why Notability is important. Correct me if I'm wrong, but her nominations for emmy's weren't for her; the episode was nominated and she (along with all the other staff) were therefore considered nominees. Would you consider all group emmy nominees to be notable per se? I imagine not. So the question goes around again to what makes her notable. Also note that even searches at the trade pubs barely come up with any refs other than "she left CC and was involved in SouthPark, and was an executive at Fox" - so how will this article ever get beyond a stub? <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesup_c788.html" title="User:Jesup">jesup</a> 00:58, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, when show gets nominated for an Emmy (it was the entire show, not just an episode), it's in fact the creative staff responsible for that show who is nominated. And I in fact do think that <u>all the writers and producers nominated for an Emmy and responsible for and extremely popular show are notable.</u> If you don't think that, that's okay as that's your POV. At least three articles (beyond what <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> considers "multiple") demonstrate notability. If you don't think her being an important executive at <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_Century_Fox_3a0c.html" title="20th Century Fox">20th Century Fox</a> is notable, again that's your POV. I guess this bears repeating, so here it goes Per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person." --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 01:19, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oakshade is referring to me; please see the Talk page and changelog for why I felt the reference was redundant (all viewable text part of the first citation). Citing that might be useful here in arguing over notability, though I'd say it doesn't help the argument, but there's no reason for the citation to remain in the article regardless of the results of the AfD. While the AfD is pending I'm monitoring the page and I think you'll see all my edits are reasonable and meant to improve the article (as much as is possible). <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> please. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesup_c788.html" title="User:Jesup">jesup</a> 01:45, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll note that I didn't mention whether sources were reliable in calling this AfD (they weren't in the article) - the issues are notability and sufficient encyclopedic content (can it be expanded?). The sources are reliable - but they don't IMO establish notability. I have doubts about the recently uploaded picture by the original article author, in that they first uploaded it under a non-GFDL license, then uploaded a scaled-down version claiming original authorship. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesup_c788.html" title="User:Jesup">jesup</a> 04:23, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you're really hung up on this "must grow beyond a stub" (could you please cite that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> clause, by the way?), then you've got a ton of Wikipedia deleting to do. Just to make it alphabetically and numerically easy, start with <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas_Highway_2_ee42.html" title="Arkansas Highway 2">Arkansas Highway 2</a> (there is no Arkansas Highway 1) and move your way up the highway system. Okay, joke over. As for this "stub" issue, open up your real-life encyclopedia and you'll see thousands or articles that are no more than one paragraph... and all of those are "Encyclopedic". --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 05:00, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article has clearly been greatly improved since the nomiation and references have been added. It seems to me that an "Executive Vice President of 20th Century Fox" is at least as important as many of the sportspeople added to Wikipedia every day. The systemic bias of Wikipedia seems to disfavour people in business, just as it disfavours academics. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 05:52, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
