<p>This is a non-notable pseudotheory. As discussed on the talk page, all papers are by the same set of authors. Google returns only 259 hits for "bios theory", and 186 with "bios theory" -wikipedia. However, many of these refer to computer BIOS's, and removing those results has proven somewhat difficult. "bios theory" -wikipedia -computer -linux returns 92 total results with only 19 unique results, but this may be too highly selective. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus"><b>Philosophus</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus"><b>T</b></a></sup> 09:33, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Would Wikipedia be better with or without this article? I'm confident that we're better off without. The article uses a lot of terminology from <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamical_system.html" title="Dynamical system">dynamical systems</a>, but in such a way that I, and even more importantly, editors like <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosBits_0d97.html" title="User:XaosBits">User:XaosBits</a> whom I consider to be very knowledgeable on this subject, cannot understand them. There has been a lot of discussion about bios theory (see for instance <a href="../../../c/h/a/Talk%7EChaos_theory_5b43.html" title="Talk:Chaos theory">Talk:Chaos theory</a> and its archives), but it has not been possible to come to a clear explanation about what the main concepts (<i>novelty</i> and <i>bios</i>) mean. This makes the whole article unverifiable. I admit that this also makes it hard for me to judge the theory on its merits, and there are some papers published on this theory, but in my opinion these are too few and too new to make the theory notable. The combination of unverifiability (because it is unclear, despite lots of effort) and probably unnotability suffices for me to advocate deletion. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 12:15, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosBits_0d97.html" title="User:XaosBits">Xaosbits</a> is the only one that actually tried to improve the article (at least with very constructive critiques). Most other people just complained without trying to edit Bios theory, and actually tried to disaprove it, which is not the job of wikipedia editors. I don't think that because something is new it should be excluded from Wikipedia. Unclear does not mean unverifiable. Verifiable means that what is in the article can be found in the published papers. I understand that there are mathematicians here who like rigor a lot. However, Bios theory emerged from the social science oriented group, and people there do not use same rigor as do people in mathematics and physics. Bios theory has been published in <i>Nonlinear Dynamics, Psychology and the Life Sciences</i> among other journals. I think that it is arrogant to claim that people publishing in these journals are <i>pseudoscientists</i> just because they have different approach to science than <i>hard science</i> researchers. World is not just what <i>we</i> know. Knowledge is not just what <i>we</i> consider knowledge.<a href="../../../l/a/k/User%7ELakinekaki_88a8.html" title="User:Lakinekaki">Lakinekaki</a> 13:20, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Article is incoherent. Despite lengthly conversations with the page author (<a href="../../../l/a/k/User%7ELakinekaki_88a8.html" title="User:Lakinekaki">Lakinekaki</a>), a meaningful article was never arrived at. To rebut the above commentary: while lack of rigor may be acceptable in the social sciences, this article was making claims about mathematics and about medical science, where rigor is required. What I found particularly disturbing were claims made connecting bios theory to biological sciences, while demonstrating an utter (and willing!) ignorance of prior literature connecting chaos theory and the life sciences. I know damned little about such things, and was displeased to learn I knew more than the author. As to arrogance: this article and its author made the arrogant claim that bios theory was the king and leader of chaos theory, which was all the more galling given the protestations about rigor, clarity and hard science. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 14:20, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> Some users have claimed this to be gobbledegook, however we have at least 7 articles in peer review journals, 1 book published by a respectable publisher (World Scientific). One of the contributors to the theory is L. Kauffman, a notable mathematican who made important contribution to <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knot_polynomial.html" title="Knot polynomial">Knot theory</a> (see Kauffman's CV at <a href="http://www.math.uic.edu/~kauffman/LKVita.ps" class="external free" title="http://www.math.uic.edu/~kauffman/LKVita.ps" rel="nofollow">http://www.math.uic.edu/~kauffman/LKVita.ps</a> to verify that he had indeed contributed to this study). To me this seems like more protoscience than psuedoscience. Sabelli et al are trying to find metrics which can destinguish between the patterns in heart rate and purly chaotic systems. Their concept of novality is one attempt at a metric which does seem to detect some patterns. The article does require a lot of work. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 14:36, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> all "little quoted theories" (this gets around 250 ghits). Why delete little quoted theories? For the same reason we deleted Aetherometry: it's not sufficiently widely discussed that we have a decent pool of secondary sources from which to write a neutral and verifiable article. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:12, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Google hits are not a litmus test of notability. But it looks like this has been through several sorts of cleanup. A theory about brontosauruses or butterflies or ytterbium is one thing, and I might not presume to judge it nonsense because I did not understand it. A <i>theory about <b>"systems"</b></i> is another thing entirely, and when its explanation seems to involve strings of abstract Latinate nouns that never seem to touch the ground, I'm much less inclined to be charitable. I have very little tolerance for this kind of writing in business related articles. This reads like the same sort of cruft, and it seems it's been given time to develop into something that reads better, and gone no further than this. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 15:21, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This seems to be an ill-written article on an ill-defined topic. I get no sense of what "bios" is as something that distinguishes itself from chaos, either as a seperate entity or a well-defined subset of chaos. To me, the lack of mathematicians running to the defense of this article is most telling. If this was an accepted part of chaos theory, they would be here opposing this action. I also am disturbed by the defense of this article by Salix alba <s>is</s> in saying that "Sabelli et al are trying to find ...". <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research_journal.html" title="Research journal">research journal</a>, nor is it a <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_ball.html" title="Crystal ball">crystal ball</a>.

<li>I have listed <i>serious problems with every sentence of the first paragraph alone</i>, showing that the article is not only very misleading (for example claiming for "bios theory" insights which should properly be abscribed to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos_theory.html" title="Chaos theory">chaos theory</a>), to the extraordinary extent that <i>virtually every caption and every sentence in this article is misleading and/or scientifically dubious</i>; it is relevant to state that like <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosBits_0d97.html" title="User:XaosBits">User:XaosBits</a> I am <a href="http://www.genealogy.ams.org/html/id.phtml?id=28250" class="external text" title="http://www.genealogy.ams.org/html/id.phtml?id=28250" rel="nofollow">knowledgeable</a> about <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamical_systems_theory.html" title="Dynamical systems theory">dynamical systems theory</a>,</li>

<li>Kovacevic may have also <i>concealed a hidden agenda of his employer which has nothing to do with science</i>; for example <a href="http://creativebios.com/bios/Chapter12-TheInfiniteAttractorofEvolution.pdf" class="external text" title="http://creativebios.com/bios/Chapter12-TheInfiniteAttractorofEvolution.pdf" rel="nofollow">this file</a> from the CCCD website claims <i>"Biotic development illustrates how evolution may be expected to continue creating an attractor of infinite complexity rather than tending to equilibrium.

<dd>What does it mean <i>On his <a href="../../../l/a/k/User_talk%7ELakinekaki_8cc9.html" title="User talk:Lakinekaki">user talk page</a>,</i> Lazar Kovacevic <i><b>now</b> admits his real life identity .</i> Look at histories of my user page and user talk page, and you'll see for how long are those comments and links there. Your <i>detective</i> work surprised me since there is the first link on my userpage that speaks for itself. It guides to complexity paper where my name stands next to bios paper, and my email is lakinekaki@yahoo.com. It gives the whole thing:</dd>
<dd><i>Quantum bios and biotic complexity in the distribution of galaxies</i> Hector Sabelli, Lazar Kovacevic * Chicago Center for Creative Development, Chicago, Illinois 60614; email: Lazar Kovacevic (lakinekaki@yahoo.com) *Correspondence to Lazar Kovacevic, Chicago Center for Creative Development, 2400 Lakeview Avenue, Chicago, IL 60614</dd>
<dd>If I ever had <i>secret agenda</i> or intention do deceive, would I ever put this link on my user page. I don't understand why you did <i>detective</i> work, when I made things so obvious. <a href="../../../l/a/k/User%7ELakinekaki_88a8.html" title="User:Lakinekaki">Lakinekaki</a> 18:25, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You can accuse me for <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>, but the only reason I put one reference with my name is because there were 5 other names in that reference, and some editors wanted to see that there were more people involved in bios, and not just Sabelli. <a href="../../../l/a/k/User%7ELakinekaki_88a8.html" title="User:Lakinekaki">Lakinekaki</a> 18:30, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete, immediately</b> - with extreme prejudice I have no specialist knowledge of chaos theory and was using wikipaedia as a first resource. I have just spent one hour following the debate about this article. Why has it not already been deleted? Its continued existence brings wikipedia's reputation into decline. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/2/2E/User%7E62.6.139.11.html" title="User:62.6.139.11">62.6.139.11</a> (<a href="../../../6/2/2E/User_talk%7E62.6.139.11.html" title="User talk:62.6.139.11">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.6.139.11_d6ec.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.6.139.11">contribs</a>) 12:43, May 16, 2006.</small>

<dd>Kindly be advised that a global open content encyclopedia like this must (as things now stand) be taken with a grain of salt. It should be used as a way to get a sense of the subject, and as a resource for other resources. As for deleting this article: There is a process involved with it, which is working. It will take several more days before enough time will have elpased and the admins will rules on this request. This page will then be removed (as there is a consensus to do so). However, each AfD action needs to be ruled on individually, as there have been cases of deletion being requested for individual articles. (Note however that if this page reappears quickly that it can be speedily re-deleted.) --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 19:06, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
