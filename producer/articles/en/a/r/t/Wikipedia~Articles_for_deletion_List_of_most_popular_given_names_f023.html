<li><b>Keep</b>: As I stated a few weeks ago on <a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html#Moving_List_of_most_popular_given_names" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit's talk page</a>: "Whilst the etymologies and meanings for the individual given names <i>would</i> belong to Wiktionary, I believe that the compiled list itself does not. The article serves a valid encyclopedic function by giving light to the naming diversity across different national and cultural contexts.

<li><b>Keep</b> per CounterFX. While I agree with the transwiki'ing of name lists from individual countries, this one is neither useless nor indiscriminate. The comparisons of a single <b>compiled</b> global list are not at all the same matter as etymologies and its presence improves the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 13:20, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It was never claimed that the article was useless or indiscriminate, but that it is better suited for a dictionary. Note that <i>all</i> of the given name lists were lists of "most popular" names; they also had a limited scope. None of them included any possible given name, which could have been endless, only the documented popular ones. This is nothing more than the same principle applied on a limited scale for more countries. The reasons for this being unencyclopedic and more worthy of a dictionary still stand: it is a list of words <i>based on word usage</i> (geographical distribution) without any prose about the meaning, in an encyclopedia which prohibits name definition articles, so that links from the names would be unhelpful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> This isn't a static list of given names by national origin, or a list of names with etymological meanings, so it isn't appropriate for a dictionary. In my opinion, it's currently a very long stub, but more detailed encyclopaedic content about international naming trends could be added in the future in order to supplement the tables. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 16:51, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not just a list of names that exist in a country or among a particular group. It is a rather well-sourced (albeit incomplete) and dynamic list of names by country and/or region. I will not comment on the list's appropriateness for Wiktionary, but will assert that it is definitely appropriate for Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:09, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I fail to see the distinction. You're committing the fallacy of arguing that sources have anything to do with whether something belongs in an encyclopedia or a dictionary, it seems. Wiktionary would strongly disagree with that (<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/WT:RFV" class="extiw" title="wikt:WT:RFV">wikt:WT:RFV</a>). How is this any more encyclopedic than the rest? <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 23:16, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My main point was not sourcing (that's just a plus). My point was that it is not just a (static) listing of names. It is a (dynamic) list that supplements the article <a href="../../../g/i/v/Given_name.html" title="Given name">given name</a> by providing information about the commonality and geographic distribution of names--such information would never be found in a dictionary. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:46, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, there is no essential difference between this list and all the others. You say dictionaries don't cover the geographic distribution of words, but encyclopedias do? You have that exactly backwards: <i>dictionaries</i> specify word usage, like regional usages. Note Wiktionary's <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Regional_templates" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Regional_templates">wikt:Category:Regional_templates</a>, which create, for example, the "(<i>Irish English</i>)" you'll see before entries like <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/feck" class="extiw" title="wikt:feck">wikt:feck</a>. Note also <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Scottish_surnames" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Scottish_surnames">wikt:Category:Scottish_surnames</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_surnames" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:English_surnames">wikt:Category:English_surnames</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Russian_surnames" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Russian_surnames">wikt:Category:Russian_surnames</a>, etc. Rather, such information should not be found in an encyclopedia, which is about the concept words indicate, not their usage - geographical, popularity, or otherwise - alone. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_usage_guide" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a usage guide</a>. I fail to see why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Given_name&amp;diff=111433062&amp;oldid=111004531" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Given_name&amp;diff=111433062&amp;oldid=111004531" rel="nofollow">this</a> is not a suitable supplement to <a href="../../../g/i/v/Given_name.html" title="Given name">given name</a>, but the exact same Wikipedia article is. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 22:43, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is a world of difference. The examples you have noted are all <i>limited to one country</i>. The <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Russian_surnames" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Russian_surnames">category for Russian names</a>, for instance, identifies only the origin of the names without saying <i>anything</i> about the geographic distribution and/or concentration of those names. Dictionaries <i>do not</i> cover this type of information: they cover the meanings of names, their origins, and not much else. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Scottish_surnames" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Scottish_surnames">wikt:Category:Scottish_surnames</a> identifies names of Scottish origin, but says nothing about the fact that there are plenty of individuals with this name <i>outside</i> of Scotland. And why should it? That is not within the scope of a dictionary. A dictionary should limit itself to identifying words, defining them, and specifying how they originated. The geographic distribution of names (which is tied in to migration patterns, the political histories of regions, etc.) is beyond the scope of a dictionary. That sort of information belongs in an encyclopedia. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:06, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think so. Regional political upheavals and migration pattersn are encyclopedic content. The general spread of words and names as a result of those migration patterns is also encyclopedic content. But information about <i>specific</i> words and names is dictionary content. The distinction that <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> draws doesn't have anything to do with the <i>scope</i> of an article or items in a list--it has to do with the <i>subject</i> of the article or of the items in a list. If the subject is a word or name, or if the items in the list are words or names, that's dictionary content. And the more that can be said about the words or names, the better--but it still goes in Wiktionary not Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:24, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The subject here is obviously not a "specific word or name". It is <i>the frequency of given names across the world</i>. The subject here is not names, but their frequency. This is not a static list. Any of the names on this list could be removed as soon as updated data arrives. Your point is inapplicable as it misjudges the subject of the list. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:52, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it doesn't. The subject of the list is not the general concept of name frequency. If it were, it would be titled Onomastic trends and would not be in list form. I imagine that such an article would be possible to write; it would include observations and extrapolations that outside sources have made by looking at data about specific names like the data that is in this list. But the list itself is a collection of information about the frequency of specific names, hence it is about specific names. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:34, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, your last statement is logically fallacious: <i>"the list itself is a collection of information about the frequency of specific names, hence it is about specific names."</i> No, as you justed admitted, it's about frequency. Second, I never claimed that the subject wsa the "general concept of name frequency". It's not about the general concept (though I suppose it could be altered to that purpose); it's about the actual frequency. Third, this is not a list of the frequency of any "specific names" (even if you count 200+ as specific) as it is a dynamic list that changes from year to year. How can it be about particular names when those names may be justifiably removed one year and re-added the next? -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:42, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let me address your first &amp; second points taken together. I raised the notion of "general concept of name frequency" to make a contrast between the kind of material suited for Wikipedia and the kind of material suited for Wiktionary. Information about frequencies of specific names <i>is</i> information about those specific names -- i.e. Wiktionary material -- as opposed to information about the "general concept of name frequency," which is Wikipedia material. On your third point, this really shouldn't be a dynamic list on either Wiktionary or Wikipedia; it should classify the information by year. But that's not relevant to the question of whether it should go on Wiktionary or Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 20:11, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is highly relevant. All the other "List of ... names" were just that: static lists of names that exist, and should have been deleted. This list is entirely different. This article does not convey information about a specific set of names; rather, it conveys information about a specific set of countries. The article presents descriptive information about a characteristic of individual countries. The individual names are of secondary (or even tertiary) importance and relevance as they are replacable. This article is actually mistitled (not a reason for deletion, by the way). It is not a list of names, but rather a list of countries. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 21:08, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> well-referenced and not just a list of word or definitions. Agree with above keep recommendations: while the names by country article were justifiably transwikied, this article is actually appropriate for Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 02:26, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Um, no one has claimed that it's not a word list, though some claim it can be encyclopedic still. But there is no denying that it is a list of words; there is nearly no prose to speak of. Have you read the article? <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 22:43, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I claimed it was not a word list! I'm guessing this was just a typo? Of course, I've read it. What I haven't read is a Wikipedia policy or guideline that says an article must contain prose, please feel free to point me to one. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 05:54, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as I don't see why the reasons given for deleting it apply, while I see good reasons given above for keeping it. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 04:11, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please provide a specific rationale. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 22:43, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The most popular given names are a highly notable topic, and I've seen entire websites devoted to the topic, as well as mentions of it in geneology books. Notable topics about which much could potentially be said belong in Wikipedia, not Wiktionary. Plus, I do not see any merit, or any basis in Wikipedia policy, in the argument about deleting this list of names just because many other lists of names have been deleted. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 02:10, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. A dictionary is the proper place for the definition and usage of words. For lists of names by category, and for showing how the frequency of name usage evolves, I think an encyclopedia is much more suited. –<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoaler_5952.html" title="User:Shoaler">Shoaler</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/o/User_talk%7EShoaler_4dcd.html" title="User talk:Shoaler">talk</a>) 15:33, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Shoaler. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 21:32, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Shoaler. Just because it does not explain meaning is no reason to not be included in an encyclopedia; we have many other lists that do not explain meaning either (lists of films, etc.) This article is interesting and fairly well-referenced. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 22:42, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Shoaler. This is a great, useful, worthy, valuable list. It's about specific names. <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">Things about specific names go in Wiktionary, not Wikipedia.</a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 01:27, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> does not require that all "things about names go in Wiktionary", and the idea that everything about names go into a dictionary is dangerously schematic. There is a branch of linguistics about names (<a href="../../../o/n/o/Onomastics.html" title="Onomastics">onomastics</a>). This particular article may be about names, but as several above have implied the synthetic effect of <i>this</i> list places it outside of anything that I've met in any dictionary. While I'm happy enough to banish most lists of names, this one strikes me as compellingly encyclopedic and very un-dictionary-like. <a href="../../../s/e/m/User_talk%7ESemperf_0e01.html" title="User talk:Semperf"><font color="#008000"><b><i>semper fictilis</i></b></font></a> 04:00, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't express myself well and have amended my comment. Of course I don't think that material about names as a general category should go in Wiktionary. See my above response to Black Falcon. But things about <i>specific</i> names go in Wiktionary. The list under consideration here is about specific names, not onomastics. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 16:37, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Don't know where it might fall on current policy, but as I just came to Wikipedia <i>looking</i> for this precise information, I would have been surprised had it not been here, and would not have thought to look in Wiktionary. --<a href="../../../j/w/a/User%7EJwanders_e4e6.html" title="User:Jwanders">jwanders</a><sup><a href="../../../j/w/a/User_talk%7EJwanders_e394.html" title="User talk:Jwanders">Talk</a></sup> 09:23, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The recent discussions have given rise to one very valid point - what about converting the list from a single, dynamic, continually-updated list into a set of static lists by year, such as List of most popular given names in 2006, List of most popular given names in 2007, and so forth? This is already being done for the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_the_most_popular_names_in_the_2000s_in_the_United_States_e12c.html" title="List of the most popular names in the 2000s in the United States">lists of the United States</a>. This way, results from previous years would not need to be lost whenever a new publication is released. Anyway, maybe it would be better to discuss this matter after the Afd is closed. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECounterFX_ea25.html" title="User:CounterFX">CounterFX</a> 22:16, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
