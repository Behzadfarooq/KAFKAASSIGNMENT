<li>It is true that the info is in articles already but this brings up an interesting issue about information organization. Sometimes one would like to gather certain pieces into one place. The ability of Wiki to be more than just an electronic version of a paper encyclopedia should be used. Not sure though how that could be implemented in this case. This is a case of a user trying to use Wiki to bring together existing wiki info in a different organizational format to better suit their needs and possibly the needs of a larger group. I think this might be a bigger issue that needs to be discussed before we go on just deleting it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.230.145.243 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.230.145.243_ad20.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.230.145.243">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, trivia. People of all stripes get arrested all the time, and athletes are no different; we just hear about it because they're famous. Regarding the previous anonymous comment, no one's arguing against ever maintaining complementary organizational schemes for the same information.

<dd>That's one opinion article from a trade magazine with a readership of 54,400, and the article is saying that there's a (mostly racially-based) stereotype (people in the US supposedly typically associate pro athletics with African-Americans, and associate African-Americans with crime), and arguing that these stereotypes are deeply misleading . <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:18, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> How is the Big Bang related? Well, there is a page that lays out the timeline. How is it arbitary? Well, it is subject to individual judgement. For example, I don't believe it. I do however believe that the rise in violent crimes committed by professional athletes is something that people are interested in and a timeline of such events would make a good page.Ajlynch131 01:46, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> This has to be a joke right? This cannot be serious. Even if it were 20 or 30 years of events, I still would be somewhat doubtful about it. If this were a well-known phenomenon that was well established, of a crime trend or jump in a certain segment of the population, then maybe. But this... I see no trend. This poor article is pitiful.

</ul>
<p>Its not meant as a joke, its meant as a starting point. Isn't that the point of Wikipedia, that one person can't collect the whole set of knowledge on a topic but the community can? Why should and article be 100% complete when posted. Dgreenfi</p>
