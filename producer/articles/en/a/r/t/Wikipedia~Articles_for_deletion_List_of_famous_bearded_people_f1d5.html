<p>The result was <b>delete</b>.

<li>You appear to be basing your understanding of membership entry in the list on the name of the article. I revised the lead paragraph.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Articles such as List of famous people wearing a moustache and List of bald people are kept unquestionably, and I don't see any reason to maintain a double standard. If you want to debate the notability of <i>all</i> of those articles, that's fine. But as long as the precedent is to keep lists of people with any defining physical characteristic, you can't just decide on a whim to delete a perfectly viable article. --<a href="../../../d/l/a/User%7EDLand_35ee.html" title="User:DLand">DLand</a><a href="../../../d/l/a/User_talk%7EDLand_38e8.html" title="User talk:DLand"><font color="green"><sup><small>TALK</small></sup></font></a> 05:26, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> and strongly consider AfDing the other similar lists mentioned by <a href="../../../d/l/a/User%7EDLand_35ee.html" title="User:DLand">DLand</a>. Where will this end? Famous people with blond hair etc. Famous people with a limp? Famous short people?

<ul>
<li>I disagree. My comment is backed up by examples. But I will happily clarify. My problem with this list is that choosing the criteria <i>beards</i> to classify people is arbitrary and absurd. One could classify people by all sorts of physical characteristics but what would be the point? The fact that they had beards did not make them better or worse politicians, singers etc. It was just a choice of personal grooming. Having a beard is simply not a remarkable thing and as such there is no reason to list those who have had one. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe">WJBscribe</a> 12:32, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The criteria for inclusion, the entries, and the references cited make clear that merely having a beard and being famous are not sufficient by themselves to be included in the list.--<a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 13:11, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see your point but I'm not sure the fact that a commentator has once remarked on someone's beard is significant. To take an example: you list <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Branson_37a9.html" title="Richard Branson">Richard Branson</a>. He is famous because he founded <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Group_f40e.html" title="Virgin Group">Virgin</a> and is a multi-millionaire. he is not famous in any way because of his beard and would be no less famous were he to never have sported a beard. Someone who has a beard may be identified by it- as may someone with hair of a distinctive colour or style, but it is not an essential element of their fame. As such I do not see how it can be notable in this form. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe">WJBscribe</a> 23:44, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you for your reply. However, it still is not clear as to which Wikipedia policy you are referring. <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#Discussion" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide_to_deletion#Discussion</a> requires a well-argued, fact-based case based upon Wikipedia policy. In particular, <a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_Arguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions_a4ee.html#It_is_unencyclopedic" title="User:Daduzi/Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions">Wikipedia Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions</a> identifies "the article is unencyclopedic" as a non Wikipedia policy argument. Without identifying an item within a particular Wikipedia policy, your reasoning is not explained and it is not possible to determine whether your concerns have been addressed. In regards to your comments, the fact that a commentator has once particularly remarked on someone's beard being notable is Wikipedia significant per Wikipedia policy and guidelines. In particular, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is not item 1.1.7.1</a> expressly permits a list if the entries are famous because they are associated with or significantly contributed to the list topic. Further, <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html#References_for_list_Items" title="WP:LIST">Wikipedia list guideline reference for list items</a> states that articles should contain only material that has been published by reputable sources. I revised the lead paragraph and the article meets all Wikipedia policy and guidelines. Regarding <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Branson_37a9.html" title="Richard Branson">Richard Branson</a>, the reputable source, the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mail_c8b4.html" title="Daily Mail">Daily Mail</a>, identified that Branson is one of England's most famous beard-wearers in the context of Branson firing employees for wearing beards. The widely known event characterized and published by a Wikipedia reputable source brought notoriety to famous person Branson's beard, which is why Branson is on the list. Regarding your concerns about "<i>Where will this end? Famous people with blond hair etc. Famous people with a limp? Famous short people?,</i>" List of famous bearded people may serve as a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">precedent</a> by which all other lists of a similar vain may be judge. If those hypothetical articles maintain the high bar membership entry of List of famous bearded people, then they should be allowed. If not, they may be deleted, citing List of famous bearded people as a standard to which they need to achieve. Deleting List of famous bearded people will not discourage creation of the articles you mention, it will only povide one less basis for you to delete non Wikipedia policy lists.--<a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 20:34, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Over separate forty worldwide news agencies expressly treated a beard as a defining characteristic of over forty famous people.

<li>Amarkov, I do understand your concerns. However, deleting one list article that complies with Wikipedia policy and guidelines to stem the creation of other potentially non-Wikipedia policy complying lists of this type will have the opposite effect of your intention. List of famous bearded people creates a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia precedent</a> against which all other like articles may be judge. If the article <i>List of people with feet</i> both states that membership entry on list of people with feet list requires that the entry be famous because the entry is associated with notable feet by a <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html#References_for_list_Items" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">reliable published source</a> as defined by <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html#References_for_list_Items" title="WP:LIST">Wikipedia Lists guidlines References for list Items</a>, and the entries in such a list comply with such a high bar requirement, then the list meets Wikipedia policy and guidelines. If you delete List of famous bearded people, then you will not have a solid, easy to use precedent against other similarly typed lists. Thus, deleting List of famous bearded people will work against your goal of stemming the creation of other potentially non-Wikipedia policy complying lists.--<a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 20:34, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. The revisions (might) immunize this from a CSD G4 death, but that notwithstanding, this does not meet the list criteria.

<li>OK, I'll try again. 1) A beard is not necessarily a defining characteristic. 2) Any attempt to define "famous" is POV. 3) The list is necessarily incomplete.

<li><b>Keep</b>, so long as a <b>very</b> close eye is kept on references for the notability of the beards as an important part of the identities of the persons. If the list begins to transform into an indiscriminate collection of every person on the planet who at some point had a beard, with nothing to back up why it was important, it should be reconsidered for deletion. <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeeJo_c589.html" title="User:GeeJo">GeeJo</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/e/e/User_talk%7EGeeJo_5052.html" title="User talk:GeeJo">(t)</a></sup>⁄<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GeeJo_9c2b.html" title="Special:Contributions/GeeJo">(c)</a></sub> <small>•&#160;22:21, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
