<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>). No further edits should be made to this page.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The result was <b>Keep</b>. As one of the... *listens to crickets chirping in the background* ...few uninvolved parties in this mess, I thought I would step in, be bold, and do what others are avoiding--Close the AfD. The title of the last section break illustrated a fact that I'm sure a lot of us have been thinking. It is March 12th. As it was specified in the unorthodox (but wise) ground rules for this AfD, it is time to close. I have been following the discussion closely and after absorbing it all. I came to a decision based on the arguments put forth in said discussion (it was indeed a discussion, even if few changed their minds… there were many fewer “per nom” votes than I would have expected on either side).</p>
<p>Firstly, as noted on the talk page, and reinforced by my own headcount, keeps outnumbered deletes by a greater-than 2-to-1 margin (roughly 140 to 60). Obviously AfD is a discussion, not a vote, but it does operate on the principle of community consensus, and I think this has been as clearly established as could be expected with such a divisive and emotional issue. Not just on this AfD, but also on the DRV before it.</p>
<p>Even discounting those facts, the strength of arguments also lie on the side of the keep votes -- <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, or the new <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>. Any other policy concerns such as <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> can be addressed with <i>careful</i> editing. Even Brandt’s concerns on the talk page do have some merit (particularly those due to prejudicial language and tone) and I urge all to avoid vilifying him in the future in or out of the article. Although Brandt brings up some good points, there are also many valid counter-arguments speaking for the article's inclusion as well. Although many agree with his basic points, no responsible parties endorse his tactics. If this were Britannica, he would not be trying to harass and intimidate its editors. If he did, I assure you that said editors would not be harassed or intimidated, but neither would they lash back and add their own POV flourishes to the article on Brandt. I know there are a lot of even stronger feelings about him following the Essjay incident, but we must avoid even the smallest pettiness at all costs. If the Essjay incident is viewed dispassionately, one sees that it only served to reinforce Brandt's notability in a NPOV, dispassionate, and encyclopedic article.</p>
<p>On the topic of editing, there also does not seem to be a community consensus for stubification/disambiguation or some of the other solutions which people have offered, apart from keeping a neutral article. Therefore I urge all to avoid edit warring along this avenue. That being said, I would like to commend those (however few) who did try to find common ground on this battleground. It is something we look for much too rarely in our disputes (there are many psychological factors contributing to this). I sometimes contemplate writing an article on the <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_polarization.html" title="Group polarization">group polarization</a> of Wikipedians... but I digress.</p>
<p>There is no other way to close this debate that will not fracture the community. I hope we can all heal now and put this behind us now. Barring unforeseen circumstances (which I avoid mentioning per <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a>) the community has spoken. I cannot imagine another AfD being opened on this topic without more hurt feelings. Think of how many good articles could be written with the energy that has gone into this debate. Let's put this ugly mess behind us. Best wishes to all. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronGargoyle_779d.html" title="User:IronGargoyle">IronGargoyle</a> 05:18, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would like to ask why your request not to close this AfD prematurely should be respected, when you did not respect the request of the administrator who closed the Deletion review to wait a week before proceeding. It appears that you also did not consult that administrator <strike>or do him the courtesy of informing him that you were</strike> before overruling his decision. Furthermore, the immediate flood of discussion seems to me quite clearly a result of the fact that this AfD is a continuation of the edit war that was developing over the article itself after Zocky's intervention. Thus we are not in fact having the thoughtful, reasoned debate that was contemplated but are simply perpetuating the same passions as before. Under the circumstances, I find it difficult to see why this "process" should be considered any more legitimate than Yanksox's out-of-process deletion last week. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 00:25, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also request that this AfD not be closed until 5 days after it was scheduled to be opened, since many editors expected to have more time to improve the article or prepare their comments. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 00:36, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Absolutely</b>. Many people will look for this during the announced scheduled time and be more than a little upset when it's prematurely closed.

<dd>Apologies, my mistake.

It is abundantly clear to me at this point that any result of this discussion cannot be considered legitimate, and the discussion should be started afresh, under calmer circumstances, at a later time. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 01:26, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I didn't take the DRV close statement by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">Thebainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thebainer_bcd6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thebainer">contribs</a>) as a request so much as a logical next step to his DRV close. Maybe I misinterpreted his statement; but I don't see this as "overruling him". I also don't see it as a continuation of the edit war because I wasn't in any way involved in that. Honestly, I don't think that if this had been AfD'd 5 days from now we'd be having any different discussion than we are having now. This article brings up many strong opinions and that would still be the case even if this was done in a few days; 5 days is not going to cool this one down. We are having as thoughtful and as reasoned of a debate as I could ever hope to see on this topic. As for comparing this to the deletion <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> (<a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yanksox_2ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yanksox">contribs</a>) enacted, sorry I don't see nominating an article for deletion a few days before it was possibly intended to be in quite the same light as the unilateral deletion of an article with no discussion per <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. If some admin is going to come along and <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> this as an out of process AfD, then they are going to do that. I'm not going to <a href="../../../w/h/e/WP%7EWHEEL_fbcc.html" title="WP:WHEEL">WP:WHEEL</a> over this. I'd just hope that for the first time in quite a while we could have an actual AfD on this article that is seen through to its conclusion.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 02:08, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As SlimVirgin notes there was no consensus either way, consensus is not required to start an AfD and the word of a closing Admin (esp. when the are as compromised as Thebainer made himself by prejudging the outcome on wikipediareview.com) is not holy writ. Note that every vote here - keep or delete - is also an implcit concurrence with this AfD.

<li><b>Strong keep:</b> The previous speedy deletion/DRV/RFaR mess was out of order as Daniel Brandt has clear notability. Below are news stories either about the subject <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> or specifically citing him as a source in the piece (I checked each of these). The first section alone allows him to easily cruise past <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> requirements. Based on his being notable I can't see any legitimate reason to delete at all. He's famous in his circles, and the entire world hears about him pracitically (note the international news coverage) often about privacy stuff. His private anti-wikipedian garbage is annoying from what I've read of it, but he's still notable. He is routinely cited by major news media (seen below) as authoratative source on a variety of privacy, search engine, Google, and internet privacy issues. By extension, if someone is so heavily gone-to as a voice and authority on a topic, by de facto he is notable because the media made him notable because of his own interaction with them. This seems to predate Siegenthaler, the Wikipedia feuds, etc., by some time. He exposed NSA/CIA spying on domestic citizens and got press for that (lots of press, world wide). More press still for his name base project. He got lots of lots of press and still does over his Google/SEO work (and still does, each month, as more media go to him). Unless Brandt completely stops talking to media forever this list will just grow each month, each year.</li>

<dd>I think that's sufficient.

Do we need one for every two bit porn star/D-list celebrity, every episode of every tv show ever, every last movie ever, every pokemon character, every notable thing ever? isn't that the point? I can appreciate the guy not wanting an article for any reason... he doesn't like it, he thinks its unfair, he thinks it an invasion of his privacy by existing (the apparent reason as I read it...), or because he feels like it <i>that day</i>. But he made himself notable, wikipedia didn't make him notable. He got more notable the more he fought, and the more attention he brought on himself by railing on and on. any circular increase in notability/notoriety he got, that I can tell from reading (good God, too many of these) articles and Wikipedia history is his own doing. he keeps at the media, he keeps at Wikipedia, not the other way around. we just documented it all it looks like, and he kept it up. chicken or the egg?

<dd>
<ul>
<li>The first regards Brandt's time as a vietnam protestor. He was not a notable vietnam protestor. The sources regarding his protests range from "weak (student newspaper)" to "his name is used.(NYTimes)." Nothing is added to our article by including this, and we have regularly had "unverifiable" (aka "totally false made up shit") inserted into this section.</li>
<li>The second part of his work is "Networking with other activists." This, again, has sources ranging from "absolute crap" (NameBase NewsLine, picked up by another source) and "Unreliable blog" (Counterpunch).</li>
<li>The section on "Deep Indexing" should be moved to an article about Micro Associates or Namebase.org, or deleted as totally irrelevent.</li>
<li>The "Split within the PIR" section shoud be moved to the article on <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Information_Research_b1d1.html" title="Public Information Research">Public Information Research</a></li>
<li>Online Activism is already covered by the article on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_419f.html" title="Google Watch">Google Watch</a>.</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> No-brainer per Denny. There's really little I can say to add to it besides to mention that Brandt is already convinced we are evil so it doesn't matter at all what we do - we are and always will be a target of his. Which isn't *that* bad a thing, as long as he remains honest, because it means he'll find stuff like the plagiarism and the Essjay thing which, however painful it turns out and however much better it could've been handled inside the community, sooner or later needed to be fixed. --<a href="../../../g/w/e/User_talk%7EGwern_64b9.html" title="User talk:Gwern">Gwern</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gwern_077f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gwern">(contribs)</a> 18:58 <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_2.html" title="March 2">2 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> (GMT) 18:58, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> but take extreme care to make sure it meets WP policy (really we should with all BLP's and all articles, but whatever).

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Mainstream media coverage + reliable sources = keep if any reasonable people want it. Reasonable people want this article. Keep the article.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It would be easy to say "13th nomination" - 'nuff said but the is much more to be said. The subject is not borderline notable, he is very very notable. He was notable in August '05 and he is <i>much</i> more notable now. The article is high quality and well sourced. Privacy is a red herring since all the information is public domain. Remember: Brandt's complaint about the article is not that it is biased to libelous - he has two problems with it (a) "Google loves Wikipedia" so it comes up first when you search for his name, and (b) he is concerned about defamatory information being added. <i>Even Brandt has no complains about the article itself.</i> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Spart_dfd6.html" title="User:David Spart">David Spart</a> 19:16, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay, a clear and detailed, albeit repetitive, case. (1) He is of very marginal notability. It may not appear that way to us, because we talk about him a lot, but that's an internal Wikipedia thing. Outside in the real world, he's not known, and he's not a public figure, though he wants to be, in my view. When the New York Times mentioned him in relation to the Siegenthaler affair, they said "Daniel Brandt, 57, of San Antonio, who makes his living as a book indexer," then mentioned that he'd set up a website. This is how newspapers refer to people they regard as private figures. They didn't say: "Daniel Brandt, the Wikipedia privacy activist." (2) Because of the fuss surrounding it, the article has attracted a lot of excited editing, and a "publish and be damned" attitude. This has led to a degree of immature and unprofessional editing, with scant regard for our editing policies, and I don't see that changing any time soon. (3) The article has caused a lot of trouble, and it isn't worth it. We're an encyclopedia project; we're not here to prove that we can't be "bullied." Ignore the bullying, the apparent blackmail attempts, and the whole hive mind thing, and concentrate on whether it benefits Wikipedia to have this article. It clearly doesn't. (4) The subject says he wants it to be deleted. I don't believe he does, because when he first requested deletion in or around October 2005, I deleted it, and it would have stayed that way if he hadn't started posting about it on various blogs, causing one of the bloggers to recreate it. But regardless, he <i>says</i> he wants it deleted, and I believe that bios of borderline notable living persons should be deleted on request. I hope this is a clear and detailed enough case. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:52, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong delete</b>, Brandt is notable in his field, yes. However, his field is not staggeringly newsworthy or of high impact on the world in general. He has requested on numerous occasions that this article be removed. Why are we so desperate to have an article on him? Will Wikipedia collapse without one article on an internet activist? Are we so rabidly inclusionist that kindness and being "for the reader, not just the editor", go out of the window? Rhetorical questions, please do not answer. I honestly don't see why we have to have an article if the subject of that article has asked us not to. It is far, far more relevant to the subject than to any of us, individually or collectively. The argument that "Yes, but the newspaper mentions him!" - hey! <i><b>Wikipedia is not a newspaper</b></i>. If any print encyclopaedia had a polite request from someone who has a small mention and who is unrelated to anything major, they would remove the article, the world would not collapse, life would go on. Why is this such an emotive, hysterically overwrought and dramatic topic? Why is our policy more important than the subject's own feelings? If you consider it is, then you are a retard and I wish to never talk to you. Brandt's not trying to subvert the article for a puff piece, he isn't trying to abuse his article in a big conflict of interest. He just, very civilly, asked for the article to be removed, and Wikipedians, being the children we mostly are, said "yah boo it is VERIFIABLE so we will keep it". Delete it, let the man have his privacy, and go make Wikipedia a better place. I wish we could move on from this, I really do. Sometimes, I understand why he is trying to get his own back, I really do.

<li><b>Be an <i>encyclopedia</i> and delete</b> this is long overdue. We are supposed to be a serious encyclopedia and we need to rise above the silliness of this tiff.

Would deleting this this set a precedent, and lead to other demands?? Yes, and we'd be a better encyclopedia for it. Delete all less-notability bios if the subject is unhappy and the article no loss, and let's go back to creating great articles in all the meaningful areas where we are full of shit.

<dd>Let's say Brandt's article is deleted (13th time's the charm if you take that one off the front, I guess). A few months down the line, someone notices that there's no article for this guy even though he's mentioned in this article and that article so they google him. They see that they get a pretty good number of hits so they consolidate all the information that's already elsewhere on Wikipedia, slap a few sources on the page, and call it a night. A few hours later, someone notices that Brandt has an article and nominates it for deletion. The author/compiler of the article comes back and uses guidelines and policy to back up the article they worked on the day before.

<li><b>Keep</b> From what I can tell the arguments for deletion are: <i>He doesn't want it.</i> Although I feel for subjects in this position, I think it has to be irrelevant to Wikipedia. <i>He (or his field) are not sufficiently notable.</i> This is reasonable, but I think notability is more cause for inclusion than exclusion. Plus, he has been noted, which I take as a good proxy for notable. <i>He deserves his privacy.</i> That would work for me for a private citizen, but Brandt is an intentionally public figure. <i>We're only doing this out of spite.</i> I don't have anything against him, so that's not my motivation. <i>There is another page with this information.</i> That's great, but I don't see that as a reason to delete this. <i>This article is too much trouble.</i> I think that would be a terrible precedent, and would mean we could be harrassed into deleting things that we otherwise would keep. On the keep side, it seems like we have plenty of material and that the article meets core policies like <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Further, it fits my personal criterion of utility: people may see his name somewhere and say, "Who is this Brandt guy the paper is quoting?" And anytime people have a reasonable question, I think we should have an easy-to-find factual answer for them.

<li>I think the biggest reason is that deleting material based on personal preference inevitably skews our contents. We have a responsibility to our readers to be a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> repository of factual information. Per <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, we don't include anything that people can't find out elsewhere, so we're not exposing anything that isn't already public.

I think <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is a good example of that.

<li>Sorry for replying to myself, but apparently my reply to the "too much trouble" argument wasn't explicit enough. First, I feel like having a precedent like this would be terrible, as I expect a lot of articles could be considered too much trouble. Second, having that precedent gives people incentive to create trouble around articles they would like removed. Third, deleting things we would otherwise keep increases systemic bias, this time in the case of favoring non-controversial material.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: When I wrote "the man doesn't want it", I did not mean that articles about Pope Benedict, Tony Blair, and George W. Bush should be taken down if the subject of the article indicated a desire that we should do so. I believe that with living people who are definitely notable, to the extent that it would seem odd for an encyclopaedia not to have an article on them {Michael Jackson comes to mind), we should keep such articles, regardless of the wishes of their subjects, <b>but we should scrupulously ensure that they stay in line with <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a></b>. For people who are so non-notable that an article about them would make the encyclopaedia lose credibility (me, for example!) we should not have articles, even if the subject wishes for one (I don't!). However, for people who are not so notable that the lack of an article would make Wikipedia lose credibility (such as Daniel Brandt), if such people indicate that they do not wish for an article, their wishes should certainly not be regarded as completely irrelevant. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElinorD_4da6.html" title="User:ElinorD">ElinorD</a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EElinorD_6fce.html" title="User talk:ElinorD">(talk)</a> 16:16, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The fact that this article is repeatedly kept shows that there's very little reliance on common sense. The existence of guidelines to guide is reasonable, yes, but, there are a few points which need to be made: 1) Wikipedia is not that important to the real world. It does meet our notability guidelines etc, but that doesn't mean it's actually a large facet of the world, nor does it make all things connected to it of vast importance. 2) Based on 1, this man's Wikipedia activism is really not that important either. Yes, it meets our notability guidelines combined with his other minor activism, but he is one of many to do similar things. At best, he is of borderline notability/importance. Very few non-Wikipedia editors will want to know about him. 3) Based on 1 and 2, if his actual relevance is questionable (and it really is in the real world), then I think we should respect requests to have articles removed. We've done it before. It's not some sort of submission to bullying, it's a matter of being decent. Nothing tragic will occur if we lose this article. The fact that Wikipedia has failed to do what it should have done a long time ago does not mean it cannot rectify its mistakes. 4) Besides all of the other things, this article causes strife within the community, and will continue to do so while Brandt remains alive. It's really quite silly to keep it around when he doesn't want it, it's not helping us, and it's really not helping that many in our readership. GassyGuy 21:55, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Obvious <b>Keep</b>. If someone asks to be removed, that is a factor in favor of deletion, but this guy is too notable for that. If you want to play a numbers game, just multiply the size of this AfD page by the number in the page title. Raw numbers don't indicate notability, but they do suggest it, and those numbers are huge. The numbers of web hits are huge also. If you want to delete someone for non-notability, why is there still an article about <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a>? He's a complete unknown outside of Wikipedia.

It looks like there are considerably more keep&#160;!votes than delete&#160;!votes, so if this is kept, can it just be <i>kept</i>? And if the consensus (somehow) clearly points toward deletion, can it just be <i>deleted</i>? I'm sure that, no matter what the outcome, someone is already setting up the DRV page, and that's stupid. It's foolish to waste so much time and effort on one person who is only marginally notable (note that I'm not saying whether or not "marginally notable" is also "sufficiently notable"). Everyone's so up in arms about one article that isn't all that important, and it would be far better if we just laid this to rest after this AfD.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> The irony, here is a barely notable activist who criticizes Google and Wikipedia on privacy issues, and we pay him back by giving him a full fledged article on his life. Payback meaning: <i>So you like privacy eh? Here’s an article about you. And it stays! Welcome to the world wide web!</i> Really people, as a true encyclopedia, shouldn’t we handle this professionally? Or are we a social club who reacts to criticism when we are called on the obvious problems we have? And our response: <i>We</i> band together to chastise someone in society that was questioning our (among others on the web) accountability and <i>we</i> say he gets an article. If he does not want an article, and he’s barely notable, why do we not respect his wish? Interesting proposition, if you want an article about your life in WIKI, do nothing but start off slow, say some things about search engines, start Google Watch knowing that since it is on the web, Google will pick it up. Then criticize Wikipedia enough to get your name in some media, and we will write an article about you and "honor your wish". Was this what he wanted? Who knows?

<li>Inclusion vs. Deletion</li>
<li>Policy vs. Ignore All Rules</li>
<li>Consensus vs. Fiat</li>
<li>Public interest vs. Subject’s wishes</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Those arguing to delete are willing to throw consensus-based policy out the window for the sake of expediency:&#160;:It’s “disruptive,” he doesn’t want it, etc. However, many Wikipedia policies make a lot of work, from allowing anonymous edits to requiring consensus. I believe controversies like this ultimately make for a better encyclopedia, because they test philosophical positions with real-world examples. They gauge community consensus. They allow opposing points of view to have a civil discussion that sets our long-term course. I believe the manner in which Wikipedia handles biographies of critics and controversial people (or in this case, both) should represent our best work. Any living biography subject should be able to look at their article and say, yes, that’s all true. In this case, it’s all true, it’s well-sourced, and it’s a fair summary of his work. So, do we ignore all rules and delete by fiat according to the subject’s wishes, or do we include a public figure based on consensus-based policy? It appears most people feel the latter is the better course of action, and we should abide by that. <a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJokestress_f864.html" title="User:Jokestress">Jokestress</a> 00:06, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b> this one is not so complicated. The subject has voluntarily stepped from obscurity into the public eye. He may not be a household name, but is well known in his field and has some notable achievements. So arguments about non-notability are subjective at best. I started the process of going through the list of references pending inclusion, checking them, and expanding the article. I thought I would have this weekend to continue this process, but it was cut short by the early nomination (which I protested above). Even if we delete this version of the article, there is nothing to stop anyone from re-creating it since it meets all policy requirements, so this is a dead end. Protecting against re-creation would be an extreme step and set a bad precedent (especially after the article survived multiple previous AfD). So delete is a non-starter. As far as splitting the content, that is a valid editorial consideration, but should be made based on the <i>content</i> not the <i>subject.</i> Even if the information about his various projects are split to separate articles, the main article on the subject needs to stay wiki-linked for context. The alternative is the opposite of <a href="../../../b/t/w/WP%7EBTW_16cd.html" title="WP:BTW">WP:BTW</a>. I do believe the wishes of the subject can be considered in cases of marginal notability, but this is not such a case. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 01:20, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Actually</b> the point of waiting a week was to give the closing admin <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">User:Thebainer</a> the best chance of subverting process to get his own way. While I know the the original speedy deletion mess was orchestrated by Brandt and a number of sympathetic admin operating out of an IRC channel, I was shocked to find out the while Thebiner presented himself as neutral in his closing remarks he had in fact been conspiring on the wikipediareview.com message boards - along with Daniel Brandt himself - to get the article deleted in the most expeditious way possible. The sordid discussion can be viewed <a href="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=6979&amp;st=20" class="external text" title="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=6979&amp;st=20" rel="nofollow">here</a> (well done to <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennyColt_9f74.html" title="User:DennyColt">User:DennyColt</a> for finding it.)

<dd>Um, actually if one continues to read the thread, one sees that that Thebainer is not conspiring as described at all, rather expressing his/her opinion on what would happen in the AfD <b>IF</b> the results from the RVC (sp?; whatever the last procedural moiety was called) were <b>extrapolated</b> to the AfD. That may be right, or wrong. Thebainor also expressed an opinion of the article which is not entirely consistent with delete.

<li><b>Delete</b>, but speedy close this AFD. It strikes me as process gaming. Anyone who paid attention to the DRV isn't expecting an AFD to come out for a week so raising this AFD early is potentially cutting off many users who have strong views about the issue.

<li>It's funny that you accuse me of not assuming good faith when you yourself are assuming bad faith on brainer's part. Though I disagree with the result of his closure (the thing really needs to go), he unquestionably did what was probably the least disagreeable action that took into account everyone's concerns. As for wikipediareview, it's disturbing that any Wikipedia admin would have an account there, but nothing he said in the thread you linked above was particularly shocking. As for this staying open five days, barring a huge revelation (like someone actually googling and finding a source), nothing ever changes after day 1 of an AFD. As far as assume good faith ... I fully assume that Isotope23 is acting in what he believes to be Wikipedia's best interest.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> Brandt has been involved in some marginally notable activities, e.g. <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_419f.html" title="Google Watch">Google Watch</a>. That does not make Brandt himself notable. Simply merge anything notable from Brandt's article into those, delete, salt, and declare victory. Not one snippet of information need be censored or removed from Wikipedia. Is it <i>really</i> so essential that it be organized in a particular fashion? No, that's a judgement call we make every day on hundreds of articles. In this case, there are two reasons that tilt the otherwise fairly equal balance towards deletion. First, Brandt has asked us to do so. Regardless of my personal dislike for him, based on his deplorable treatment of Katefan, that does not make it ok to treat him poorly in return. Second, Brandt has poured considerable effort into causing problems for Wikipedia. I believe he is likely to be less energetic without this thorn in his side. Indeed, Brandt explicitly says he's likely to get tired of this: <i>It's also true, however, that if my bio stays down, I'll get bored with the idea of expanding wikipedia-watch.org. It might just sit there like Google-Watch has been sitting there for almost two years now.</i><a href="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=6954&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=23482" class="external autonumber" title="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=6954&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=23482" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> We've paid a huge price in time, lost editors, bad publicity, ill will, 13 AFD's + DRV, and paranoia. Witness the current nightmare involving Essjay, who asserts that avoiding stalkers like Brandt was the genesis of his fraud. Is this good for the encyclopedia? It has been, and will continue to be, enormously destructive. The cost-benefit analysis is simple. Zero benefit to keeping, as the information could equally well be merged elsewhere. Enormous damage on multiple fronts from keeping. People seem to imagine that somehow they are defending the principles of Wikipedia by voting keep.

<li><b>Comment</b> - This morning, I attempted an alternative way forward, but unfortunately it failed. With it we also squandered a chance to establish the precedent for proper application of IAR - explain, act, discuss, revert yourself if the discussion fails to gather consensus for what you've done. A precedent could also have been set for properly reverting IAR actions: If you don't agree that it's the best thing to do, explain why, revert and let the previous process continue. The sad thing is that it was sabotaged exactly by the people who should have seen that this would have advanced their position in the results/process debate. I would only like to ask them to stick to the process at least now, and allow this AFD to be ran at the previously agreed time, so that people who were planning to present coherent cases can be allowed to do so. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 03:53, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I think most of us can be sympathetic to an individual's lack of desire for an article here, or a photograph in the tabloids, or a nosy reporter in his/her front lawn... but the truth is that while Wikipedia is to be (and generally is) a "serious encyclopedia" it is only coherent and saved from being a giant blog by the fact that there is some consensus-based internal accountability for what the editors retain and discard from this website. This internal accountability appears in the form of our <i>policies</i> which, imperfect as they may be, must be followed unless there is a strong common-sense reason for invoking <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">WP:IAR</a> that saves us from those systematic imperfections. I've read through the delete votes, and I just don't see anything that compelling. I agree that it is possible the article may have been started because of some petty net.revenge tactic, and perhaps retained for a while due to this reason, but I have seen a number of subtle and not-so-subtle violations of the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> guideline in regard to the editors voting to keep the article <i>now</i>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Not to drag on too long, I have two main reasons for voting to keep: 1) It meets our policies. If these policies need to be changed, they need to be changed, but until they are it will not "hurt" anyone (the article's subject included) to abide by them. 2) <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> makes a remarkably compelling argument based on how Wikipedia has worked and does work. The entry has survived a huge number of previous AfDs and, unless the article is deleted and salted, it's going to pop right back up, reflecting the obvious fact that there will never (never[never{never}]) be a perfect consensus on whether or not to include this article. <i>No consensus defaults to keep</i>. This is the way Wikipedia currently works, like it or not, and I have not read a single clear policy-based, consensus-based or precedent-based reason for removing this entry. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 05:27, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Shouldn't be too stressful - no consensus keep, and was always going to be. An RFC might have been a better way forwards. We're just arguing back and forwards about how notabile he is when we really should be asking "Is the damage caused by having this page greater than the damage that would be caused by making an exception to our usual policies on notability?" and "Would deleting this page stop the damage anyway?". I think the answers are no and no, but frankly, I'd be prepared to try anything, just as a one off experiment. Fully protect the page and see what happens. Or delete the page and see what happens. Our usual practices are not working. I sugest it's time to try something unusual.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - True enough. Frankly I find the "He's not notable" arguments passing strange. I hadn't heard much about him before, but I am sure I haven't heard about a lot of notable people. I think the problem is that people are confusing "notable" with "famous" which is a little different. Someone even said something like, "He is not notable because he's only known in his field." Well... that makes him <i>notable</i>, the size of the field notwithstanding.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> as per Denny, and Jokestress (excellent arguments by the way: policy-based, and compelling). I would further add that it seems a little ridiculous that after the article on Daniel Brandt has in fact become well-researched and well-sourced that we would <i>now</i> abide by his wishes to delete the article (made most vocifierously when it was a "piece a crap"). Not having the article at Wikipedia would make it seem as though we have to something to hide. Keeping it and making sure it is absolutely excellent, would show that Brandt's criticism, while possibly valid at the time, no longer holds. Wikipedia has risen to challenge by designing policies and oversights that mitigate against such problems emerging again in the future, such as the additions to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> that make provisions for article subjects to challenge factual inaccuracies in articles about them. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 15:25, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b> - Can someone please explain to me in a very simple way what "this article is not worth the trouble" means in this context? How much stress are our editors going to endure by keeping a policy-compliant article on a figure that most editors appear to believe meets notability guidelines?

<li>Daniel Brandt has made it part of his mission in life to make Wikipedia <b>accountable</b> and to that end he is doing everything he can to find out and reveal the real identities of wikipedia administrators. Some people think he will stop if we delete his bio. He has said he will not.

<li>True, but consensus can change. The degree of reliablity of sources and general notability of topics has been steadily increasing and so having another AfD of a possibly borderline case is not intrinsically unreasonable. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 08:34, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An article that has gone through AfD no less than <b>twelve</b> times and has come up with a "keep" result every one of those times is hardly a "borderline" case. I suspect the only reason this AfD wasn't speedied or snowballed as a keep as well is simply due to the messy nature of the unilateral deletion and AfD that preceeded it. Since you yourself suggest that the reliability and notability of the topic has increased since then, I don't understand why you'd think a thirteenth AfD would be useful. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan Derksen</a> 06:02, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - No evidence has been presented here agains this notability that hasn't been brought up the first 12 times. There are plenty of non-trivial third party sources which is both necessary and sufficient for notability. Those who repeatedly bring this article up for deletion just haven't come to grips with that.

(2) I don't understand what is meant by <i>"too much trouble"</i>: If one or more editors, are disturbed by the drama surrounding this article, can't they just <i>choose</i> not to participate&#160;? If on the other hand we are talking about legal issues, shouldn't the <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a> weigh in and simply "force" a deletion&#160;?

<li>Try this for too much trouble (a) Katefan, an extraordinarily fine administrator who had nothing at all to do with Brandt, has to leave Wikipedia because Brandt harasses her livelihood. Ponder on that ... someone's <b>life</b> is screwed up simply for contributing to Wikipedia, because of this article. (b) Essjay, an extraordinarily fine administrator, an arbitrator, and god knows what else, assumes a false identity apparently to avoid such stalking. Unfortunately, and perhaps understandably, he takes it a bit far. I assume you are aware of the consequences for Wikipedia of that? So, no, I guess this is really no trouble at all. By the way, Brandt's article isn't particularly unflattering. He just doesn't want a freaking article on him.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Borderline notability only (internet activism tends to inflate the number of independent media mentions drastically, indeed this systematic bias is a great problem with the primary notability <i>guideline</i>) coupled with the difficulty in writing and maintaining a neutral version of this article, makes me believe that this should go. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:17, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>You have a point of course, but I think the issue with this article is not simply a case where the person is controversial. Here we have a case where the person is disliked strongly by a significant portion of the Wikipedia community, and I see serious conflict of interest issues when a community who dislikes the person is going to write up a supposedly neutral biography about him. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:16, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Actually, empirically speaking the Brandt article has a lot of positive material (such as his work with the government cookies) it is thus hard for me to see the conflict issue as actually being a problem when one looks at the edits that occur to the article and to the current state of the article. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 07:22, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per Borisblue and others.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I came to this AfD with an open mind, as Doc Glasgow had requested. I've been watching it since it was created. That's why I asked for clarification on the first Delete vote, since I'd seen a lot of good Keep reasons by then, and no Delete reasons. Now that I've seen a fair number of arguments each way, I feel prepared to have my say. Basically, it most people seem to be breaking notability down into 3 "levels". A/ Not notable. B/ Notable, but little enough that if they don't want an article, they can ask for it to be removed. C/ Notable, we should have an article about them. Most of the Delete votes state that Brandt falls into category A or B. Most of the Keep votes state that either he falls in C, or that B doesn't exist (making him fall into C by default). At this point, I'm still not sure whether or not B should exist, but given the number of stories that've been written about him in prominent, and reliable sources, I'm inclined to agree that he falls into category C. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 15:19, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> With all due respect, <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a> hardly expresses my feelings here. I'm tempted to write an essay called WP:IREALLYFREAKINGHATEHOWDISRUPTIVETHISSTUPIDARTICLEIS. (Apologies in advance for snarkiness, it's not directed at you personally.) Wikipedia's been held hostage by this damn article for a long time now. It could end so easily. So yeah, it's an emotional vote. I also agree that his notability is borderline. He is not, for example <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>. Wikipedia without an article on Bush would be ridiculous, Wikipedia without an article on Brandt is not. That's my argument.

<li><b>Comment</b> Fair enough, perhaps my thinking is wishful. But thinking it through further it appears to me that we may be ignoring an internet guideline that's existed long before <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Brandt is Wikipedia's biggest troll. There's no guarentee that if we don't <a href="../../../f/e/e/WP%7EFEED_4ab5.html" title="WP:FEED">feed</a> him he'll go away, but if we continue to do so, he will inevitably stay. There isn't really a right or wrong here. I disagree with the arguments that deleting the article will inevitably set up an infinite list of precedents. Those individuals mentioned as examples would have to be willing to act with the same single-mindedness as Brandt. It is possible, but also unlikely that they would. I'm not suggesting (though on re-read, I suppose I did) that deleting this article would solve the problem. But keeping it, debating it, all of this creates this spiral of disruption that I suspect is very pleasing to certain types of personalities. Let's take the high road here -- if one is really available. You make a big stink about your article? Fine, you're not that important, so we delete. Don't let the door hit you (etc.). On to the next thing, we have more important things to do. Flipping through the CSD makes it clear that there's enough people who desperately <i>want</i> a Wikipedia article. It's a job in itself to delete them sometimes. So one more internet meme, user name, guy who's really good at a "grown up's" version of an online role playing game (ie. Brandt) gets deleted. We shrug and move on. It's just a suggestion, albeit a hopeful one. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 18:40, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a very difficult decision to make. The spirit with which we are supposed to go into this particular AfD (and, actually, <i>all</i> AfDs in general) is one of a review from first principles (<i>de novo</i>, as the lawyers put it, though <a href="../../../i/a/n/IANAL_268a.html" title="IANAL">IANAL</a>) of the encyclopedic case for keeping or dropping the article, untainted by past AfDs, deletion reviews, talk pages, outside fora, arguing, debating, bitching, moaning, whining, and the associated emotional baggage. Being that we're all human, this can be very hard to do. This review should be based solely on whether the article's subject is proper for inclusion here. Lines of argument that aren't very good (despite the fact that I, myself, may have used some of them at times in the past... I'm human too) include "He's insisting that he be removed, and he's being a big pain about it... so we gotta <b>teach him a lesson</b> by refusing his request!!!"... or conversely, "He's insisting that he be removed, and he's being a big pain about it... so it <b>just ain't worth it</b> to keep the article... let's give in on this." There seems to be a growing trend on Wikipedia lately to decide to delete articles that are the focus of lots of fighting and griping, on the "just ain't worth it" grounds (Encyclopedia Dramatica and GNAA are two recent examples), but I disagree with this reasoning. On the other hand, if I then vote "keep" on the grounds of opposing such reasoning, then isn't <i>that</i> a vote based on emotional reactions, or ideological point-making, too? To get out of that paradox, it's necessary to put aside all such thoughts and consider only the notability and verifiability of the subject, by objective criteria. Here, it is my observation that Brandt has been written about numerous times by the media, and has frequently been used as a cited source in matters of public interest. Hence, he meets the criteria for inclusion. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 17:30, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am in complete agreement with that. I also think that the amount of "damage," or potential damage to Wikipedia is being vastly overstated. Wikipedia is not being disrupted (or its editors unnecessarily captivated) by this article or even the gigantic AfD it has generated <i>13 times</i>. Only those who choose to be involved are involved, and the site rolls on with little notice (just compare the percentage of contributors to this page with the total number of Wikipedians, most if not all of whom know nothing of this matter). First principles is necessarily the only way to go in deciding this matter, not emotions, biases, or anything else unrelated to our policies or <b>strong</b> common-sense reasons for ignoring all the rules. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 17:44, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The only real disruption this article has caused is the ceaseless debate over its existence. Has the subject of the article made it clear that he doesn't want the article to exist? Of course, but that's because the subject of the article runs an anti-Wikipedia organization (which, as far as I can tell, consists mostly of him). Firstly, I don't believe that we should remove an article solely because its subject doesn't approve of it. The article isn't the potential source of a legal issue, as far as I can tell, as it's more or less accurate. If people don't want to be documented, positively, negatively or neutrally, then they should stay out of the spotlight. Wikipedia is supposed to be a compilation of knowledge, and deciding to exclude anything from the encyclopedia on the basis that it's controversial is a self-defeating practice. Deleting this article sets a bad precedent that we can't afford. Secondly, and I know at least one person will jump on me for this- several people have stated their opinion that, despite policy, we should delete the article, because its subject doesn't approve of it. Well, I hold a more or less opposite position, also outside of policy: Daniel Brandt spends most of his time trying to damage Wikipedia's credibility and in a large way he has succeeded. If we deliberately choose not to document Daniel Brandt, this will only serve as further ammunition for him. It will not appease him. It will make us look, to his supporters, even more illegitimate- what sort of an encyclopedia, he'll say, would remove a well-documented person? Even if he doesn't reverse his position to further his goals, he -will- make it very public that Wikipedia gave in. Is it a poor reason to reject an AfD? Perhaps, but it's not my primary reason, and I think it's an issue. --<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoralis_8b3a.html" title="User:Moralis">Moralis</a> 17:46, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Aside from his Wikipedia-related activism, he also has Google Watch, NameBase, and the whole NSA cookies incident to his name (this won't count for anything, but I had heard of the NSA cookies incident long before I knew he had anything to do with attacking Wikipedia). The fact that he doesn't want the article is the worst possible reason to delete it; <b>deleting an article because the subject wants it deleted is grossly POV</b>. The article is very well sourced, so <b>there are no BLP concerns</b> (indeed, an ArbCom decision certifying that will pass very soon).

<li><b>Delete</b>. It appears that this whole debate hinges on the question of "who is notable"? To me, an occasional editor who happened to stumble across this whole thicket whilst reading up on the Wikipedia scandal du jour, I see "notability" as the answer to this question: Would someone who <b>didn't</b> read Wikipedia have any reason to know who this person is? A non-Wikipedia reader would know who <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> is. A non-Wikipedia reader wouldn't have a clue who Daniel Brandt is. To me, that means Brandt is non-notable and the bio should be deleted. One should watch out for the circular logic of "we're talking about him on Wikipedia, so therefore he's notable on Wikipedia, so that's why we're talking about him on Wikipedia".

<li><b>Keep</b>. The subject is notable for many separate news worthy events, and has chosen to put himself in the public eye. A delete based on notability would require that the standards for BLP are raised significantly, and I cant see where a new line can be drawn that would exclude this BIO without resulting in the deletion of large numbers of the other BLP. IMO, the only satisfactory way to delete this article is for the foundation to make a legally and ethically defensible policy that BLP's can be removed at the wish of the subject. Articles like this one and another related BLP up for deletion at the moment illustrate how encyclopaedia that anyone can edit can find itself becoming a tabloid. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 06:49, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Linuxbeak Solution</b> (I think it's called that) where we keep the article deleted until Mr. Brandt dies, and then we can restore it and work on it. As a person with considerably low notability, Wikipedia won't take a blow from temporarily not having this article. Once he's dead, he really wouldn't care about an article about him because he's dead. <span style="font-size:95%">—<a href="../../../m/e/s/User_talk%7EMessedrocker_915e.html" title="User talk:Messedrocker">Signed</a>, your friendly neighborhood <b><a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessedrocker_53b5.html" title="User:Messedrocker">MessedRocker</a></b>.</span> 07:28, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Unacceptable. Among other issues, do you expect Wikipedia to keep a list of who is still alive whose articles we've deleted? Oh number 32 kicked the bucket! I guess while his family is grieving we can bring back that article now that caused him so much distress because of course none of them would mind. Now, if you wanted to do something like 25 years after the guy is dead that might make some sense. But we still have the fundamental issue, under what logic should we delete an article on a clearly notable individual who has been more than willing to talk to the press simply because he doesn't like their being internet content about him that he doesn't have control of?

<li><b>Keep</b> as I do believe this person meets the applicable notability criteria and the article meets policy standards. I heard of him before I ever accessed Wikipedia (the cookie thing).

So, just as a wild suggestion, what if one of our truly talented writers was to sit down with the reference list on the talk page and craft a top notch article - using an IP address if he or she preferred?

<li><b>Keep</b>: with the current controversy surrounding this article, it seems clear to me that this subject is only going to continue to rise in notability. We need to be careful as to exactly how his article is editted since his notability increasingly derives from meta-referencing Wikipedia and obviously many editors will have <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflicts of interest</a> simply by virtue of being affiliated with Wikipedia, but deleting an article on this individual wholesale is inappropriate in my estimation and seems to be based mostly on a distaste for the subject of the article and a (somewhat disingenuous, in my estimation) misplaced concern with the opinions on the subject as to whether an article about him should exist. There is no criteria which state anywhere in this encyclopedia that one of the criteria for inclusion should be whether or not the subject wants to be in the encyclopedia. This is something that should not change, in my opinion. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 13:17, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

There's never been consensus that we should delete articles on less notable people upon request from the subject.

<dd>I like the use of the word "instigated" but I think you meant "initiated". Fine. A notable person, at the level of H.W. Bush, COULD nominate (or instigate) multiple AfDs but have they? A notable person, at the level of H.W. Bush, COULD also hire people to do so but have they? Examples? I'd argue that Brandt has the time and inclination to obsess on wikipedia precisely because his notability is low enough to leave room for such activities. Truly notable people don't hang out in IRC chat rooms all the time. I mean this is really common-sense that only gets lost in the translation because we talk about Brandt a LOT on WP.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeURL_4d82.html" title="User:MikeURL">MikeURL</a> 19:50, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm going to have to second JoshuaZ on this one. The Free time=Notability standard is a very weak link to make. Furthermore, Internet activity doesn't necessarily mean free time.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I see it in a simple way: he's notable and so we have an article about him. Period. Now, it's entirely possible (I'd argue likely) that individuals other than Mr. Brandt <b>will</b> want to pressure Wikipedia and Wikipedians for the deletion of articles about themselves. To my mind, it's as problematic to delete an article at the behest of the subject as it is to allow the subject to re-write his article with impunity - they're both forms of deception. Mr. Brandt meets our guidelines, and I feel that should be the end of it. It's not about "spite" or "revenge" or anything like that. My motivation is writing an encyclopedia, not frustrating Mr. Brandt <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECartwarmark_5701.html" title="User:Cartwarmark">Cartwarmark</a> 01:13, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The gentleman passes WP:BIO, and his article is well-sourced. Other concerns, including the gentleman's desire for the article's deletion, are irrelevant. The current content reads well, and complies with NPOV: Wikipedia can cover this subject dispassionately, and should continue to do so. As criticism of Wikipedia is sure to be noteworthy for the foreseeable future, and as Brandt's role in that topic continues to be prominent, it is likely his notriety will only increase. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 23:12, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

After further consideration, I don't think there's a good case for deleting the article for either reason. However, I do think it should be significantly pruned so that it covers only what the recent news sources deal with, namely, his online activism. Thus, <b>everything to do with antiwar protests and so forth should be removed</b>. The next section should also be removed, save a brief mention of Namebase. The Siegenthaler section should be reduced to a link because it's already covered in the appropriate article. The PIR schism sentence should be removed for precisely the same reason. This way, we'll have an article on Brandt - I see no way out of this - but we'll keep it to the bare essentials.</li>

For a time, there was only one referernce that treated Brandt as a subject in a biographical context. Every other referernce made trivial mention of Brandt's anti-Wikipedia and anti-Google stance and his activities with the CIA/NSA website. In the past week, it has been determined that this one reference was unsuitable because the newspaper uses Wikipedia as a source. This leaves no external sources that are of a biographical context. There are references that are interviews with the subject, but the discussion was not of a biographical context; it didn't discuss Brandt's background, just his recent activist activities. Even these do not pass the criteria for inclusion under WP:BIO because the sources must be "independent of the person." It's well past the time where this article should have been deleted.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - The above user writes, "There are references that are interviews with the subject, but the discussion was not of a biographical context." That doesn't matter - the section of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> being quoted above is strictly about establishing notability, not about sources for the actual biographic information within the entry itself. In other words, if the interviews establish notability for <i>any</i> reason, they do not have to be of a biographical context. The biographical information contained in the article can be drawn from elsewhere (e.g., sources that are not entirely independent of the subject) as long as they can be verified... if the notability is there. And again, <i>notability</i> and <i>fame</i> are two different things. Brandt may not be famous, because many people do not know about him, and few outside the context of his activism, but in the fields of his activity, he has been <b>noted</b> by a number of independent sources, meeting Wikipedia's requirements for an article. Quick way to decide notability: "Has the subject been noted by a number of non-self-published sources?" The answer in this case is, "Yes." And, whatever else may be said about it, pain or difficulty is not mentioned anywhere in the policies or guidelines about deletion or retention of encyclopedic entries. Consider... what kind of credible encyclopedia filters its content based upon the desires of its topics?? Wikipedia would hardly be worth the paper it's not printed on if it were to bow to the wishes of individuals when deciding content. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 19:29, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Independent of the person" refers to the writer or publisher of the source; it doesn't mean interviews aren't allowed, it means that self-published articles don't count, and the publisher isn't the subject's employer, employee, or brother-in-law.

<li><b>Keep</b>, absent any real evidence that the article (rather than its subject) has harmed anyone. "Notability" is everybody's favorite word these days, but it means fuck-all in the big picture. You can gerrymander your "notability" guidelines however you want, but there is no reasonable inclusion criteria which this article would fail, none which the other cruft on your watchlist would satisfy, no magic bullet, no hypothetical arbitrary threshhold that doesn't take the unprecedentedly low stoop of mentioning the subject by name, even. I don't know how could I make it any clearer that there is no basis in policy or guideline to delete this page. Unplagiarized, neutrally presented information verifiable by a source other than ourselves; That is the <i>only</i> inclusion guideline established by policy. Everything else is a harmonious ad-libbing at best, and an aimless pissing match at worst. Guidelines are acceptable to the extent that they are based on precedent, and on the opinions of our core contributors the people who know what they are talking about, the people we trust, regarding the quality/usefulness/maintainability of any given page. Of course, these are secondary to actual policy. If these are ambiguous, the moral default is live and let live, find some other area to continue your gate-crashing, albeit good faith, attempts to "improve" the encylopedia. I've read all the excuses with which people have tried to justify deleting this article, so don't reiterate them for my sake. My bullshit detector has blown about twelve fuses in the last two weeks.

<li>Not in the least.

This is the gist of the Attribution (No Original Thought) Policy, and it outweighs any consensus of Wikipedia editors, including all other policies and guidelines.

<li>It is simply my observation that Wikipedia Editors are conducting what anybody else would call an "Opinion Poll" in order to decide whether a certain person is "Notable". Whether an Opinion Poll is conducted by interviewing Mr. and Ms. Person In The Street, by a sampling of what Wikipedia Editors consider to be "Notable" Newspapers, or by meta-enumerating your favorite search engine hits, it still amounts to the same thing, to wit, Original Research conducted by Wikipedia Editors.

<li>Don, you are a very new user and so you may not have a strong grasp on policy at this time. The bottom line is that notability for inclusion is distinct from saying "X is notable" in article space. Furthermore, Wikipedia in fact to a large extent works off of precedent so your analogy with the speeding tick is irrelevant. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 22:20, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>(Carriage Return 1). I see that some folks have a lot more time to spend on this than I do, so I will try sum up how I see it for today. Not my contention. Not my policy. What I see is some very strong language about <i>Not A Primary Source</i> and <i>No Original Thought</i> in the Attribution Policy, and there is a maximum precedence ordering that is currently assigned to that. On that principle, it should never happen that somebody will say "X is notable" just because Wikipedia takes notice of X. I get the feeling that people will continue to differ about what's Notable Enough for a Newspaper Article and what's Notable Enough for an Encyclopedia Article, but Wikipedia is supposed to be an Encyclopedia, not an Almanack, not an Opinion Poll, and not an Op-Ed column. Outside observers, of which there are especially many right now, will only respect Wikipedia if it has Policies that it applies equally to all cases. You do the math. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDon_de_la_Muncha_4555.html" title="User:Don de la Muncha">Don de la Muncha</a> 19:58, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ok, so the bottom line is that you don't understand the difference between deciding that something meets <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and saying inside an article that "X is notable" one is ok, the other is no this clear from both the wording of the policies and long standing precedent. If this were not the case a great many articles would need to be deleted. For example, I suspect that many US Presidents articles would need to go since I doubt anyone has ever bothed in a reliable source saying something like "George Washington was notable" and certainly most elected officials in congress and various parliments are out. You don't really believe this is policy do you? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 20:09, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>(Carriage Return 2). I have stated my position and my reasons. In making your argument, you seem to find it necessary to refer to my personal characteristics, to speculate on my reading comprehension skills, and to invoke an unspecified superiority of experience and expertise with Wikipedia policy. Technically speaking, these are <i>ad hominem</i> arguments, and they are especially odd to hear in this environment. People may have an expert grasp of Wikipedia policy — I have no beef with the possibility of that — but like every other claim of expertise, they will have to articulate it here, and not just insist on their automatic claim to it. For that we have no recourse but turning to the texts of policy as they are written. If we find that we cannot produce a good encyclopedia by that prescription, then the R<sub>x</sub> will have to be adjusted. P.S. I am not an apothecary. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDon_de_la_Muncha_4555.html" title="User:Don de la Muncha">Don de la Muncha</a> 01:54, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ok, one more attempt to explain this — roughly speaking you are confusing meta-information with information.

What is prohibited is OR to determine information, that is material that goes into articles. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:02, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you think you can work that Original Rationalization into the current policy statements, then be my guest, but until then I will have to go with what's presently there. We all know that meaning is context-dependent, so you might be able to get away with saying that EnglishWikipedia:"Notability" means something different than EnglishLanguage:"Notability". Let me know how that works out, but I can at least see the possibility of it. You may even be able to get away with convincing other people that ArticleSpace:"Notability" means something else besides PolicySpace:"Notability", but I think you'll have something more of a fight on your hands with that. But when it comes to arguing that DanielBrandt:"Notability" is a different standard from RyanJordan:"Notability", or pick your favorite scandal of the month, then I think that most folks will start getting just a little bit suspicious of what we say is Wikipedia Policy. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDon_de_la_Muncha_4555.html" title="User:Don de la Muncha">Don de la Muncha</a> 02:18, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Brandt and Essjay have the same standard of notability — <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> — the same primary inclusion criterion as used for everything. If something else had been intended by this arrangement, don't you think someone would have already brought up this issue? Wikipedia Notability is a question of how many and what sort of sources we have a long with a few other things. We can evaluate those without falling afoul of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, we do this every day on many far less contentious AfDs. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:25, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Using <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s primary criterion is a tough argument to make because no <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary sources</a> have been provided. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> only loosely defines "notable" in terms of other loosely defined words like "non trivial" or "substantial". In the end, a judgement call is typically being made in cases where a secondary source does not exist (i.e. a real book hasnt yet been written by an undeniably reliable and qualified source). I have voted keep because a BIO crosses a magical line in my head that says "this is important and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> stuff" and "other more important stuff will also be tossed if this is deleted", but I can understand a newcomer shaking their head at this subject being considered "encyclopaedic" despite whatever criteria that we may like to use.</li>

<li>I think we have agreed that Wikipedia Attribution Policy, as currently written, militates against making an explicit assertion in an article that "X is a notable person" unless we can find the right sorts of sources explicitly saying that X is a notable person. We agree that there is some kind of distinction between this explicit assertion and the implicit assertion of notability that is involved in making an editorial decision to write a biography of that person. So far so good. But I think that this distinction is what is commonly called "a distinction without a difference", while JoshuaZ thinks that there is a significant practical difference between the two actions. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDon_de_la_Muncha_4555.html" title="User:Don de la Muncha">Don de la Muncha</a> 04:56, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I think it may make more sense to move this discussion to the area above where we started it, or even better to one of our talk pages since the unique policy interpretation will likely have no influence on the final decision. I'm becoming more and more perplexed about (a) why you don't see that there can be article space restrictions that don't apply to deciding whether we have an article and (b) why you would think if there were such an amazing glaring problem in our policy and guidelines that no one but you has ever noticed it. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 08:23, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>From what I read in the above instructions, this discussion is not supposed to be so much a matter of raw votes or intensity of feelings as a question of the better argument for what we should do. That is how I understood your interventions above, questioning my position and the reasons that I gave for it, all in the spirit of arriving at fair and rational applications of established policy. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDon_de_la_Muncha_4555.html" title="User:Don de la Muncha">Don de la Muncha</a> 15:36, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>With regard to JoshuaZ's Point (a), I have already said several times that I see <i>some</i> kind of distinction between explicitly saying, "X is a notable person", and implicitly saying that X is a notable person by dint of including their Personal Biography in Wikipedia. I am just saying that I do not see a <i>practical</i> distinction between these two things. For all practical purposes, those are just two different ways of saying the same thing. That is not just my perception — that is just the way that Common Sense and the General Reader would regard it. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDon_de_la_Muncha_4555.html" title="User:Don de la Muncha">Don de la Muncha</a> 16:26, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>With regard to JoshuaZ's Point (b), it was clear to me that many people had foreseen these very sorts of issues in writing the various policies and guidelines, and that was precisely why they wrote them the way that they did. Whether we have reached the best solution yet is a separate question, but I'm just going by the policies as written, along with the priorities that are assigned to them. The declared purpose of the Wikipedia project prohibits it from becoming a primary source, and its policies must be crafted to that purpose. If you ask the editors of a secondary source where they got the notion to print "S is a notable P" and all they can say is "from Wikipedia", then something has gone wrong somewhere. It's our job to make sure that the fault does not lie with us, that the buck does not stop here. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDon_de_la_Muncha_4555.html" title="User:Don de la Muncha">Don de la Muncha</a> 15:36, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I think that it would serve our ends here if people could make specific logical criticisms of each other's arguments and be assiduous to avoid even the appearance of personal insinuations.

There is some additional discussion of this point below, where a distinction is made between notability as an individual person, deserving of a full-fledged biography, and notability merely for particular actions and incidents. No doubt the current situation is in a state of more than usual flux, but it's clear that Wikipedia Editors recognize such a distinction, no matter how variously they may judge different cases. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDon_de_la_Muncha_4555.html" title="User:Don de la Muncha">Don de la Muncha</a> 02:02, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I don't believe that anyone other than Jimbo and ArbCom have the power to express "special treatment" for something which is such a big deal.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> The wishes of a person or subject are quite irrelevant if there are reliable, attributable sources cited for the material included in the article. If the information concords with Wikipedia's policy, there is quite frankly no other relevant concern. No other argument has been raised to counteract this, as the only serious one (the borderline BIO bit) has been knocked over recently and righly so. The only criterion is reliable, non-trivial coverage and more than incidental coverage etc as set out in policies; on that basis, this article must remain. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">SM247</a> 07:33, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> / <b>Sermon</b> / <b>Rambling thoughts</b> - I haven't really been paying attention to this thing. So this morning, I thought I would read some of the comments here. Does anyone realize that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia? This isn't a tabloid. It isn't TV guide. It isn't Pokemon Central. It isn't a message board. Articles about topics that have little or no significance outside of Wikipedia don't belong here. I've seen repeatedly that we should keep the article because Brandt shouldn't get to decide whether or not it gets deleted. Well, he isn't. I don't give a flip what he wants - I want the article deleted because it is unencyclopedic. I've seen keep&#160;!votes arguing that it meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Well, if it does, then WP:BIO needs to be changed. Heck, I meet WP:BIO, but it would be absolutely silly if a Wikipedia article were written about me - I'm a programmer at a small, unimportant company. What we should be focusing on is whether having this article makes us a better encyclopedia or does it make us a laughingstock. Is any serious scholar going to do research on Brandt? Is a student going to do a book report on a book he wrote? Will people be googling for Brandt, find that article, and decide that they want to become contributors? Is Encyclopedia Britanica going to suddenly realize that what they have been missing all these years is an article on Daniel Brandt? Good grief. Let's be an encyclopedia and clean house a little bit. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 16:04, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

It seems to me like you're saying, "Yes, we have sources, and yes 'all of us insiders' appear to be in favor of keeping it, but let's benefit Wikipedia by deleting it because most people will never search for this individual"? According to the front page, Wikipedia currently has "1,675,100 articles in English," and I guarantee you that the vast majority of users are not going to search for any one topic at any given time.

<li><b>Philosophical rambling</b> - The question most relevant here, even more than <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, seems to be philosophical regarding the extent to which Wikipedians go, or allow Wikipedia(ns) to go, to further the goals of Wikipedia. According to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, "Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia and, as a means to that end, an online community of people interested in building a high-quality encyclopedia in a spirit of mutual respect." Noting that Wikipedia has already lost one respected contributor and admin due to this article and had another admin caught in scandal because he was trying to prevent a similar situation per Derex above, the possible desysopping of two admins in a silly and preventable wheel war, and the above statement of Wikipedia policy, I must ask, how far is too far? Does the goal of building "a written compendium aiming to convey information on all branches of knowledge" (<a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">WP:ENC</a>) <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machiavelli.html" title="Machiavelli">justify the means Wikipedia(ns) take to get there</a>? This isn't likely to ever become an official policy on Wikipedia, but rather, it is a moral consideration that, at least, each user must make on their own, weighing the importance of the completeness of Wikipedia against the value of protecting members of the Wikipedia community. Certainly, this sort of discussion wouldn't be taking place if this article were about <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W.

<dd><b>Comment</b> It is a shame if warring over this article has cost the project a few contributors. But there are 3,771,025 ... oops I mean 3,771,042 ... no um... 3,771,066 registers contributors. So actually, in the time it took to type this reply, the project has already covered those losses.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - The fact that Wikipedia has many contributors shouldn't make individuals less important. I feel that it is important to remember that each user name here represents a real person, which is why I am mildly surprised by the analogy to economics. Wikipedia's community should be more like a company's staff list than its checkbook: money is money, no matter how you get it. But people are unique, and should be treated as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Prisoner_016e.html#Intro" title="The Prisoner">more than just numbers</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> This seems to be a claim that we are legally not allowed to have this article- this is ridiculous- if there were any legal problem you don't think Brandt wouldn't have sued us already. Also, read <a href="../../../l/e/g/WP%7ELEGAL_8608.html" title="WP:LEGAL">WP:LEGAL</a>. Finally, can you explain how we have in any way done anything that was done in Eight Ball? The matter there if you recall was publishing digitally altered nude pictures oof Milano. Now, given that, Milano claimed that her copyright had been infringed, her privacy violated , her right of publicity misappropriated, and that she had been placed in a false light. Now, if you could show how any of those have plausibly happened you mgiht, maybe have a point. None of those have occurred with Brandt and so this argument lacks any water. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 20:43, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sigh. Must I even point out <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>? Shystering? I think the average Wikipedian is Stupid? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a>, I believe the case is relevant: the final ruling in the case was not on whether the pictures were altered (some were, some were not) or whether or not they were copyright violations (most were, some weren't but Milano herself held none of the copyrights and thus had no standing); the ruling was whether the damage to her image done by the violating of her right to privacy was worth censoring the photos for. That and that alone was what the case was ruled on. My understanding is that Mr. Brandt is concerned about his reputation being damaged by the work of vandals to the web page.

<dd>If I did not assume good faith I would not bother to engage in a discussion with you, I can be much blunter than I have above. I am not a lawyer either and all I really know about law is that what the average journalists knows. That Mr. Brandt's page gets vandalized is hardly an object of this discussion but if we should have a page at all. Pages that are vandalized can be protected or semi-protected by any administrator and/or sysops. That ball is in their court and if the page is not protected than we should ask them why not. As for Mr. Brandt, being in the lime light by his own doing, I hardly can understand why he starts crying foul when the inconveniences of notability hit him. That is part of the I-am-notable game.

The Wikipedia and Daniel Brandt news articles did not begin until around June 2004. The Daniel Brandt article was created on September 28, 2005. The Wikipedia Daniel Brandt article itself did not make the Daniel Brandt topic <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Wikipedia-notable</a> (which was a concern of mine that I resolved with some research).

However, I would not oppose deletion under a different process if there were another process available (or even newly created) to address many of the above concerns. There also may be different processes to stub the article and delete the history/talk page of the article to start fresh.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Clearly, strictly according to policy this article can be kept (it is on a notable, verifiable subject, is not POV, and contains no original research). There are then two issues:
<ol>
<li>Is the article causing more trouble than it's worth?</li>
<li>Should the wishes of the subject be considered?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<dd>The answer to question 1 is unclear, but I would like to point out that this discussion, and previous discussions, have remained civil. The presence of discussions is not a problem, but a sign of a healthy community. Therefore, it seems like the article is not really causing much trouble. As for Mr. Brandt's so-called trolling, he would likely persist if the article is deleted, as well as if it is kept. The answer to question 2 is simple: if Mr. Brandt wants to keep certain facts private, he should not release them to the public. If Mr. Brandt wants to keep <i>all</i> facts about his existence public, he should not be a public figure. We will remove false information, but we will not remove inconvenient truths. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> (<a href="../../../n/_/s/User_talk%7EN_Shar_c5ad.html" title="User talk:N Shar">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_N_Shar_2c7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/N Shar">contribs</a>) 05:13, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Comments to Muncha and Fish- Regarding Essjay another consideration is that all the information was kept still in one location and Essjay redirects to that so the exact article title isn't as important.

<dd>Many problems with the above: first, google hits are no way an indication of notability. Second, a large number of the google hits given are not about "Google Watch". Third, internet-based events always have a high <a href="../../../c/r/u/Wikipedia%7ECruft_multiple_ace8.html" title="Wikipedia:Cruft multiple">Cruft multiplier</a>. Fourth, at best this would be an argument for having a mention of who he was on the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_419f.html" title="Google Watch">Google Watch</a> article (starting something notable doesn't make someone notable). Fifth, the current Brandt matter occured before the Essjay matter. Sixth, Brandt does <i>not</i> want an article here, so if people are reacting to him in any way, it is reacting to say keep to annoy him- people who are arguing for deletion are not doing so out of "offense." <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:21, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you search for "google watch" in quotes (phrase search) the ovewhelming majority of the available results are reffering to the website. Google hits are an indication of notability (though obviously not an exact measurment). People are interested enough to write and comment about Google Watch. Currently the majority of english speakers are Internet users. Even if you take into account the fact that people who participate in content creation on the Internet are more likely to write about Google Watch, this still means that other Internet users are reading about it. I changed my comment about the motivation of those who vote but still feel that this plays a role. <a href="../../../v/o/o/User%7EVoodoo_b671.html" title="User:Voodoo">Voodoo</a> 04:02, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>People are interested enough to write and comment about many things. They have nothing to do with whether we have <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that talk about something, and actually I don't think you understand how incredibly high the cruft multiplier is for internet based stuff. To use the ubiquitous example, I get over 100,000 hits for "Brian Peppers" even though there is not a single usable source about him (we have only one source of questionable reliability). However, the major talmudic figure <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honi_HaM%27agel_4609.html" title="Honi HaM'agel">Honi HaM'agel</a> has many fewer hits, even when we use a large number of variations of the name. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Honi+HaM%27agel&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Honi+HaM%27agel&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">Honi HaM'agel</a>- 98 hits, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Choni+HaM%27agel&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Choni+HaM%27agel&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Choni HaM'agel</a>- 80 hits, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Choni+HaMagel&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Choni+HaMagel&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Choni HaMagel</a> - 124 hits, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Honi+HaMagel&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Honi+HaMagel&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Honi HaMagel</a> - 20 hits, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Honi+Circle-drawer&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Honi+Circle-drawer&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Honi Circle-drawer</a> - wow a whopping 1600 hits, slightly over 1% of "Brian Peppers"! <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Choni+Circle-drawer&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Choni+Circle-drawer&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Choni Circle-drawer</a> - 248 hits. So in total we have Choni Hamagel, a figure who shows up in many Talmudic stories, even when using all imaginable variations of his name having in total at most (never mind the overlapping hits) less than 1/50th the number of hits as an internet phenomenon dedicated to a man who had the misfortune of being accused of a crime and having an odd looking picture. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:19, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>First of all, you link to a page about Wikipedia policy on attribution, which is different from notability so is off topic for this discussion. Second, your example proves absolutly nothing other than the fact that Brian Peppers is far better known than Honi HaM'agel. You may think the latter is more notable, but this either comes from your personal interests or elitism, because of which you believe that ancient writers of religious texts are more important than 'trivial' internet phenomena. I don't share that particular view. I do realize, however, that basing my opinion about notability on my personal interests would be wrong, so instead I try to estimate the number of people interested in the subject. Ghits are a pretty good indicator of that, even if there are exceptions (such as self-published material.) Assuming then that Ghits tell you something about the interests of internet users, the only issue mentioned on the cruft multiplier page that remains is whether this interest is shared by the general population. I have already addressed this when I wrote that most english speakers are internet users. Yes, internet issues are more important to internet users, but we are talking about a sample that by now exceeds 60 or 70 percent of the population. Brian Peppers is better known than Hani HaM'agel to the general public because, increasingly, internet culture is popular culture. If instead of the phonomenal growth in internet adoption we had similar growth in the number of Talmud readers maybe the opposite would be true. (BTW, I do think other criteria besides interest should be used in determining notability - such as possible future concequences or importance to the functioning of society - which make subjects in the esotheric fields such as theoretical physics or economics notable, but these do not need to be considered when there is sufficient interest in the subject.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../v/o/o/User%7EVoodoo_b671.html" title="User:Voodoo">Voodoo</a> (<a href="../../../v/o/o/User_talk%7EVoodoo_9290.html" title="User talk:Voodoo">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Voodoo_4eb7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Voodoo">contribs</a>) 07:25, 10 March 2007 (UTC).</small>

In any event, all the named notability criterion you have given like "possible future concequences or importance to the functioning of society" are extremely subjecting, which is why we don't use them. Furthermore, you fail to understand that even if a large number of people are using the internet, it only takes on the internet a small number of internet-obsessed people who spend all their time on the net to give something like Peppers a large number of hits. The bottom line is that if something is notable we will have reliable third party sources that talk about it. If not, there isn't much we can say about it even if you could make an argument that in some subjective sense the issue in question is notable. Brandt is notable because we have many indepedent, non-trivial, reliable sources about him, not because his website happens to get many google hits. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:08, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There's no question that this fulfills <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Like any other article, we can handle <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> as we go along. <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> is well taken care of. From a policy point of view, there's no reason <i>not</i> to have this article. There's still a question of whether there are any positive reasons to <i>have</i> the article. Because Brandt is a deliberately public figure, the answer is yes. He ends up in newspapers and magazines, and when he does, readers come to Wikipedia to learn more about him. Wikipedia is an ideal place to gather sources and build a NPOV article about the man, just as for any other topic. The goal of Wikipedia is to be a useful repository of free information, and this article helps us fulfill that goal. There are arguments against the article, not grounded in policy but worth answering. I believe they have already been answered. I found the following, further up the page:
<blockquote>
<p>From what I can tell the arguments for deletion are: <i>He doesn't want it.</i> Although I feel for subjects in this position, I think it has to be irrelevant to Wikipedia. <i>He (or his field) are not sufficiently notable.</i> This is reasonable, but I think notability is more cause for inclusion than exclusion. Plus, he has been noted, which I take as a good proxy for notable. <i>He deserves his privacy.</i> That would work for me for a private citizen, but Brandt is an intentionally public figure. <i>We're only doing this out of spite.</i> I don't have anything against him, so that's not my motivation. <i>There is another page with this information.</i> That's great, but I don't see that as a reason to delete this. <i>This article is too much trouble.</i> I think that would be a terrible precedent, and would mean we could be harrassed into deleting things that we otherwise would keep. On the keep side, it seems like we have plenty of material and that the article meets core policies like <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Further, it fits my personal criterion of utility: people may see his name somewhere and say, "Who is this Brandt guy the paper is quoting?" And anytime people have a reasonable question, I think we should have an easy-to-find factual answer for them. ... Deleting material based on personal preference inevitably skews our contents. We have a responsibility to our readers to be a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> repository of factual information. Per <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, we don't include anything that people can't find out elsewhere, so we're not exposing anything that isn't already public. I agree absolutely that we should respect our subjects, and that we should edit with compassion and taste. I think <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is a good example of that. But that's different than respecting their wishes. ... Sorry for replying to myself, but apparently my reply to the "too much trouble" argument wasn't explicit enough. First, I feel like having a precedent like this would be terrible, as I expect a lot of articles could be considered too much trouble. Second, having that precedent gives people incentive to create trouble around articles they would like removed. Third, deleting things we would otherwise keep increases systemic bias, this time in the case of favoring non-controversial material.

The article, sadly, will require far more attention to POV and vandal stuff than others less notable because of the nature of his notability, but that's the price a project like this has to pay if it wants to extend itself further than the baliwick of print encyclopedias. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDharmabum420_04df.html" title="User:Dharmabum420">dharmabum</a> 09:52, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The discussion has included a lot of speculation on Daniel Brandt's motives, and even though I'm still puzzling over the pertinence of all that, I might as well chime in and share my own thoughts about it. From what I've read here and there, I'm guessing that his motives are twofold — call them "ambivalent", "conflicted", or "duplicitous" according to your taste, but here is how I see it:
<ol>
<li><b>Speculation 1.</b> On the one hand, he is trying to educate Wikipedia Editors about the Rules of Reality, which all of us eventually find out overrule the Rules of Wikipedia. This is so because Wikipedia is really just a tiny part of Reality at Large, and not an isolated bubble world. This is, incidentally, one of the lessons that Wikipedia Editors should also be learning from the ongoing <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essjay_incident.html" title="Essjay incident">Essjay incident</a>. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDon_de_la_Muncha_4555.html" title="User:Don de la Muncha">Don de la Muncha</a> 16:14, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speculation 2.</b> On the other hand, he is trying to lay a trap for those Wikipedia Participants (Jimbo Wales, Administrators, Editors, and so on) who fail to learn the first lesson. If he ever does follow through on suing Wikipedia Participants, either collectively or individually, he will need to do a couple of things to reinforce his case:
<ol>
<li><b>Recollection 1.</b> Show that he has exhausted all other means at his disposal to get Managers and Users of Wikipedia to cease and desist whatever the heck he says they are doing wrong. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDon_de_la_Muncha_4555.html" title="User:Don de la Muncha">Don de la Muncha</a> 16:14, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Recollection 2.</b> Show that there is a large reservoir of malicious intent among whatever set of Managers and Users of Wikipedia that he elects to name in the prospective suit. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDon_de_la_Muncha_4555.html" title="User:Don de la Muncha">Don de la Muncha</a> 16:14, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>As always, I am neither barrister nor solicitor, I am merely repeating what Daniel Brandt himself has said in various places. But I think that Wikipedia Editors need to bear all of these considerations in mind as they conduct their research into Daniel Brandt's biography, and in the things they utter in these brands of editorial proceedings. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDon_de_la_Muncha_4555.html" title="User:Don de la Muncha">Don de la Muncha</a> 16:14, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sigh. I had to look that one up, and some of what it said wasn't very nice, so I'm sure that you didn't really mean all that — apparently we are, unwittingly for some us, still picking on this New York lawyer from the 1840s, name of <i>Scheuster</i>. Now that's Notability for you! But all I did was to mention two things that Daniel Brandt has said in public that he needs for his future court battle. And what I'm saying is, "Don't give him that". <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDon_de_la_Muncha_4555.html" title="User:Don de la Muncha">Don de la Muncha</a> 17:28, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I know about Scheuster (though some sources say his real name was Schuster), and I am sorry but the guy made his own name by pulling from the bottom of the trick chest, so if his (Americanized name) still stands for slightly less than ethical law practice I cannot help it. The point is, no matter where, as a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_figure.html" title="Public figure">public figure</a> Brandt does not have a foot to stand on when it comes to have his article deleted. He might be able to sue those who vandalized the article and/or added patently false content with intend of defaming, and I believe that Wikipedia should aid in as far as possible to identify this person (or persons). But that is as far as it goes. His best chance would be a law suit in France, but French Wikipedia does not have an article about him, yet... <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 17:39, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Brandt <i>asserting</i> that Wikipedia is doing something wrong and should cease and desist is hardly the same thing as this actually being <i>true</i>. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 16:44, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Right. And we need to be neutral about this. As Brandt deliberately makes himself a public figure, it is reasonable to expect that people who read about him in a newspaper article will come to Wikipedia looking for more information about him. Deleting the article, then, would not only do our readers a disservice, but the practice would encourage a systemic bias toward non-controversial subject matter, and/or away from topics in which certain people give us trouble. The only fair thing to do is to treat him as though he's had no interaction here, and made no trouble here.

<dd>And, regarding Brandt supposedly educating Wikipedians in the "rules of reality"... well, while it's true that we editors sometimes seem to have our own wacky version of reality that's pretty peculiar from the standpoint of the rest of the world, I'm not so sure that Brandt's personal "reality" is necessarily any "realer" either. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 21:13, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I haven't encountered any argument here or in the DRV that I've found convincing. Deleting the article will allow us to "move on?" It seems to me that a great deal of the problems are created by the unwillingness to accept the community's repeated verdict rather than the article itself. In fact, until the last few weeks, I thought this was a long-settled question and wasn't aware that there was any serious sentiment for deleting his entry. Brandt doesn't want it? We can't give subjects veto power over their articles. Non-notable or marginally notable? Any standard he would flunk has been shown to be considerably more deletionist than the community consensus. BLP? Everything looks solidly sourced to me, and no one points to specific problems. (Admittedly, I find the suggestion that Brandt's bad blood with Google stems from low rankings for NameBase a little fishy. In my Nicaragua-related searches, NameBase seems to come up fairly high.) Privacy? The article seems clearly focused on his public career. The price of keeping the article is too high? Frankly, admins like NSLE and Essjay are responsible for their own problems. Also, NSLE and Yanksox ran into trouble by giving the article special treatment, which is all the more reason to treat it like a regular article. Merge or redirect? He has been involved in too many different things for a clear redirect target. And for the same reason, an individual who has been involved with SDS, NameBase, Public Information Research, NSA cookies, Google Watch, Wikipedia Watch, John Siegenthaler, and the Essjay controversy needs an article of his own which shows how his lifelong activism fits together. It can't properly be assessed when decontextualized into a half-dozen discrete articles. Policy, consensus, and common sense all say keep. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice"><span style="color:indigo; border:thin solid cyan; background:aliceblue">Groggy Dice</span></a> <span style="border:thin solid gold;"><a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGroggy_Dice_aa9f.html" title="User talk:Groggy Dice">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Groggy_Dice_610a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Groggy Dice">C</a></span> 03:13, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The only valid argument I see from the delete voters is that the existence of this article causes us more trouble than it is worth. However, I see no reason to believe that the trouble will end if we delete the article. Daniel Brandt is out to cause us trouble any way he can. If we keep the article, we give him attention, but if we delete the article he will only crow about his victory. In this situation I believe we should stick to our core principles, all of which argue for keeping the article.</li>

It's still a question of... 47ish versus 52ish sources that I found, over a couple hours of Google scouring various combinations of his name with other phrases. and I'll just mention that that the 52 number was literally a random number--that's just when I stopped really digging, figuring enough was enough. If someone wanted to compare my URL list vs. the remains of that one google search I linked--it was the best of the bunch--you'll find at least 10-25 more that appeared at a glance to be likely to fall into either the primary or 'cited' sections I made up.

<li><b>Comment:</b> My opinion doesn't count because I've been banned for almost a year, but I nevertheless have an opinion. There are issues which no one has addressed in this farce of an AfD. First, about one-third of my biography is self-referential for Wikipedia. It's the equivalent of the World Book Encyclopedia having an entry on someone associated with Encyclopedia Britannica simply because that someone criticized World Book. No, it's worse than that. It's as if World Book started a negative article on someone who worked at Britannica, and then when that someone criticized the World Book for doing so, the article in World Book got longer and longer, mainly by referring to these criticisms. Either the self-referential material should be deleted, or Wikipedia should stop calling itself an encyclopedia. Second, there is no information on my education, or my three years in graduate school, primarily because such information in not easily found unless the subject of the article consents to the article. Third, there is no information on my employment history for the same reason. Fourth, the information about President Carter's draft amnesty was deleted, but the draft-card burning information was kept, an act that is prejudicial. Fifth, the year of birth was deleted, primarily because no one could figure out whether it was 1947 or 1948. Sixth, no one at Wikipedia has found a photo of me anywhere on the web. Seventh, the Google Watch stuff is about as notable as someone starting a blog on some topic. The only reason it has more than its fair share of citations on the web is because it was the first anti-Google website, and when it started no one could believe that anyone could be anti-Google. Eighth, the NameBase material is biased. It's not a "quirky" index. Ask Oliver North how quirky it is. NameBase led a reporter to the person who put up Oliver North's security gate, which resulted in North's only conviction (for accepting an illegal gratuity). This was covered in the Washington Post. Picking out a quotation that uses the word "quirky" to describe NameBase suggests bias. (The same source also says it was started in the 1960s, which would have been difficult since I would have needed a mainframe and IBM punch cards to start it that early.) Ninth, the cookie stuff at CIA and NSA is trivial. One fax to each agency and the problem was solved. It played in the press because no one understands cookies, which in turn gave the press an opportunity to hype it. The bottom line is that Wikipedia should not pretend that it is competent to write biographies of living persons without the subject's consent and cooperation. Without that cooperation, the article at best ends up as a loose collection of facts, most of which would be irrelevant in a balanced biography. At worst, it ends up as malicious libel that uses verifiability and notability as convenient cover. The motives of those who voted KEEP are clearly suspicious, based on their own justifications. This AfD was front-loaded with a prejudicial list of citations, which is improper. Posters for candidates are supposed to stay a certain distance away from the voting booths -- why doesn't this apply to Wikipedia? Most of those voting KEEP have no familiarity with me or the article, which makes them drive-by voters who only seek to amuse themselves. This is also improper. This entire AfD is a disgrace for all of Wikipedia. -Daniel Brandt 68.91.89.24 20:35, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I need to look at that. 2nd, how do we know you are really him. 3rd, I totally disagree that you can't write an excellent bio without the help/imput of the subject in question. Anyways, if you are really Mr. Brandt, would you mind posting a picture of yourself somewhere around here&#160;:) Cheers! --<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeafterthree_41a1.html" title="User:Threeafterthree">Tom</a> 22:13, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Given YankSox's decision to restore this comment I will respond to it. Brandt analogy about various encyclopedias fails for a variety of reasons already discussed. Not to belabor the point, but Brandt was notable prior to his Wikipedia involvement and would meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> even without that. Furthermore, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> and others are notable precisely because of their involvement with Wikipedia and this does not preclude us from having articles on them.</dd>
<dd>The second, third, fifth and sixth points are irrelevant to whether or not we should delete the article. The fourth point is a minor editorial concern which Brandt can deal with the way banned editors are supposed to- email OTRS. The same response exists to the eighth point and in any event, has nothing to do with whether or not the article should be deleted.</dd>
<dd>The seventh point is irrelevant since this is an AfD for <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> not <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_419f.html" title="Google Watch">Google Watch</a> and even if it were would have nothing to do with whether or not we kept the article. The same problem applies to the ninth point. Notability is determined by whether the media and others have found something to be sufficiently notable to write about it in reliable sources, whether or not it deserves to be notable. If deserving had anything to do with it, I'd AfD <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britney_Spears_3573.html" title="Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a> and a host of others for starters.</dd>
<dd>The last part is simply standard Brandt ranting- the notion that we somehow need to work with every single living person to write their biographies is absurd. I am amused however by Brandts attempt to a) make AfD into an election and b) smear a large number of respected Wikipedians "Drive-by voters who only seek to amuse themselves". <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 22:19, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If this must be here, I would like to respond as well. Firstly, it is claimed that the material is libelous. Libel is a claim that a <i>false</i> and harmful statement was made about someone. Yet no examples of falsehood are cited. Libel is <i>not</i> defined as "Someone said something about me I don't like" when the statement disliked is true. Secondly, the voting booth analogy is an inappropriate comparison. This is a discussion, not a voting booth, and providing material relevant to a discussion to participants in it is appropriate. Finally, for the rest of the material, the news media has certainly taken note of the exposure of government cookie exposure as well as the Google and Wikipedia campaigns (which have been noted extensively by the news media, unlike the vast majority of blogs.) One cannot put up websites, try to drive traffic to them, grant interviews to the news media, and look to gain all kinds of notability and publicity, and then simply claim not to be a public figure when it suits one's purposes. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 22:35, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Dear Mr. Brandt, we appreciate that you took your time from your multiple duties to have a little say about our AfD. I must say that I am slightly disappointed to see the usual rantings and nothing of substance. If you would have bothered to read through this AfD, which you evidently have not, it would not have been hard for you to notice that we mulled through the whole thing and the shystering arguments about libel do not really impress us. I am slightly more impressed that you mention birth dates, and can't help but wonder how we had a vandalism attack on <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> shortly before, in which <s>the reference</s> it alludes to removing birthdays of little notable people <s>is mentioned</s>. If that comes as shock to you, yes, we consider you little notable. As for the rest of your rantings, I am sorry they do not - in any way - impress me to change my opinion, and you see I really had a crash introduction to this story during the last week -- which means I would still be impressionable. Sincerely yours <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 23:03, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There is sufficient source material for an article. The subject's consent is irrelevant. Arguments over content don’t belong here. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokeyJoe_6cd1.html" title="User:SmokeyJoe">SmokeyJoe</a> 22:48, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> if I hadn't said so before. I think Seraphimblade has it right. You were , to your credit, a notable activist long before WP and Google; the notability from them remains, and would justify an article on that basis alone. (And I regret that you now regard your anti-war activities as reflecting negatively on you.) The Google and Yahoo work alone would also have been sufficient. Not just was it widely noticed at the time, but t has led to much further awareness of the practices and the threat they pose--you are one of those with <b>credit</b> for having been a pioneer here. As for WP, it is a very good thing indeed that WP has full information on its critics, and on the problematic areas. Some of us have been arguing for days to keep full information about the Essjay controversy and the article on him--it reflects very negatively on the way WP has been doing things, and we shown our honesty by publishing it. And so do we in publishing your criticism, and in thinking you encyclopedia-worthy for having made that criticism. <i>Frankly, I regard the article on you as positive,</i> and I would have been proud indeed to have accomplished a tenth as much. I am not sure what accounts for your current modesty--you cannot be expected to like everything said, but what subject of any true bio would? Regard this article as one of the beneficial fruits of your criticism of us. Had we not improved due to your criticism, we would not be trying to keep the article. You've made us better, and we think it our duty to record that. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:10, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I've split this off with the title above, because I want to make a meta-argument on the arguments presented. At some point, I think it helps to assume a basic knowledge of the dispute, and to move up a level. In situations like this, there will always be a faction which views any personal consideration as a sign of weakness, as well as a group willing to fight to the last drop of the subject's blood. Once the issue has become so polarized as is evident, a search for consensus is doomed, since no matter what the outcome, there will be a disappointed side of the debate. In that sort of situation, between two unattractive alternatives, I advocate erring on the side of the individual. Because of the asymmetric power relationships, an institution can withstand a possible mistake much more readily than a living person. Please, replies to this comment, address the problem at this level, don't repeat the basic AfD arguments again. I've heard it. You've heard it. Oh, how we've all heard it ...
