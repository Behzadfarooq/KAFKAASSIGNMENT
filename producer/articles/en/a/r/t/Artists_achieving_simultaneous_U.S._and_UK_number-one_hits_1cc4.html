When their U.S. and U.K. releases fell in sync with each other, The Beatles achieved a record seven simultaneous #1 singles and (once the U.S. and U.K. albums became identical beginning with <i>Sgt.

<p>Stewart's simultaneous event occurred in May <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> with his third album, <i><a href="../../../e/v/e/Every_Picture_Tells_a_Story_0eb7.html" title="Every Picture Tells a Story">Every Picture Tells a Story</a></i> with the universal hit "<a href="../../../m/a/g/Maggie_May_850a.html" title="Maggie May">Maggie May</a>". The single "<a href="../../../m/a/g/Maggie_May_850a.html" title="Maggie May">Maggie May</a>" was supposed to be a B-side track to the song "<a href="../../../r/e/a/Reason_to_Believe_bde6.html" title="Reason to Believe">Reason to Believe</a>", but that was changed after the reception proved more positive for "May". Both single and album stayed at #1 for five weeks in the US and UK. Moreover, it managed to top at the same time making him the first artist to do so comparing with earlier two artists who had the effect at separate periods. In the UK, the track climbed to number one on his sixth week in the chart after its entry position at number 31. The song declined slowly and enjoyed its successful run of 21 weeks. The singles chart was Top 50 during the period until the mid 1970s when the <b>Chart Information Network</b> (CIN) expanded the list to Top 75. Stewart's first appearance of the expanded chart (between number fifty-one to seventy-five) was in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> for the song <i>Ole Ola (Mulher Brasileira)</i> with the Scottish World Cup Squad at number sixty-two before he was thrown off the chart a week later. CIN was renamed to The Official UK Charts Company from <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>. The single was certified Gold from <a href="../../../r/i/a/RIAA_104b.html" title="RIAA">RIAA</a> in October <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> whilst the album was certified platinum much later in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>. The album also was frequently voted one of the best British albums of all time. A recent, clear evidence was when <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> in the UK ranked his album 99th of the 100 <i>Greatest Albums Ever</i> in 2005.</p>

Beyoncé's debut album cover</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Beyoncé Knowles' album <i><a href="../../../d/a/n/Dangerously_in_Love_ad5e.html" title="Dangerously in Love">Dangerously in Love</a></i> and single "<a href="../../../c/r/a/Crazy_in_Love_%28song%29_a1fc.html" title="Crazy in Love (song)">Crazy in Love</a>" have topped simultaneously in the US and the UK in July <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> which made her the first female artist to achieve this feat, the first artist in the 21st century and the second artist (after Rod Stewart) to top both the singles and albums charts in the US and the UK simultaneously.</p>
<p>In the US, the album made a strong debut at #1 whilst the single moved up to the top position from #3, knocking off <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay_Aiken_b79b.html" title="Clay Aiken">Clay Aiken</a>'s single <i><a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridge_over_Troubled_Water_This_Is_the_Night_1f30.html" title="Bridge over Troubled Water/This Is the Night">This is the Night</a></i>. It was simultaneous for only one week. The following week saw Knowles' album being knocked from the top spot whilst the single remained at #1 for seven more weeks, before being replaced by <i><a href="../../../s/h/a/Shake_Ya_Tailfeather_559f.html" title="Shake Ya Tailfeather">Shake Ya Tailfeather</a></i> by <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelly.html" title="Nelly">Nelly</a>. The single itself spent 28 weeks on the Hot 100 and the album for 72 weeks with the certification of Platinum and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platinum_single.html" title="Platinum single">four times</a> (4x) platinum respectively.</p>
<p>In the UK, the album (released a week earlier than the single) also debuted at #1, replacing <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evanescence.html" title="Evanescence">Evanescence</a>'s <i><a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallen_%28album%29.html" title="Fallen (album)">Fallen</a></i> which the artist have managed to have simultaneous number ones in the UK. The next week saw the single debuting at the top position replacing <i><a href="../../../b/r/i/Bring_Me_to_Life_82b6.html" title="Bring Me to Life">Bring Me to Life</a></i> by <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evanescence.html" title="Evanescence">Evanescence</a> therefore resulting in her single (topped for three weeks) co-inciding with the album (five weeks) to top at the same time for three consecutive weeks. The following week's #1 single was replaced by <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Bedingfield_30f8.html" title="Daniel Bedingfield">Daniel Bedingfield</a>'s "<a href="../../../n/e/v/Never_Gonna_Leave_Your_Side_fe91.html" title="Never Gonna Leave Your Side">Never Gonna Leave Your Side</a>", as Knowles slipped to number two.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../d/a/n/Dangerously_in_Love_ad5e.html" title="Dangerously in Love">Dangerously in Love</a></i> held on at #1 for one more week before being succeeded by <i><a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_and_Medicine_5d74.html" title="Magic and Medicine">Magic and Medicine</a></i> from the British band <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Coral_8aaa.html" title="The Coral">The Coral</a>. (The next artist to have a simultaneous #1 album and single in the UK was <i><a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_Idol_c106.html" title="Pop Idol">Pop Idol</a></i> winner <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Young_4eca.html" title="Will Young">Will Young</a> with the single "<a href="../../../l/e/a/Leave_Right_Now_21a4.html" title="Leave Right Now">Leave Right Now</a>" and the album <i><a href="../../../f/r/i/Friday%27s_Child_064a.html" title="Friday's Child">Friday's Child</a></i> in December <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> - this was his second time to do this.)</p>
<p>Beyoncé's album had the most <i>consecutive</i> weeks at #1 in the UK for 2003, even though the album did not have the most <i>total</i> weeks at #1. She became the second female artist in the UK to hold simultaneous #1s, after <a href="../../../k/y/l/Kylie_Minogue_fac0.html" title="Kylie Minogue">Kylie Minogue</a> in 2000 (album <i><a href="../../../f/e/v/Fever_%28album%29.html" title="Fever (album)">Fever</a></i>, single "<a href="../../../c/a/n/Can%27t_Get_You_Out_Of_My_Head_9cca.html" title="Can't Get You Out Of My Head">Can't Get You Out Of My Head</a>"). Because the download sales were not integrated until July <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> for the singles chart, the single "Crazy in Love" spent 15 weeks based on physical sales alone which was considered a quite long run with 260,000 units of shipments certifing the song to silver. The album <i>Dangerously in Love</i> spent 54 weeks in the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_Albums_Chart_1dc0.html" title="UK Albums Chart">UK Albums Chart</a> and was awarded <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platinum_single.html" title="Platinum single">two times</a> (2x) platinum from the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Phonographic_Industry_4a61.html" title="British Phonographic Industry">British Phonographic Industry</a> (BPI).</p>
<p>Despite mixed reviews from international critics, the album earned her five <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Awards_8fa1.html" title="Grammy Awards">Grammy Awards</a> and a nomination for the "Record of The Year" (won by <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coldplay.html" title="Coldplay">Coldplay</a>), one <a href="../../../b/r/i/BRIT_Awards_42b0.html" title="BRIT Awards">BRIT Award</a> for "Best International Female Solo Artist" but missed out on the "Best International Album" which she was nominated for (won by <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Timberlake_c6d4.html" title="Justin Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a>), and thirty other music industry awards. The album sold eleven million copies worldwide; the single sold 3.2 million copies worldwide.</p>
<p>Knowles is the only American solo artist to achieve this feat. British music magazine, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Musical_Express_a10e.html" title="New Musical Express">New Musical Express</a> (NME) voted "Crazy in Love" as the Best Single Release of 2003 beating 49 other candidates such as <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outkast.html" title="Outkast">Outkast</a> (for "<a href="../../../h/e/y/Hey_Ya%21_1c2f.html" title="Hey Ya!">Hey Ya!</a>") and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_White_Stripes_bfe2.html" title="The White Stripes">The White Stripes</a> (for "<a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Nation_Army_04d6.html" title="Seven Nation Army">Seven Nation Army</a>") at their end of year review.</p>
