It is not after her, and is instead going to fight a polar-bear like <a href="../../../k/o/o/Koolasuchus.html" title="Koolasuchus">Koolasuchus</a> for food. As Dig escapes, she sees a herd of <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammoth.html" title="Mammoth">mammoth</a>-like Muttaburrasaurs heading to the north, where the winter would be less harsh. Unknown to the herd, however, a tundra <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allosaur.html" title="Allosaur">allosaur</a> is hunting them.</p>
<p>After a long hibernation, she finally awakens, but there is less food.

<p>Lysyl oxidase is an extracellular enzyme that catalyzes formation of aldehydes from lysine residues in collagen precursors. These aldehydes are highly reactive, and undergo spontaneous chemical reactions with other lysyl oxidase-derived aldehyde residues, or with unmodified lysine residues. This results in cross-linking collagen and elastin which is essential for stabilization of collagen fibrils and for the integrity and elasticity of mature elastin.</p>
<p>Complex cross-links are formed in collagen (pyrodininolines derived from three lysine residues) and in elastin (desmosines derived from four lysine residues) that differ in structure.</p>
<p>The importance of lysyl oxidase-derived cross-linking was established from animal studies in which lysyl oxidase was inhibited either by nutritional copper-deficiency or by supplementation of diets with β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), an inhibitor of lysyl oxidase. This resulted in lathyrism, characterized by poor bone formation and strength, hyperextensible skin, weak ligaments, and increased occurrence of aortic aneurysms. These abnormalities correlated well with decreased cross-linking of collagen and elastin.</p>

<p>Lysyl oxidase is an extracellular <a href="../../../e/n/z/Enzyme.html" title="Enzyme">enzyme</a> that catalyzes formation of <a href="../../../a/l/d/Aldehydes.html" title="Aldehydes">aldehydes</a> from <a href="../../../l/y/s/Lysine.html" title="Lysine">lysine</a> residues in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collagen.html" title="Collagen">collagen</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elastin.html" title="Elastin">elastin</a> precursors. These aldehydes are highly reactive, and undergo spontaneous chemical reactions with other lysyl oxidase-derived aldehyde residues, or with unmodified lysine residues. This results in <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross-linking.html" title="Cross-linking">cross-linking</a> collagen and elastin which is essential for stabilization of collagen fibrils and for the integrity and elasticity of mature elastin.</p>
<p>Complex cross-links are formed in collagen (pyrodininolines derived from three lysine residues) and in elastin (desmosines derived from four lysine residues) that differ in structure.</p>
<p>The importance of lysyl oxidase-derived cross-linking was established from animal studies in which lysyl oxidase was inhibited either by nutritional copper-deficiency or by supplementation of diets with β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), an inhibitor of lysyl oxidase. This resulted in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Lathyrism.html" title="Lathyrism">lathyrism</a>, characterized by poor bone formation and strength, hyperextensible skin, weak ligaments, and increased occurrence of aortic <a href="../../../a/n/e/Aneurysms.html" title="Aneurysms">aneurysms</a>. These abnormalities correlated well with decreased cross-linking of collagen and elastin.</p>

<p><b>BIOGRAPHY</b></p>
<hr />
<p><i>Kyle Thomas Kendall</i> was born at the bustling hospital of St. Josephs in downtown <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacoma.html" title="Tacoma">Tacoma</a>, WA; just minutes from <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_Defiance_Park_ae03.html" title="Point Defiance Park">Point Defiance Park</a>. Weighing in at 8lbs, he was born to Father Thomas A. Kendall, and Mother Georgina U. Kendall. Just before the age of two, Kyle's parents divorced leaving custody to his father. Where soon after he moved to <a href="../../../g/i/g/Gig_Harbor_51c8.html" title="Gig Harbor">Gig Harbor</a> Washington. Growing up in Gig Harbor offered many exciting outlets for the young <a href="../../../w/u/n/Wunderkind.html" title="Wunderkind">wunderkind</a> Kyle. His love for <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legos.html" title="Legos">Legos</a>, Puzzles, <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Nintendo_60e0.html" title="Super Nintendo">Super Nintendo</a>, kept him thoroughly entertained throughout his young childhood. Extremely into Airplanes the young <a href="../../../w/u/n/Wunderkind.html" title="Wunderkind">wunderkind</a> dreamt of being a United States Navy Pilot one day. But little did he know that his life would be forever changed by source far from our plane of understanding.</p>
<p><b>Rise from Wunderkind to Believer</b></p>
<p>Kyle's childhood was not a advertisement for the "perfect Christian" family, in fact, it was far from it. Mother Georgina believed in a God but never explored her faith beyond that. On the other hand, Father Thomas almost held a negative attitude towards such a faith since it was forced upon him as a child. With this negative influences in the young <a href="../../../w/u/n/Wunderkind.html" title="Wunderkind">wunderkind</a>'s life, its no wonder Kyle never followed Christian circles as a child. Young Kyle believed in a God, but did not specifically believe in Christianity. Though it was his open heart that would one day give him the opportunity to see what he's been missing all this time. While attending <a href="../../../g/i/g/Gig_Harbor_High_School_f21b.html" title="Gig Harbor High School">Gig Harbor High School</a>, Kyle was given the chance to attend <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Life_69cf.html" title="Young Life">Young Life</a> camp Malibu in <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. While there, Kyle experienced the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel.html" title="Gospel">Gospel</a> in a way never before witnessed. As if explained to a child, he learned day after day, experience after experience all that <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> had done for him and has yet to do. It was here that Kyle accepted God, and here where he first truly prayed. Along comes Paul Bochen, a young life leader, Paul helped bring Kyle to his true faith, allowing Kyle to start down the right path to righteousness. Over the next few months Kyle got plugged into Campaign Groups with Young Life. During this time a slow heart change occurred in Kyle, helping him to accept Christ into his life. Time was ending in his Junior year of High School, and planning for future was on the schedule. Applying in fall of 2004, Kyle looked towards all of the state schools <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_State_University_f7e8.html" title="Washington State University">Washington State University</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Washington_University_45f9.html" title="Western Washington University">Western Washington University</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Washington_University_4f2c.html" title="Eastern Washington University">Eastern Washington University</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Washington_University_b9d5.html" title="Central Washington University">Central Washington University</a>, along with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Washington_e29d.html" title="University of Washington">University of Washington</a>. Being accepted to all he applied to, Kyle chose <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_State_University_f7e8.html" title="Washington State University">Washington State University</a>; by far the best choice.</p>
<p><b>Growth from Believer to Leader</b></p>
<p>Installing Class of Fall of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Kyle moved into the Waller Hall dorm of Washington State University located next to Stimson Hall and the Stephenson Hall's smack dab in the center of campus. Immediately he moved toward his goal of becoming a teacher, quickly applying to classes rooted in History, his chosen profession. It was also in fall of 2004 that Kyle became plugged in with the Christian based Fraternity, <a href="../../../p/i/_/Pi_Kappa_Phi_15ec.html" title="Pi Kappa Phi">Pi Kappa Phi</a>. <a href="../../../p/i/_/Pi_Kappa_Phi_15ec.html" title="Pi Kappa Phi">Pi Kappa Phi</a> did not yet have a chapter on the campus of <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_State_University_f7e8.html" title="Washington State University">Washington State University</a>, and began recruiting strong young individuals to its ranks. Kyle eagerly joined and contributed much over the months leading up to the most successful growth of a <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraternity.html" title="Fraternity">Fraternity</a> <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_State_University_f7e8.html" title="Washington State University">Washington State University</a> has ever seen. In just five months, <a href="../../../p/i/_/Pi_Kappa_Phi_15ec.html" title="Pi Kappa Phi">Pi Kappa Phi</a> grew from 13 to 40+. Initiating as a Founding Father PN#20, Kyle continued to amaze those around him. Gathering friends effortlessly, he moved towards bringing his faith to those around him. Starting <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, The INN from University Presbyterian Church in <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle.html" title="Seattle">Seattle</a> Washington sent over a team to begin a faith based College organization at <a href="../../../w/s/u/WSU_e1fa.html" title="WSU">WSU</a>. Kyle eager to continue his faith, jumped right in on the opportunity taking a lead with fellow bad a'er's Luke "Tuesday Night" Tushar, Amanda Krull, Bill "TreeTrunk" Strunk, and Claire Algeo. Kyle played effortlessly the <a href="../../../d/j/e/Djembe.html" title="Djembe">djembe</a> under lead singer Luke "Tuesday Night" Tushar and Singer Amanda Krull. Throughout the coming months, Kyle saw the growth of the INN take off, bringing in more and more people each week. Brothers from <a href="../../../p/i/_/Pi_Kappa_Phi_15ec.html" title="Pi Kappa Phi">Pi Kappa Phi</a> held the bulk of the population, but every day more and more diversity engrossed the little amphitheater they called home. In <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring.html" title="Spring">Spring</a> of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Kyle ventured off with <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nine.html" title="Nine">nine</a> others on a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mission_trip.html" title="Mission trip">mission trip</a> to <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast.html" title="Belfast">Belfast</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. Adding to only more reasons for Kyle to grow in his faith. Ireland truly brought about the best in this group, friendships were made, bonds were strengthened, and most importantly, lessons were learned that would never be forgotten. It was in this time that Kyle saw his true potential, as a <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitarist.html" title="Guitarist">guitarist</a>. Playing <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worship.html" title="Worship">worship</a> guitar in Ireland was only the first step toward what would become one of the best experiences of his life.</p>
<p><b>Luke Tushar and the Tuesday Kights</b></p>
<p>Starting in the Fall of 2006, The INN band would never be the same. Pulling on new band members, Drummer Bryan "Steely Eyed Missleman" Saftler, Bassist Jacob "J-Cub" Turner, and Pianist and Singer Kenta "No soup for you" Matter; the INN worship band under the direction of Luke Tushar, became Luke Tushar and the Tuesday Knights. Directing the Electric Guitar like it is a member of of his body, Kyle floated sweet sounds of righteousness each and every Tuesday night. With an ever growing population, the INN at WSU flourished at its new location; Pullman Presbyterian Church, settled comfortably next to Beasly Colosseum, across from Streit-Perham resident hall. <a name="Sources_10" id="Sources_10"></a></p>

Tim Dellar, the Melbourne man who came came to noterity by unwittingly winning an eBay auction for a billboard of Mick Molloy in 2004. The billboard was auctioned on the popular auction site to help raise money for the Lighthouse Foundation. Tim was pleased with his purchase and had it proudly on show at one of his parties. Tim Dellar has long been an avid follower of radio/TV personalities Mick Molloy and Tony Martin, following their careers from the early radio and TV shows as well as their movies, he has a huge collection of material and can quote much of the popular material including dates and show background. Tim was also an extra in the film The Extra and hopes to get his break in radio soon. --&gt;</p>

<p>Edison High School is one of the most reputable high schools in California. Due to the rigorous standards many of the students have persevered and gone onto universities such as Harvard, Stanford, etc. Edison High School may be located in a ghetto but that has not affected the students' abilities to learn and succeed.</p>

<p>ABONA Major Romano-British Settlement Sea Mills, Avon</p>
<p>Situated near the mouth of the River Avon at the confluence with the River Trym, this major Romano-British settlement probably served the nearby spa town of Aquae Sulis (Bath) as its river-port. Five fragments of a limestone tombstone was found in 1873 at a site overlooking the railway station at Little Sneyd. The stone now resides in Bristol City Museum, the recorded visible text is shown and translated below.</p>

<p>The GlobalGCC project</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In September 2006, a 15-partners consortium has started to work on the GlobalGCC [GGCC] project, within the ITEA [Information Technology for European Advancement] programme (see <a href="http://www.itea2.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.itea2.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.itea2.org/</a>).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The GGCC project will last 30 months and is partly funded (around 30%-40%) by French, Spanish and Swedish public authorities.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The partnership is composed of various types of entities (Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) +, big corporations ++, research labs and universities *) that are listed hereafter in alphabetical order per country:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>in France: Airbus/France (++), Bertin (+), CEA-LIST (*), INRIA-Futurs (*), Mandriva (+)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>in Spain: Aquiline (+), Answare (+), Base (+), IDI Eikon (+), SQS (+), Telefonica I+D (++), UPM (*)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>in Sweden: MySQL A.B (+), SICS (*), Syxoo (+)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The project leader is Mandriva (the company behind the Mandriva ex-Mandrakesoft Linux distribution in France).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The GGCC (ITEA) project aims to extend the free GNU Compiler Collection by globally processing several compilation units (e.g. work on a whole program or on a library) in order to customize and configure GCC to European software industry needs&#160;: for performance level or for better diagnosis.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The GGCC (ITEA) contribution will be GPL licenced free software, and will be proposed to the FSF. The GGCC (ITEA) consortium is determined to work in close cooperation with the GCC community and the FSF.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In an effort to empower the mainline GCC4 compiler from FSF (which focuses on code generation quality and compilation speed) with advanced compile-time techniques, the GGCC (ITEA) project aims at integrating into a GCC4 branch sophisticated program-wide compile-time analyses. As a result of that, it is expected that GGCC be more resource consuming (e.g., it could run 10 times slower than the GCC4 compiler). In return for that speed loss, more program bugs are expected to be pinpointed, and programmers will be able to state properties to be met in their code. Additionally, all the good characteristics of GGCC (high-quality code, number of available back-ends, etc.) are expected to be kept.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The GGCC (ITEA) product will be hosted on Unix/Posix/GNU/Linux environments.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The GGCC (ITEA) project aims to extend GCC through continuing research efforts, providing tools, interfaces and documentation which will enable new approaches to be developed around program-wide static analysis techniques. The static analysis of GGCC (ITEA) will work on the GIMPLE internal representations of GCC, hence be usable for all the current source languages and target systems available today in GCC.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The static analysis techniques projected for GGCC (ITEA) will be means permitting:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>1. Global program-wide optimisation (because the properties inferred at a given call site may be propagated to avoid useless computations in the program; for example if on a given call site and calling context the static analyser determined that a pointer is not null, pointing to a local variable which is positive, this information can be used to optimise further on, etc...).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>2. Hazard detections, that are warnings (for the developer using GGCC</p>
<p>(ITEA) compiler) about possible threats like: if a function f() was called by g() called by h(x) with x&gt;0 then at line 345 of foo.c there is a possible zero-divide fault. The challenge is to reduce the number of false positive alarms (which are stricto sensu unavoidable).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>3. Coding rule validation: A formalism will be defined by the GGCC consortium to express coding rules, and to use static analysis techniques to validate some of them.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To permit development of static analysis techniques, some work on the GCC infrastructure (in particular, persistency of GIMPLE internal representation and extensions of it) is required.</p>

<p>The Eternal Question is regularly cited as being a religious one. However, the phrase implies a question which has co-existed with humanity for a long time and will continue to co-exist with humanity for at least as long as humanity itself. In the sense that religion has only co-existed with humanity over the last couple of thousand years, it is clear that the question itself out dates religion. The question itself must have emerged with the first dawnings of human awareness and is likely to re-emerge as the last flickerings of human awareness die out.</p>

<p>Australia is a nation in which several different cultures and countries are represented within a relatively small population. In fact, people from over 200 different countries call Australia home <a href="http://www.dfat.gov.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.dfat.gov.au/" rel="nofollow">(Australian Government, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade)</a>. This integration of multiple cultures is nothing new to Australia. Australia has always been strongly influenced by foreign cultures. The United States has had a growing influence on Australian society. This primarily resulted from the nation growing further away from England, with which its most early involvement is associated with. This transition allowed Australia to create a non-discriminatory immigration policy, lending itself to shift its focus to other parts of the world, specifically the United States. <a href="http://www.dfat.gov.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.dfat.gov.au/" rel="nofollow">(Australian Government, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade)</a>. Many Americans come to Australia to study at prestigious schools such as Bond University or The University of New South Wales (John Dalton). Many come to vacation in popular tourist areas such as the glamorous party hot spot of Gold Coast, Queensland or the tropical city of Cairns on the Great Barrier Reef (John Dalton). American music and businesses can be found all over Australia. Popular music artists such as The Black Eyed Peas, Incubus, Jack Johnson and 50 Cent can be heard on Australian radio as well as in night clubs and retail stores. McDonalds, Burger King (known as Hungry Jacks in Australia), KFC, Ford, and General Motors are just some examples of the large corporations operating here.</p>

<p>Australia is not a very densely populated country. The population is only about 20 million people (John Dalton). It is however, a very large country in area, at about 7,700,000 square km<a href="http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia-1continent/" class="external text" title="http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia-1continent/" rel="nofollow">(The Australian Continent)</a>. This is about the same size in area as the continental United States <a href="http://www.state.gov/" class="external text" title="http://www.state.gov/" rel="nofollow">(U.S. Department of State)</a>. Across this vast land lie several very important resources that are of great interest to Asia and the United States, thus making such a lightly populated country a power in the world economy. Some of the important resources include fish, coal, crude petroleum, iron ore, agriculture, and uranium. The following numbers show just how much Australia relies on the United States, China, and Japan for its economic needs. In 2004, Australia’s national gross domestic product was calculated to be USD $587.3 billion <a href="http://www.state.gov/" class="external text" title="http://www.state.gov/" rel="nofollow">(U.S. Department of State)</a>. Australia exported USD $112.6 billion <a href="http://www.state.gov/" class="external text" title="http://www.state.gov/" rel="nofollow">(U.S. Department of State)</a>, the United States and Japan being the main partners in this trade. New Zealand and China followed closely behind. Imports reached USD $148.1 billion <a href="http://www.state.gov/" class="external text" title="http://www.state.gov/" rel="nofollow">(U.S. Department of State)</a>. At the top of the list as a supplier, again, was the United States followed by Japan and China <a href="http://www.state.gov/" class="external text" title="http://www.state.gov/" rel="nofollow">(U.S. Department of State)</a>.</p>

<p>According to Dr. John Dalton professor of Australian Studies at Bond University in Gold Coast Australia, Australian relations with the United States most notably began during WWI when the two countries fought side by side. The most famous battle in which Australian troops fought in WWI was the battle at Gallipoli. Australian troops landed on shore and tried to attack. They were annihilated by machine guns and suffered a horrible loss to the Turks. However, in the end the Australians were on the winning side and their well trained forces did prevail (Dalton). WWII, however, was really the start of the close relationship that the United States and Australia share today. The United States did not get involved in the war until Eastern enemy Japan bombed Pearl Harbor; simultaneously, Japan advanced into the South Pacific and Northern Australia. For strategic reasons the United States used ports in Australia to station troops closer to Japan and the South Pacific Islands (Dalton). The Australian military was able to push the Japanese submarines out of Sydney Harbor and put an end to Japanese bombings in Northern Australia. Shortly after, American troops pushed the Japanese ground troops out of Papua New Guinea, thus causing Japan to retreat until the end of the war. The Australians were grateful for the American help and knew that without their support, Japan may have taken over the country. The Americans were grateful that Australia allowed the United States to use Australia as a base for fighting Japan in the Pacific Islands (Dalton). In 1951, as a result of the shared thankfulness after World War II, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States came together to create a formal treaty known as the ANZUS treaty. The treaty basically says that Australia and the United States will act together to combat common dangers. However, in 1985 New Zealand was suspended of all defense obligations because they refused access of its ports to American nuclear weapons <a href="http://0-www.countrywatch.com.library.edu/cw_topic.aspx?type=text&amp;country=9&amp;topic=POFOR./" class="external text" title="http://0-www.countrywatch.com.library.edu/cw_topic.aspx?type=text&amp;country=9&amp;topic=POFOR./" rel="nofollow">(Australian Country Watch)</a>. As a result of this reprimand, the Australia-United States Ministerial (AUSMIN) has been formed. Meetings for AUSMIN take place alternately between the U.S and Australia annually <a href="http://0-www.countrywatch.com.library.edu/cw_topic.aspx?type=text&amp;country=9&amp;topic=POFOR./" class="external text" title="http://0-www.countrywatch.com.library.edu/cw_topic.aspx?type=text&amp;country=9&amp;topic=POFOR./" rel="nofollow">(Australian Country Watch)</a>. An example of the ANZUS/AUSMIN in action is after September 11, 2001. The United States declared war on terrorism and moved troops into Afghanistan. The treaty was invoked and Australia joined the U.S. to help combat terrorism. Australia has also fought along side the United States in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War, and currently in Iraq (Dalton). The ANZUS treaty greatly benefits Australia. As I have mentioned before, Australia is a vast country with tens of thousands of kilometers of coastline and a small population; it would be impossible for Australia to defend the entire country by itself due to the military being far too small. The Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs website has the following statement regarding the ANZUS treaty: “No other country can match the economic size and global reach of the United States in international affairs, nor will any do so in the near future. Australia's ability to influence and work with the United States is essential to our prosperity and security.” <a href="http://www.dfat.gov.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.dfat.gov.au/" rel="nofollow">(Australian Government, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade)</a>. This statement shows that Australia knows that not only does the United States provide security for the nation through the ANZUS treaty, but it also builds economic relations. The United States is Australia’s third largest export market and its largest import market while the United States is the largest investor in Australia. The two countries, although very different in size and power, have developed interdependence among each other. The bilateral relation only strengthens with time. In 1996, John Howard of the conservative Liberal party was elected Prime Minister <a href="http://0-www.countrywatch.com.library.edu/cw_topic.aspx?type=text&amp;country=9&amp;topic=POFOR/" class="external text" title="http://0-www.countrywatch.com.library.edu/cw_topic.aspx?type=text&amp;country=9&amp;topic=POFOR/" rel="nofollow">(Australia Country Watch)</a>. At this time Australia had its foreign policy focused on building relations with its neighboring Asian countries. Howard, however, made it clear that he would focus on relations with the United States <a href="http://0-www.countrywatch.com.library.edu/cw_topic.aspx?type=text&amp;country=9&amp;topic=POFOR/" class="external text" title="http://0-www.countrywatch.com.library.edu/cw_topic.aspx?type=text&amp;country=9&amp;topic=POFOR/" rel="nofollow">(Australian Country Watch)</a>. In fact, the U.S. president visited Australia in 1991, 1996, and 2003. John Howard in the past 10 years has visited the U.S. 8 times (1997, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006) <a href="http://www.state.gov/" class="external text" title="http://www.state.gov/" rel="nofollow">(U.S. Department of State)</a>. Also, many U.S. institutions conduct scientific research and activities in Australia. Most notably U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, better known as NASA, has its largest and what is considered to be its most important program outside of the U.S. The most recent addition of activities that strengthen Australian-U.S. relations is the new free trade agreement that was reached in 2005 <a href="http://www.state.gov/" class="external text" title="http://www.state.gov/" rel="nofollow">(U.S. Department of State)</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-03_832a.html" title="Edit section: Free Trade Agreement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Free Trade Agreement</span></h4>
<p>On 1 January 2005, the Australian – United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA) took effect. This agreement will allow free trade amongst the two countries eliminating several high tariffs, such as that on automobiles and auto parts. The free trade agreement has also developed what is known as the E-3 Visa for Australian Nationals. The E-3 Visa allows for business people and professionals from Australia to capitalize on the opportunities offered by AUFSTA <a href="http://www.dfat.gov.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.dfat.gov.au/" rel="nofollow">(Australian Government, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade)</a>. There is much debate about this new agreement. Some economists say it will have very little impact on the Australian economy and is just a publicity action taken by Jon Howard. Other economists believe that this will benefit the Australian economy greatly. The Australian Government has a positive outlook on the agreement. A quote directly from the Australian Government Free Trade Agreement webpage reads, “As well as easing technical restrictions to trade, the AUSFTA promotes a shift towards a more transparent business culture. It demonstrates a greater acceptance of Australia as an important and growing trading and investment partner and will lead to easier market entry for Australian business.” <a href="http://www.fta.gov.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.fta.gov.au/" rel="nofollow">(“Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement”)</a>. Another quote from the same website reads, “It is truly a landmark deal, the most important bilateral economic agreement ever undertaken by Australia.” <a href="http://www.dfat.gov.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.dfat.gov.au/" rel="nofollow">(Australian Government, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade)</a>. Either way, the agreement gives Australian businesses guaranteed market access to the world’s largest economy, and really has no visible negative effects on the Australian economy. Because the agreement is still fairly new, it is still difficult to quantify the value of it.</p>

<p>Limerick FC closed out their second successive eircom League First Division victory courtesy of a second half goal from substitute Derek McCarthy at Hogan Park on Friday night.</p>
<p>The former Galway United and Waterford United man, back at Limerick this season, came off the bench to fire the only goal of the Munster derby.</p>
<p>Cobh keeper Packie Holden could only parry a long-range strike from Robbie Kelleher on 57 minutes, and McCarthy snaffled up the chance.</p>
<p>The results lifts Limerick FC to joint-second in the First Division table – although it is looking ominous for the chasing pack as Shamrock Rovers moved seven points clear with victory over Kilkenny City on the night 213.94.184.26 16:06, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>- my own notes - I always thought that this was an official US fan site, but when I investigated the whois registration database, it turned out to be a Dutch site...</p>
<p>Another funny thing is that, although this is one of the biggest sites I've ever seen about Heather Nova - and it surely is more than that because it contains a lot of interesting articles too about world news, politics etc. - , the site isn't listed on the official heather nova site at <a href="http://www.heathernova.com" class="external free" title="http://www.heathernova.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.heathernova.com</a> and that's why I decided to ask for an article about this site, because it deserves a place in Wikipedia.</p>

<p>As Londoners consider the prospect of a new skyline, architect Jack Warshaw argues that the case for giant buildings is being built largely on myths.</p>
<p><br />
I was born and grew up in New York. My father owned a small fashion business with offices on Manhattan’s West 34th Street. When I was six or seven he took me “downtown,” up to the top of the Empire State Building, then the world’s tallest at 102 storeys. I could look across and see the Chrysler Building, Radio City, the Woolworth Building and many other pinnacled and craggy skyscrapers, spread out like a great model before me. I saw the city as an adventure playground. It belonged to me. I had no fear of it. I didn’t know then that people died building the Empire State, or that a small plane had crashed into it some years before. Was this the pre-awakening of my life in architecture?</p>
<p>Thirty or so years later I was to take my seven year-old daughter whizzing up in its high speed elevators to the rooftop of that same building, reliving my boyhood as she gazed upon that same scene - except that it was not the same, dominated as it now was by many long, box-like forms, the tallest of which was the World Trade Center (WTC). No longer a city of shining spires, but of banal, formulaic extrusions which might have risen in any America city. New Yorkers themselves mocked the WTC as the boxes that the Empire State and Chrysler buildings came in. They were alien to Manhattan’s character, the iconic ensemble largely created in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>All that changed on September 11 2001. The largest civilian mass tomb ever fashioned in Terrorist Hell, inscribed in every New Yorker’s memory forever more, takes on a ghostly cultural significance out of all proportion to its previously questioned architectural distinction. USA planning and urban design forums, especially those on-line are suddenly filled with searing polemics as intellectuals position themselves in relation to every conceivable variant of pro and anti skyscraper posture and what to do with the site of the still smoking, stinking tomb. Radical planners see skyscrapers as corporate ego trips and architects who build them as arrogant and unprincipled; architects retort that they simply meet demand and comply with planning controls.</p>
<p>Back in the UK, a growing list of skyscraper proposals, all “iconic,” all by distinguished architects, are debated in the cool newurbanspeak of regeneration, density, skyline, capacity, sustainability, infrastructure, critical mass, U-Name-it. Has anything changed this side of the Pond? A people who survived the Blitz may feel entitled to treat every incident since as a pinprick.</p>
<p>But our cities have been changed out of all recognition, as everyone knows, not by the Blitz so much as by postwar planning, which spawned our own early skyscrapers, the urban myths with which they are now associated, and the many diversions from genuine issues about what makes a “good city”. Why is it that even in the face of terrible and terrifying disaster these myths are still being propagated?</p>
<p>Myth No 1 - higher densities require skyscraper buildings. Density is measured in rooms per hectare or plot ratio, guidelines for which are contained in development plans. These have to relate to urban capacity, which in turn is related to the values or costs placed on such elements as open space, historic architecture, underground services, modes of transport, air quality, water supply and, not least, quality of life. European capital cities such as Paris, Prague, Amsterdam, Lisbon, Rome, St Petersburg, Copenhagen and many smaller ones achieve higher densities than most British and American cities by means other than skyscrapers. The American equation of high density as a product of skyscrapers is an illusion. In reality average densities of most American cities are low, taking account of the sprawling suburbs where most Americans live. Even in their city centres, the skyscrapers, set alongside vast acres allocated to wide roads and car parks, combine to yield moderate densities. Outside Manhattan, where most New Yorkers live, there are virtually no skyscrapers. Manhattan dwellers themselves tend towards ultra-rich and poor polarities. Vital debate about urban quality, sustainability and security is in danger of being hijacked by forces whose vested interests coincide with proliferating this most capitalist building type.</p>
<p>Myth No 2 - modern cities cannot do without skyscrapers. Forcing skyscrapers into the “modern” (in reality ancient) cities we consider most civilised, would destroy them. Huge buildings require superblocks to sit on, destroying historic, human scaled street patterns, as the WTC did in Lower Manhattan. This would have befallen Paris had it not been for the wise decision to preserve its urban structure, despite much new building, and foist the skyscraper cluster on La Defense. Perhaps Abercrombie’s Greater London Plan of 1944 marking Croydon for such a role in London should have been pursued more vigourously.</p>
<p>Myth No 3 - technology can fix it. Technology- the invention of the lift, made skyscrapers possible, but new imperatives of safety and security seem to require different, as yet unknown solutions. Sir Peter Hall (Regeneration 21 Sept) is right to warn of the need to start “thinking the unthinkable” about how we plan, build and live. Any structural engineer could (or should) have known for example that progressive collapse of the Twin Towers was inevitable once the structure of even a single intermediate floor was sufficiently weakened. Washington DC, a planned modern, high density city, has no skyscrapers.</p>
<p>Myth No 4 - Skyscrapers are OK in the right place if they are attractive. This universal mantra of all on-message promoters is something even English Heritage finds difficult to counter. In reality, we are already seeing the creation of a huge industry dedicated to proving that almost anywhere marked for “regeneration” is the right place for a new skyscraper. Which of the hundreds of 60s and 70s London skyscrapers are now judged to be both in the right place and attractive, let alone “iconic?”. All were at the time. Most now look hideously dated, unsustainable, sick and detached from the street matrix. Looking at the Swiss Re building, does it not more aptly resemble the shape of a bomb, bullet or Nazi V2 rocket minus fins than a gherkin? Is that the right iconic image?</p>
<p>Myth No 5 - allowing enemies to influence our cities is defeatist. An almost laughable knee-jerk, head-in-the-sand reaction, if it weren’t so dangerous. The very location and subsequent form of practically every city since time began has been strongly influenced, if not totally defined by security alongside food and water supply. Think of York, Chichester, Canterbury, Edinburgh, Plymouth. In times of war or threat of war, defence and minimising casualties become a nation’s first priorities. If our profession fails to deliver all possible steps to protect people against fanatics, we will share the blame for the body count. Building form matters. CDM regulations are impotent in this area. The attack on the Pentagon damaged but did not destroy it. If we need to rethink city planning, along with some building types, with greater security in mind, let’s not waste time.</p>
<p>Myth No 6 - Regeneration means bigger buildings. Previous efforts at postwar regeneration produced many of the large scale mistakes we now revile or are seeking to rectify or redevelop. Some made the error of replacing solid, street oriented urban buildings with compounds and culs-de-sac that turned their back on the city, fragmenting it, making it less permeable, more dangerous. Others replaced traditional street buildings of human scale with internalised megaliths. Where this happened still bigger buildings are not necessarily the right answer. Simply because Elephant and Castle was grotesquely exploited in the 50s and 60s does not automatically mean that regeneration, including reintegration with its surroundings, will be achieved by building many times more floorspace.</p>
<p>Myth No 7 - Only a limited number will be allowed. When did any aspect of a city become finite? Can there be any greater self-delusion than to declare that only 15 or 20 skyscrapers will be allowed in London, then no more? The reality, if history is any guide, is that the pressure for more will be irresistible. Is this the new Democracy, or the new Fascism? No Mayor or Mayoral policy, however well intentioned, can last indefinitely.</p>
<p>I am not the first to suggest that, whether in the context of security or simply meeting the needs of cities, ancient or modern, the question of whether to build more or bigger skyscrapers should not be reduced to political gestures, “iconic” appeal or floorspace, but enlarged to retaining or regaining functionality, distinctiveness, sustainability and above all, warmth and beauty at human scale. If we lose sight of those values, the enemy will have won. •</p>

<p>Back in the days in 2000 not many people had heard about these guys, but after they changed their name and attitude the birth of Epiphany was complete.</p>
<p>Starting off from their hometown Maastricht they started to record some demo songs and did some small performances but when they folks started to listen instead of laughing there actually was a meaning underneath. People embraced Epiphany in a faster pace then god could have and after winning a lot of local competitions between political bands and underground musicians they competed in a battle of the bands in Afrika and became second. MusicTV has spend a lot of time on these guys to get them ready for their international wolrdtour for peace.</p>
<p>But unfortunately the band has decided to split their ways so they could spread the word of wisdom faster.</p>
<p>With their unique eye for detail (in the world) they have conquered Holland's record stations for over almost one and a halve year.</p>
<p>But unfortunately the band has decided to split their ways so they could spread the word of wisdom faster.</p>
<p>Epiphany would like to thank all the radiostations that embraced their way of thought, the televisioncompanies that didn't, the mayor porncompany that wanted to hijack the official Epiphany website, but most of all and this one is seriously serious, the fans that supported the band for many years and still know Epiphany is not more than fun.</p>

Joel Larson is a respected rock drummer &amp; percussionist from California. He was born on April 29, 1947 in San Francisco were he lived until he was 17 years old. He took up drumming at the age of 12 and during the next five years honed his skills in the rock music scene of the early sixties. His destiny was to become one of the original Grass Roots, a rock group that enjoyed a successful hit making output of music from 1966 to 1975.</p>
<p>In 1965, he joined a band called The Bedoiuns and helped them win a Battle of the Bands in San Mateo. Word began to spread about the band. In early 1966, they were asked to come to an audition at the San Francisco Whisky A Go Go. They performed for Lou Adler who was the head of the new label Dunhill Records in Los Angeles. They were selected to become The Grass Roots, a folk rock group created by songwriters P.F. Sloan and Steve Barri.</p>
<p>The original Grass Roots were Denny Ellis on rythum guitar, Bill Fulton on vocals and lead guitar, Joel Larson on drums and Dave Stensen on bass. They moved to Los Angeles in 1966, took part in recording sessions and played live performances in the exploding LA music scene. They were one of the first house bands for The Trip on the Sunset Strip. All of The Grass Roots were under the age of 18 so their parents had to sign their contracts with Dunhill Records. They also performed as a TV back up band for The Mamas and the Papas and Johnny Rivers. They appeared on the first color broadcast of The Ed Sullivan Show. After about a year of live performances and networking in the LA rock music scene, the group wanted to have more creative control and input on the selection of songs to perform and record. Dunhill Records had a formula for the group already in mind and did not want to vary from it. The group minus Joel returned to San Francisco and contiued to perform until Dunhill Records decided to replace them. Joel was offered to continue with new group members but decided to take an opportunity to play with Gene Clark of The Byrds fame. He then met Emitt Rhodes and formed The Merry-Go-Round that same year. Starting in 1970 he played with Lee Michaels and help produce the huge hit "Do You Know What I Mean".</p>
<p>In 1971, he rejoined The Grass Roots and played with them through the end of their heydey in 1975. From 1975 on, he continued to perform their hits until the mid eighties. In the new wave era, he worked as a dance night promoter in Los Angeles with live broadcasts through KROC radio. He then entered into property management and real estate investment while continuing as a musician in Los Angeles playing with members of The Buckinghams and Paul Revere and The Raiders.</p>
<p>In 2000, Joel started work in the movie and TV entertainment industry as a driver and production coordinator. He has built a long list of credits which include major motion pictures such as Mission Impossible III and The Bucket List. Joel continues as a musician playing live performances with other notable musicians in the LA area to the present day.</p>
<p>Joel was in the heat of the action in the rock music and cultural explosion that took place in California in the 60's. He has left a musical legacy by his work in numerous rock groups that will be enjoyed by listeners for many years to come. He continues in the entertainment industry helping to coordinate smooth production of film and TV offerings.</p>

<p>I am not in fact submitting an article, but in fact this seems to be the only way to submit something that someone else may have information on and might in fact be able to create a Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>One of the most popular podcasts on the internet is This Week in Tech, or TWiT, hosted by Leo Laporte. On several episodes, one of the co-panalists, John C. Dvorak, has made reference to something called "Macintosh BASIC." It was supposedly a form of the BASIC programming language that was to be made available on the original 128k Macintosh back in 1984 (I think). However, something came up, and, in Dvorak's words, "Microsoft killed it." He's never given more information about it, and the original Macintosh never had any type of "built-in" programming language or environment. Before Mac OS X was introduced in 2002, the only way to write a program on a Macintosh was with some third-party software.</p>
<p>Why wasn't this "Macintosh BASIC" ever introduced? Did it in fact exist? It sounded like it was near to completion or was already complete. What weight would Microsoft, a competitor, have in forcing Apple not to introduce a product? Was there a copyright violation? And why exactly would Apple introducing a "Macintosh BASIC" be so bad for Microsoft? These are some of the questions I'm wondering about it, and Dvorak has never given any additional info (to my knowledge). I'm sure there are more than him out there that have information on this. Although I do not have the resources nor the knowledge to actually write a Wikipedia article about this, it would be nice to have a page like this in its place to solicit information from others who do actually have the information. And I'm sure there are others who would love to be able to look this up in Wikipedia and find out about it.</p>
<p>Note that I have checked the article on the BASIC programming language, and do not see a reference to Macintosh BASIC there. I've also checked both the "List of BASIC dialects" and "List of BASIC dialects by platform" pages, and do not find reference to it there, either. They do have an interesting entry for "MS-BASIC for Macintosh", although there is no associated Wikipedia entry.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>EDIT: After saving this page and seeing the other submitted pages, I learned of the Wikipedia:Requested Articles link. I did not know about that page, and will post this info there. I apologize in advance.</p>

<p>As I said above, the sources I do have would be the This Week in Tech podcast, and journalist John C. Dvorak. Other than that, I'm not sure what other sources the information could come from.</p>

<p>from Arbetman, Lee, &amp; Edward O’Brien. Street Law: A Course in Practical Law, 6th Ed. West Educational Publishing: New York. DRUG TESTING FOR STUDENT ATHLETES Veronia School District has one high school and three grade schools in the small logging community of Veronia, Oregon. In the mid-to-late 1980s school teachers and administrators observed a sharp increase in both drug use and disciplinary problems. School officials determined that student athletes were among the leaders of this “drug culture.” This caused special concern to the school, because student athletes in this town tended to be admired and served as role models and because school officials believed drug use could increase the risk of sports injuries. The school district offered special courses and guest speakers, and even used drugsniffing dogs in an attempt to solve its drug problem. However, the problem persisted. Frustrated by their lack of success, school officials sponsored a parents’ input night at which officials described a proposed drug testing policy. The parents in attendance were unanimous in their support of the policy. The schools decided to implement the policy. The policy applied to all students participating in interscholastic athletics. Students and their parents had to consent in writing to the policy before the season began. Each athlete was to be tested at the start of the sports season. In addition, each week during the season 10 percent of the athletes were randomly selected for testing. Student athletes also had to provide information on any prescription drugs they were taking, as these could have an effect on the tests. Careful controls on the testing were spelled out in the policy. These included watching or listening as students provided urine samples, hand-checking the specimens for temperature, sending the specimens to a reputable laboratory for testing, providing a second test if the first test was positive, and limiting knowledge of the test results to senior administrators in the school system. If the second test was positive, then the school scheduled a meeting with the student and the student’s parents. The student could choose to participate in a six-week drug rehabilitation program (with weekly testing) or be suspended from sports for the current and the next season. Seventh grader Jason Acton signed up to play football at one of the grade schools, but he and his parents refused to sign the consent form. He was not allowed to participate. Acton and his parents sued the school district for violation of his constitutional rights. The U.S. District Court dismissed his case, but the federal court of appeals reversed the trial court’s decision. The school district appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Tyvek Wristbands: An Event Planner's Best Friend</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 1em;">
<p>Whether you're planning an event for 100 or 10,000, wristbands are an invaluable tool in making sure your event runs smoothly. In fact, whether you choose Tyvek wristbands, paper wristbands, custom wristbands, plastic wristbands, or vinyl wristbands, simply using these simple identifiers can alleviate a number of potential problems during your event. The versatility of wristbands means that you can use them anytime you need a visual identifier. Here are some examples of the myriad of ways you can use wristbands:</p>
<p>Age or height identifier: Wristbands can be used at venues to identify minors in order to prevent them from purchasing alcoholic beverages. They can also be used in amusement parks when there are height restrictions to certain rides. Tyvek wristbands have the advantage of being waterproof, and so can be used for water parks.</p>
<p>Admissions: When you use wristbands, you can sell day passes for events or amusements. Guests will appreciate not having to fumble for tickets, and workers will save time by easily identifying those who have paid for a pass. If you are holding a conference that spans several days, you can use wristbands of a different color each day so that registrars can tell at a glance whether the attendee is registered for a given day's events.</p>
<p>Child-Parent Protection: Twin wristbands are ideal for situations where it's necessary to identify parents of children. Daycare centers, preschools, and amusement venues for small children all need to ensure that a child is leaving with an adult who is his or her parent or guardian.</p>
<p>Group Day Trips: Whether it's a school field trip or a day trip to a casino, it's important to be able to identify those with your group. Being able to check wristbands ensure that the proper individuals are boarding the proper busses, and allow for an easy head count to make sure no one is left behind.</p>
<p>Commemoration: If you're planning Red Ribbon Week at a school, you can issue wristbands to those students who pledge to participate. Likewise, you can use wristbands as a way for people who have committed to a cause or an ideal to self-identify.</p>
<p>Wristbands are made from a number of different materials, such as Tyvek wristbands, paper wristbands, plastic wristbands, and vinyl wristbands. Which material you choose depends upon your budget and the type of event you're planning.</p>
<p>Best of all, wristbands can be easily customized. Although there are a number of preprinted wristbands on the market, you can order custom wristbands with the name of your company or event. Custom wristbands can also include bar codes, logos, and other special text.</p>
