<li><b>Comment</b>: Yes but in that the Armenians of Van were <i>resisting</i> being killed off by the Ottoman Turks. They did the same thing at <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musa_Dagh_16e8.html" title="Musa Dagh">Musa Dagh</a> and their actions of self-defense during the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> are, in my opinion, comparable to those of the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw_Ghetto_Uprising_1dae.html" title="Warsaw Ghetto Uprising">Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto</a>. The events at Van were not an open rebellion of the Armenians against the Ottoman government as this article might imply. It should also be noted that, aside from the Turkish POV source provided in the article, none of these rebellions from 1780, 1782, 1786, 1808, 1818, 1820, 1825, 1829, 1831, 1835, 1836, 1840, 1842, 1843, 1850, 1852, 1853, 1854, 1857, 1860, 1861, 1862, 1865, 1868, 1873, 1875, 1876, 1877, 1878, 1879, 1893, 1895, or 1914 can really be verified by independent sources. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 10:38, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> useful. Also, when someone complains that an editor has notified others about the debate I am immediately suspicious of why the complainer doesn't want a more inclusive debate. These AfD's are routinely posted on "info boards" to allow editors who may be interested to know about them. Not all subjects have info boards, however, and unless the editor who <b>has been</b> notified complains, I see no reason for others to do so: the fact that someone tracked down the other person's edits is further indicatiion of the weakness of the tracker's position. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 16:59, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I believe that you are referring to me. Firstly, detecting canvass is not an uncommon procedure and it's essential to ensure that there is no interference in consensus building. Then, if I complain about canvass that's because I think it is something to be promptly frown upon, not because I want to stall incoming opposition to my stance on a discussion (in fact, in at least one occasion I have reported canvass carried by users that shared my view). The canvass situation that occurred here was more like a <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wp%7Espam.html#Friendly_notice" title="Wp:spam">friendly notice</a> which can be accepted if performed in a very limited number. In fact, user Clevelander contacted me and expressed that there was no intention to canvass, for which I assumed good faith and retreated the canvass acusation as you can see above. Your argument about posting on info boards is unrelated. Advertising AfD's on info boards is acceptable, for such procedure is prone to attract both supporters and opponents. Now, when you select specific users and coax them to participate, then that's canvassing and I will always have a firm stand against it. Last but not least, you should have assumed <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> as well before attacking me for ensuring that a clean discussion may take place here.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 17:53, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I dispute your premise that exclusion of people interested makes the consensus or discussion "clean". A spam-blast of everybody is uncalled-for, selected notices to people who may not have been paying attention is fine. You can call it canvassing, but as you know, these discussions are not votes, so if the "canvassee" only contributes a "keep" or "delete" it won't carry much weight. However, some canvasees can put forward an argument missed by other editors or put an argument in a more cohesive and pithy way. And why would that be wrong? Consensus shouldn't be sought to the exclusion of editors' opinions. I have had friendly messages removed from my talk page by editors who think that such removal is warranted. I assume good faith, but recognize that you are just doing what you're doing because of the weakness of your position. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 16:59, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> General comment concerning the above keep's. Most of you want the article kept provided it's sourced properly. The problem is that it can never be sourced properly as there have never been any Armenian rebellions in the Ottoman Empire. Attempts were made at various times by Armenians outside the Ottoman Empire such as <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Emin_b97e.html" title="Joseph Emin">Joseph Emin</a> or <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Ori_b6f0.html" title="Israel Ori">Israel Ori</a> to organize such rebellions but none ever came to fruition as a result of the isolation and distance of the Armenian population in the East from the major European powers. This was clearly not the case with Bulgarians, Greeks or Serbs who had easy access to European powers.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 19:15, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>At risk of not assuming good faith here, I unfortunately have to note that most <i>keep</i> votes are from people of Turkish origin and almost every <i>delete</i> vote from someone of Armenian origin. As I also stated above, it is difficult to find independent sources for stuff like this. I based my keep vote and subsequent rewrite largely on this Armenian source: <a href="http://www.armenianhistory.info/western.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.armenianhistory.info/western.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, which also states that <i>The 20s and the 30s of the 19th century were marked by a series of revolts of the non-Turkish peoples throughout the Ottoman Empire. ... The Serbs, Bulgarians, Albanians and Armenians were about to throw off the Turkish sway.</i> --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<li>I have to wonder, there's gotta be a way to reword this article to make it good.

I haven't read it, but if the Turks are supporting it and the Armenians not, then there must be something going on here that I don't understand. Normally, I'd think it the other way around, (e.g., with the Irish example, the english would be annoyed, and the Irish proud), especially with words like "Armenian genocide" which usually offend the Turks. Any takes on possibly moving it to a category? -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a> 21:20, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

The article says: "Starting around 1780", well lets start with that, why don't you tell me about that Armenian rebellion in 1780?--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 22:28, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Delete or keep with a rename</b> This RFD is problematic, because it seems as a borderline cases at first (but which isen't) and for this reason is more open to results which might be influenced by bias from both sides. One of the problems I believe is that for some the term rebellion has negative conotations, it does not necessarly have such negative conotation (see for example what led to the American war for independence). I do believe the potential of such an article, but the title is problematic and does not respect the majority position to term those incidents, each of the reported rebellions from the Ottoman Empire have found echo in the west as a massacre of Armenians, one of those pre 1870's was what was termed the Tigris massacre in 1867. So in this cases, we need to find a more encyclopedic title for such an article, which I believe has real potentials. Then why so my 'weak delete'? Well, because there isen't much valuable content as of now in that article(properly sourced that is), and the title is difficult to handle, as in the majority of the cases if not all that term is the minority position, since those incidences are more properly termed 'Armenian massacres,' and the direction this article could take would be FORK if worked as is. Thosefor, I don't see a loss of deleting an article which neither right now has the content neither the title to be kept. And without those two there is not justification to keep. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 22:45, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and NPOV/source where required. All other ethnic groups rebelled against the Ottoman Empire, but some claim that (by eliminating this article) only Armenians demanded to be subjects of the Ottomans Empire. Claims that Armenians were leaving happily everafter under the Ottoman Empire is funny. All ethnic groups rebelled and so Armenians.--<a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOttomanReference_bb23.html" title="User:OttomanReference">OttomanReference</a> 23:52, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Lets see, Greeks... Greece, Serbs... Serbia, Croats... Croatia, Albanians... Albania, Bulgarians... Bulgaria, Arabs... all the current Arabic states etc. Armenians? Armenia is carved on a part of 'Russian Armenia'..., the only other exceptions are Nestrogian, Syriacs etc., of course the Kurds, but a considerable portion of Eastern Turkey are still Kurds. I don't see this analogy with 'other ethnic groups.' I also fail to see why the article should be titled with a term which is considered the minority view, you propose a FORK. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 03:52, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
