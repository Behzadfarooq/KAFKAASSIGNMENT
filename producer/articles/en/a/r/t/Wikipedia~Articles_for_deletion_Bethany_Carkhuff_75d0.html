<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> A Google search on this woman returns only 7 original hits, a yahoo search, only 3. This article smacks of a PR plant. The fact that she is wealthy, attends Columbia University and is the daughter of a prominent attorney is hardly notable. The fact that she may have famous neighbors is also irrelevant.I have never read anything about Ms. Carkhuff in any publication-other than Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Thesaunterer (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThesaunterer_da92.html" title="User talk:Thesaunterer">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thesaunterer_756a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thesaunterer">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> This girl is up and coming, the same way Paris Hilton was before she landed the simple life. She is beginning to be well known throughout New York City, and I have seen her in different New York publications for attending benefits, store openings, etc. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Craziness1 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Craziness1_2195.html" title="Special:Contributions/Craziness1">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Neutral</b> Note: Applebees1 entry has been removed due to repeated VANDALISM by this user who has no prior posting history other than this AFD. Possible sockpuppet account. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Applebees1" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Applebees1" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Applebees1</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This entry is (in my opinion) one of the most egregious examples of <b>self promotion</b> I've ever come across in Wikipedia. The tenuous connection to the Wang family is ludicrous. Does the daughter of John D. Rockefeller's attorney also have an entry? Article has <b>NO SOURCES</b> and fails to establish any degree of relevance. The two links that were posted don't even reference the subject. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 4.239.255.248 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.239.255.248_edce.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.239.255.248">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I know for a fact that Ms. Carkhuff was present as a guest at the Emmy's, the VMA's, and on Howard Stern. I have recently submitted these to IMBD and they should be updated soon. I think it is best to wait and see if this verifiable source can be added to the page before it is subject to deletion. I also believe the above comment (the source claiming to be Ms. Carkhuff is false and is just someone who is either jealous or doesn't know how to create a valid argument and wants this article deleted). I agree with the person who said this article might as well remain, for the same reason there is a Kimberly Stewart article or articles about the younger boy Hilton siblings who have never done anything except been born priveleged. There is a new generation of celebrities arising, and that is of people who are rich and have high class family ties; and even if it is unfortunate, there are people want to know about these people. Ms. Carkhuff appears to be one of these people, so I would not consider this self-promotion, but an article about yet another socialite who is not as well known as socialites like Kimberly Stewart, etc. yet. So I vote for Don't Delete on these grounds. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Thesocialite (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thesocialite_142a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thesocialite">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> As a regular wiki surfer, I came across this page through the American Socialites category. I understand the argument about no references and few hits using different internet searches, but there are many models, socialites, etc. that it would be difficult to come across internet sources for. Not every event, public appearance at a nightclub/benefit or even the event itself will turn up in your internet searches. I personally know a high-fashion runway model, who could possibly be considered a "socialite" even though he has no family ties, who has worked with many reputable agencies such as DNA, etc. that does not produce any internet hits. I tend to agree with the person above me. "Celebutaunte," "socialite," and being famous just for the family you were born into or the people you know is a generally new concept that has been brought to light by Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, etc. Previously you would have said, why should Nicole Richie get her own page, she is merely the daughter of Lionel Richie; there are other examples of people who are in this category simply because of there family. Instead of trying to delete people that could belong to this "American socialites" category, I would like to see it expanded. This is a rising new concept that deserves merit in its own right. I, and I'm sure other users, would like to know who is out there living these life styles, knowing these people, etc.; of course, there will also be people that are jealous or find no interest and want such pages deleted. I wouldn't say that this is a page of self-promotion; why would a person of status waste time and create their own wikipedia page? They obviously caught the interest of someone else, and the page has been edited by several different people. As for "tenuous connections" and "famous neighbors," I think that is merely explaining the source of wealth (Hilton from Hilton hotels) and the area Ms. Carkhuff is from, respectively. As for sources, some verifable sources are bound to come up eventually. So my verdict, don't delete. Wait. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ridiculousness7 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ridiculousness7_1193.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ridiculousness7">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Ms. Carkhuff just emailed the help desk from her columbia.edu email address requesting deletion of the article as she wishes to remain a private persona at least until graduation. This posting is legitimately from her. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a> <a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> <small><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_WAvegetarian_f393.html" title="Special:Emailuser/WAvegetarian">(email)</a></small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WAvegetarian_0ea5.html" title="Special:Contributions/WAvegetarian"><sup>(contribs)</sup></a> 18:12, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The only thing verifiable in this article is that Bethany Carkhuff is a college student at Columbia University; I can't confirm that she is an heiress, socialite, or model. If she really was a famous "celebutante" and tabloid fixture, there would be a lot more Google hits for her. If she becomes one, we can create an article about her <i>then</i> because we will be able to find verifiable information about her. Also, everyone, please sign your votes by ending them with four tildes like this: ~~~~. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:36, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Speedy delete</b> - if there is any notability, it would be of being part of a notable family (which, by the way, doesn't have a Wikipedia article), and I am convinced that the unsigned comments requesting such came from the subject of the article. The article was most likely posted by a classmate (Fuzzyponsays, with only one edit away from this article) without her knowledge, and it must go. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 17:16, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
