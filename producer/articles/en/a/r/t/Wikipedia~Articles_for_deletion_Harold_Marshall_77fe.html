<dd>There is absolutely no evidence that he was ever even employed in his trade - the only historical facts on record are that he was in the Army in 1944 and had his picture taken once. So tell me - what else does anyone know about him? He's simply not notable other than for having a picture taken. Beyond that, what makes him notable? No one has listed any reasons. Incidentally, I am the webmaster for the Calgary Highlanders website and have access to the War Diary of the battalion. I don't mean to denigrate his service, but I can safely say there was nothing to distinguish him from the hundreds of other Canadian Army snipers that served in the Second World War, and <b>absolutely no basis</b> to describe him as "the most notable Canadian sniper in history" - in fact, that would go to <b>Ducky Norwest</b> or <b>Pegmahbow</b> or one of the other First World War snipers. The First World War snipers have easily verifiable kill records - there is no evidence out there that Marshall ever even shot anyone. So no, my objection is not to the misidentification of the kukri on his belt (my analysis is based on discussions with regimental museum staff and examination of the photo enlarged to 3 feet square, so please, sherucij, let me know what examination you have done besides looking at an internet picture), but rather to the fact that the entire article is a waste of bandwidth based on the fact we don't know anything about him, nor, frankly, are we like to given the lack of information available in the public record about him. He's simply not encyclopaedic.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 17:14, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - The point is that it's not the job of Wikipedia to examine enlarged photos to draw our own conclusions, it's to report what is <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiable_e5a8.html" title="WP:Verifiable">WP:Verifiable</a>, and your personal opinon isn't.

<p>Michael Dorosh's arguments make the case for articles on Ducky Norwest or Pegmahbow to be created, not for this one to be deleted. Also there may be a need for revision of the article, but that doesn't mean it should be deleted.

<li>Was in the Canadian military in the Second World War. (So were approximately 1 million men and women).</li>
<li>Was employed as a sniper. (So were thousands of soldiers).</li>

<dd>They're making an entire movie about the Iwo flag raising - the difference is that we know a lot about the guys that raised the flag, Ira Hayes, etc., and the flag raising itself was a notable event. Marshall is photographed... standing in a field, posing for a picture. See the difference? There is nothing notable about standing in a field posing for a picture. Raising the flag on Suribachi is infinitely more notable for reasons that should be self-evident.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 15:41, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>It was the photograph that made the flag-raising a notable event, because it was a striking image. Without the photo, the event would have been not known about and entirely forgotten. A notable event (e.g. the assassination of Lincoln) is remembered in its own right, even though there is no photograph. In both cases, of flag-raising and Marshall, we are recording the power and notability of an image which is symbolic. Proof of this is that no one bothers about the fact that there was an earlier (and smaller) flag raised at the same spot on Iwo Jima. That was the more notable event—but not the notable image. The photo of Marshall embodies values, equivalent, for example, to the tomb of the unknown soldier. Marshall is an individual, but he represents much more than that. To just talk about him standing in a field is reductionism. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 16:43, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The point you are missing is that the other photos cited were taken during notable events; a non-notable person standing in a field is not notable. The photo itself is notable and should be included on Ken Bell's page, the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Highlanders_6992.html" title="Calgary Highlanders">Calgary Highlanders</a> page and on the <a href="../../../s/n/i/Sniper.html" title="Sniper">Sniper</a> page, but Marshall is not notable himself. Nor is the photo all that remarkable; it is often reproduced, but there is no history to the photo the way there is to the flag raising on Suribachi. If anyone can identify the location that Marshall is standing in please post it here. You can't, because even the photographer didn't note the location - it wasn't noteworthy. It's a cool picture, but nothing more, and if you want to start an article on H.A. Marshall Photo then your argument might hold some water. If you are lobbying for an article on H.A. Marshall then you have still not presented any of the wikipedia criteria for notability.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 18:59, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't feel this response answers my points, so I will leave it for others to judge.

<dd>What I meant to say is that the photo is all that is remarkable in the case of Marshall, but the photo does not show anything notable. The photo of the Iwo flag raising is not just notable for being a famous photo, it actually shows a famous event - the 2nd flag raising on Suribachi. The men involved have well documented histories, including an upcoming movie. Nothing has entered the historical record about Marshall other than he posed for a picture once and the picture was really cool. Ask yourself - if you can't even type out where Marshall was born, how old he was, or when he joined the Army, much less what he did in the service, how is he notable? On the other hand, Ira Hayes' postwar history is well known and one could probably fill a few paragraphs on his history alone, not to mention the dramatic impact of the flag raising(s) - they came early in the battle but the ships at sea and men on the island that witnessed the flag then and in days after had much to say about the event. Marshall's photo is notable only for being cool - no one knew that it was being taken and it didn't see widespread publication until after the war. It was not an EVENT the way the Suribachi raising or the Kent State shootings were. It is only notable in that it has been widely reproduced despite the subject being not notable.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 20:54, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The interesting "event" in the case of Marshall was <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> in which he <s>lost his life,</s> as did many others. The photo has obviously come to symbolise things about that war, in the same way that the flag-raising photo has. You've put the horse before the cart. That photo doesn't show a famous event. It made the event famous. The only reason the event is famous is because it's a great photo. The only reason the men involved have "well documented histories" is because the photo generated interest in them. They are just ordinary soldiers otherwise. A photo doesn't have to show an "event" to be notable: it can, for example, symbolise values, character, etc. The photo of Marshall is well known and it is only right to give him the dignity of acknowledging who he is. As you say yourself, it has been "widely reproduced". This fact alone justifies the article in wiki terms. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 00:13, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>HE DIDN'T DIE during the war. DHH website incorrectly lists him as dead but see the list of fatal casualties at www.calgaryhighlanders.com - he's not on it. He lived through the war. I guess he's so notable that no one even knows he lived, eh? Besides I never said the photo wasn't notable. Marshall himself isn't. Doesn't merit an article. The photo can be discussed on Bell's page, the Sniper page, or any of a thousand Second World War related pages. There is nothing to populate a page on him alone.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 02:58, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tyrenius, you're REALLY not getting the fact that any information on the Internet regarding Marshall is a result of my putting it there. The DHH site has a painting of him, and inaccurately notes that he died. Anything else was my doing. And I am stating from a position of authority that this guy, as far as is known, is not notable. I had my reservations from the minute I saw this page was created, but I followed WP guidelines and presumed good faith, thinking that perhaps there was some original research out there to shed light on him. That didn't happen - what happened was someone tried to create an article on a person based solely on a picture caption. So yes, there was questions about notability all along, but because I was presuming good faith, I didn't voice them until it became apparent the article creator had absolutely no evidence of notability - which was evidenced by his bizarre decision to argue the kukri handle. The photos of Canadian machetes are clearly shown on my website. I've examined large blowups of the photo and discussed it at length with museum staff at the regimental museum. Kudos to <b>Sherurcij</b> for being bold; unfortunately in this case, it has come to a dead end in an article about someone lacking notability.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 13:18, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, you know full well that Marshall didn't die during the war becuase you yourself posted at the User Talk for Marshall's page that there is a photo of him taken in the 1970s. So who's not arguing in good faith now?<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 13:20, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I found the 1970s photo reference only after I made my last post here, and put the info where it could do some good on the article talk page, so please again do not make implications. I don't see it as relevant to the AfD debate particularly, nor what kind of knife he was carrying for that matter. It's irrelevant who put the information on the web sites referenced: the fact is that they can now be used as a reference. I would like to congratulate you, however, on your research and your very informative sites. Also the Canadian government has seen fit to give him a page, as a separate source for reference. However, I find it odd that you are "bigging up" the prominence of the photo on sites you run, and arguing the opposite here. I think this discussion has covered the points of view more than adequately, and suggest we agree to now let editors make up their own minds, based on what has been said to date. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 15:30, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And they'll be sorely disappointed by the article here if they do, because all that is known is that he served in the military in 1944, was photographed once, and wore a Denison smock.

<dd><i>People who have been deceased for some time pose the simplest question, because history is usually clear about the nature and extent of their importance. With historical perspective, there is less controversy about the facts of their contribution. The basic test in this case is:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Has the person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in the specific field?</i></li>

<dd>Marshall does not pass the test - what contribution has he done other than pose for a picture? The enduring historical record was altered by Bell, for taking his picture; Marshall himself was simply a soldier who did his duty.

<dd>He is notable, as previously stated, for being the subject of "one of the most famous Canadian images to come out of the Second World War", as stated on the <a href="http://www.calgaryhighlanders.com/history/scouts.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.calgaryhighlanders.com/history/scouts.htm" rel="nofollow">Calgary Highlanders website</a> run by the same Michael Dorosh, who is arguing so vehemently that he is not notable.

<dd>You are arguing then that he is passively notable? Incidentally you've quoted a "Doresh" a couple times now - who is that in reference to? I refer you back to the notability guidelines - you can argue that he has altered history and I will grant that the photo itself is notable due to the impact it has made - but still argue that the man himself is not provably notable given how little we know about him or are likely to see reproduced. Perhaps in 5 years if the proposed centennial history project comes off (which I hope to write) you can quote from my book, if there is anything of note in our archives about Marshall that is, and I decide to include it.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 17:47, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
