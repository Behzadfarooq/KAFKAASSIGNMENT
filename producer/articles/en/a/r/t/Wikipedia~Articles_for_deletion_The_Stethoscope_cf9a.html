<li><b>Keep</b> I am another stethoscope member, and all I can say is please examine the merits of the organization by looking at the website, rather than listening to people whose only comment is "non notable" without explaining why it is non notable, considering the size of the organization and their lack of familiarity with even the university of toronto. If all it takes is a sockpuppet fan base to flood this with keep votes, then we can easily get dozens of members to put down some sort of comment on why this should be kept. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.100.90.251 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.100.90.251_eb52.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.100.90.251">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Most student organizations that exist at only one university are non-notable. Lots of universities have pre-medical (pre-dental, etc.) organizations, and that's a popular career choice among college students, so it doesn't surprise me that this organization could have 750 members at a campus with about 50,000 undergraduates. However, if this becomes a national pre-med organization, it would probably be notable enough to qualify for Wikipedia in my opinion. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 01:25, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am also a Stethoscope member, and we certainly have a lot of footing. We have high profile events and last year in our inaugural year we actually had Tak Mak and the federal minister of public health come and give a talk, and this year the chief medical officer for Toronto is apparently coming as well. If we are some nonsense non notable club with 7-10 members would those high profile personalities actually take the time to go? De Lovely 18:03, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: The Stethoscope could be, and apparently is, completely legitimate and worthwhile <i>for its members</i> without warranting having a Wikipedia article about it. I don't consider it nonsense, but that doesn't mean it's notable. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 01:38, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Since Wikipedia contains extensive articles on every Pokemon character and video game in existence (not to mention its growing library of porn star bios), I believe the bar is sufficiently low enough to enable a good-sized academic organization at a major institution of higher learning to easily meet the entry qualifications. I'm not defending dumbing down Wikipedia (in fact, I'm quite opposed to it), but I am saying that an even and consistent set of criteria should apply. If we allow cartoon characters to have their own articles, but deny them to college organizations, we've taken one more step down the road to Wikipedia becoming little more than a repository of insignificant, pop-culture trivia. — <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMaylett_1b3a.html" title="User:Maylett">C Maylett</a> 17:18, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: Maybe we should do the appropriate thing and list all of those insignificant cartoon characters for deletion instead? —<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleared_as_filed_a7db.html" title="User:Cleared as filed">Cleared as filed.</a> 10:55, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: We can't plausibly use the same standards in determining whether Pokemon characters, porn stars, and student organizations are worthy of Wikipedia entries; neither <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikachu.html" title="Pikachu">Pikachu</a> nor the Stethoscope has ever won an <a href="../../../a/v/n/AVN_Awards_0318.html" title="AVN Awards">Adult Video News Award</a>. I don't believe there are any official guidelines about student organizations having Wikipedia entries, but I think most of those I have seen on AfD have failed their votes and been deleted. If you can find precedents in your favor among other <i>student organizations</i>, I would take those into consideration. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 00:41, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment: For keeping</b> I am the first stethoscope member who posted above, i made an account but i forgot my log on name so i am signing off with my ip. Someone mentioned student organizations that have been kept, here is one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Sigma_Phi_Philippines" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Sigma_Phi_Philippines" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Sigma_Phi_Philippines</a> . As far as it seems it doesnt have the same scope as our organization since it comes from two small second rate provincial universities in the philippines. They are a considerably older organization, but is age really the matter for notability, or is it the relevance of the organization to an x number of people? We make no financial gain out of having the stethoscope on wikipedia, since our membership is free and open to all, and we even have logged europeans and australians visiting and returning to our website on a regular basis looking for information on the health care professions admissions criteria in canada. This entire article will probably be deleted, but you people who consider yourselves as guardians of wikipedia should really get priorities straight if the message you are sending is that a pokemon character or 60's porn star has more notability than an organization involved in helping the next generation of a first world country's health care profession. 70.30.120.30 13:38, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
