<li><b>keep</b> I am not an expert on this topic, but it seems that wikipedia should have an article to capture the ethnic tensions that are documentable in this region. <a href="../../../a/h/v/Ahvaz_Bombings_004a.html" title="Ahvaz Bombings">Ahvaz Bombings</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> could be merged to this article. If you want to rename the article to say "tensions" rather than "politics" I would be ok with that. According to <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty_International_6202.html" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a> <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE130592006?open&amp;of=ENG-2MD" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE130592006?open&amp;of=ENG-2MD" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <b>Much of Iran's Arab community lives in the province of Khuzestan which borders Iraq. It is strategically important because it is the site of much of Iran’s oil reserves. Historically, the Arab community has been marginalised and discriminated against. Tension has mounted among the Arab population since April 2005, when scores of Arabs were killed, hundreds injured and hundreds more detained during and following demonstrations. The demonstrations were undertaken in protest at a letter which came to light allegedly written in 1999 by a presidential adviser, who denied its authenticity. This appeared to set out policies for the reduction of the Arab population of Khuzestan, including resettling Arabs in other regions of Iran, resettling non-Arabs in the province, and replacing Arabic place names with Persian ones</b> <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 17:12, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Few points: <b>1) Please show evidence of ethnic tension between Arabs and other ethnic groups in the region (such as Persians, Lurs, Bakhtiaris, Qashqais, Afsharis, etc.) 2) Why should <a href="../../../a/h/v/Ahvaz_Bombings_004a.html" title="Ahvaz Bombings">Ahvaz Bombings</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> be merged here when it should be the other way? i.e. Merge what is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> here (very little) into <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a>. 3) WP is not a soapbox or a political platform and the way you quote Amnesty (and bolding such a huge portion of text) is clearly evidence of this POV. 4) The Amnesty report is not neutral and it contains factual inaccuracies. Also the Amnesty report only shows tension between Arabs and the regime. In case you didnt know, there is tension between ALL Iranians and the regime. This is NOTHING to do with so-called "ethnic tension", "ethnic politic" or "ethnic conflict". Again WP is not a soapbox, not for advocacy, not for propaganda, and not to prove a original claim or point.</b> <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 17:39, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The "topic" unfortunately is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> as shown on explanations here. The article is mostly about Khuzestani Arabs and we already have <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> (which should be called <a href="../../../k/h/u/Khuzestani_Arabs_a7eb.html" title="Khuzestani Arabs">Khuzestani Arabs</a>) so anything that is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> here should be taken there and the terrorism things to <a href="../../../a/h/v/Ahvaz_Bombings_004a.html" title="Ahvaz Bombings">Ahvaz Bombings</a> and anything historical to <a href="../../../k/h/u/Khuzestan.html" title="Khuzestan">Khuzestan</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Khuzestan_6357.html" title="History of Khuzestan">History of Khuzestan</a>. But this article title is OR. As Mr. Doostzadeh says we could create similar OR titles like Ethnic conflict in North Africa (which actually wouldnt be OR because there is plenty of articles about Arabs killing Berber peoples), Ethnic conflict between Arabs and Persians (which though we could say is very true, is still OR), Ethnic conflict in Iraq (about pan-Arab genocide of Persian-speakers and Kurds - this is also not very OR), Ethnic conflict in Southwest United States (about conflict between Hispanics, Whites, and Blacks), etc etc etc. Some of them are not OR but would turn into "political battegrounds". Already we see the problem here. We should not have double standard and single out Iran or Khuzestan for these POV pushers. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 10:26, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The article can be dealt with in the Khuzestan province article or Arabs of Iran. Virtually all the sources here are from separatists sites. Easily a country like former Ba'athist iraq can support a small group and that small group can setup a website and then propogate their political POV which is definitely not neutral. BTW is there is an article on Berber ethnic politics in Algeria? I think the genocide against Iranians by Arabs can also warrant an article. So these sort of articles are not helpful to anyone and are too POV oriented to have any neutrality. I do not see any valid reason for this article since it is all POV so far. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 04:31, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> how many Ethnic politics of... articles are there? Articles like this can easily be just POV. At best include a section in the Khuzestan or Arabs of Khuzestan article.

<dd>Your block on me has prevented me from making an important point on the deleting of the Ethnic Politics of Khuzestan article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ethnic_politics_of_Khuzestan" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ethnic_politics_of_Khuzestan" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. As this block extends beyond the deadline for the deletion, I would like you to pass on my points.</dd>
<dd>1. The article was created as the information contained within it was judged to be too lengthy for the Khuzestan article alone: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Khuzestan_Province#Ethnic_conflict_in_Khuzestan" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Khuzestan_Province#Ethnic_conflict_in_Khuzestan" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. This was done with consensus of editors, although the name was changed from "ethnic conflict" to "ethnic politics" as "conflict" was judged too strong and POV and anyway it was recognised that the issues were of political importance.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. A lot of work has gone into the article from people of all POVs, with the involvement of Iranian editors, and it has not been the subject of any lengthy edit war, despite the sensitive nature of the subject. This work will be lost if it is simply deleted without a merger with other articles - which I think is Khorshid's intention. It is worthwhile noting that Khorshid has made no attempt to edit the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4. The issue of minority rights in Khuzestan is of significant public interest <a href="http://www.unpo.org/article.php?id=5848" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unpo.org/article.php?id=5848" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.ahwaz.org.uk/2006/11/european-parliament-condemns-iran-over.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ahwaz.org.uk/2006/11/european-parliament-condemns-iran-over.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and deserves a separate article, with details on the actors involved.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please pass on my comments to the AfD page, so people understand the context of why the article was created.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>1)There is not just <a href="../../../k/h/u/Khuzestan.html" title="Khuzestan">Khuzestan</a> article - there is also <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> (where most of the Arab stuff that is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> - not separatist propaganda - should go).</dd>
<dd>2)Both are POV and violate <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. No credible evidence is there to prove this. What sources is there only shows tension between Arabs and regime, and this is same for all Iranians.</dd>
<dd>3)I have no bad intentions. Most of the article is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and violates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> like the separtist political groups. What is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> should go into <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> where almost all the Arab information already exists and to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Khuzestan_6357.html" title="History of Khuzestan">History of Khuzestan</a>.

<dd>4)<a href="../../../u/n/p/UNPO_2036.html" title="UNPO">UNPO</a> and British Ahwazi Friends Society, the two links you provide, are not only not neutral they promote separatist agenda and false history. There is fact and then there is propaganda and they are 100% not fact. Also those links dont discuss "minority" rights but "Arab" rights and the current article only talks about Arabs. There are a ton of minorities in Khuzestan beside Arab. And like I said there is already <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> (which be renamed <a href="../../../k/h/u/Khuzestani_Arabs_a7eb.html" title="Khuzestani Arabs">Khuzestani Arabs</a>).

<p>Keep: politics should not influence history. Unfortunately some with ultra-nationalist, anti-Arab ideology want to influence this respectable forum that should be an educational tool. Arabs of Iran as a non-dominant, ethnic, linguistic and a national minority have never had the opportunity to express their identity in a Persian-dominated Iran during both, the monarchist or the current clerical regime. So it is just to allow this minority a few lines in Wikipedia. It is utterly undemocratic for the Persians to push for deletion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Alsaid (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alsaid_f332.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alsaid">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— Alsaid (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alsaid_f332.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alsaid">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>
<p>KEEP Please: Ahwazi-Arabs are indigenous to the area of Khuzestan. They date back before Islam. About 5000 years ago, long before the Achaemenid left Russia and headed toward the Iranian plateau, a Semitic nation by the name of Elamite lived in Khuzestan. They have left us signs of their blooming civilization in the ruins of Susa, Ghagharzanbill and other parts of Khuzestan, Lurestan and Fars. The Old Testament mentions their name for the first time. So we the Arabs of Iran are decedents of the Elimite. Kasravi, a well respected Iranian historian, in his book titled “500 years history of Khuzestan” writes "but it is certain and there is proof for it that during the Parthian era Arab tribes were living in provinces of Kerman, Khuzestan, Bahrain and Fars". Kasravi refers to the Tabari history book, the first Muslim historian whose work is still universally accepted and writes ‘Aam (banu-Am tribe). This means during the Sasanid era, Iran had many kingdoms, of which Aghlim al-Ahwaz (province of al-Ahwaz) was one. Other historians such as Mohammad Ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Batota and ibn Athir travel books as well as many other historians such as bin abi Yaaghobi, ibn Haghol, Estakhri, Nasser Khssrow, ibn Balkhi, el-Kamil, Habib al-Sair, Askendar Beg, Najm al molik Ghafari and others reference the existence of Indigenous Ahwazi Arabs in Eghlim (region) of al-Ahwaz or Arabistan, in one way or the other. So to say there are other ethnic groups live in Iran, it may be true but they are not indigenes to the area. In fact up to the discovery of oil in Khuzestan in 1908, the area was 100% was inhabited by indigenous Ahwazi-Arab tribes. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Alsaid (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alsaid_f332.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alsaid">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— Alsaid (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alsaid_f332.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alsaid">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>
<p><b>Keep</b> - The subject is noteworthy and is an issue of growing media interest due to human rights issues and unfounded claims by the Iranian regime that Western governments are responsible for unrest in the province. If there are concerns about the title, then it should be changed. A section is also needed on the province's Mandean community, which is also subjected to discrimination and state terrorism. But as the Arabs are the largest ethnic group, they naturally receive the most coverage. The issues go well beyond recent bomb attacks. Additionally, the article as it stands has 64 references, mostly Amnesty International but also including Bloomburg, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Al-Jazeera and other reliable news sources. Therefore, the claims of breaching <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> policies are questionable - indeed, this article is one of the most heavily referenced on Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 21:23, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've no particular objections to this, only that the reason why the article was originally created was because it was decided by consensus that the Khuzestan article was getting too long. A separate article was created for the issues surrounding ethnic unrest in the province - not just the bombings, but also the geopolitical issues and human rights concerns. There have been other spin-offs from this article since then - eg <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Iranianism_c948.html" title="Anti-Iranianism">Anti-Iranianism</a>, which goes into greater detail about claims of British involvement in the province's ethnic politics.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 23:18, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Or perhaps a new article on Ethnic Minority Rights in Iran, to cover all minorities? I don't really mind this, but I think it would be a mistake to put human rights issues under <a href="../../../k/h/u/Khuzestan.html" title="Khuzestan">Khuzestan</a> (which I think is more appropriate for historical and geographical data) or <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> (which should be anthropological rather than political).

<dd>I just read the article, and I will change my opinion a little bit. I still think that the idea behind the article is valid, but I have to agree with Ahwaz that there might be something more than simple human rights issues.. I can also hear Khorshid's comments that some of the stuff about human rights can go into Human rights in Iran article, but I think that there is enough info about it that it could have its own article. But considering that there are some other issues talked about in the article, I think some other names could also be appropriate. I just proposed "human rights in.." because it is a quite universal word that can cover many things with subsequent sub-sections with different titles. So I don't know.. Depending on what other content can be added "human rights in khuzestan" or even the original name "ethnic conflict in Khuzestan" can be appropriate, I just thought that human rights could have been a less inflammatory compromise for a title. But the idea beneath is definitely valid in my opinion. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 02:33, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I never liked the title - it can be changed, in my opinion. One editor originally created the article as "ethnic conflict in Khuzestan" in order to put relevant content from the <a href="../../../k/h/u/Khuzestan.html" title="Khuzestan">Khuzestan</a> article in its own article, but there was consensus that this was too strong as there has never been a suggestion that there is communal violence between ethnic groups in the province. It was changed to "ethnic politics" without much thought. But no-one really knew a better alternative. It is more than a human rights issue, but indigenous grievances touch on the area's historical autonomy, inequality, linguistic rights, civil rights, geopolitics, etc.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 00:27, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why not just rename it <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Khuzestan_f592.html" title="Politics of Khuzestan">Politics of Khuzestan</a> (there are plenty of "politics of ..." articles on Wikipedia), so that wider political issues can be taken into account - including election results, political traditions, etc? I can see that just transferring the political stuff to <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> will continue to generate problems, with users arguing that too much importance is paid to just Arabs and that Arabs are being defined solely in terms of opposition to the Iranian regime. Such issues are often more complex. Taking the "ethnic" element out of the title need not lead to the removal of current political content, but could broaden it to include broader issues. What do you think?--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 00:51, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You see problem there is Iran is not like USA where state/province has autonomy. Iran has strong centralised government and provinces do not have any kind of autonomy (we can argue that one or two have it but thats something else - khuzestan has no autonomy). All the political groups except one are separatist and based outside Iran and some of them are not even verifiable. So <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Khuzestan_f592.html" title="Politics of Khuzestan">Politics of Khuzestan</a> makes no sense because there is no autonomous poltical system and also there are no ordinary political groups of Khuzestan, just one that is Arab in Iran (has no power), one that is "pro-federalism" outside Iran, and the rest are separatist/terrorist. So they belong in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a>. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 01:18, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well, I don't agree with the conflation of separatist and terrorist. I also think that there are political forces that are particular to Khuzestan - certain personalities, the way the place is governed due to its geographical and strategic significance, etc. While Iran is highly centralised, each province has a different set of political dynamics - this is what makes Iran, a highly diverse country, such a fascinating place. I think there should be articles on the politics of each major province and perhaps Khuzestan could be a good starting point.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 01:25, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would like to hear what other ppls have to say about that. My issue is that it will be mostly an Arab article with focus on south Khuzestan, like this one.

<dl>
<dd>Not necessarily. The electoral politics and governorship of Khuzestan are not adequately covered by an ethnic focus. A broader article will make it less about ethnicity and more about politics, of which ethnicity plays just a part. Why not change the title to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Khuzestan_f592.html" title="Politics of Khuzestan">Politics of Khuzestan</a>, clean up the article and see whether the problems you have raised have been addressed. If there are still problems by 20 December (a month after the conclusion of this AfD), then open up a new AfD and we can look at other ways of organising the material.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 01:55, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> There can be no arguments for deletion for any article because of its shortness since we have many more shorter articles about fictional Pokemon and Star Wars characters and planets, so as long as the title is correct, there is no reason why any article couldn't exist. If there is a "main article - sub-article" relation with another article, the correct remedy is to introduce a few sentences in the main, then put a "see also: X" at the end of that section. POV issues can always be addressed in the article itself, and title should be NPOV, but deletion, no. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 03:17, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
