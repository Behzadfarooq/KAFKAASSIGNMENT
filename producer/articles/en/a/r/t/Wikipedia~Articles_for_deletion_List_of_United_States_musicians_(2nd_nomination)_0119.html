<p>The result was: There is a clear consensus to <b>categorise and delete</b> here - but how exactly to close this AfD is a bit vexing. It's not clear that the categorisation is complete. Basically, I see two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep all the articles until it's confirmed that they've been categorised, then... um... well, god knows. <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> them? Except, of course, that any article which has been nominated for deletion before cannot be prodded. <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">Ignore all rules</a> and speedy them? God help us, another 100-article AfD? I think there's a high chance they'd just be forgotten about and hang around for months.</li>
<li>Or I can delete them all now, and if any of these lists have not been fully categorised and someone wants to complete the work, they can contact me and I'll restore them to userspace.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm going with 2, especially given that no-one's objected to Dr Zak's assertion "delete, categories exist" below, despite this AfD hanging around for several extra days. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 09:01, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> This AfD will take a while to close, and I may be interrupted before finishing - if you notice any of these lists or links to them still hanging around, please do not contact me to say "hey, you didn't delete x" until tomorrow (Tuesday 18th July). --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 09:06, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>None of the musicians listed here are notable for being from the United States; many are not even notable. This is the beginning of an attempt to change all of these lists into categories. There are already categories for many of these lists: for example, there is a list of bands from California and a <a href="../../../c/a/l/Category%7ECalifornia_musicians_84e9.html" title="Category:California musicians">Category:California musicians</a>. This is redundant and, since the categories are more appropriate, the lists should be deleted. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStellis_c699.html" title="User:Stellis">Stellis</a> 21:52, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I was involved in maintaining both of the Wisconsin articles on this list due to my involvement in WikiProject Wisconsin. I vote weak delete because the Wisconsin articles were frequently "vandalized" by anons adding red links to bands and musicians without asserting their notability. The articles were too hard to maintain too. I think that categories are a better route, because notability is automatic (or else the article will eventually be nominated on AfD). The problem is that the categories don't allow for a list of notable artists/bands to be added later. <b><u>These lists HAVE to be converted into categories so the data is not lost.</u></b> Hopefully a bot can do that task. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil">Royalbroil</a> 14:59, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yup, <b>categorise</b> per nom. This is exactly what categories do well.

<li><b>Keep</b> although I have worked on some, I do believe the lists are useful. You can make almost any list into a category but I don't believe that would be best for wikipedia. List of architects could easily be a category but does well as a list. Maybe what would be best is deleting red linked bands as they aren't notable to even have a page yet, leaving bands that are noticible enough to have there own page. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_jedi_requiem_3b2a.html" title="User:Dark jedi requiem">Dark jedi requiem</a> 17:01, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I find it particularly useful when state lists are broken down by city, such as that of List of bands from Ohio. I don't think the sub-categorization would be as clean using categories. And as far as red links go, while a blue link may indicate notability, I don't feel a red link necessarily means non-notability. In fact, it may encourage people to create a new article for a notable band. <a href="../../../h/o/o/User%7EHoof_Hearted_0f23.html" title="User:Hoof Hearted">Hoof Hearted</a> 15:46, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Categorize all and delete</b>, I actually stumbled on this looking for the category for Massachusetts musicians, and wondered "Why does this exist when a category would do the work?" And wouldn't you know, the AfD notice was there waiting for me! Categories do work much better in these cases, and if a city is lucky enough to have multiple significant musicians heralding from it, a new category for "Musicians from CityXXX" wouldn't bother me, either. <s>I would encourage moving even the redlinked subjects for now; let's deal with their presence on those lists another time.</s> <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">HumbleGod</a> 18:50, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Support</b> for <b>Categorize and delete</b>. (I take it this will mean that anything that any links to the articles will be fixed as well?) I was helping maintain the List of bands from Oregon, and think lists are handy, but understand the reasons for the nomination. No loss of data (except for redlinks of dubious value) would be good. Thanks for tagging this and opening it up for debate--as a fairly new user, the disappearance of the article kept me puzzled for a few days until I learned to check the deletion log...thus, if deleted, it will be necessary to tag/protect/redirect/whatever the article so it doesn't get recreated endlessly. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatr67_a209.html" title="User:Katr67">Katr67</a> 23:27, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

There are a lot of anonymous editors posting vanity entries on these lists, from what I've seen on List of bands from Oregon, and it makes it difficult to maintain. That same list now has dubious genre categories and isn't alphabetised. This process of reaching consensus through formal nomination is a good thing, though. I like the idea of lists of (whomever) from (wherever), but all the anonymous vanity edits on these lists are annoying. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittle_Otik_3998.html" title="User:Little Otik">little otik</a> 01:45, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
