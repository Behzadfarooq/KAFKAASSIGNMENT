<dd>She's having a third baby... this makes her notable? It suggests to me that the tabloid newspaper in question was having a slow news day. And you miss the point about the BBC; companies often put profiles of their employees on their own Web pages — that isn't a sign of notability.<br />
Note that I'm not trying to do her down; I'm sure that she's an excellent person, good at what is doubtless an interesting job, pleasant to be with, a good mother, and so on. I'd very likely rather spend an evening in her company than in that of most of the people with Wikipedia articles. But can you imagine any other encyclopædia having an article on here? The <i>Britannica</i>? The <i>Chambers</i>? <i>Encarta</i> even?

<ul>
<li>Right, but <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says the sources must be <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>. <i>Qua re</i> if the worst of the British tabloids qualify. Anyway, the article in The News Letter is the only one that is longer than a mere blurb (a trivial mention), so the multiple requirement still wouldn't be satisfied. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 04:23, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not true. <i>The News Letter</i> is more than a "blurb" or "trivial mention" as the free preview shows 262 of 1,759 characters. Plus <i>The Daily Mirror</i> article is also more than a "blurb" with that free preview showing 94 out of 677 characters, and the <i>Fresh Magazine</i> article is even more than both. And <i>The People</i> is still a published work satisfing WP:BIO notability guildlines - "The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. This criterion includes published works <b>in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles</b>, books, scholarly papers, and television documentaries except for the following: Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that just mention the person in passing, telephone directory listings, or simple records of births and deaths." Whether it's a tabloid or not, it's still a published work. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 04:37, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Right, the <i>News Letter</i> is the only source of any length for this. 677 characters is under a hundred words. <i>Fresh</i> magazine is put out by the Health Promotion Agency and its brief interview was about her childrens' eating and exercise habits. And you are ignoring the part of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> that says that the sources must be reliable. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 13:28, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are confirming that the <i>News Letter</i> article is more than "just mention[ing] the person in passing." 100 words is well beyond "mentioning in passing". And the <i>Fresh Magazine</i> is a published work under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and doesn't fall under any of the "exceptions". Who publishes the magazine is irrelevant as the "source is independent of the person." As for the reliable sources, that refers to accuracy of content, not notability. If the National Enquirer writes several article about someone, that someone is notable, no matter how light weight the articles are. And there are two new published works from the national charity <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodland_Trust_0154.html" title="Woodland Trust">Woodland Trust</a> that are primarily about her <a href="http://www.treeforall.org.uk/NorthernIreland/News/Autumnwatch+with+Angie.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.treeforall.org.uk/NorthernIreland/News/Autumnwatch+with+Angie.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a><a href="http://www.treeforall.org.uk/NorthernIreland/News/CelebritySupporters/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.treeforall.org.uk/NorthernIreland/News/CelebritySupporters/" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.

<ul>
<li>I confirmed it in my first post and in each subsequent post. The problem is we still don't have multiple articles of which she is the subject that are longer than blurbs (and yes, 100 words is just a blurb). The Fresh magazine piece is just one in which she, along with other minor celebrities are asked questions about their children's diets. A typical example is "Do your children like fruit and veg.?" It doesn't provide any information about her. Honestly, how are we supposed to use that as a source to write the article: "Angie Philllips, whose children like fruit and veg., is a weather presenter for the BBC"? The Woodland Trust pieces similarly do not talk about her, but contain quotes from her in support of its mission. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 19:07, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks for the confirmation of the confirmation&#160;:). A 100-word peice, whether someone labels it a "blurb" or not, is beyond <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s "passing mention." Even if you feel like excluding all three of <i>The People</i> articles about her, plus the <i>Fresh Magazine</i> and the Woodland Trust articles, there's still two published works (i.e. "multiple") cited that are primarily about the subject.--<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 21:24, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, sources are supposed to be reliable — but more importantly, many of those sources are saying no more about her than that she had a third baby... If this were an article about someone notable for having three babies(!) then I suppose that those sources would provide verifiability and notability. Any presenter on local radio or television is likely to have been the subject of mini-article in newspapers on slow news days (I've been the subject of a couple — one in the <i>Times</i>, one in the <i>New Statesman</i>, because even academics get this sort of thing — should there be an article on me? Articles on academics are constantly being deleted on grounds on=f non-notability, because it's deemed that what they've done doesn't raise them sufficiently above their peers. Apparently they don't need to have written a successful book, just had an artcile about their child-bearing capabilities in the <i>Sun</i>); are we to have articles on every such person? They're not even micro-celebrities. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 09:01, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe there should be an article on you, Mel.&#160;:) (unless your real name is different, you didn't come up on a G-news Archives search like Angie Phillips did several times). Articles on academics are also constantly being kept because they pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. But you're missing the point. WP:BIO is passed here. Whether an editor is assuming a news outlet is "having a slow news day" is irrelevent. How do you know that major events weren't occuring on those days anyway? It's 100% speculation and that is in no way a basis for deciding if a subject is notable. And as stated above, even if you feel like discounting 3 of the published works about Angie Phillips you don't like, there's still 2 more non-trivial published works about her that are not just "passing mentions". --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 10:11, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I do come up (my real name is a dark and deadly secret, known to a very few...). The point is, though, that those articles on me wouldn't demonstrate my notability (and neither or them was a passing mention). Note also that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> only offers guidelines; editors are free to delete an article that meets the criteria there, and to keep an article that doesn't. (And I wasn't saying that my belief that it must have been a slow news day was grounds for ignoring it, incidentally.) Do you think that she's more notable than all the other presenters, newsreaders, weather-reporters, <i>et al.</i>? If not, should we have an article on each of them? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 16:42, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But the primary criteria of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is met. If you want to arbitrarily ignore official policy guidelines on specific subjects you don't like, well, editors are free to have their opinion, but that's not in line with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> or WP:BIO, with the exception of <a href="../../../i/g/n/WP%7EIGNORE_187e.html" title="WP:IGNORE">WP:IGNORE</a> of course. And many news anchor persons and weather reporters/metorologists do have their own articles when they fit the notability criterion. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 18:15, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding the UK press there is widespread acceptance that publications such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a> are reliable, while <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sun_e3a1.html" title="The Sun">The Sun</a> isn't.

<dd>I'm just confused. Do you feel that if this person is the subject of an article in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Mirror_3a22.html" title="The Daily Mirror">The Daily Mirror</a> which has a circulation of over 4 million, that doesn't make the person notable?

<dl>
<dd>Have a look at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, notability isn't newsworthiness and sources must be reliable. Tabloid journalism doesn't, in my view, qualify. 23:23, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But if someone is the subject of multiple non trivial published works, whether it's from a tabloid or not, they qualify as notable under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. If a extemely popular tabloid-like newspaper such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Mirror_3a22.html" title="The Daily Mirror">The Daily Mirror</a> has an article about her, she's notable per WP:BIO. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 23:28, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In the second paragraph of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> it very clearly states that sources must be <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>. According to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> a reliable secondary source is "the informed and expert interpretation, interpolation, extrapolation or corroboration of primary sources to synthesize a conclusion".

<dd>Oakshade seems to be arguing that being in a tabloid isn't <i>evidence</i> of notability, it <i>creates</i> notability (or else I don't see the relevance of the circulation figure, popularity, etc.).--<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 23:51, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It's evidence of notability. And that she's the subject of a published work from a newspaper with circulation of over 4 million per day is irrelevant?? Sorry, but it's VERY relevant. That the editors of a newspaper that millions of people read every day chose to run a story about this subject is not only <i>evidence</i> of notability, but <u>strong evidence</u>. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 00:00, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
