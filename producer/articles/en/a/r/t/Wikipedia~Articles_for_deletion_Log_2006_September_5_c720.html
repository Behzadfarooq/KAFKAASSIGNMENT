<li>GridNetworks is a new consumer content application that does have value for discussion on WikiPedia. We will be launching rather largely in the next 4-6 weeks with some very large name brand customers. Users of the wiki will be looking not only for information, but a discussion. We created the stubs on the wiki, and hope that the community interest will drive the content to be a truly neutral. As it is, I posted the most neutral information I could find to start the discussion. In no way do we plan to abuse, or would we want to abuse the wiki. We are pretty enthusiastic supporters of the Wiki, and personally I feel this adds value, but I might be biased. However, at some point, users WILL be making entries for this company and product, why not let the otherwise neutral stubs just stay for the meantime till the discussion gets going? Thank you for your time on this matter. We want to drive traffic to the Wiki from the beginning of the launch. Us, as a company, likely will never add content to the stubs again, now that they have at least been seeded with basic information. Nerolabs 00:26, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>a question</b>. This is a major business hub for the capital of a state. That seems notable, in and of itself. The sad thing (for me) is that most US cities really only have malls as their business centers. If we have a stricter policy on **malls than on pre-automobile forms of urban spaces, we automatically close off Wikipedia to huge areas of commercial life in a major country (the USA). We allow, even encourage, articles on neighborhoods, see the article on <a href="../../../u/p/t/Uptown%2C_Chicago_082f.html" title="Uptown, Chicago">Uptown, Chicago</a> for example, but should recognize that many places in the US are no longer built with residential-commerical mixes. It seems to me that the Mall of Louisiana is at least as important as Uptown, where I live, and certainly more so than (to take a random example) <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grant_Park%2C_Illinois_d408.html" title="Grant Park, Illinois">Grant Park, Illinois</a>, a tiny place of 1,000 people which I've never seen but which merits its own Wikipedia article. My <b>question</b> is what could Wiki-writers do to make the Mall of Lousiana wiki-worthy? Would adding information on the architects make a difference? To me, it seems the writers have made a good-faith start on this article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think any general category is inherently notable or non-notable. Notability depends on at least two things: the connections an encyclopedia entry has with the rest of the world and the size/exclusiveness of the encyclopidia. Certainly there are malls that are as notable as, to give the same example, my Chicago neighborhood of <a href="../../../u/p/t/Uptown%2C_Chicago_082f.html" title="Uptown, Chicago">Uptown</a>. Here, we have a major mall in the capital of a state (connections with the world) and a huge encyclopedia with room for all kinds of entries on fairly obscure people, places and things (size/exclusiveness). Again, I'm no fan of malls; in fact, I really dislike them. Despite that, I think that this article serves the purpose of a stub for an imporant part of the commercial life of a state capital. It certainly needs <b>expansion</b> to demonstrate this importance and also <b>re-writing</b> to make it less of a business directory. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Interlingua_69c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Interlingua">email</a></sup> 23:35, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b>. Malls as collections of chain stores are most definetly NN. We dont have an article on every Macy's or Target store in the United States, so why should we have one simply because a collection of these stores are in the same location?

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree that we don't want Wikipedia cluttered with all kinds of short articles about tiny malls. But I don't think that this is what the Mall of Lousiana is. As for it's importance, I wrote "This is a major business hub for <b>the capital of</b> a state", not that it was a hub for the entire state. I agree that the business directory aspect of this article is inappropriate and show be replaced with a link to the mall's official website. Nonetheless, the number of businesses there would, if located in a conventional downtown business zone, warrant a stand-alone article. I think that we shouldn't dismiss such an article simply because these businesses are present not in a downtown but in a mall (as much as I personally dislike malls). Wikipedia policy on corporations is only obliquely relevant to malls. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> has no mention of malls and is focuses much more on individual companies. I think that Wikipedia policy on schools <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> might be more relevant to the discussion of malls. "Schools are frequently important to their communities, and are often the subject of the sort of non-trivial published works that are needed to complete an article. Wikipedia articles about schools should show that there <b>is</b>, or that there <b>is likely to be</b>, sufficient coverage of that school to allow for the creation of a complete article". Malls, similarly are important to their communities, and we ought not insist that <b>right now</b> there is "sufficient coverage", only that there is likely to be such coverage. And I think that with a mall like this one, such coverage is quite likely in the future. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Interlingua_69c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Interlingua">email</a></sup> 23:35, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> (regrettably) It is a fairly trivial example of the coin problem, and I would prefer to have it renamed, but there do appear to be quite a lot of places other than Mathworld where this probelm is discussed under the name 'McNugget numbers'. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmath789_8910.html" title="User:Madmath789">Madmath789</a> 06:48, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Although <i>Irving</i> above seems a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, do we <i>really</i> need to re-edit this article every time McDonalds changes their options? Perhaps, if the article is kept, we should refer only to the Orginal McNugget numbers and note that the numbers are subject to change at McDonalds' whim.

<li><b>Merge</b>. Actually, I am now inclined to merge into <a href="../../../c/o/i/Coin_problem.html" title="Coin problem">coin problem</a>. I don't think Irving's really trying to present some "classical" McNugget problem, although he may have been inspired by, say, Usenet. If you look through the book (look inside the book on Amazon), he keeps modifying the problem, even getting a Happy Meal and McNugget problem in the process. There is even a section of the book called "Congruence classes and McNuggets". I think it's fair to say he sees it as a good illustration of the more general Frobenius coin problem, but I think he's doing it more to be cute rather than because it's some classical, wide-spread, common, etc. way to present the problem. So I would take his adoption of this form with a grain of salt. BTW, you can now get 10 piece McNuggets, and the 9 piece is no longer offered. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 08:11, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

And I wasn't trying to suggest that the inclusion of the example in Irving's book implies that the problem is classical, but it certainly is a well-known variant of this sort of thing.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Hannah appears to be a pretty well known historian of theology; his 2001 book <i>Our Legacy: The History of Christian Doctrine</i> ranks #205,430 on Amazon, which is pretty good for a 5 year old hardcover - perhaps because certain colleges use it as a textbook - for instance, see <a href="http://www.rmbc.edu/documents/Fall2006TextbookList.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.rmbc.edu/documents/Fall2006TextbookList.pdf" rel="nofollow">here, under 'TH4005'</a>. His charts of church history are distributed by <a href="../../../z/o/n/Zondervan.html" title="Zondervan">Zondervan</a>, which is one of the top religious publishers in the US. "John D. Hannah" get 180 unique Google hits, and almost all of them are him - I wouldn't call that bad for an academic in a backwater discipline. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 05:12, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

I think perhaps he should try to do a little more research before trying to AFD these.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Actually they are all created by the same user, tied to the same school, and none of them assert notablity. I could care less if the article is kept or not. But if you vote keep, and make a comment such as you did, add to it, clean it up, and demonstrate it is worth keeping. As of now its still sloppy, ill-sourced, and of dubious notablity. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 06:25, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> AfD is not beauty school for articles. It's not our job to clean them up and this is not the proper venue to pursue that. They should be appropriately tagged with your concerns left on the article's talk page or with the article. John Hannah is a well known evangelical author who's work is used as text in many accrediated Bible schools. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 07:15, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. But we have to be careful which academics we include and which we don't--there's a lot of profs on here with 6 books who no one would dream of deleting. But few of those teach at Dallas Theological Seminary.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 08:00, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> While, as I said above, Amazon Sales Rank is a poor test for book significance, the research above seems to have found the second best seller, not the best seller, which is currently at 122,000 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Our-Legacy-History-Christian-Doctrine/dp/1576832643/sr=1-1/qid=1157634225/ref=sr_1_1/103-1109842-7846211?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Our-Legacy-History-Christian-Doctrine/dp/1576832643/sr=1-1/qid=1157634225/ref=sr_1_1/103-1109842-7846211?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. For a hardcover academic work, that is a high sales rank. Either it is fairly popular, or (as ssaid already above), it is a frequently used college text book. Per the proposed <a href="../../../b/o/o/WP%7EBOOKS_edbc.html" title="WP:BOOKS">WP:BOOKS</a>, that would make an article on the book worth keeping. If he has written books worth keeping an article on, we should keep the article on him. At least one of the prior comments seems to indicate that Dallas Theological Seminary is a low prominence institution. In fields like Math, English Literature, etc.. that is true, but then seminaries don't focus on non-religious subjects. In Theologoical studies, which is the relevant field, it is more prominent than places like Harvard that have abandoned their origin and relegated the religious departments to a backwater. I believe DTS should be evaluated as being in the top tier of U.S. colleges/universities when evaluating theological studies. They are "the academic center of Christian dispensationalism." The <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> multiple independent review test is met; he has enough published books, each with at least one or two independent reviews, to meet the test. <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> says "An academic who has published ..., a widely-used textbook, ... is likely to be notable as an author (see WP:BIO), regardless of their academic achievements." So I evaluate as passing <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (a guideline) and <a href="../../../b/o/o/WP%7EBOOK_b369.html" title="WP:BOOK">WP:BOOK</a> (a proposed guideline) and <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> (a proposed guideline) being irrelevant by its own language. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 13:26, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. He's more than the generic professor as he's published a considerable number of (admittedly rather shoddy or suspect) books. But the generic professor does less than this: he publishes his PhD dissertation and then a couple of more articles before he retires. He's also been the chairman of a department for decades, although in a seminary with no more than 1,900 students (and perhaps some/many of those not full time) this isn't the same thing as being chair at Harvard or the Sorbonne. I don't think I'd have many points of agreement with Mr. Hannah, but the aricle is 1) verifiable and verified, 2) NPOV, and 3) notable in the world of conservative evangelicals. He is NOT notable in <b>my</b> world of secular, ecumenical humanists, but that is not a requirement for inclusion in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Interlingua_69c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Interlingua">email</a></sup> 23:48, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Further Comment</b> Havn't finished the sourcing yet but i'm curious about the charge of "tracts/books of unkown dubious publishing". So far the book publishers i'm come across are <b>W Publishing Group</b>, <b>Integrity Publishers</b>, <b>B C M Publications</b> and <b>DJ Publications</b>. The dual claims of dubious publishing combined with sourcing not offered confuses me. Without the sourcing how was it evident the publishers were of dubious origin?

<dd><b>Comment</b> I removed the strike since you have no reason to invalidate my vote. The admin who decides on the close can give whatever weight to my thoughts as he/she shall choose. At the risk of being uncivil, I will say that the logic you are using is quite infantile. If your mouse has the capability of moving to click on the user contribution tab you will see that I've commented on many AfD in the past. (And tend to vote delete more often then not) Just because <i>yours</i> happens to be the ones that tickle my fancy today does not mean that I'm targetting these AfD. My brother and parents were huge Fundies and while I don't share that persuasion, I'm mindful of those for and against the fundamentalist bent. So, these Afds peaked my interest--namely because they're so laughably notable and the theme of the AfDs so apparent. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 10:18, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). There are good and valid arguments for deletion here, but arguments have been presented by Mikka among others that we have a number of other lists which bundle together topics related to a particular subject and that the list might be useful for navigation.

<dd>"well-defined", as opposed to "indiscriminate collection" is a fact, not POV: it is list of topics that discuss Russian language. It does not include porn stars, gay rights, pokemon and other popular topics. "no cleanup necessary": if a cleanup is necessary, please explain which exactly. I may be wrong here, but still I don't see why it must be "severe". Are you going to delete 5/7 of entries? In summary, yes, my POV is better, because I can argument for it. And it is not an accusation, but a statement of fact: "unnecessary" <b>is</b> a POV, not an argument. The voter who thinks it is "unnecessary" <b>must</b> provide arguments by which rules there is "no need for such list", out of simple courtesy to fellow wikipedians. We are not discussing deletion of a vanity page here. Lists are tools for search information. And like I said, we have hundreds of them.

<dd>Actually, the reasons for there being no need have already been listed in the nomination. Your POV is not better than others. Your comparative examples are poor ones because they're lists of (arguably) non-notable trivia while the argument against this article is that it is not a "structured list." Linguistics pages that mention/should mention Russian is not a well-defined or discrete topic. Why, for example, are <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alveolar_trill.html" title="Alveolar trill">alveolar trill</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiceless_velar_fricative.html" title="Voiceless velar fricative">voiceless velar fricative</a> listed but not any of the other phonemes?</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> At the risk of getting my head bitten off, surely the place for the fact that (for example) Russian is a stress-timed language is in the article on stress-timed languages (which it already is) and the article on the language itself (which it doesn't appear to be). While the argument that "other equally large lists already exist" doesn't really get us anywhere (they might simply exist because nobody's got around to nominating them here yet), I'd argue that the difference would be that the articles linked in that list actually talk about "archaeology" or "mathematics" or whatever else it's a list of. When this list links exclusively to pages which mention the word "Russian" or "Russian Language", it might - and I do stress <i>might</i> - be a useful analogy. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 07:52, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I suggest you to <i>try</i> to count the number of pages that mention the word <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a> before jumping to weird analogies. For all others: precisely because "Rus Lang" page is linked to countless articles that say <b>nothing</b> about the language this list is highly useful: it points to <b>linguistics pages</b>, in other words, it is not "an indiscriminate collection". (Of course, you are free to maintain that "Linguistics" itself is an indiscriminate collection. &lt;Shrug&gt;.)`'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 07:57, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What I meant was that not all of the articles <i>on this list here</i> mention Russian. This is admitted on the list itself and is (I would suggest) not the case in the other "List of X Topics" lists, which presumably link only to articles which <i>do</i> mention "archaeology", "mathematics", "dog-breeding" or whatever value X has. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 08:59, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is a list of articles that discuss peculiarities of Russian language, period. When, say, the artile Mondegreens in Russian language will be written and placed into <a href="../../../r/u/s/Category%7ERussian_language_911a.html" title="Category:Russian language">category:Russian language</a>, then the entry "*<a href="../../../m/o/n/Mondegreen.html" title="Mondegreen">Mondegreen</a>" may be deleted from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Russian_language_topics_d9b3.html" title="List of Russian language topics">List of Russian language topics</a>. When the list becomes empty, I swear delete it myself (I pledge to delete it even earlier: when it will contain less than 6 items). `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 15:24, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In that case, why not move this to a subpage of your userpage for your own reference? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 21:34, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Because this is a <i>reference</i>, not "my own reference".

<ul>
<li>Fair cop, but might it be a valid suggestion in case the list <i>does</i> get deleted? It seems as though you're saying that the list serves two purposes - it can provide links to topics connected in various ways to Russian and it can remind you (or another user who's interested in doing the same thing) to create articles about "X in Russian". I would respectfully suggest that if it's deemed to be unencyclopedic to do the former, userfication would make a lot of sense to achieve the latter. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 22:08, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually this discussion gave me an idea how to make this list into something "bullet-proof" against deletionists. And such lists wil be useful for other languages as well. My observation (which triggerred the creation of this hapless list) is that it is nearly impossible to quiclky find out whether a particular feature exist in the language. For example, is Russian an <a href="../../../a/g/g/Agglutinative_language.html" title="Agglutinative language">agglutinative language</a>? The corresponding article gives "examples" of languages only, and it may well be that Russian is agglutinative, but simply was not among handpicked examples. Further, if it is not agglutinative, then which kind is it? Luckily, there sits the {{<a href="../../../l/i/n/Template%7ELinguistic_typology_topics_a47c.html" title="Template:Linguistic typology topics">Linguistic typology topics</a>}} template, and I can try and find Russian language in articles from the same category. OK here we go: it turns out it is <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synthetic_language.html" title="Synthetic language">synthetic language</a>. But is it fusional or olygosynthetic (listed as subcategoeries in the template)? Dunno. Stuck. And this problem is especially acute with more obscure topics, such as does Russian have <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequentative.html" title="Frequentative">frequentatives</a>? Right now I noticed that <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_grammar.html" title="Russian grammar">Russian grammar</a> article has a statement that there is no <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nominative_absolute.html" title="Nominative absolute">Nominative absolute</a> it modern Russian, which is false. My list is an attempt to add some search structure to the chaotic presentation of linguistic topics. And here come some deletionists who cannot tell ablaut from umlaut and tell me that this list is useless. Of course you don't need it when you write pokemon articles. Just take a look into the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_songs_7fe6.html" title="Category:Lists of songs">category:Lists of songs</a>. How much effort is put into this songcruft, and all are happy. But my list useful for searches in a serious topic somehow makes someone sleepless. Sheesh! `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 00:21, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I disagree, because it is notable. The artist has finished a substantial amount of high-quality work, and just because she isn't in magazines yet, doesn't mean that her work should be discredited.

<p>I speedy-tagged (A7) Philip R Chandler for no assertion of notability. I discovered this page was created after my user page was vandalized by the article creator, but as assertions of notability were now made (supposedly the founder of <a href="../../../m/e/d/MediaLens_1a34.html" title="MediaLens">MediaLens</a>), I let it go with an autobiography tag (edits were made by anonymous users, User:Pjchandler, and User:Philchandler). Upon some investigation however, I discovered that google searches for "Philip Chandler" and "MediaLens" turned up mostly Wikipedia mirror sites. The book Beyond Positive Thinking is not listed on Amazon or any other major bookseller that I can find.

<li>I see that my article has been requested for deletion. I took a look at some of the users who requested this, and I saw college students, computer programmers, and writers, but nowhere did I see anyone that seemed to have actual experience on any aerial circus apparatus. I did not see any indication that ANY of these people would know anything about aerial circus arts other than what they type into a search engine and find. Plus I added the link to the "Aerial Tissu" page to provide people with more opportunities to see and learn more about tissu and all the other apparatus, and my expansion was deleted. If this is an encyclopedia that is available to people on the web to expand their knowledge I do not see why there shouldn't be a dozen links to aerialists' pages to give a wide variety of what is really out there instead of giving one link leading to one website. Being an aerialist that has trained for several years and worked hard I have never come across any information that says the one link that is available on the "Aerial Tissu" article should be crowned the best representation of aerialists and be the only one offered on Wikipedia. If I've missed that announcement I'd love to get that memo. The website that is linked to the article leads to a good aerialist, but there are more professionals out there describing this topic, and the more available links that are listed on Wikipedia, the more rounded a persons understanding of that topic can be. So if my article is going to be deleted, it better be because someone with SOME kind of aerial training, background, and knowledge tells Wikipedia that my descriptions of the apparatus are not accurate, and the photos and video that are provided are falsely representing aerial circus apparatus. It should not be deleted because some young college student and computer programmer, with NO first hand experience in the circus world, have too much time on their hands. <small><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/e/r/User%7EAerialShowgirls_5fa7.html" title="User:AerialShowgirls">AerialShowgirls</a> (<a href="../../../a/e/r/User_talk%7EAerialShowgirls_f2d3.html" title="User talk:AerialShowgirls">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AerialShowgirls_15bd.html" title="Special:Contributions/AerialShowgirls">contribs</a>).</small></small>
<ul>
<li>The reason why your article is getting deleted is not because of experience or lack thereof in the circus world. It is a simple case of notability (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>). Also your article can be seen as advertising, which is inappropriate on Wikipedia. In fact, I find your claim that your article should only be judged by people who themselves have experience in the circus world amazing. There is nothing stopping anyone from writing, or criticising, an article about something they don't have first-hand experience of themselves. All that is required is an understanding of Wikipedia's rules and policies. If I were to write an article about myself, should I forbid anyone who is not a 20-something Finnish male computer programmer from saying anything about it? Of course not. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 11:26, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>Then perhaps the article "Aerial Tissu" should be edited, and the link to www.aerialexperience.com should be removed too because when you click on that link, in the first paragraph it says, "From the meeting room to the stadium, aerial tissu is an emotionally moving act utilized with great success to entertain audiences. <b>Perfect as a part of a symphony orchestra presentation, corporate meeting, tradeshow, sporting event or television production this creative aerial ballet can help to make a strong statement <i>for your product and your company</i>.</b>" Sounds like a suggestion to hire someone...like an advertisement. If that is not considered advertising than how is my article different when I offer a brief description of several aerial apparatus and present a link leading to more images and in-depth descriptions just as the article "Aerial Tissu" has? Plus, I was not saying that I think your lack of knowledge in circus should cancel your opinion. I was saying I think your lack of circus knowledge is <b>limiting</b> in deciding that one website deserves to be available as a link, but not another. Plus like I said before, why shouldn't there be at least a dozen links to aerialists' websites to provide the most accurate representation of Aerialists and the performance art itself. Any beginning aerialist is going to search online a lot to see photos and video of other aerialists to see the different styles and latest moves so they have something to aspire towards. I know this because I've been there searching myself when I was a beginner, and many of the students I teach are doing this now. Therefor having more info. available instead of less on an encyclopedia, in my opinion seems like a smart idea. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/e/r/User%7EAerialShowgirls_5fa7.html" title="User:AerialShowgirls">AerialShowgirls</a> (<a href="../../../a/e/r/User_talk%7EAerialShowgirls_f2d3.html" title="User talk:AerialShowgirls">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AerialShowgirls_15bd.html" title="Special:Contributions/AerialShowgirls">contribs</a>).</small></p>

Mystic Nation is a trademark and the material is copywritten into history. The band owns the trademark, is a member of ASCAP and has international distribution. As far as notability, two of the band members were nominated for a Grammy in 2000, much of the historical record has not yet been uploaded, venturing into wikipedia seems a sticky subject, if there is a better way to present history and fact, not sensationalism, please explain. This page is only here to represent a group of musicians, a historical truth and basically the fact they have been performing all along with groups already existing on wikipedia:<br />

<li><b>Delete all</b> science misconception articles per AFDs of Physics and Chemistry misconceptions. The choice of misconceptions to explain on the articles is inherently POV.

<li>What I meant was the misconceptions and their explanations are sourced and therefore not POV, but the <i>choice</i> of misconceptions discussed is, as there must be hundreds of science-related misconceptions, ranging from trivial to degree level science. It is POV to decide which deserve a place on this article and which do not. <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolerat_5815.html" title="User:Molerat">Molerat</a> 13:08, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Fortunately, no such decision is necessary - you can include all that have reliable sources. Apart from which, it is essentially impossible to argue that choosing what to include and what to exclude from an article is so inherently POV that the article should be deleted - <i>every single article</i> does this. The article on <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> doesn't discuss everything that's verifiable that's ever happened there, but that's a featured article. If this was well sourced it'd certainly be encyclopaedic and verifiable, which would necessitate a keep argument. Here, it ain't though. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:24, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"If it's sourced, it's not POV at all" is just not true. If I started an article called Why Tom Cruise is a moron, it would obviously be inherently POV, even if I got copious amounts of sources for people stating words to that effect. The similar problem here is that "misconception" can be just as much a matter of opinion. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 13:19, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you had copious reliable sources about Tom Cruise being a moron, you should be able to make an encyclopaedic article. <i>Everything</i> in the whole shebang we call Wikipedia is just someone's opinion - please read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> before accusing it of saying something it doesn't. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:24, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

The "inherently" part stems from the opinionated title and premise of the article - I thought I'd made that painfully obvious, but I guess not. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 13:42, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Given that neither the title nor the premise are <i>inherently</i> opinionated, it'd pretty hard for it to be obvious. I'm sure if someone were so inclined, they could write an excellent article on the exact subject using nothing but articles from peer-reviewed journals. Whilst the title might omit some implicit qualifier like <i>common</i> to suggest the entire content of the article needs to be in the title is a bit excessive. This article is at the title it should be per <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a>, being at the most common name for the subject in english - along with all sorts of other articles like <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> or <a href="../../../w/o/u/Wounded_Knee_Massacre_5f79.html" title="Wounded Knee Massacre">Wounded Knee Massacre</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:48, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am also sure that an article called Why Tom Cruise is a moron would be deleted as an attack page and not for being <i>inherently</i> POV. Since this is not an attack page it is an apples and oragnes comparasion. You need a better example than that. I also have a question.

If those "references" at the bottom really are related to anything in the article (I hesitate to call it an article; it is an essay), there's no way to tell.

<p>What do you have against Jewish Holiday traditions? I keep adding everything I know about Yenta Claus and related characters even though they have Wikipedia entries of their own that ignore her. I will post the Yenta Claus "book" online for you and everyone else to read as I didn't know notable meant the necessity of materials being on the internet. I am probably wrong here, but I thought the reason Wikipedia invited new material was because the mission was to get info useful to readers on the net and that Wikipedia was paperless, with millions of entries and thus open to niche topics. Wait until December, Yenta Claus, Bubbe and Harry et. al. will be all over the net, blogs and relevant cultural sites as well as the off line world in mostly urban areas and I bet Israel too. Last year Blooms book, out of print at the time was fetching over $1000 on Amazon and I know it for a fact because I couldn't afford to get my hands on a copy. Now if Hanukkah Harry gets a stub entry and Chrismukkah get a full status entry and so does Santa Claus, why pick on Yenta Claus for exclusion? I made it a stub and asked for help in dressing up the article as well as expanding it. This is my first attempt at not only a Wikipedia article, but writing an online article altogether. Cut me a little slack and be constructive rather than summarily dismissing the subject and my attempts to fill an online void. P.S. Isn't Santa Claus really a hoax or fantasy perpetuated upon children for every ones enjoyment and delight? Be nice to Yenta Claus and she will be nice to you too!&#160;:-) I thought you would be delighted to see this and was taken back at the blatant attempt to censor it. Well, maybe you will reconsider, after all you really didn't give it more than a moment to 2 as you set it for deletion minutes after it went up yesterday and after the first revision spent less time to sent it to the deletion tribunal. --68.41.86.146 19:01, 5 September 2006 (UTC) PS isnt almost everything around the holidays, including Santa as we know it compliments of Coka Cola ads of the 1930-70s, comercial. It is impossible not to link to comercial sites when writing about anything to do with giving toys or the way children get them around Christmas, Hanukkah and Chrismukkah.</p>

The standards you cite ought to result in the deletion of many many many articles I have read here.

No rant but really folks, real life is a very good source, ie published news articles, published speeches made by leaders and authorities in the field, actual books, commercial site offering the evidence of the existence of the topic. So are you saying you object to anything that does not smell of moth balls and was already predigested by academic types so one merely regurgitates second and third or more hand takes on dry toast material? Don't need Wikipedia if that is all it is, but you have Hanukkah Harry? And so much totally weird stuff? You propose to censor what is offered to the public, an inside scoop, the real thing with cites of real people doing and writing and saying what amounts to a cultural phenomena and you vote to delete? Apparently because the citations and links do not lead you to stuff that sits that has been around so long it is already dusted over on times shelves? Well, I may pull it off totally befre you delete it and write about how you young folk barely out of school with little real life under your belt think you qualify as experts in censorship.--68.41.86.146 22:52, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK rather than summarily vote to delete something as wonderful as yenta Claus, and since you all apparently have the time to sit in judgement over so much information that undoubtedly is tossed up, I ask for the sake of discussion that you, for the moment only, assume that Yenta Claus is a worthy subject, critique my work from that vantage. In other words, tell me how to win. Not to worry, even if you tell, if I can't deliver than I'll at least understand. I think I get the drift here but being that we have a generation gap and I can, thought rarely will admit to remembering, fondly remembering, rotary phones and party lines. Ha! Now those are subjects dusty enough to be included? Yes? So the future will know of it? And I remember the first TV and the first orbiting satellite Sputnik. There write about the Space Race wars and haw us kids watched the night sky to see a Soviet glowing ball of steel float over the night sky several times every clear night. OK, tell me what you consider the type of sources I need and I may just be able to float a few your way and then maybe not but at least you will have "communicated" and perhaps I'll write about a few patents, a religion based upon faith in life and how a trial lawyer save tens of thousands of lives with one lawsuit and did it all pro bono. Really, do give Yenta Claus the chance anything that cool deserves by just giving up the details your summary dismissals hint but do not reveal to those who were born before the Internet.--68.41.86.146 23:09, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

The Wikipedians, those people with deep inside knowledge into how Wikipedia works (like policy debates or advanced syntax), do more edits by number, but those edits are also often just structural or syntactical changes to content “non-Wikipedians” provided.</p>
<p>Frankly, all of this makes perfect sense (expert knowledge on such a wide array of topics must be widely distributed among different people, too, and won’t be contained within a group of say 500 Wikipedians), but it also shows that Wikipedia will only remain healthy if it keeps trusting outsiders." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/h/i/User%7EBhires_b1ef.html" title="User:Bhires">Bhires</a> (<a href="../../../b/h/i/User_talk%7EBhires_1f42.html" title="User talk:Bhires">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bhires_c8e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bhires">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><s><b>delete</b></s> There are no Ghits (out of 32 unique hits for "Yenta claus") outside the company, its products, and greeting cards, and a private individual using tripod.com, so it appears to be all <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. The owners probably would have not been able to register such a company name had it been a <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generic.html" title="Generic">generic</a> term. However, if Yenta claus brings me something for Chrismukka, I might just reconsider&#160;;-). The article appears to be a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Product_placement.html" title="Product placement">product placement</a>, written in such a way as to subtly introduce an apparently unknown company and its products, and so violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a soapbox. Wiki does indeed have a conservative bias, but is not censored, so whether the editors collectively "like" or "dislike" the article would never be an issue. Unlike blogs which where people can write or rant about whatever trendy thing they like or dislike, wiki editors need to follow fundamental rules on verifiability, and unfortunately Blogs and chatroom fora are not considered reliable per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. As a result, Wiki may often miss grass-roots phenomena, which blogs and community sites pick up. Also, there are subject areas, cultures, countries which have a low web presence/penetration, wiki editors would tend to err on the side of caution when no sources (on-line or otherwise) are cited. Often, the deletion debate results in articles found which may sway the deletion panel. The simple fact is that a well sourced and referenced article, documenting a well-known phenomenon, has a much better chance of being retained than one which does not do one or the other. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:22, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>User:ArmadilloFromHell added the "prod" template to the article Yenta claus, suggesting that it be deleted according to the proposed deletion process. All contributions are appreciated, but we don't believe it satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, and User:ArmadilloFromHell explained why in the deletion notice (see also Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not and Wikipedia:Notability). Please either work to improve the article if the topic is worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia, or, if you disagree, discuss the issues raised at Talk:Yenta claus. If you remove the "dated prod" template, the article will not be deleted, but note that it may still be sent to Wikipedia:Articles for deletion, where it may be deleted if consensus to delete is reached. — riana_dzasta wreak havoc|damage report 00:58, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

I read this on a Wiki user site: "This is what the inherent failure of wikipedia is. It's that there's a small set of content generators, a massive amount of wonks and twiddlers, and then a heaping amount of procedural whackjobs. And the mass of triddlers and procedural whackjobs means that the content generators stop being so and have to become content defenders. Woe be that your take on things is off from the majority. Even if you can prove something, you're now in the situation that anybody can change it. And while that's all great in a happy-go-lucky flower shower sort of way, it's when you realize that the people who are going to change it could have absolutely no experience with the subject whatsoever, then you see where we are." --<a href="../../../b/h/i/User%7EBhires_b1ef.html" title="User:Bhires">Bhires</a> 04:53, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

I am tired and feel a bit worn out by what I thought would be a positive and productive effort to what is clearly becoming 'not fun at all' and otherwise something I wouldn't ever do again, unless, possibly unless I was paid a significant amount for, turned into efforts to salvage my little but notable piece from an attack of the Langoliers as in the 1990 Steven King novel Four Past Midnight;</p>
<p>"If you've ever worked in a large company, one where not everyone's name is known by everyone else, you've bumped into these people, who don't know the thing the company makes very well, don't keep on top of new ideas beyond buzzwords, yet wield the kind of power where they can stop and start innovation and positive growth because they simply feel like it. It's pretty heartbreaking stuff and I hope a bunch of you never have to deal with it.</p>
<p>But thanks to Wikipedia, you can experience this on a daily basis! College students with too much free time deciding your subject matter is not worth reporting. Bizzare insight from strange lands telling you they didn't think your paragraph was relevant. And ever the bizzare need for a Neutral Point of View. Neutral Point of View is a doctrine about how Wikipedia articles should be written. Like wikipedia itself, it is a great idea in theory. In application, of course, it turns into yet another hammer for wonks and whackjobs to beat each other and innocent bystanders.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/h/i/User%7EBhires_b1ef.html" title="User:Bhires">Bhires</a> (<a href="../../../b/h/i/User_talk%7EBhires_1f42.html" title="User talk:Bhires">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bhires_c8e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bhires">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Wikipedia is a relatively new creation, but it already quite beset with the same problems that inhabit any self-styled intellectual collaboration. People make little empires, have their agendas, push through ideas and themes they want, and disregard and delete things they do not. The main difference between this and other similar academic environments is the pure speed at which stuff can happen; you can literately have 30-40 little editing nibbles on a page within a single day. If people are feeling frisky, it can take place in a few hours. This means that you get all the politics and turf war of Ivory Tower Academia without the mitigating barrier of time to cool down or consider. That is, you get a nice big mess." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/h/i/User%7EBhires_b1ef.html" title="User:Bhires">Bhires</a> (<a href="../../../b/h/i/User_talk%7EBhires_1f42.html" title="User talk:Bhires">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bhires_c8e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bhires">contribs</a>).</small></p>

I think less and less of it every time I login. It may be that some think so little of Wiki that they feel qualified to delete another’s work and project their own motivational issues upon others when ascribing opinions on intentions and efforts.</p>
<p>To have Baseball Baby, who ever that is, remove my discussion because of an apparent discomfort when criticism is too accurate citing a no personal attacks policy as censorship justification is one example of why I object to this exercise. It is a poorly organized effort. Well, you should know, my comments were not intended as personal though expressed with feelings of a real person, me. I usually avoid this kind of silliness, that is subjecting myself and work to critiques by people who don't have a clue about it nor its cultural context and may, possibly may, harbor resentments towards others, i.e. prejudices.</p>
<p>Yes it really bothers me to have you all nominate something I care about. I’d rather have never offered it than to have it shot down. It is doubly an offense that I don’t feel some here are truly qualified as gatekeepers. It would be different if someone here tried to be objective and contributed to an effort here rather than issue summary deletion attacks. Nevertheless, I agree to remove the entire article, something I have agreed to before but was actually prevented from doing.</p>
<p>BTW, for those who keep referring to me as a he and those who are impolite, not that it really matters, but I am a highly educated, successful, accomplished dual professional and a woman. Many of my accomplishments could easily rate for separate entries. Note: I am not interested in more notoriety than I have already received in life. I had my moments and do not need any more. See, I already have had two Wall Street Journal articles discussing me and my work, numerous TV news appearances, on the cover of magazines, hard copy not online, and featured in various news papers, print copy and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Note: I have read up on many of the contributions, citations in articles of minor note and personal pages of most here. I am happy some are ambitious and seek success and fame. I am impressed that some graduated college, and some have jobs or once had jobs and that some are heads of their own publishing companies, i.e. Boggs and online rant sites. A few even wrote articles about their experiences. However, it does appear to me that perhaps some of you though adults are fairly young, very close to the age of my son. Thus I should give you all a bit of slack, something not offered to contributers of content apparently, and tolerate the youthful approaches.</p>
<p>I would like to simply withdraw my article.</p>
<p>I have one other recommendation for the future, it would be wise to learn to be less judgmental about what the "world" may find of value. Clearly that Wiki lets people write articles about their High Schools, college records, amongst articles about companies that once employed them, and the like, all of which underscores Wiki's acceptance biases.</p>
<p>So, let's end this now. I elect to redact my article.--<a href="../../../b/h/i/User%7EBhires_b1ef.html" title="User:Bhires">Bhires</a> 15:27, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Conditional keep</b> I was asked to reconsider, so I took another look at the article, the changes <a href="../../../b/h/i/User%7EBhires_b1ef.html" title="User:Bhires">Bhires</a> has made to the article since the Afd opened, and his sources. Based on the changes, I think I can see where Bhires is going with this, and I'm willing to give him a chance to more fully develop the article. He's provided sources, expanded it a bit, and demonstrated that the term isn't a hoax, so why not? I agree with <a href="../../../r/i/a/User%7ERiana_dzasta_07ef.html" title="User:Riana dzasta">Riana dzasta</a> that it needs a serious copyedit and wikification, but that's not hard. My reasoning is that as Christmas and Hanukkah approach, there may be more references to Yenta Claus and more editors on this article, so let's wait until after the holidays to see what happens. It can always be renominated if it doesn't develop or expand, or if the term isn't in use this year. I think this may be the wrong time of year to judge notability as a neologism – a better method would be to wait until the time of year when the term is more likely to appear online and other places.

<p><b>RE: Suggestion</b> Point taken and I have adjusted my knickers. I was unfamiliar with the workings of the site at the time I began to write. It all started as I was researching the subject, found Hanukkah Harry and no Yenta Claus on Wiki and rather spontaneously, began writing for Wiki to fill what I preceived as an online void. Over the past few days, I think I have spent as much time learning the Wiki process and trying to make amends, as the time I spent trying to improve the contribution to address the concerns raised. I am truly a "newbie" here and hope my learning curve is short. &#160;:-)--<a href="../../../b/h/i/User%7EBhires_b1ef.html" title="User:Bhires">Bhires</a> 22:30, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> If she is indeed popping up on multiple independent sites that all say she is a Jewish Hanukkah character, why negate her? The article includes all known versions from a NPOV. I have read many wiki articles on obscure characters that are not deleted who have either no external referances or are merely claimed to exist in ancient manuscripts written on untranslated Arabic or simply referanced to a library, containing thousands of books, in a distant nonenglish speaking foreign country. At least we know Yenta Claus exists in multiple online communities. I have even read emails/blogs have written years ago where they write that they asked her for presents for Hanukkah. I think some here just might be a tiny bit too hasty in their dismissal of her. At least she should be allowed time up during the Holiday since she is a seasonal character and we are out of season now. Time will tell who was correct, but if she is deleted now, she may not reappear and Wiki will be out an objective stub and a valuable article. Do you really think come March when the referances fade off line in the off season someone will say, hey lets write about her for Wiki?

<dd><b>Comment</b> You said "Time will tell who was correct, but if she is deleted now, she may not reappear..." That's actually a key part of the Wikipedia philosophy. If an article is deleted and no other author comes along with the same idea, that means that "time has told" that it was appropriate to delete it. Also, if several individuals have independently come up with the name "Yenta Claus," it does not mean that there is any shared cultural concept that they are all referring to. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a>, a respected longtime contributor, has written <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">an excellent essay</a> that you may find helpful for explaining some of these issues. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> 16:03, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Thanks for the info linking Uncle G and I did read it and understand where you are coming from on this. In Yenta's favor, he did say things that would tend, at least somewhat support, keeping the Article as well. I see how people could easily vote either way. I just want a chance to better it. I am new here and am sorry to have put it up early and in such unfinished form. I saw many with less and thought it was going to be a colaboration of sorts not a rush to judgement. I appreciate many helpers and supporters and believe we will get morer contributers soon as the season is approaching and perhaps people from other groups, like Chrismukkah and such helping too. I did more research on both Christmas and Hanukkah characters ond observances and the internet discussions pretty much end in early Janurary and start up around late october to mid November or so. I do see her as a emerging and Notable character even if she is of interest to a smaller group and during a specific time of year. Uncle G seems to support these topics and cautions against subjectivity in deleting them because of this. I am tired and need to do something else for a while so my comments should be taken in that context and in both the words and in the spirit of <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">an excellent essay</a>. I just don't feel it is fair to dismisss the topic if it isn't of interest off season, like now I guess. I'll work more on her and Mrs. Claus later today or in the morning. I did find a very nice referance to the origin of <a href="../../../m/r/s/Mrs._Claus_b807.html" title="Mrs. Claus">Mrs. Claus</a> and added a bit to that very short and neglected article. I am beginning to adopt her as an interest of mine and I'll actively work to improve that entry too.

<li><b>Delete all</b> as this is hoax. Anime series on Wikipedia generally have at least 'some' Japanese text in them. At least original (japanese) name and character names, while this article doesnt even cites series title, even after saying this 'series' is restricted to Japan. For me, the fact that [AniDB.info AniDB] has nothing on Trissanju is reason enough that Trissanju is a hoax, but the fact there is nothing on google and no Japanese words just confirm it. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinhan_d563.html" title="User:Shinhan">Shinhan</a> 10:41, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Despite the grandiose claims, this isn't an NPO, it's a group of fans who enjoy colouring other people's work in. Now, I have nothing against colouring other people's work in -- it's one of the things I do for a living -- but I see nothing to suggest that the people who do it are important enough to fall within an encyclopedia's scope. It's possible that the activity of colouring in manga and illegally distributing the coloured version might deserve an article, as we have similar articles on other copyright-infringing activities like <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fansub.html" title="Fansub">fansubbing</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_translation.html" title="Fan translation">fan translation</a>, and <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanfic.html" title="Fanfic">fanfics</a>, but the individual groups involved in such things rarely merit dedicated articles. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 13:34, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, OK... but who/what is "Shuker" and when/where in 1988 did he make the statement attributed to him in this article? Maybe this is just a case of very lousy sourcing and citation... but personally I don's see a (sur?)name and a year as sourcing. It needs to be tied to an external source, or at least Wiki-linked so any other reader could figure out who made this statement, when, and in what context.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:01, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>... but gives no clue as to who that is. For all that we know, that could be simply a friend of the editor who wrote that (Clarehodder (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Clarehodder_627a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Clarehodder">contribs</a>)). (It's probably Roy Shuker, but the point stands: This isn't helpful to readers who don't <i>already</i> know of Roy Shuker.) <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:26, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's a standard citation style. While I'd never let a good article or featured article get away with it, it does cut the mustard at AfD, as far as I can tell. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:11, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is quibbling at this point, but it's only standard when you have a bibliography at some point in your work... regardless, I made the sourcing clear. That should take care of some of the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> problems.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:39, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, the sourcing is definitely much better now. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:43, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>No. As <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> points out it is not a citation. It's just <i>a pointer to</i> the actual citation, which in that style is located in a bibliography (or, in Wikipedia parlance, "References") section. See <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarvard_referencing_e866.html" title="Wikipedia:Harvard referencing">Wikipedia:Harvard referencing</a> for how this works. To cut the mustard at AFD the source must be locatable. "Shuker (1998)" really provides no information to someone who doesn't already know what the source is, because it's just a pointer to the actual citation, rather than the actual citation itself. It's only enough to locate the citation itself, not enough to locate what is actually being cited. The actual citation, giving the name of the author, title of the work, publisher, and so forth, was never added to the article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:00, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I don't think anyone is arguing deletion based on sourcing anymore, but a "citation" that doesn't actually tell you the source is more than "poorly written"... it's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I started the Super Cosplay Warriors Ultra page and realised that I got the name of the game wrong. Super Cosplay Wars Ultra is the correct name. However, I question whether the 'Super Cosplay Wars Ultra' should be deleted. I'll admit, as far as I am aware, the game has a small englsih speaking fanbase, but game is wildly available for download on English game sites (for one unverified source on download statistics check <a href="http://www.caiman.be/gamestats.asp?nr=1528" class="external free" title="http://www.caiman.be/gamestats.asp?nr=1528" rel="nofollow">http://www.caiman.be/gamestats.asp?nr=1528</a>) and the wiki article is about the only english guide around (few exceptions). That's my opinion anyway. Lenny_Reason 9:37, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It may have a fanbase, but as a <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighter_Maker_3606.html" title="Fighter Maker">Fighter Maker</a>-created fan game with few English articles about it, it fails the <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> guidelines for notability.

<p><b>delete</b> award from The Robert Schumann Society. I never knew how many sites picked up content from wiki until I started looking for the society. "Robert Schumann Society" scored 79 unique out of 1140Ghits. "Robert Schumann Society" + duesseldorf scored 58 unique hits out of 106Ghits. The vast majority are from sites which take content from wikipedia. The organisation's own <a href="http://members.aol.com/schumannga/" class="external text" title="http://members.aol.com/schumannga/" rel="nofollow">website</a> is hosted on aol and has <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmembers.aol.com%2Fschumannga%2F" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmembers.aol.com%2Fschumannga%2F" rel="nofollow">no Alexa rank</a>. The Robert Schumann Society may have some important patrons, and a 25 year history, but little presence on the web, which could be due to cultural/systematic bias. Little appears to be verifiable. Thus unable to judge importance of the Society or the award. The society's page has been blanked out as copyvio of the society's site. The award has no web visibility. 2 unique Ghits for "Arrau award", both were for award winning recordings by Claudio Arrau. The Award could be merged with the Society's own page. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 08:53, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The Robert-Schumann-Gesellschaft in Düsseldorf publishes a scholarly catalogue of Schumann's works, a series of critical editions of his compositions (<i>Neue Ausgabe sämtlicher Werke</i>, 1991-) and other Schumann-related publications - this can be verified through your favorite online library catalogue. It also appears that they arrange (or have for some time arranged) an annual Schumann festival with extremely notable people like <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_Perahia_cc6e.html" title="Murray Perahia">Murray Perahia</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/e/Dietrich_Fischer-Dieskau_8b0a.html" title="Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau">Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau</a> and <a href="../../../o/l/a/Olaf_B%C3%A4r_b40c.html" title="Olaf Bär">Olaf Bär</a> participating (<a href="http://members.aol.com/schumannga/schu2000.htm" class="external text" title="http://members.aol.com/schumannga/schu2000.htm" rel="nofollow">2000 festival</a>, claimed to be the seventh). That the website is on AOL is not really relevant, as the notability of the Society is not based on its web presence. I notice that the article on the Society itself is currently a copyvio. I would suggest restarting that page as a stub and <b>merging</b> the medal with the society article. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 15:02, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> @<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>: I'm not sure I get what you mean here. My idea was to take what meaningful information we have (i.e. basically, that this band has a song about Tiananmen Square) and put it in the article for the band, if anyone cares enough to do it. I really don't think that we need to preserve the edit history of this particular stub in order to be allowed to do so. As it stands, <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrested_in_Shanghai_5af7.html" title="Arrested in Shanghai">Arrested in Shanghai</a> is not a valid article, and its subject does not qualify for any article per <a href="../../../s/o/n/WP%7ESONG_9898.html" title="WP:SONG">WP:SONG</a>. Stating that some information from it might be used in another article in an AFD nomination doesn't make the nomination a proposed merger. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 11:58, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Your nomination starts with the words "propose to merge" so you might understand why I thought that was the idea. But yes, the history needs to be retained.

<dd>For the record, it wasn't "my" nomination, I merely supported it with a clearer vote to delete. As for the rest: If there is really no other way, I repeat my vote to delete this <i>without</i> salvaging any content, which was just an attempt at compromise, anyway.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 21:56, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I would not oppose deletion per guidelines, or how this AfD is supposed to work. However, there appears to be useful content, and thought someone would want to transfer the content prior to deletion of the page. Or perhaps the content could be re-created.

<p>The article is only stating the contents of the verse. Seeing that the chapters of the Gospel of Luke (for example "Luke 17") redirect to Luke, I find it odd to find a verse that has an article of its own.

<li><b>Keep</b> This has been creating quite a bit of buzz, as has been stated, and has had a very positive reception amongst fans (of both Yankovic and Chamillionaire). It is not crystal-ball-gazing, as the song already exists, and has been streaming on Chamillionaire's MySpace page. It appears to be a significant Yankovic single, and as many other of his singles have their own articles, I don't see why this one should not, either (it has more information than some of those other ones, as well). --<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwilightsojourn_cba7.html" title="User:Twilightsojourn">Twilightsojourn</a> 07:34, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I originally speedy deleted this article because the apparent article subject requested deletion. From the talk page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This page, supposedly about me but with my name misspelled, first came to my attention because it includes a mention of one of my sons (name misspelled also). Besides being a violation of his and my privacy, and besides being rife with inaccuracies, the article is about someone who is not a public or notable figure in any way. While I once chaired a nonprofit board, I have not done so since 1984, and there are thousands of people in the US who have also chaired a board. I request that the page be removed. --E. M. Deull 13:13, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was not quite sure what to do at that point. I probably should have gotten some advice about how to handle requests for deletion from article subjects, but I just went ahead and deleted it. However the article creator, <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">Smeelgova</a>, requested a more above-board deletion process, which I will happily oblige. There are probably policies about this, but I do not know them. Therefore, I <b>abstain</b>, and request that users experienced in this kind of situation help determine what to do.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I don't think we should pull content just because the subject asks us to - that wouldn't be acceptable behaviour for an encyclopaedia, and I don't have much truck with arguments about privacy.

There is a question about notability though and if it is kept it would need moving to the correctly spelt title. I'm also not sure that this isn't a subtle attack page - it seems to raise questions about the use of his legal firm by the NGO (undue weight afforded this area considering the size of the article?). <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 14:04, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I am in agreement with user <a href="../../../b/t/l/User%7EBTLizard_ebd6.html" title="User:BTLizard">BTLizard</a>'s statement above. Inaccuracies should be cleaned up and corrected, but the article itself should be retained.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The misspelling seems to have been done in good faith, as the National Labor Relations Board made the same error. Allegations of bring "rife with inaccuracies" were unspecific. Errors can be corrected and are not a basis for deletion. Ellis Deull was notable enough to be mentioned in two published articles about the Hunger Project: Giambalvo, Carol (January, 1988). "The Hunger Project: Inside out". <i>Spiritual Counterfeits Project (SCP) Journal</i>. Vol. 8, No. 1; and Gordon, Suzanne (December 1, 1978).

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Nothing in the article demonstrates notability, though I could imagine that notability might be there: if you believe you have rewritten to demonstrate notability, let me know, my vote might change. If it is to be kept, move it to the correct spelling. And it does currently read like an attack piece: if it is to be retained, it will need a substantial rewrite. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:27, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Popov is a pretty well-known architect in Australia, has worked on some major projects and won many awards.

<li><b>Comment</b> - the article lists awards and commendations and several works. Not sure what you are looking for here. At the moment concensus is 5 keep to one delete. Any improvements to the article would be worth while but the issue with deletion of a biography is not content but notability, could something be written - the answer is yes - the bare bones are there and it is waiting for improvement from an interested editor or editors.--<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">Golden Wattle (<small>formerly known as Arktos</small>)</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGolden_Wattle_52fc.html" title="User talk:Golden Wattle">talk</a></sup> 05:39, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. I disagree with the nominator in stating that it is a non-notable event. It was highly notable in Paraguay when it happened, and it's fairly rare for news from this small country to make worldwide headlines. I would argue however that being notable and verifiable are not sufficient criteria for the inclusion of "news events", as they are inherently verifiable and notable on some scale. I will agree with the nominator in stating that this is not WikiNews, this is an encyclopedia, and the only "news events" that should be getting their own articles here are ones that have some kind of far-reaching impact beyond the scope of the event itself. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 18:49, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm pretty sure you could write a pretty decent article on the subject (this isn't it, though). There's a lot of editorialising, but that's not really AfD's concerned.

<p>The term Gino is used in exactly the same context as the term Goth. Keep.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I totally disagree. While the article needs cleanup, the term 'gino' is *not* simply a slang term. It is representative of a sub-culture in the cities mentioned. For example, if "<a href="../../../g/o/t/Goth.html" title="Goth">goth</a>" can be an entry, than "Gino" cannot be deleted. I don't know how one takes it off deletion, but I am totally against it. The problem is on the "original research" clause, but don't know how to get around that, I could edit it myself but wouldn't have a published source. Posted 5 September 2006</li>

<p>Apologies for seeming to spam - I had no intention of doing so. I created the music4uonline page in response to the fact that various of our competitors receive mention here, something which we feel is unfair in a business setting. I have no problem with what I wrote being dramatically slimmed down, or entirely re-written by someone else, but I do not feel that it is fair to remove it altogether, as long as our competitor's pages remain in existance.

<dd>Wikipedia has no obligations regarding fair business. We write an encyclopedia, which covers notable subjects. Your competitors may or may not be notable -- if they're not, they should be deleted too. But if they are, that does not mean every other similar company has to be covered as well.

<p>I totally appreciate this, and although I would prefer to see a mention remain here, I have no real problem with the page being removed, as long as this does not leave us without representation in a location where some of our competitors are represented. I do notice that one that was in existence yesterday has been removed (YCD Multimedia Ltd), but if you look at the 'similar companies' section on <a href="../../../m/u/z/Muzak.html" title="Muzak">Muzak</a>, or at the <a href="../../../d/m/x/DMX_Music_f82a.html" title="DMX Music">DMX Music</a> page in general, you will see catalogues of competitors for whom I can see no real merit in their having a mention if we don't. Muzak is a different matter - their name is synonymous with a music style, and I can therefore see a perfectly good reason for its existance here on Wikipedia. In short, if you do intend to remove the music4u page, please also remove those of our competitors - the market is complex enough without advantages being given in neutral zones on the Internet. Apologies to anyone who has been angered by my post - I saw our competitor's pages, and felt that we required a mention too. Hezza1506 09:12, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have no right to "representation" here. The other articles have to be evaluated on their own merits.

<p>Apologies for the fact that I have evidently annoyed you - this was never my intention. Nor do I feel that we have a 'right' to representation, I was simply trying to explain what made me create the page in the first place. I would happily nominate them for deletion, except that a) I am clearly biased and it seems as unfair to them as I would consider it to be to us, b) as you have probably gathered, I am not well versed in the 'rules' of wikipedia, and would not therefore know where to start in suggesting their removal and c) much as I would like to have the time to spend learning about the ins and outs of the site, I don't have - I have a company to market, and wikipedia is not on my list of priorities for marketing - for obvious reasons. All I ask is that when considering this for removal, people also bear in mind the presence of other sites of equal merit (or lack of merit, as the case may be).

<dd>Vote: Delete. Hezza, if you'd care to do the legwork of assembling a list of links to the entries you feel are questionable and post them to my talk page, I'll be happy to look them over and NFD them if they are of a similarly inappropriate vein. That's not to say I can or will delete them, but I'll put it up for discussion if I find them to be in the same spammy vein as your article. NB: Please stop adding your company's information to the Music Licensing page. I worked hard to create it, and others have worked hard to add to it, and I'd like for it to remain useful information rather than an advertisement. I would respectfully suggest that anyone looking on a Wiki for a vendor for services like this is probably not the most astute businessperson in the world anyway - there are far better resources to find commercial services.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Henry_DeJong_4d99.html" title="User:John Henry DeJong">lowgenius</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Henry_DeJong_09fc.html" title="User talk:John Henry DeJong">My Talk Page</a> 18:24, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do the math. Say for the US, as I can't generate realistic Phillipine numbers off the top of my head. 50 states (plus territories, etc...) * 100 high schools for state (intentional low ball estimate) * 12 staffers (this page has 11, 12 makes rounder numbers) = 60,000 staffers of school newspapers per year. We don't get that many new prominent journalists or politicians per year, lets estimate high at 6,000 in the U.S., of which we'll say 50% worked their high school newspaper (odds are higher for journalists than politicians, but there are more prominent politicians than journalists), so 3,000 per year. This means 3,000 of 60,000 or 5% of high school staffers go on to become prominent. The intentional biases are to make that number too high. I find 5% extremely unconvincing. I think without the biases the likely real ration is 0.5% to 1%. This argument is totally unconvincing to me, but was certainly original. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:56, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page violates all the guidelines for a BIO article. The majority of the article isn't even about the subject, but rather what happened to her. The Google results initially used to prevent AFD reveals no other stories outside of the ones just after the accident in March. There have been no substantial changes in content for over five months, and the subject hasn't been newsworthy since three days after the accident. The article was justified then by others because she was on the news and <i>The Today Show</i>, and she has since faded back into obscurity. The apparently important NCAA meeting that was also cited as upcoming also failed to make the news, and the results also failed to make this article. Thus, there were no real repercussions from the event, and what we are left with is a vanity article about a person who is noteworthy because of what happened to her rather than because of something she did that was of any real substance. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 19:21, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You should expect a biographical article about a person to focus on what makes them newsworthy, encyclopaedic, whatever. That's not a flaw in thsi case, just indicates that the article isn't "complete". Lack of completeness is not a criterion for deletion. Saying she's <i>noteworthy because of what happened to here rather than what she did</i> reeks so strongly of POV I'll just disregard it entirely. The article is sourced, and vaguely encyclopaedic. "Encyclopaedic value" isn't something you lose, so the <i>failure to develop</i> argument is one I also find unconvincing. Thus, I'm relucktantly forced to conclude we should <b>keep</b> the article, even though it's a real Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:38, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd><b>My comments from the first nomination</b>: "Plenty of people with considerably less fame have articles on them in Wikipedia. In Yamaoka's case, shes' been the subject of media attention from a broad range of major media outlets, including <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a>, <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a>, <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a> and hundreds more. She received a call from <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">President Bush</a> and also appeared on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Today_Show_8f75.html" title="The Today Show">The Today Show</a>. It isn't just the accident that made her famous, it's her actions afterwards that made her famous. The ban that you note may be overturned <i><b>is</b></i> in effect for the NCAA tournament, not just the MVC women's tourney (which is not over, it's still going on). Try searching for "Kristi Yamaoka" at <a href="http://news.google.com/" class="external free" title="http://news.google.com/" rel="nofollow">http://news.google.com/</a>. This generates more than 500 news article hits. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> specifically states as a test for inclusion in Wikipedia, "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events". Having nationwide news attention, getting on The Today Show, getting a call from the President, etc., well exceeds that criteria. "</dd>
<dd><b>My comments from the second nomination</b>:"<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> clearly states "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events". Given all of the press attention, appearance on a number of TV shows, a call from the President of the United States, and ONGOING press coverage, the article clearly passes this requirement. The above statement that there is no news of her since March 11th is false as she's been mentioned in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Sun-Times_5b28.html" title="Chicago Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a> and been on the <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_Degeneres_c40a.html" title="Ellen Degeneres">Ellen Degeneres</a> Show of late.

<dd>Nothing has changed regarding this person's notability to possibly conclude the invalidity of the prior AfDs. People can and are notable for singular events in their lives. If she just fell and was hurt, no big deal. Lots of cheerleaders fall. Injuries are commonplace. What made <i>this</i> person notable was the fact that she continued to perform her cheerleading duties from the stretcher. <b>THAT</b> is what drew all the media attention. That is what made her notable. Not her fall. Much less the fact that her fall caused a nation-wide temporary suspension of similar moves is plenty enough on its own to make it notable. MSJapan has made no convincing argument that this person is any less notable now than she was at the time of the event. How many AfDs does this article have to endure? Enough is enough already. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 20:24, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Shortly after the fall, The American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators declared a temporary ban on basket tosses and 2 1/2 high pyramids (the same type of stunt Yamaoka was involved in that precipitated her fall). This temporary ban was to extend for the rest of the season for all cheerleading events, including the NCAA tourney. See <a href="http://www.aacca.org/news20060307.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aacca.org/news20060307.asp" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. Following AACCA's July meeting on updating safety rules, they issued a press release modifying the rules regarding these same types of stunts requiring the presence of mats if on a hard surface and may only be done during half time or following a game. See <a href="http://www.aacca.org/CollegePressRelease.doc" class="external text" title="http://www.aacca.org/CollegePressRelease.doc" rel="nofollow">press release in MS-Word format</a>. Thus, MSJapan's assertion that there were no repercussions from the event is incorrect. Regardless, the larger reason for Yamaoka's fame is not the fall; plenty of cheerleaders fall. The reason for her fame is her actions after the fall, in continuing to cheer when strapped to a stretcher. That's what prompted all the press coverage, appearance on media outlets, call from the President of the United States, etc., not the fall. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 13:23, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b>I still frankly think that too much stock is being put in certain events - for example, I know someone who was personally at a Presidential bill signing, made the local news as a result, and received numerous phone calls from the President at the time. They don't have a WP article, nor do they deserve one. It also concerns me that available information was not added to the article in a timely fashion. If the meeting took place in July (it was stated as April in the article, and that meeting not having occurred yet was a key reason AfD #2 did not pass), why did it take until AfD #3 in September to find and add the relevant information, thus undermining this AfD as well? How can someone be notable enough for WP when the article doesn't even have a DOB for her (which is because it wasn't mentioned in the whopping three days of media coverage)? How notable can she be when no substantial changes have been made to the article since a week after the accident? While I suppose at this point there is no reason to continue with the AfD, these are questions that I think really need to be considered when thinking about the appropriateness of this article for WP. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 18:26, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>We do not base deletion policy on whether or not all available information is added in a timely fashion. It simply isn't a criteria.

<p>Sorry, I didn't know what that code was at the top of the page so I took it out. I'm kinda new to Wikipedida and didn't realize that deleting the code would take out the message on top. I thought it just stayed there itself. Anyways, I feel this article should stay. MSB FTW is very successful and has over 210,000 posts since January, which is very impressive. The board has become even more popular lately, too. The board was slow during the first month of creation or two, but now the board averages well over 2,000 posts per day. Note: Please don't get mad if I did this wrong too. I think I got this edit right though MetsRule 20:06, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

The Board also compiles a lot of current events and is not a sole time waster, there are many worth while discussions that go there and I feel as if the it deserves to be recognized by wiki. Wiki is a favorite place for people to link information on MSB FTW.

<p>Oh boy here we go again, We have Shazbot who is a member of an online gaming guild who dislikes a guild I'm in and harasses the members of that website a long with myself. Then we have Jestix who deletes or reverts every single ligit edit or article I add. I'm sure there is other articles you can find that really need to be deleted and are wasting wikipedia space. Since I can't seem to do anything about it, I will just play your game and continue to readd the article. If you delete my ip address, I own two office locations, two water front homes. I'll just keep readding them again again. Not just for kicks, but because your unfair and need to get a life.

<li>Dear BLake, please note that I'm not an Administrator and have not the power to delete pages, all I do is to nominate them for reviewal by the widely spread wikipedia community.

<p><b>Lock</b>, @closing admin, since the author already announced he will keep readding the page because he feels it unfair the wikipedie community doesn't find him encyclopedic noteworthy, I would suggest to lock the lemma instead, if the discussion results into a delete. --05:51, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have noticed that it is unaimously decied due to the fact many members from an online gaming community have decided to follow or watch my articles and edits. Again I'm just getting the hang of wikipedia and realizing, it appears to be a website that anyone can log on and edit, delete, alter or add false information posted by other people. Sometimes it can be helpful.... but I only use it as a last resort because you can post completely false information here......sure it will probably be editted and corrected, but not immediately. In some cases important or notable information is even editted or deleted.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think her case can be made better as an academic than as a well-known artist.

In reply to Greiner's comments, I think assuming that wide public knowledge of a figure is the only route to notability is a dangerous path to take. Substantial recognition within a field is the best way to deal with academics, and if we don't accept that we will have to throw a LOT of important scholars out.

<li><b>Delete</b> (without prejudice, in case WP:V can be satisfied). Like others, I am not satisfied with the reliability of the sources we have. There seems no doubt the idea exists and is notable enough to create some amount of fuss on the internet, but to satisfy WP:V we ought to be able to find a reliable discussion of it in a proper, non-partisan scholarly publication or at least some major serious news media, talking <i>about</i> the idea and its proponents, and not just agitating for or against it.

<li>I would be inclined to <b>not delete</b> this article out of hand. Family articles like this raise some interesting questions:

<li>Can a family be notable when few or none of its members are notable? (I would say yes, just as a band can.)</li>
<li>Is a family a good way to group people? (I would say sometimes. If a family fortune or business or hereditary title is the common thread.) That is not the case here, though. What is the connection between Hans Vollers and Johann Balthasar von Löhr? None, really.</li>

<li>What IMHO really speaks against a grouped familiy tree is, since one member is currently aggressibly adding person after person of this familiy to wikipedia, with seperate articles we have the wikipedia tools of AFD to determine person by person if he is notable or not. If there is a familiy tree I fear it will go down to any newborn baby to mementioned by that guy, and when we remove it by revert this will very likely result into revert wars. --<a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJestix_6105.html" title="User:Jestix">Jestix</a> 06:15, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep the name for disambiguation</b> Almost any surname is non-exclusive so "Van Leer" is needed like we need <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rothschild.html" title="Rothschild">Rothschild</a>.

Any worthwhile family article, like <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rothschild_family.html" title="Rothschild family">Rothschild family</a> (see the redirect too), is probably written after good encycopedia articles have been established on the individuals. The content of this article isn't enough yet for a decent "Van Leer family" article, but can it be improved? The enthusiasts ought to try to work first on worthwhile individual articles.

<li><b>Response:</b> Rangefinderforum has 6,000+ registered members, receives 10,000 unique hits per day, is the world's largest forum dedicated to rangefinder cameras and have broken several world-firsts such as photos of the upcoming Leica M8. It has also held photography competitions featuring what can be accomplished using a rangefinder camera - with prices sponsored by well known photographic equipment vendors.

<li><b>Move</b> I think the page has some potential and should be kept and sheperded in the right direction. The crossover elements of the show have been discussed on the official podcast as referenced in the article establishing some notability. The list of crossovers is unencyclopaedic, but it can be cut back and prevented from becoming a list of fancruft without deleting the article. The article should instead focus on any other external discussion on the use of interweaving flashbacks on Lost. If there is not enough information to support a separate article this should be merged back into the main article.--<a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpark_77_c2a4.html" title="User:Opark 77">Opark 77</a> 07:25, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is a tough one. Crossovers are absolutely germane to the show, but this list is woefully subject to the <i>Lost</i> fan disease of seeing a connection around every corner (e.g., doesn't that Portuguese man at the end of last season's final episode look like Jack, etc.). Verifiability <i>is</i> both questionable, in many cases, and not the main/only point anyway when it comes to being encyclopedic. As we've done with the literature references in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thematic_motifs_of_Lost_90ff.html" title="Thematic motifs of Lost">Thematic motifs of Lost</a> article (i.e., providing a few pointed examples, but not trying to be comprehensive--"more is not better", again), I'd say that we should eschew trying to list <i>every</i> crossover, and leave that for the fansites, whose bar is a lot lower. In short, to my mind, the purpose of this article is therefore suspect, in terms of lining up with Wikipedia guidelines and tenets, so I vote we delete it. -- <a href="../../../p/k/t/User%7EPKtm_9f50.html" title="User:PKtm">PKtm</a> 11:35, 7 September 2006 (UTC).

<li><b>Keep</b> I found the page while looking for information to confirm/deny one of the items in the list. For that reason, it was of use to me, and therefore I found value it being here, even in the format it's in. Wikipedical mentions above "Lostpedia", which I've not heard of before, and just checked out. Comparing the same article (about character Hurley) on both sites, I prefer the one that is on Wikipedia over Lostpedia. It's no wonder I'd never heard of Lostpedia, as it's not mentioned on the main Wikipedia Lost page. I think I will edit this page to reference it, and continue to use Wikipedia to "learn" about stuff on this show that I've missed or don't understand. If I can't find it here, I suppose I will look there, and wonder "What's the point of having a wiki, specifically for a subject that already has a place in Wikipedia?" <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Henderson_796b.html" title="User:David Henderson">David Henderson</a> 17:06, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Lost is obviously a notable show, and the crossovers are a notable aspect of the show. As the show continues, there are likely to be more crossovers, making it more difficult to merely have this as a section of another article. Wikipedia has thousands of articles on obscure points of notable subjects, and I think that's one of the great things about the project. That being said, I agree that the article is not encyclopedic in its present form, but we haven't allowed time for the wiki process to do its thing yet. <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> 19:40, 13 September 2006 (UTC) Note - after re-reading the discussion, I would also support Opark 77's suggestion. <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> 19:45, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. The raw total is 5-3 Delete. One Keep commentor has five edits, non (except here) since May. If, for the sake of argument, we discount that and add the nameless original nominator, it shifts to 6-2 Delete.

<li>Ergh. Don't take it that way. =) For the record, I'm not an active user of the site.<br />
I have my highly practical "web notability gut feeling" thing: 1) have I heard of the thing outside Wikipedia? Often? 2) Does it appear to have tons of user after a short scrutiny? 3) Does it appear to be well-established (long history, frequently linked to/discussed about, etc). The rationale being that generally, WP:WEB seems to <i>follow</i> from this - a famous site gets media recognition etc. I was merely trying to hint that yes, in fact, it's a big site; yes, it's probably worth doing the kind of research you're suggesting. My point being, it <i>probably</i> qualifies; if it had more of the material you're asking there, we wouldn't be having this debate.<br />
It's just that personally, I don't have a clue myself on where to begin researching for the notability issues. Like I said, I'm not an active user of the site, and know little about them. So, if <i>anyone</i> who uses the site and actually knows anything would bother to dig these issues up - I'd hate to see this thing die right here because it doesn't have sources or references <i>now</i>... --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 08:53, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I quite understand your gut feeling (although I can't verify it because photo.net is down as of now), but I'm reluctant to keep a not-very-good, vanity-laden article because of it.

<li><b>Delete</b> for failing <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> - lacks multiple third-party non-trivial articles about it, no national awards. The reason Google isn't the final arbiter of notability is because it's not entirely accurate on its face: Yes, you get 4.4 million general hits from "photo.net", but only <b>80</b> are distinct hits, and of those 80 most don't have anything to do with Photo.net. Most of these are similarly-named sites like aircraft-photo.net, and so, and this says a lot about the notability.

<li><b>Comment</b>. What I disagree with is the notion that any sort of deletion (be it a speedy, a prod, or an AfD) requires that you do anything more than look at the face of the article. There is no significant assertion of notability in the article as I nominated it, and there still is not sufficient notability established with the revision done by TruthbringerToronto. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 22:12, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>What I disagree with is the notion that any sort of deletion (be it a speedy, a prod, or an AfD) requires that you do anything more than look at the face of the article.</i> — Nominators should do the research. Nominators who do not do the research make bad nominations. Nominators who assert that they shouldn't even have to do the research are bad editors. Good editors do the research, which results either in the article getting better (with sources being added to it, for example) or in a <i>good</i> nomination that explains what attempts were made to look for sources and what was, or was not, found.

<li>An explanation of what constitutes bad editing is not incivility, any more than explaining that an editor who vandalises is a bad editor is not incivility.

<li>It's not a "process-centred approach" to strongly disagree with the idea that "it is necessary to look for and evaluate sources". It's an outright rejection both of the notion of collaborative improvement of articles, and of one of the fundamental tasks involved in writing an encyclopaedia. An <i>actual</i> process-centred approach would have, of course, <i>followed processes</i> such as "<a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">before nominating [...] consider whether an article could be improved</a>" or "<a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#Nomination" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">before nominating [...] investigate the possibility of rewriting the article yourself</a>", both of which processes by their very natures involve looking for the existence of sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:12, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
