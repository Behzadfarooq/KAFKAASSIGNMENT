<p>He hung arround with a barely notable band - who never let his join - got evicted and convicted when they abused his hospitality - wild guy, but not I think notable! --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 14:23, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b>, but it needs some additions about his own career in order to solidify it. I do believe he was also a roadie for TAS, so that might also warrant keeping.<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.154.189.180.html" title="User:69.154.189.180">69.154.189.180</a> 19:01, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm from Tulsa and somewhat familiar with their music scene; I personally knew members of Agony Scene, and Jacob Hacker, though never a member, deserves note for the numerous illegal activities he and the band participated in together. Either more information needs to be added to this page, or it needs to be merged with Agony Scene's entry.Mistergrind 00:58, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I have only a vague idea where Tulsa is.

<li>WTF? You want to delete something because you don't know where the city it took place in is located? That's just ignorance-- not to mention calling a city the size of Tulsa "outback."Timmybiscool 00:25, 30 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I want it deleted because he is a non-member of a barely notable band whose other claim to fame is a criminal record. Who on earth wants to know about this except the sock puppets who are running this debate.--<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorturology_8c86.html" title="User:Porturology">Porturology</a> 01:23, 30 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sock puppetry? WTF? You better have some evidence to back yourself up. You think someone is NN, but other people don't, so they MUST be sock puppets, huh? Go ahead, I want to see your evidence. Or did it come from the same corner of your mind that thinks Agony Scene (signed to a major indy record label with national tours and two albums) is "non notable" and that Tulsa is "outback."Timmybiscool 02:21, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> assuming the external links contained in the article do provide some degree of verifiability. I find it surprising that someone with only a vague idea of where a city is decides to delete on that basis, especially given that the information is only a <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tulsa.html" title="Tulsa">mouse click</a> away. I might also add that WP:MUSIC is not policy and should not be treated as such (especially where it has no jurisdiction). <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupin_68a5.html" title="User:Lupin">L</a><a href="../../../l/u/p/User_talk%7ELupin_3e7a.html" title="User talk:Lupin">upin</a> 11:27, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> The point being that if I wanted to know about Tulsa it is only a click away. However i can not imagine that anyone other than a few people in Tulsa will ever want to know about this small time crim and the value of Wikipaedia is demesned by his inclusion.--<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorturology_8c86.html" title="User:Porturology">Porturology</a> 23:45, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

</li>
<li>Just a note to user Porturology, Tulsa is either the second or third largest city in the state of Oklahoma, behind OKC. Hardly backwoods.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't think he should be judged on music criteria as some of you are, because this article is not primarily about him as a musician. The links all check out, especially the prison and police stuff, so I vote to keep him in. 207.70.152.126 17:03, 25 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Uh, okay then, he's also a non-notable small-time criminal. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdc_936f.html" title="User:Cdc"><small>CDC</small></a> <a href="../../../c/d/c/User_talk%7ECdc_878d.html" title="User talk:Cdc"><small>(talk)</small></a> 18:33, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, but how many small-time criminals house, are arrested with, and tried alongside members of nationally recognized/touring bands? If he were just some stero thief I'd be voting delete, also. It's his affiliation with the band that gives him noteriety<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.154.189.180.html" title="User:69.154.189.180">69.154.189.180</a> 21:13, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> While there is a grand tradition of Larceny amongst musicians and artists in general, he never went for the REALLY big score that would have put him over the top, so to speak. He still has a chance to get into wikipedia, he just needs to do some bigger crimes, or maybe even DO SOMETHING USEFUL. Like start a band that gets signed to a major label or well known indie, sells a few thousand copies, tours internationally. Just let me know if he comes to Canada so we can alert the proper authorities. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 12:47, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><small>You can pretty much sum up anybody and add "Big deal" on the end and give the illusion that they don't matter. Tony Sirico-- a criminal who happens to be on a TV show. Big deal. See how easy that is? You're disregarding the fact that TAS is signed to a major label and that this guy was involved in one of its members being arrested and tried for a felony-- and yes, THAT is a big deal.
