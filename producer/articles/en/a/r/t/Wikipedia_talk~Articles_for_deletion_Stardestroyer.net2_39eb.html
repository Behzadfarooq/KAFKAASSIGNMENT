<p>The forums attached to the website have the 20th highest post per member ratio of any board on the internet (Source: <a href="http://rankings.big-boards.com/?sort=ratio" class="external text" title="http://rankings.big-boards.com/?sort=ratio" rel="nofollow">http://www.big-boards.com</a>), and are the 437th largest board of all forums on the internet.

<p>Stardestroyer.net is the definitive website and board for debating Star Trek Vs. Star Wars. (The website is 1st on all search listings for the topic on Google. The webmaster, Mike Wong, is referred to by name in official Star Wars publications.)</p>
<p>The forums have over 2000 active members.</p>
<p>There have already been 3 VFD in as many months, all defeated to this point.</p>
<p>This VFD, and the VFD before it, were started in bad faith by members banned from the Stardestroyer.net forums for various offenses.</p>
<p>Something worth noting. SD.net forums have 2,000 members. These are 2,000 <i>active</i> members. The admin of SD.net regularly deletes registered accounts that never post on the forums.</p>

<p>The site while it may be usefull for sci-fi facts is a brutal and violent atmosphere. The level violence is bad as it is but it increases 100x if you make a mistake and it makes R movies look suitable for children in terms of language and dialogue. Thats why it should be removed from Wikipedia, we don't need people seeing this and being hurt by it or younger people that live in a rough society as it is seeing this stuff. For future refrence I'll save this due to the fact people like to delete these commments. (Unknown Source)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not a very good argument, "Unknown source". Excluding it for those reasons would be a POV violation.

<p>The fact that the article has been subject to past VfDs is not relevant.

<p>Being the number one hit for a given Google search string does not, in itself, make a website notable. <a href="http://www.heptune.com/poop.html" class="external text" title="http://www.heptune.com/poop.html" rel="nofollow">Scoop On Poop</a> is the first Google hit for "poop", but I do not think it deserves an article because of this fact.</p>
<p>The allegation that SD.net is "the definitive website and board for debating Star Trek Vs. Star Wars" is unsubstantiated, and irrelevant.

<dd>And just to make things perfectly clear, I'll bring up this important fact here, from Wikipedia's own policy regarding Alexa.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../a/l/e/Wikipedia%7EAlexa_test_fdc8.html" title="Wikipedia:Alexa test">Also note that the Alexa rating includes significant bias, due to various factors. For example, the Alexa software is only available for Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Internet Explorer, and requires installation. So, for instance, a website exclusively devoted to an Apple Macintosh related topic might not have an Alexa ranking that accurately represents its true traffic activity. On the opposite extreme, some webmasters install the Alexa toolbar for the sole purpose of improving their own rankings, by visiting their own web site with it. The Alexa toolbar's user base is small enough, that one frequent visitor can have a noticeable effect on overall results.</a></dd>
<dd>Given that the people who visit this site tend to be tech savvy, and would actively delete or avoid Alexa for privacy concerns (eg. By using Firefox), the Alexa ranking can hardly be considered to be accurate. --<a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukashi_21e0.html" title="User:Mukashi">Mukashi</a> 07:14, August 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes it is common for any one who uses IE to be advised to use firefox by others on the site.</p>
<p>This is a quote from the site owner “<i>So, while I know this is kind of redundant since so many people have said it for so many other reasons already, it's really best if you use a browser that is not IE</i>.” <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElfwood_93bd.html" title="User:Elfwood">Elfwood</a> 10:33, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A google search on the phrase "Star Trek versus Star Wars" returns SDN as the #1 result, <i>beating Wikipedia's own article on the subject!!!</i> Don't give me that "not notable" garbage. --<a href="../../../v/a/g/User%7EVagodin_fa52.html" title="User:Vagodin">Vagodin</a> 03:28, August 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Not anymore it doesn't. Google shows "Star Trek versus Star Wars" #1 result as the Wikipedia article. Furthermore, even "Star Trek vs. Star Wars" comes up with a different site. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 18:15, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So you thought nobody would notice if you stuck some quotes in there so that it would <i>exactly</i> match Wikipedia's article title. Nice. You almost fooled us. If you leave the quotes off then it doesn't matter whether Wars or Trek comes first, so it makes more sense to search without quotes. As for your comment that this is unimportant, I fail to understand what you mean. If you mean that google is not a good way to test for notability then I would have to disagree. It is far better than Alexa in this case. Alexa collects it's information from an IE toolbar. Since most people who visit SD.net are tech savvy, many of them use firefox or other browsers, so Alexa is clearly not a good choice. --<a href="../../../v/a/g/User%7EVagodin_fa52.html" title="User:Vagodin">Vagodin</a> 01:17, August 30, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Vagodin, I was perfectly straightforward about what I was doing: I <i>provided a screenshot</i> of the <i>entire search</i> precisely so that everyone could see that when you search for what FCYTravis indicated he was searching for, you got results consistent with what he said. I wasn't trying to "fool" anybody. As for the rest of your ungracious response, I will suggest that this is the part of the conversation where you're supposed to say "FCYTravis, I apologize for calling your statements a 'blatant lie'. I was wrong." And next time, take a deep breath before you attribute malicious motives to other editors. Thanks in advance for being mature about this. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 01:31, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you weren't trying to fool anyone, however running a google search with quotes is clearly not the best choice. As Elfwood pointed out below, SD.net always puts starwars first. As for your "take a deep breath before you attribute malicious motives to other editors" comment, considering this VfD was started by Tanizaki for malicious reasons it's pretty hard not to jump to conclusions. I apologize for the misunderstanding. --<a href="../../../v/a/g/User%7EVagodin_fa52.html" title="User:Vagodin">Vagodin</a> 02:16, August 30, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I can explain why that’s the case. Stardestroyer.net always puts starwars first. So adding the quotation marks stops any stardestroyer.net results from appearing. A much fairer way is with out the inverted commas. Since it allows and accounts for both ways of writing it. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElfwood_93bd.html" title="User:Elfwood">Elfwood</a> 22:32, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(Unknown Source)I just want to add it's funny everyone goes back and forth on what site comes up when you put in "Star Wars versus Star Trek" at Google. Well what happens if I went to Yahoo which I prefer? What if I typed "Star Wars vs Star Trek" or maybe "Star Trek vs. Star Wars". There are tons of possibilities and tons of places people will use to search for a site for those two things. Of course SD.net will say the one specific way shows there page as the first result where as the hater of SD.net will show another way which doesnt show the SD.net as the first result. This is a useless argument.</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> This VFD is a violation of VFD policy. The article has survived two previous VFD attempts (most recently it survived one just 22 days ago) and this is the third VFD attempt in as many months. This is such a clear and blatant violation of VFD policy its not even funny. Its nothing more then a smear campaign by those who dislike the site itself attempting to remove it from Wikipedia because all they want is an encyclopedia that containts content they approve of. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 00:50, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment directed at Tanizaki</b> Surviving two VFDs due to a majority vote in favor of keeping the page is definately a case of surviving the VFD and being worthy of being kept. You think the information is somewhat lacking, then help expand it.

<p><b>Comment directed at "No consensus" crowd</b> I find such a statement absurd. Oh, gee, you mean having the majority vote favor keeping the article in two previous VFD attempts is irrelevent? It might have been titled no consensus, but the majority vote in the previous <i>two</i> VFDs (I can't bloody believe people think that trying another VFD so soon after the previous two is going to fair any better) favored keeping the article thus the article survived and the majority consensus was that the article be kept. Its called simple math and logic people. Try using it. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 04:29, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It may have survived the vote, but votes by new accounts made after the nomination of the article or those very new to wikipedia may be discounted which could've changed the number of votes considerably. -<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 08:11, August 25, 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment</b> I've said it before, I'll say it again, the Spacebattles.com article doesn't get near this much attention, in spite of both articles being pretty much the same in content. And don't tell me that Spacebattles is any more deserving of its own article than Stardestroyer.net. And yet, the Spacebattles.com article has yet to come up for a VfD, while Stardestroyer.net has come up for its third in as many months.

<p><b>Comment</b> I see that people can't be bothered to read up the facts and continue to make false accusations without basis of reality. Wub, if you and Ryan had bothered to read up on SD.net you would find sockpuppetry to be against the rules and it certainly is not occuring here. All I am seeing is slander by the part of people who only want Wikipedia to post what they like. An Encyclopedia is about knowledge, not selective entries. Three false accusations of sockpuppetry in a row. I smell something, and it stinks.

<p><b>Comment</b> There are no sockpuppets in here. Each member can be accounted for at SD.net where sockpuppet accounts are a violation of board rules and a permanent bannable offense. A great many of the accused meatpuppets are infact members who have been here since before the VFD. Several of the accused meatpuppets (some of whom have yet to vote) have become contributing members of Wikipedia since the previous vote. And last of all, all votes were apparently counted in the previous two elections as the people in charge of keeping track of the VFD elected to allow them. All you are doing is attempting to slander the opposition in order to force your opinion on Wikipedia. Come up with a rational reason for wanting to remove this page and enforce this opinion on all similar pages. SD.net is no different from the likes of Something Awful and SB.com. Both of those have Wiki entries, and the SB.com entry has not once attracted a single VFD. The SD.net entry attracts VFDs almost entirely because of the forum owner and the way the forums are run. Wikipedia is designed as an open encyclopedia, not an exclussive one that only contains content that you approve of. The SD.net entry is notable because it is the first of the dedicated ST vs SW websites and has one of the larger internet forums as well as a notable entry on the Evolution vs Creationism debate. Last of all the SD.net entry is far from vanity considering the number of people who dislike SD.net who participate in the editing of the article. There is no rational reason to delete the entry and all that leaves is irrational dislike of the article on personal levels. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 09:04, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's nothing wrong with votegarnering. Likewise, there's nothing wrong with making sure that admins are aware that votes are being "garnered"; many admins have suffrage criteria to prevent ballot stuffing from unduly influencing a vote.

<p><b>Comment</b> Your dislike of the entry is noted, and irrelevent. ST vs SW has its own entry on Wikipedia. The two primary websites that its debated at and have the biggest history with ST vs SW are worth noting on Wikipedia. Furthermore, SD.net is more then just about ST vs SW. Once again I see no rational reason given for the deletion of the article, just peoples personal predjudice.

<p><b>Comment</b> Alyeska, you have improperly shifted the burden of proof. It is not upon the "delete" crowd to provide reasons why the article should be deleted. The burden is upon the "keep" crowd to provide reasons why the article should exist. Things are not entitled to Wikipedia articles by default. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanizaki_5a31.html" title="User:Tanizaki">Tanizaki</a> 21:18, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> Burden of proof fallacy. The article is here, it has expanded, it has adressed a great many previous concerns. You must justify a reason to delete it. The very nature of Wikipedia is inclussive, not exclussive. Furthermore, this is not your intent. You were banned from SD.net for the most blatant and obvious trolling. You nominated SD.net for VFD after having just joined Wikipedia. After nominating SD.net for VFD you edited the nomination to remove your name. You are trolling and fullfilling a vendetta against SD.net. Its that simple. Everything you have done is in bad faith. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 21:22, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> No, it's not the burden of proof fallacy. The burden of proof lies with the party making the affirmative claim e.g. "SD.net is entitled to a Wikipedia article". Feel free to tell us what my trolling was. I also hasten to add that I joined Wikipedia on 7/20/05, more than a month before I nominated SD.net for VfD. I also point out that your appeal to "bad faith" is argumentum ad hominem. What's the big deal?

Furthermore, our arguments have already been given and the "counter" arguments ignore facts or use double standards. And don't try to hide from your trolling.

<p>You guys are welcome to have whatever sort of conversation you want, I guess, but I don't think any of this is furthering the conversation. No one is keeping score, and the one who makes the most cutting remark doesn't "win." If you're all just interested in slinging threats and insults at each other, perhaps you could find a more appropriate place, such as perhaps some internet forum board, or your user talk pages, to do it.

<p>More lies from Tanizaki. SD.net is ranked 437 on the list of the largest forums (not just ST vs SW, SomethingAwful is also in there and definately isn't a ST vs SW forum) on the internet just by total posts. SD.net is in the top .1% for internet forums. SD.net is in the top-20 when it comes to post counts to member ratio. Something else I would like to point out. I have spotted ten delete votes citing non-existant wiki policy as their reason for wanting the article deleted. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 23:34, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> I see such a blatant double standard on the part of some people here. They are so intent on removing this page they are willing to do anything. Every single instance of someones edit history being nitpicked is someone who voted to keep the article. Radiant, Ryan, Nandesuka, Wub, why aren't you ruthlessly tearing through the delete supporters? And why do I see so many people voting delete under IDENTICAL grounds which are not Wiki policy? You have actively slandered and attacked Keep supporters as well as accused of sockpuppetry and meatpuppeting. I see identical behiavor on your parts. Don't try and play the high road card. You've been slinging mud the whole time, often times without thought or concern and outright slandering people whole. I've directed my comments at peoples arguments and reasoning. I've been using logic. Your doing nothing more then slinging mud. And you think your best qualified to determine what Wikipedia should have. Wikipedia is an open encyclopedia, not an exclussive club for articles only you people personaly approve of. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 08:39, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi. Please note that <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">"no personal attacks"</a> is more than just a good idea, it is official Wikipedia policy. I can't speak for anyone else, but I certainly haven't been anything other than courteous to you. To describe my activities (opposing the inclusion of your non-notable forum, and annotating the votes of some voters who have not contributed many articles to Wikipedia) as "slinging mud", or "slander" belies a lack of perspective, and seems like a personal attack. Therefore, I ask that you moderate your language. One technique I like to use when I'm upset is to write my comments or message, and then before hitting "save", I go to the bathroom or take a brief walk to calm down. Perhaps you could try this technique. As to the vote itself, believe it or not, Wikipedia editors can think that including your favorite forum in the encyclopedia is a bad idea and <i>and still be acting in <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">good faith</a></i>. It is entirely appropriate for editors to vigorously debate and argue about the merits of an article, and to examine the bona-fides of other voters; if you find voters who are voting "delete" who have only 5 or 20 edits, I encourage you to annotate their votes accordingly. I'm sure the admin who closes the vote will appreciate it. This will be my last reply to you on this issue, because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a battleground</a>, and I find the whole forum-like tone of this talk page distateful. I respectfully suggest to you — as I tried to, obliquely, earlier — that you have already convinced everyone you are going to convince with your arguments, and that perhaps you (and <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanizaki_5a31.html" title="User:Tanizaki">User:Tanizaki</a>, who has been equally belligerent) should step aside quietly and let the community finish coming to consensus without further shouting.

<p><b>Comment</b> Since Ryan isn't bothering with the Discussion page, this definately goes out here. Who the hell do you think you are Ryan? Its obvious what your doing here. You are doing everything in your power to discredit those voting to keep the page. You happily toss out labels of sockpuppetry and meatpuppetry but you can't get around the fact that your selectively attacking only those who disagree with you and quietly ignoring everyone who agrees with you.

<li><b>Comment</b> This article seems to fall outside of "articles that contain nothing but a description of the site and that seem unlikely candidates for expansion may be deleted for lack of useful content" context, <b>however</b>, at present it also does not fall into the "Having been the subject of national or international media attention within the last 2 years" category either, would some enegetic wikipedian/'sock' go find something along those lines, bearing in mind that "National or international media attention means editorial content produced by a national or international news content provider, with particular weight given to off-line sources of news such as newpapers and national broadcasters". Personally I have no problem with this article and can easily see that it's VfD history, revert wars and comments on its talk pages have fueled hostility that would have been better channelled in making it a better article, but has been prevented by this hostility. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_alf_522c.html" title="User:Wiki alf">Alf</a> 12:26, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I want to know the vote counts. Reading the votes as left in the vote section this page should have survived. I want to know every vote counted and every vote left uncounted. I want to know who. Those people who had votes discounted deserve a chance to defend themselves. What I see here is nothing more then a bad faith VFD run by people who want Wikipedia only to have what they approve of. They wan an exclussive rather then inclussive encyclopedia. I see countless invalid and outright lies given for delete votes. And I am dead certain that the delete voters were guilty of everything they accused the keep voters of.</p>

<li>From a more general perspective, note that this result is almost directly related to Alyeska's ill-advised attempt to garner meatpuppet votes on the forum in question. There are a great many Wikipedians who deeply resent attempts by obviously interested parties to manipulate Wikipedia's processes, and meatpuppeting VfD votes is a perfect example. I might not have even given the VfD a second glance except that I saw a bajillion meatpuppets. I use the RickK Rule for meatpuppets - the more of them who show up, the less likely an article is to be worthy of inclusion. If an article needs a bunch of ballots stuffed to survive a VfD, then it probably shouldn't survive it. Alyeska, next time you want an article to be kept, make a rational and logical argument for it instead of blatantly going to drum up meatpuppet <b>Keep</b> votes that are just going to be discarded. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 06:06, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>For those of us at SD.net, this was an item of interest and we were discussing it. I was not calling for people to vote. That they came and voted was their own choice. Some even choose to do stupid things such as vandalizing others user pages. Though I find it interesting that you didn't count the VFD starters vote because of his actions. Why even allow the VFD when his intentions where clear? He had no intention of doing Wikipedia right and his VFD nomination was under false grounds and intent to conduct a vendetta against SD.net. That all three of the VFDs were started by people banned from SD.net is telling. Many of them dislike the nature of SD.net and the ban polls, yet those are almost identical to VFDs here on Wikipedia.

<dd>The VFD was started by someone with a vendetta. Why should the VFD have even occured in the first place? If his vote wasn't counted, then the person nominating effectively never voted and therefor never nominated the article for VFD in the first place. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 07:38, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That is incorrect. From <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a>: "Anyone can make a nomination, anonymous users as well as pseudonymous users."

<dd>You can't take a simple look at the facts and decide that yourself? The VFD was started by someone who was banned from SD.net. He was banned via a ban poll. This is almost identical to VFDs. He then uses the VFD to try and remove the SD.net article from Wikipedia and just so happens to try and hide his tracks in the process by altering the name of the VFD starter and then attempted to vote a second time. If thats not a bad faith VFD, I don't know what is. Taik was conducting a vendetta against SD.net pure and simple. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 08:16, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't really care what happened on another forum. That's irrelevant to Wikipedia. Whether it was some sort of vendetta, I don't know or, honestly, care. Like I said, forum politics bore me. The nomination was not made in violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> or as a vandalous act. The nominator's motives in nominating are not relevant. What matters is whether the article features an encyclopedic subject. In my opinion (and in the opinion of many other Wikipedians), it didn't. The fact that meatpuppets then appeared pretty well sealed the deal. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 08:36, 30 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I fail to see how the nominator's motives in nominating are not relevant when it's those motives which clearly establish the fact that the nomination was made in bad faith, and thus the nomination should be made invalid. Wikipedia isn't isolated from the net. In cases like this, where an event (a banning) on an outside site has sparked off an event here, the events of those outsides sites do matter. I can understand not wanting to get involved with forum politics, I'm sure the politics of Wikipedia are crazy enough as they are, but quite honestly, unless you make at least some vague attempt to understand the situation rather than dismissing it out of hand as "not relevant", then I'd have to say you're not exactly qualified to judge if the VfD was valid or not.</dd>
<dd>For that matter, I'd have to say the same thing for a number of the delete votes, who voted more in protest to the meatpuppeting rather than to having actual reasons to delete the article, that could be justified with actual WP policy rather than vague guideline. --<a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukashi_21e0.html" title="User:Mukashi">Mukashi</a> 13:53, August 30, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia policy allows any user to start a Vote for Deletion. Wikipedia policy also allows the admin who closes a VfD to discount votes made by users who may have voted in bad faith. From <a href="../../../d/g/f/WP%7EDGFA_21d3.html" title="WP:DGFA">WP:DGFA</a>: "For example, administrators can disregard opinions and comments if they feel that there is strong evidence that they were not made in good faith. Such "bad faith" opinions include those being made by sock puppets, being made anonymously, or being made using a new userid whose only edits are to the article in question and the voting on that article." "Votes for Deletion" is not a strict vote, but instead an attempt to determine consensus among the Wikipedia community. People who are not part of the Wikipedia community are not entitled to manipulate the process by stuffing the ballot box. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a democracy. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 15:33, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>Precedent for adminisitrative ruling in cases of no consensus. Admin decides to rule "keep(no consensus) since there wasnt a two thirds majority for deletion" If 17 keep and 27 delete votes were counted, the delete votes fall short of a two thirds majority.</p>

If they want to discount 23 of the keep votes, then surely they must firmly establish that they are sockpuppet accounts, and should be tagged as sockpuppet accounts.</p>
<p>Also, could the continual attempts to discredit the arguments of supporters by analysing their contribution history be considered elitism? If so, that may be in violation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers</a> .</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not "elitism" - it's ignoring what amounts to vote fraud by bringing in new users whose sole intent is to vote <b>keep</b> on an article they are personally interested in. This is called "meatpuppetry" and is commonly dismissed in closing votes, as it violates the intent of Wikipedia's processes. If you wish to claim that the VfD was invalid, I invite you to begin a discussion at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion</a> or beginning a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a>. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 06:15, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You adressed only one (though not really) of his points while outright ignoring the other two. What about the issue of 2/3s majority? What about the issue of the VFD nomination being in good faith? <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 06:40, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I'll take a stab then. First of all, I don't think many people here was voting in bad faith (maybe the nominator but that's a different story), although it might have gone better if anyone under 100 edits just didn't vote. As I stated before, if the admin is suspicious there might be meatpuppets (as in this case due to it being on a forum and whatnot), then the admin will typically throw out any vote with less than 100 votes (this admin only threw out ones with less than 50), and in many cases the Admin will throw away votes under 100 edits anyway. Typically an article gets deleted if there are 60% in favor of deleting when all is said and done. However, as wikipedia is not a democracy these are only really hypothetical rules, as technically VfD is only to provide comments on what action the admin should eventually take in order to represent the consensus of wikipedians - so the admin could delete an article with 30% delete votes if he/she finds a really valid reason and deems it so (I've only seen it once around here).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And I also pointed out the difference between sockpuppets and meatpuppets on VfD page, but for clarity "sockpuppets in and of themselves are not a bannable offense. If you use a lot of them to influence votes for example you might get blocked for a couple days. Meatpuppets, which is what we are talking about here, is not bannable at all (they just don't count on VfD)." sockpuppets are when one user creates multiple accounts, whereas meatpuppets are just users with low edit counts voting to prove a point or for one particular cause (which most wikipedians don't like because they haven't contributed anything, generally). For a humerous example of sockpuppetry see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Parker_Law_Firm" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Parker_Law_Firm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, normally VfDing again is discouraged - however, on some articles like this one the VfD will get messed up and will Admin will note that it needs to be retried more carefully (as happened last VfD for this and one or more of the GNAA VfDs).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, in answer to the question about the nominator nominating in bad faith... well, that's a tougher one. As stated previously becuase of the last VfD it sort of cancelled out much of the bad faith from the nominator (if there was any) as many people who voted last time wanted to voice their opinion again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I should note that many people believe that if a website really is notable it shouldn't need people notified by the website itself to come vote in support of it (not me personally though, but that seems to be the consensus here). Also, maybe you can ask an admin for the previous version of this page and continue it in your user space (User:Alyeska/SN.NET etc.).</dd>

<p>-(Mark666 once again not logging in) I got a comment about the site but first one for Alyeska. First I see you think Mike is High and Mighty too. This is a point many people that don’t like the site try to get across. This is my general comment, he’s like that Maddox guy that the young people like. Heck, most of the people are like that on the site and those people are all part of the same click that if you don't have the same general opinion you will get torn apart and you must beg for forgiveness or get banned.</p>
<p>Time and time again I watch here as people from the site say "We allow equal opinions". Yet the most common thing I see is religion bashing, some really horrid subjects often, battles that are childishly handled by the "Click"(edit:Try "clique". It's hard to be pretentious if you can't spell.) and one sided and always ended with a childish manner like a Ban or a childish Title added to someone’s name. I could go on and on. It's like a school ground play yard with a bunch of bullies and yes men and new people that are beating toys. There’s really no order. You think the board is popular but it isn't or else you'd have allot more members.</p>
<p>Now of course the response to this comment will be many things. Like I don’t know what I'm talking about or maybe I am a really pissed off banned member or some other insult or some other cleverly worded way of snaking around the issue. Personally I think the first deletion here was done by members at your site because to many people were speaking out against it and since you got caught editing to much stuff and you were told to stop you had people vote to delete it so all the comments would be removed then acted like "Banned members did it!". Yes I'm sure they all somehow got a hold of each other through magical means and voted for the deletion.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I'll end for now with this. One day hopefully things on here will get taken care of and you won’t be screwing around thinking you own this website adding pages everywhere. Then eventually maybe SD.NET will be fixed up because of its vulgar and horrid content. It does have good Information on more then just Star Wars, to bad it’s covered in filth. Once again ill be copying this incase anyone tries to delete or edit it.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we take a quick look at the TrekBBS wikipage, we'll see that a webpage that is no more notable, but far less controversial, somehow managed to avoid gathering delete votes like a rotting corpse gathers flies.</li>
