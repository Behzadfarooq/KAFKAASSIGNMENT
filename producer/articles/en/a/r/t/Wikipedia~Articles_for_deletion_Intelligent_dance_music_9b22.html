<p>This is a genre of music that in the words of one of its "references" is ' music that defies categorization'. The term is a complete <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">neologism</a>, and also inherently point of view. Why is this kind of <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance_music.html" title="Dance music">dance music</a> intelligent? The references are completely <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">unreliable</a>, being a few forums, blogs and a web ring. the entire article seems to have been built off the fact that an album was released in the mid 1990s called <i>Artificial Intelligence</i>. <a href="../../../a/p/h/Aphex_Twin_3573.html" title="Aphex Twin">Aphex Twin</a>, which this original research describes as the founder of 'intelligent dance music' is a <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drill_and_bass.html" title="Drill and bass">drill and bass</a> / <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambient_techno.html" title="Ambient techno">ambient techno</a> artist, not 'intelligent dance', and said himself that he considers he has nothing to do with the newly-invented and made up arbitrary name, himself suggesting it was not a fair name to use (<a href="http://www.furious.com/perfect/aphextwin.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.furious.com/perfect/aphextwin.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>).

<li><b>Keep</b>. The fact that the name of a musical genre is vague does not deprive it of notability. This label (usually seen as IDM) is at least discussed at <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=77:11690" class="external text" title="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=77:11690" rel="nofollow">allmusic.com</a> and audiogalaxy.com.

<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, what policy is that test contained in? I have heard of my dog, but my dog has no article. <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allmusic.html" title="Allmusic">Allmusic</a> is utterly unreliable when it comes to names of genres, as they're chiefly user submitted (I don't know about Audiogalaxy). <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 15:45, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>When "policy" is imagined to trump the observation that I had heard of this term well before seeing a Wikipedia article on the subject (and therefore, this isn't some newly made neologism, but a label with some currency), this seems to me to lead to the conclusion, not that this AfD has even slight merit, but that reams and reams of "policy" ought to be on <a href="../../../m/f/d/WP%7EMfD_481c.html" title="WP:MfD">WP:MfD</a>. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 22:14, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> - Excellent article which tries to explain a term, a so called <i>superword</i> like <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk.html" title="Punk">Punk</a> in which it's meanings are contested, which has been used widely for the past 16 years in the dance and electronic music community. Hardly a neologism and definitely not something which someone made up in school the other day. A google search for "intelligent dance music" produces 120,000 entries and the more frequently used term idm+ambient (for example) comes up with 1.3 million entries. A quick search on ebay for idm came up with 85 music listings. <a href="../../../y/o/r/User%7EYorkshiresky_ee54.html" title="User:Yorkshiresky">Yorkshiresky</a> 15:50, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And the fact that it's linked to 400+ other wikipedia articles seems to indicate that's it's a fairly widely used term. <a href="../../../y/o/r/User%7EYorkshiresky_ee54.html" title="User:Yorkshiresky">Yorkshiresky</a> 16:03, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fact that some word is linked to 107+ articles usually indicates that it sits in a template&#160;:-) `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 17:28, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> and massively cleanup. I don't think <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> applies here as if this is a term made up by the music media (as are most genre designations) and then written about. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> Does apply to some of the content of this article and it certainly needs some editing to take out content that doesn't meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, but on the whole I don't think the very concept or existance of the term is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and I don't think <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> necessarily applies here. Inherent POV of the term is also not an issue in my opinion, any moreso than it would be with <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trash_rock.html" title="Trash rock">Trash rock</a> or <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emo_%28music%29.html" title="Emo (music)">Emo</a>. It is a name, nothing more or less. With all due respect to Richard David James, I don't think his opinion of what his music should be categorized as is in any way relevent here. What matters is what the music media categorizes him as and if he doesn't like it he can start up a support group of "mislabeled artists" along with the multitudes of musicians who have been lumped into the catch-all of Emo... All that said, <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a> has a very good point about the reliability of the sources. Other than Allmusic, there is an audiogalaxy editorial, Usenet posts, and a couple of interviews that don't even reference the term. This is something that needs to be corrected. The fact however that in an interview with James the interviewer references the fact that his music has been called IDM and that would seem to indicate the fact that this is a known term and the way he answers the question would indicate he is familiar with the term and it is one that is common enough that it would be understood by someone who follows techno music. Of course "seem to indicate" isn't what we base articles on. I guess what I'm getting at here is that at this time I think a keep and cleanup (and if that means busting it back to a stub on the term ref'd just to the Allmusic article, so be it) is the correct course of action with no predjudice against another AfD if real <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> are not added to this article in the next month or so.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:11, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

The fact that Aphex Twin does not like the label is hardly an argument from Wikipedia policy.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I see the problems with <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, especially in terms of giving much credence to the effect of a usenet group without citing anything, but the article can be cleaned up. The important thing is that the article has a good skeleton to it. The concept itself was not "made up in school one day" and is certainly not a neologism--it's been around for a decent amount of time and has been fairly widely adopted. If you're going to consider this a neologism, you might as well AFD <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indie_pop.html" title="Indie pop">Indie pop</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drum_and_bass.html" title="Drum and bass">Drum and bass</a> as well. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackhorkheimer_f07f.html" title="User:Jackhorkheimer">Jackhorkheimer</a> 20:43, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article needs work for sure, but it is a definite keeper on the basis that it is a fairly commonly used genre label. The description of the music being "intelligent" may not even accurately describe the music, but there are other music genres that arguably suffer from inaccurate labelling as well. Regardless of that, people commonly use the word and I see it often on different websites including AllMusic, and even MySpace has it as an option for artists to describe themselves as. Overall, it just needs editting and sources, and I think it can be on its way. -- <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowolf_ffd9.html" title="User:Shadowolf">Shadowolf</a> 23:34, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Promise_Ring_b778.html" title="The Promise Ring">The Promise Ring</a> say they aren't emo, <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarentel.html" title="Tarentel">Tarentel</a> say they aren't post-rock, Aphex Twin says he isn't IDM. Sounds about right. There are tons of genre articles we should be deleting before this one.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> The genre classification is very widely used, it is not "made up in school one day". The google book/scholar hits should be enough to show that this genre deserves its own article. AmitDeshwar 17:27, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> Not commercial but quite widespread underground. While I do not liste to it, it certainly does not fit the deletion guidelines. A simple genre search returned over 1000 albums. Now if that genre came out of another one in the 90s or not i don't know nor care, since the term is notable on its own. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../v/o/d/User%7EVodkaJazz_6d7b.html" title="User:VodkaJazz">VodkaJazz</a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../v/o/d/User_talk%7EVodkaJazz_212b.html" title="User talk:VodkaJazz">talk</a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 18:07, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
