<li>Also, nominators should check What links here - a well-meaning newcomers writes a very limited substub on legitimate redlinks, and if all we see is the weak substub and not the inbound links...

<ul>
<li>Sorry, but no. While I agree that the article should be <b>kept</b>, the suggested procedures for 'speedy keeping' have been shot down by consensus on grounds of them being too easily abusable.

<ul>
<li>Not really. There should not be precedent for closing a VfD within <i>nine hours</i> of being created simply because there haven't been any delete votes so far. Similarly, I would strongly disagree to <i>speedy</i> a VfD after nine hours if it didn't get any keep votes.

<p>Not certain about suggesting deletion of this one, and hopefully someone will be able to fill in more details, but the three key words in this rarticle (Gasermatiladme, Seriladmen, and Nakabuderamis) each return zero hits on google other than in copies of this article.

<p>Your ever-so angry David.</p>
<p>Ps:If there wasnt i you STILL woildnt have the deposed monarchs lists from the 19th-before the 17th century.Think about what YOU write in articles and THEN re-consider your aproach on maters,such as Deletion,even though the said thing does not technicaly range beyond the limits of the describsion of a certain subject(i repete the generals for a MICRONATION:A PROCLAMATIOn and NO RECOGNITION.</p>

<li><strike>Hi Wikipedia, I wrote the article. Not to be rude, but why did you call my article "nonsense" and "speedy" delete it earlier? I looked at the procedures for deleting and I don't think my article is "nonsense." Frankly, if you're going to insult articles people write and blank them out immediately, I think your attitude to contributors is awful. And if you don't live in New York--which you obviously don't--you don't have any right to decide whether an article about Ray's Pizza is nonsense. Oh well, off my soapbox for now...

<li>No, I didn't touch your Kennedy Fried Chicken article. And insults aren't going to get anywhere. The point I am trying to make is that if you are talking about one particular chain of Ray's Pizza, that would be a case. But you're talking about <i>several</i> Ray's Pizza, not a particular chain. Yes, there's is Tommy's in LA, just as the article states. But being from LA myself, I know of at least fourteen other non-related burger joints in LA by the same name and have nothing to do with the <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy%27s.html" title="Tommy's">Tommy's</a> of that regard. Doing an article on one particular chain is fine, but what is the purpose of doing an article on a bunch of restaurants in the area whose only link is that they have the same name? It's not a single particular company you're talking about, it's a single coincidence. If there's a Ray's Pizza company that owns 17 restaurants in NYC, that's Wikiworthy, IMHO. But if there just happens to be seventeen unrelated Ray's Pizza places that just happen to have similar names, that's one for the phone books, not Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 04:08, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b>!!! not to support the above tone of whoever wrote the article, but "Ray's Pizza", as a <i>concept</i>, is a VERY important NYC establishment that deserves to be here, regardless of who owns them and despite the controversy. they really really are on every block. On <i>the Daily Show</i> someone once told jon stewart that she lived "by the starbucks," and his instant response was "that's like saying you live by the Ray's!!" "Ray's" as a whole, not the first one, not the legal battle, not the one company that owns seventeen, but the concept, the Ray's on Every Corner. It's that sort of place, something that is inextricably linked with the very idea of pizza- and just as strongly, the city itself- for virtually anyone who lives in the city. It is absolutely notable, not in any way equivalent to some 15 year old kid's garage band or someone promoting his copyright on "Joe's Diner". The world is a big place, and to the millions living in New York, Ray's is very significant. Most people think of the Statue of Liberty or the empire state building when they think of New York; most people who live there think of Ray's. It is part of home. --<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeah_5965.html" title="User:Heah">Heah</a> <a href="../../../h/e/a/User_talk%7EHeah_0915.html" title="User talk:Heah">(talk)</a> 10:19, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: The IP who wrote this and who has been storming around screeching insults is one thing, but the article is absolutely a speedy candidate. There is no content. A statement of a negative is not a statement. Please, folks, vote on the article, and not the topic. So, given the long story on this subject on <i>The Next Big Thing</i> radio show (WNYC) in 2002, all we get from this person is "It's not one thing." Gosh. Then the Kennedy's Fried Chicken? Is there only <i>one</i> Kennedy's Fried Chicken in only <i>one</i> city, and are they all subsumed under the same negative? Is Ray's actually significant elsewhere? The story was presented on <i>The Next Big Thing</i> as a minor bit of humor. No content.

<li>No threat. I meant that as a statement of future intent, not a "behave or else." Recreating deleted articles with personal attacks in the edit lines is noxious, vandalizing behavior. (This "IP" seems to know what the deletion logs say. Similarly, this "IP" is simply recreating deleted content rather than using VfU, which is process, while simultaneously pretending to be a newbie who is bitten.) At any rate, folks need to remember that they're being asked to consider the article, and not the topic. The reason is that we end up keeping utter junk that way, as everyone passes the buck onto that imagined future editor who might, someday, write the article that VfD voters imagine is lurking inside the lump of dross before them. If VfD voters want to write the imagined article, then that's fine, but "maybe I think there was a legal case about this once" won't do it, IMO, until that content is actually within the article. We don't need articles saying "The International Home of Pancakes is not IHOP" or "Hojos is not Howard Johnsons" or (and this happens) "X restaurant in Mumbai is a lot like other restaurants, but it's different." <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:39, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ok, but your position of <i>"vote on the article, and not the topic"</i> is out of step with both policy and common voting procedure. Not-so-great articles on decent topics should be expanded, or sent to cleanup or attention, not deleted. Please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_policy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_policy" rel="nofollow">Deletion Policy</a> for explanation, in particular the "Problems that don't require deletion" table. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 12:34, May 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, it is in contradiction with neither. Let's put it this way: let's say that our IP friend wrote an article that said "Ashlee Simpson is not Jessica Simpson. She's a skank!" Now, should that be kept? The fact that <i>an</i> article might be written does not mean that a <i>particular article</i> should be kept. In fact, one would wish to scratch the original and not preserve in its history the libel. The guidelines speak of "not so great" articles on good topics, not "weak, useless articles on topics that might, if handled by an expert, be worthwhile." Since deletion guidelines also call for the deletion of non-encyclopedic content and the speedy delete criteria advocate the deletion of articles without content, I'd say that the "send to clean up" option is not appropriate for feeble stubs. Were it to be so, then we would be leaving articles in that say "The apolo missions were really cool they went to the moon" and "Mars is a planet thats red." Finally, that advice is to those who are <i>going to nominate</i> an article for deletion. Once it's on VfD, consider the article, not the topic, unless you are going to rewrite. If you <i>are</i> going to rewrite, please inform the voters, so they can reconsider. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:20, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sure thing. Shouldn't we're getting such valuable content from this user that I can see why you'd be afraid of biting him. Mean of me to suggest that his vandalism of user pages would lead to a block. Awful, really, to suggest that the non-stop personal attacks in edit summaries might lead to a block. While the pity party rages, ask yourselves what it is that the contributor gave us. Look through the diffs. See how a sentence is so valuable that any amount of whinging, screeching, and paranoia from the user is worth putting up with in order to have. Please.

Perhaps our IP editor can be such a great guy as to actually get an account now so that we can have a specific identity to deal with, and not just a floating address. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:39, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeah_5965.html" title="User:Heah">User:Heah</a>, you really ought to look through the contributor's contributions. First thing was that I got given credit for speedy deletions of both of his creations, when I had deleted one. So, he called names. Then, however, he recreated instead of VfU. Then someone else did a proper VfD of a substub that stated a negative (so, gosh, it's now a <i>conspiracy</i> against Ray's Pizza and not just me). So, more personal insults. Deleting admin called a "douchebag," then "obviously never been to New York," etc. So, in the face of this childish taunting from the IP, you insist that the deletions were abuses? Those are very serious charges, and I hope that you will open an RfC on both (or perhaps three) of the admins who speedy deleted his articles, as well as the user who tagged his Kennedy's Fried Chicken for speedy deletion, as well, of course, as the person who made this nomination. Otherwise, <i>do not make accusations of such a serious nature.</i> If I am reacting strongly to your gestures, it is because you are attempting to make an amazingly feeble substub a cause for castigating the entire deletion process. I don't consider new IP's who do nothing but scream and insult to be valuable contributors, no. I do not consider single sentences to be articles. I do not consider the deletion of single sentence substubs to be "abuse" (!) as much as propriety. Hideous the way that you are making very, very serious charges in the name of virtuous protection of the poor little IP (who seems to know many profanities but no information). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:00, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>first, if this conversation is continued, i'd lke to request that we continue it on user talk pages as it no longer has anything to do with whether or not this article will be deleted, but first i'm gonna post this. Second, I don't know what the heck you are talking about, geogre. I accused no one of deleting the page originally, as i had no idea who had done it. I already stated above that i thought the comments here from the ip were out of line. However, I have looked at the contributions from this ip and i'm not sure what your problem is. I haven't found the word "douchebag" used by him anywhere, although i very well may have missed it; I didn't see him call you any names on his post on your <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_Talk_archive_7_f861.html#KFC" title="User:Geogre/Talk archive 7">talk page</a>, don't see a problem with his reasoning that if you were from new york you would know why ray's is notable, and think it is somewhat understandable for a newbie to get upset about things like this and react improperly, due both to their ignorance of how to go about things here and the hurt feelings that come with your first foray into something being quashed without discussion. His response was to ask us to please not be jerks, (without calling anyone a jerk), and recreating an article counter to general policy that was deleted with complete disregard for general policy, with edit sumaries along the lines of "i'm having trouble with the deletion process." You have a huge issue with him recreating the article without going through VfU, but i think its very important to note that <i>the article was deleted without going through VfD</i> and the ip was new here. I haven't searched through the history of your talk page, so i may have missed what you are calling his "vandalism". But he certainly wasn't insulting anyone before the article was deleted, and furthermore his vandalism has NOTHING to do with whether or not this article should be here, and whether or not it should have been VfD'ed according to policy. This is very important, so i'm going to say it again, in italics: <i>the actions of this ip after the speedy delete have NOTHING AT ALL to do with whether or not the article should have been speedy deleted.</i></dd>
<dd>I am not attempting to "castigate the deletion process"; rather, i think it is important to <i>use</i> the deletion process. that's why it is here. I am not trying to "make accusations of a serious nature" and don't think an RfC is necessary at this point. I just think that the articles should not have been speedy deleted, whoever did it, and whatever their reasons were; the results of the VfDs, that the article be kept and that the Kennedy article be merged, obviously give my point some creedence. These shouldn't have been speedily deleted.</dd>

<p><b>Comment.</b> Okay, since someone's calling for my head, I should probably explain a few things. For one, prior to nominating for deletion, I did a websearch for relevance. I found none. Whether or not your milage on Google may vary is different. Secondly, the original article was written in such a way that I found it very nonsensical; it was a poor choice of wording and I should have said <i>pointless</i> or <i>irrelevant</i>. As I said above, as the article was originally written, it's like writing on "Tommy's Burgers" in LA if you're referring to every restaurant in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Los_Angeles_area_a039.html" title="Greater Los Angeles area">area</a> with the name and not the <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy%27s.html" title="Tommy's">specific company</a> - it's pointless that way (see the "Joe's Diner" comment above). I did not know about it's pop culture importance (because I'm not a TV watcher) and aside from a layover in JFK, I've never been to NYC, so I wouldn't know about it being on every street, much less the legal issues surrounding it. Had the article been in any condition as it is now (or at least given the hint that it was anything beyond a bunch of restaurants that just happen to have the same name), I would have stubbed it, not VFD'd. As it is now, by all means I agree <b>keep</b>, but I made the call I did for the reasons I did. No apologies (except possibly to the original poster if he/she felt I was on some sort of personal vendetta, which was not the case), no regrets. --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 20:38, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">User:Mitsukai</a>, you shouldn't have to apologize. Folks coming in late and shedding crocodile tears for the innocence abused of someone who can only manage "Ray's Pizza is not Ray's Pizza" should not be in a position of calling for your head, either. The fact that later editors have made the article worthwhile is good, and they should each be applauded. However, the article as nominated was a speedy deletion candidate and was speedy deleted. I believe that all those folks who rescued this feeble effort should be rewarded, and they should be proud of their names in the edit history to the article. However, I don't see why the original submission needs to be honored in any way whatsoever. A phone book could have suggested the topic, as well as those pop culture shows, as well as the syndicated <i>The Next Big Thing</i> radio show (which contained more information in ten seconds than our contributor could muster). I hope we continue to get good treatments of pop topics, but those who believe that I'm threatening unreasonably or intimidating the trembling virgins need to wake up and re-read that original submission. The nomination was valid. The rescue was heroic. The original writing was anemic. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:39, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Contrary to what is stated above, the first two paragraphs of the article (as it now stands) are wholly of my authorship. Would it bother anyone if I just removed these two paragraphs?

<li>I'm not trying to be an ass, but I put the content back. The article doesn't make sense without them there, and content submitted to Wikipedia is licensed under the GFDL. I did note that a rewrite would be welcome in the edit summary; I'll go back and add that to the talk page. My own opinion is that the first two paragraphs that I restored are extremely well written, and they could be rephrased, but I think they'd be hard to beat for the way they fit into the article in its current form. Again, I'm sorry if I seem an ass, but this is the sort of thing that the GFDL was written for; to make sure that content submitted is always available freely. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused">Unfocused</a> 21:07, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

However, I acknowledge my posts are similar to his, and will expound on the reasons. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.217.105.2.html" title="User:205.217.105.2">205.217.105.2</a> 13:03<b>-16:24</b>, 9 May 2005 (UTC) <i>[<b>Forgery Alert.</b> I have corrected the false timestamp on the above contrib, which was altered repeatedly over a period of 3+ hours by its author without updating the timestamp.

<li>I think it's ironic that the IP address you're using for your "I am not Iasson!" posts is the same one which posted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Knowledge_Seeker&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13272745" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Knowledge_Seeker&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=13272745" rel="nofollow">some highly Iasson-esque vandalism to various user pages</a> just a few days ago. Let's face facts: Iasson got a lengthly ban for his disruptive voting policies, and it's highly unlikely that anyone other than a sock would pick up where he left off. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:32, May 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah, but my posts do not fall under policy that banned users should be reverted, because while I have occasionally received temporary blocks, I have not been banned (unlike Iasson). Therefore, to delete my articles without regard to the usual deletion criteria would be unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious, to borrow a phrase from Francis L. Young. I move that the "delete" votes that were based on the mistaken belief that I am Iasson be disregarded. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.217.105.2.html" title="User:205.217.105.2">205.217.105.2</a> 14:50, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, then perhaps you'd care to explain the following: If you're really <i>not</i> Iasson and don't want us to think you are Iasson, then why are you going so far out of your way to look and act like Iasson, right down to the disruptive voting and user-page vandalism?

<dd>Again: That this book is real real real doesn't make it encyclopedic. This is not an argument.</dd>
<dd>The one argument here for "keep" has been importance, i.e. "well-known book", i.e. a good seller, and being mentioned in The Times. That may be and I didn't know of it. That indicates there could be something noteworthy about it beside that it is a book and it has a ISBN and many people bought it (which is not noteworthy by itself).

<li><b>Keep</b> - barely. I'd agree it is not well written, however I've heard very interesting, detailed, and scientific debates on this which made it into a fascinating thought experiment.

<li>The issue of whether this event "actually happened" in the context of the fictional universe, whether Lucas intended for it to happen, etc. is addressed within the article itself.

<li><b>Delete</b> for the same reasons as Gamaliel. Wikipedia explicitly excludes speculation, the propounding of theought experiments, etc. — that's original research (though that term really flatters this article). That the nominator has nominated less obvious articles, or is mass-nominating, is irrelevant to the vote on this one. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 11:02, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd suggest severely condensing (no more than a few sentences) and <b>merging</b> into <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endor.html" title="Endor">Endor</a>. Pretty obvious that the holocaust theory wasn't the intent of Lucas (in fact the article even states that several canonical sources have debunked it). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:32, May 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Non-encyclopedic. A small amount of this article could rewritten for one of the other starwars articles if it's not already covered well enough.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. By the way, when I do VfD closes I always count redirects/merges distinct from keeps and deletes. It seems fairer to me that way. I get a lot of "no consensus" results, but I think that's okay because it reflects the diversity of opinion. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:37, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You mean that the nature of the article is irrelevant; you'll vote to keep for extraneous reasons, ignoring the arguments given for deleting? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 18:16, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Or Stancel may simply be saying their vote is for keeping it. Also, The nominator has been mass-nominating Star Wars articles on Vfd.

<li>Then, as this isn't a mere voting process, but reasons matter, there are at least two, possibly three votes without reasons (or with reasons irrelevant to this article) which need to be supplemented. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 19:00, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Mass-nominating? I nominated <i>three</i> articles on Vfd. Hardly a mass-nomination. Next time you libel me, at least try to make it sound plausible.--<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.123.232.156.html" title="User:67.123.232.156">67.123.232.156</a> 19:03, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Though the attempt to add "..and then deleted" to the Star Wars Wiki template tag would arguably count as an attempt to delete EVERY Star Wars article using it, a whole lot more than three. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenneth_Fisher_1907.html" title="User:John Kenneth Fisher">John Kenneth Fisher</a> 19:50, May 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's true that I did change the template to that. But in that case I was only following the recommendations of the Star Wars Wiki itself (see <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:Community_Portal" class="external autonumber" title="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:Community_Portal" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>). Also, when I did that, I did not <i>nominate</i> the articles, I merely took an action that might eventually lead to the articles' deletion. You cannot say that I mass nominated those articles for deletion, since nominating consists of placing vfd tags and such, as I did with these three (carefully selected) articles.--<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.123.232.156.html" title="User:67.123.232.156">67.123.232.156</a> 03:44, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> for reasons cited by Mel and Andrew. Fancruft surrounding fiction, not verified, apparently contradicted by available facts, no potential to become encyclopedic.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The debate is large enough to be notable and as clearly mentioned in the article there are references in expanded universe canon, both for and against.

<dd><b>Comment</b> While I have vague recollections of seeing the Insider lying on my bro's bedside table (he is an immense star wars fan), the other two sources you cite look like nothing more than essays published online on fan sites. Are they considered canon? Are they even notable? Is every piece of fan speculation on anything that exists notable? This isn't about being pro or anti star wars (I love Star Wars), or even about how much genuine Star Wars information deserves to be on Wikipedia, this is about non-notable non-canon unverifiable speculation about something that didn't happen in a film. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> 00:42, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Technical_Commentaries_8152.html" title="Star Wars Technical Commentaries">Star Wars Technical Commentaries</a> have had their own Wikipedia article since Mar 2004, so they are certainly notable. SW:Insider is a magazine with wide circulation, so it is notable, and the last is a rebuttal to Curis Saxton's (of the SWTC) arguments, and is not that widely known, which is why I said only 2 of the 3 I would consider notable. This is a theory argued about inside the SW:Community, including among magazine editors and physicists. If you go to a convention, you are bound to find either view represented.

<dd>In response to the comment that the article "doesn't seem expandable", by way of comparative illustration, let's take the article on the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Fieldhouse_52d2.html" title="Allen Fieldhouse">Allen Fieldhouse</a> (an article in relation to which Eskog claims major contributions). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allen_Fieldhouse&amp;oldid=13145423" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allen_Fieldhouse&amp;oldid=13145423" rel="nofollow">This article was in the form of an unchanged minor stub for almost 12 months, between inception in June 2004 and early May 2005.</a> Not being an aficionado of historical American college basketball venues in <a href="../../../w/h/a/What%27s_the_Matter_with_Kansas__2b10.html" title="What's the Matter with Kansas?">Kansas</a>, I too may have considered that this rather <i>conventional</i> article did not "seem expandable", given that it concerned some obscure sporting venue in the US Midwest, which no one had seen fit to edit for many months. However, it would not have made the article appropriate for VFd, for all the fundamental reasons Wikipedia exists in the first place.</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, it now appears that Vfds can be assigned a relative weight according to at least 2 variables, namely (a) whether a user is signed in (see above), and (b) whether a user considers that the relevant article "seems expandable" — 10 May 2005.

<li>In my view, the difference between Allen Fieldhouse and Conventional is pretty clear. AFH does not belong in a dictionary any more than Conventional belongs in an encyclopedia.

With the exception of the Starfleet ranks, and a very small portion of the Bajorian insignia, the rest of the info in the article is based on conjectural information which has only been published on unoffical fan sites.

<li><b>Keep</b> I know the TV show doesn't get too much into insignias and such, but are you sure that most of this is speculative? It seems to me that at least one of the many, many, many official and semi-official Trek books out there would cover it. I mean, there are official books covering everything from how to wish your grandma "Happy Birthday" in Klingon ("Quchjaj qoSlIj") to how many moons orbit the sixth planet of the Delta Triciatu system (four). So it seems hard to believe no official source ever laid out what the ranks and insignia are... surely the show's writers at least have style guides to cover such things for the purpose of continuity. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 18:47, May 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Further comment</b> After submitting the above, I had yet another thought: there have been plenty of licensed Star Trek paper RPG materials as well as numerous video games, some of which allow the player to play as various non-Federation races. Surely these materials must cover the ranks and insignia. I am now 98% certain that the article could be preserved with official information if someone looks hard enough. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 19:05, May 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. WikiProject:Star Trek set up the rule of thumb on this which is canon should take precedence, with fanon and conjecture and non-canon being mentioned as trivia. And the official party line from Paramount is that canon is only material seen on screen in a live-action production. So unless a comparative chart of ranks was visible in an episode or movie, or there was considerable on-screen evidence of ranking (i.e. Starfleet), it's very difficult to put together a chart like this that remains within canon. Even official books like the Encyclopedia aren't considered full canon unless a writer makes use of the information therein. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 19:59, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Subject to verification, I vote <b>delete</b> as non-notable trivia, tangentially related to a major fictional body of work, and apparently a mix of non-canon fanfic and possibly some copyvio. I believe we should let the WikiProject:Star Trek editors maintain notable material where it belongs and remove unencyclopedic cruft from WP's article namespace. Per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, this topic doesn't appear to be major or significant, so even if it were verifiable to be canon, it wouldn't merit an article. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:37, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>, while I don't exactly question the notability of the information, I do question whether it deserves its own article. Frankly an article with just a table of the ranks doesn't do anything for me and I don't really see how any expansion will fix this. Personally I think the information should be split to the articles about whatever Race/Organization. Meaning the information about ranks for Klingons should probably be at <a href="../../../k/l/i/Klingon.html" title="Klingon">Klingon</a>. The information on StarFleet is <b>duplicated</b> anyway at <b><a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranks_and_Insignia_of_Starfleet_da7b.html" title="Ranks and Insignia of Starfleet">Ranks and Insignia of Starfleet</a></b>, which is a much more comprehensive article.

<li><b>Keep</b> Nothing wrong with documenting fan speculation about ranks.

<p>NOT DELETE-1th I couldn't create an own website yet.2.the newpapers around here are so greedy they want payment for such a publication,or they told me that either im a freak,cook,weirdo,pervert,madman,etc.etc.etc. or said they have no rome,time or will.Consider it this way:if you would bust your brains out to actually get so,ethink noted,for what you have only paper-evidence(inpenendance proclamations,calls to the people,etc...)and you dont have a skaner,you hope the people will belive you.And if they dont,you have full right to be angry.And if people dont trust one-another anymore,then i ges the worlds gome more to heck than i thought.The principe of a micronation is as far as i know CLAIM and PROCLAMATION.This page does not say(to the best of my knowledge) that in order to be listed here you need a WEBSITE.The first king of Redobda also didnt have a homepage,yet is still recognised.The island also doesnt have any newpaper as far as i know curently,so no newsaper IN REDONDA mentioned the CLAIM for redonda's THRONE.Another thing-why cant a person proclaim a micronation HERE and not be acused of VANDALISM?I could also complain how i used,under various other nicks,knock my Brains out to MODIFY this site nad what do i GET?The COLD SHOULDER,thats what.PEOPLE,have a heart.Besides i've got a internet newpaper (www.solokapr.cz)in witch,"under circumstances"(thats what one of its editors told me)"my case" could be presented.Wait a 2,2 weeks and see(its wery far into the centre of thet newspaper from my home and i need to get all materials together. Your ever-so angry David. Ps:If there wasnt i you STILL woildnt have the deposed monarchs lists from the 19th-before the 17th century.Think about what YOU write in articles and THEN re-consider your aproach on maters,such as Deletion,even though the said thing does not technicaly range beyond the limits of the describsion of a certain subject(i repete the generals for a MICRONATION:A PROCLAMATIOn and NO RECOGNITION.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, no potential to become encyclopedic, impossible to make NPOV. Dozens of lists like this are published (in verifiable media) each year. None adds verifiable factual knowledge to the universe; I don't see that an article about one (which is not an authoritative list from some source more noteworthy than the other dozens) adds usable information to the Wikipedia. At best, this should be merged to an overview of such lists. I don't think even that could be made encyclopedic, since the topic is subjective "worst" rather than "most objectionable on a specific point that could be discussed as a sociological issue." <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:32, 10 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>It is an interesting one. Best/Worst movie lists are ultimately subjective. But, they are a phenomenon which obviously exists (otherwise there wouldn’t be DVDs about them). This article is NPOV. Quoting a list from a DVD is a very good NPOV of presenting this POV phenomenon, in the same way that wikipedia can present a NPOV article on the POV ideologies of, for example, the British Conservative Party (etc.). We are presenting subjectivity in an objective way. The article is not <i>subjectively suggesting</i> a list of the worst movies ever made, it is <i>objectively reporting</i> the opinions of a <i>professionally</i> distributed DVD.<br />

<dd>Also multiscale calculus should be VfD'ed. The operators he describes there are known to me as deRham operators (totally unrelated to de Rham's mainstream work on coholomology), they generate some very interesting fractals, they generate a sub- <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semigroup.html" title="Semigroup">semigroup</a> of the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modular_group.html" title="Modular group">modular group</a>; they generate stuff on the boundary between what's differentiable and what's not. So the suggestion to use them for calculus is ... entertaining. FWIW, they *are* multiscale, (they're fractal) which is why this person finds them handy for financial analysis. On the other hand, the smell of money is infamous for attracting kook math to the financial markets. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 16:04, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Please <b>Keep</b> as a separate article. The reason we do this, and continue to do it, is to spin off excessive detail from the articles on major composers where it is off-putting to a reader to be immediately bogged down in a morass of detail on the composer's name, the controversy over his birthdate, the controversy over his nationality, and other minor issues which detract from the flow of the main biographical article. There is a respectable precedent established on other composer articles for this practice (see for example the satellite articles around <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beethoven.html" title="Beethoven">Beethoven</a>). <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> 23:48, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>: As the nominator points out, and as I pointed out on the takpage months ago, <i>the article shows several clear anachronistic misconceptions about names in the 18th century</i>, such as the idea that a certain (Latin) form of a name in a baptismal record would be "decisive for its purpose", i.e. determine the exact form of a person's name for life, or that composers were exceptional in changing the form or spelling of their name according to language and other circumstances.

<li>The <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozart.html" title="Mozart">Mozart</a> article in its current state is hardly unweildy and the addition of a section devoted to Mozart's name would <i>not</i> significantly detract from it's readability. If the <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozart%27s_name.html" title="Mozart's name">Mozart's name</a> article held a large amount of information, or showed potential to have, it would be a different story. This, however, is not the case. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> is correct in that the information is not worthy of it's own article and needs to be shortened dramatically even if not merged. As <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> pointed out, a small section on Mozart's name inside the main Mozart article would not bog down anyone looking for other information. No one is forced to read <i>anything</i> on any article, (except maybe the first sentence), especially if the information were put in it's own section. If properly integrated, the information on the name of Mozart would <i>not</i> "detract from the flow" of the main article. In it's current form, the information is not easy to find, even if you're looking specifically for it. <a href="../../../r/m/r/User%7ERmrfstar_ff0f.html" title="User:Rmrfstar">Rmrfstar</a> 16:00, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm responsible for the existence of this article, though not most of its content. It put it as a separate article because people kept putting little anecdotes about Mozart's name right at the top of the Mozart article, where it seriously disrupted the expository flow and sounded amateurish. <a href="../../../r/m/r/User%7ERmrfstar_ff0f.html" title="User:Rmrfstar">Rmrfstar</a>, who wants simply to have a short discussion in the main article, is not taking into account a widespread phenomenon in the Wikipedia composer bios: people are always putting in little anecdotes without regard to whether their contribution is disrupting the organization of the article. Satellite articles provide a way of accommodating these little anecdotes without making the main article incoherent. If we actually delete information, as Rmrfstar is proposing, it will all come back sooner or later, re-disrupting the main article. <a href="../../../o/p/u/User%7EOpus33_8708.html" title="User:Opus33">Opus33</a> 16:05, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

I do, though, believe that some information may be added concerning Mozart's chosen name <i>Amadeus</i>, and the multiple interpretations of it's meaning, (especially relating to his competition with <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salieri.html" title="Salieri">Salieri</a>).

<li>I really don't understand why anyone is opposed to the existance Country and anti-Semitism articles. They seem to have the right scope and are encyclopedic by nature.

<li>Could it even get off the ground in the first place? IIRC there was no significant Jewish presence in the region long before the state of <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saudi_Arabia_53d2.html" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> even existed, and nowadays Jews are not allowed in to the country, so there's not much to write about.
