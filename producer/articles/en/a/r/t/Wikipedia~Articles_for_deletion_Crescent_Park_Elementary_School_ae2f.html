Perhaps you would benefit from thinking of it as the Ongoing debate and discussion on what level of detail is needed to create a comprehensive wikipedia, which while not trpping off the tongue at least frames the disagreement in a way that shows that we have the same goal (a comprehensive wikipedia) with diverging views on how to get there. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> 15:36, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> because this is an elementary school which is notable. The statement that "all other elementary schools normally get erased" is patently false.

There only appear to be 2 elementary schools deleted since improvement efforts targeting school-related articles began in March 2005. Two elementary school articles deleted, out of roughly 180 school-related pages nominated for deletion.

<li>Actually, with Tony having abandoned the Schoolwatch program as well as his not voting or improving school articles, elementary schools are in great short-term danger on an article-by-article basis.

<li>Bethel Maine is a town of just a little more than 2000 people so it is only important for <i>only</i> 2000 people so its still very non-notable. The elementary school nearby got about 2000 students but that doesn't mean it is still notable. There should be a limit on schools I belive. All High schools and higher should be kept and im willing to expand on it but under that it is Way to much unless it is signifantly expanded in which in this case it won't too small of a school.--<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranda56_4537.html" title="User:Aranda56">Aranda56</a> 19:21, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm amazed at the staggering presumption of people who believe that because something is of no importance to <i>them</i>, personally, <i>now</i>, it is never going to have any significance to anyone, ever.

<dd>I asked you whether it was of importance to you; you didn't answer. I'm amazed at the staggering presumption of people who think they know what future historians and social scientists will care about (our ancestors certainly didn't), and at the gall to assume that Wikipedia must be hijacked to serve the needs of future historians. I'm sure if they want to know about the school system, there's a Department of Education report that gives more useful information then Wikipedia, and that for every school. Personally, I think that future historians might be very intersted in garage bands and what they mean about the role and level of average people as artistic creators, and find it much harder to get their hands on the information. But I don't think that's a hole that Wikipedia is designed to fill.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 12:46, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's 2 million words per penny only if you don't care about your data or the speed of I/O. RAIDed SCSI drives, for a server like Wikipedia, cost a lot more. And how will they fix vandalism? If I start Joe Mercer Elementary School and write that it's in Alva, Oklahoma, what are the odds that any of the one or two Wikipedians that know anything about elementary schools in Alva, Oklahoma will notice and fix it? What if I change something on <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crescent_Park_Elementary_School_8ec9.html" title="Crescent Park Elementary School">Crescent Park Elementary School</a> long after this VfD has been forgotten, say the number of students, how many people will know whether it's correct or not?--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 12:55, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, it's a little elementary school. It's nothing to do with the servers or 'clogging things up', it's the vague and fading dream that Wikipedia should actually have some kind of quality control, ensuring only things that are encyclopaedic have, you know, an encyclopedia article. Wikipedia is NOT <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everything2.html" title="Everything2">Everything2</a>. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a web directory. Wikipedia is not toilet paper. Sadly, too many Wikipedians really, <i>really</i> want to see Wikipedia regurgitate every inconsequential, non-notable, unimportant collection of four walls and a roof back onto the internet. It does no harm for these 'articles' to exist? Today schools, tomorrow every church, every branch of McDonalds, every pub, every telegraph pole, every field, and so on, ad nauseum. A line needs to be drawn. The only people that would care about this information (the good people of <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethel%2C_Maine_f46a.html" title="Bethel, Maine">Bethel, Maine</a>) would already have it.

<li>What on earth does this mean? "We need more votes"??? You've already expressed your opinions above. There is no concensus on school articles and the vast majority survive the AfD process. There are plenty of AfD nominations for schools every week that clearly demonstrate this to be the case. Some bizarre statement that "we need more votes" is truly baffling. We will continue to vote until we are blue in the face, but there will still be no concensus.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 04:12, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
