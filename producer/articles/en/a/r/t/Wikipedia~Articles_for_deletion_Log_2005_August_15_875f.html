<p>OK I'm bringing this one in as kind of a test case. Hayashi Yoichi seems to work for <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konami.html" title="Konami">Konami</a> on music video games. The article is linked to from the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bemani_musicians_3e9d.html" title="List of Bemani musicians">List of Bemani musicians</a>, Bemani being the name of Konami's musical games division. The list itself seems questionable to me in it's notability, but the sheer volume of red links to other music video game artists kind of scares me. I don't really think working on a musical video game is terribly notable, but I'm interested in hearing community opinion. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">Ëvilphoenix</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">Burn!</a></b></small></sup> 03:44, August 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>After a quick look over the parent list article, it seems to be some kind of ugly, ugly list of various people who work in Konami's music department, and an unverifiable list of pseudonyms they've worked under. I've removed all the redlinks, to try and discourage further ones being made. I'd be tempted to remove all the pseudonyms (or at least most of them) on the list, also. But that's sidetracking. The actual article you've nominated is a <b>delete</b> as not notable IMO, but some of the people on the list are more notable than Mr Yoichi, so be carful about mass-nominating them all. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 11:05, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I'm not mass nominating anyone yet, most of the links on that list were red, I just wanted to establish some kind of precedent first, by seeing how this nomination fared. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">Ëvilphoenix</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">Burn!</a></b></small></sup> 16:06, August 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><strike><b>No vote</b></strike> (see vote below). I'm sincerely conflicted on this one. Merely having a credit on a game does not make one notable, anymore than being Gaffer on a film would make one notable. On the other hand, its clear that a game music composer or sound designer <i>could</i> be notable. It's just that this article doesn't actually assert that notability in any way I can understand. I'd like to invite the author of the article to clearly state why this person is notable, beyond his name appearing in the credits of a game. I almost wish there was a variant of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> specifically for "embedded music" such as in movies and games to provide us with guidance. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 12:54, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You misunderstand, of course, just as you misstate my intentions. Perhaps you should stick to describing your own rather than inventing motivations for others.

<li><b>Comment</b>. What we seem to have here is a school with a considerable commitment to excellence particularly in sport. Its alumni have gone on to join the National Gymnastics team, Track and Field Olympic teams--one guy was once rated 5th in the world--Olympic Beach Volleyball, Olympic Paddling Team, National ski and freestyle ski teams, and even a NHL referee and a St Louis Blues (NHL) player. This isn't quite like having <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Beckenbauer_9676.html" title="Franz Beckenbauer">Franz Beckenbauer</a> or <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Charlton_1adb.html" title="Jackie Charlton">Jackie Charlton</a> as an alumnus, but it's close.

<li>Well, you've created exactly the sort of Alumni list I already said I wasn't impressed with. So to me, this doesn't count as creating a good expanded article, this is just filling space for the sake of filling space. I want some form of proof that the school created these great athletes, not that they just happened to live in the area (I went to school with an Olympic swimming finalist, and I can guarantee the school had nothing whatsoever to do with her competing at the Olympics). So while, say, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permian_High_School_0544.html" title="Permian High School">Permian High School</a> gets an article because of sports achievement, it is the sports achievement of the school (National champions, featured in a book and a film) rather than that of people who happened to go to the school.<a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 22:08, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I gave an example of a National Champions, of a country with a population of just under 300 million, a team that almost uniquely has more than just the parents of the players turning up to watch it (they have their own stadium that can seat thousands), and you expect me to be impressed by badminton champions in the 18 year old age category from a population of 800,000 is impressive? Exactly how many 18 year old badminton players do you think there are in North Ontario? It's just local padding, it might make a brief mention in the local news, it won't make the national news, there won't be any books written on them by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists, and nobody will make a film about them. 128.243.220.41 10:06, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>PSimon removed relevant References to this article. What he/she saw offending in referencing the original Korzybski book on the structural differential is beyond rational discussion. Also, the description of the structural differential is next to meaningless without the graph I was going to add. Hovewer, altercation with censors of the PSimon ilk is not worth my time.

<li><b>Abstain</b>. Examination of history does not support the claim that Cruise was "mass adding" links.

<li><b>Keep</b> and restore Cruise links and references, SimonP deleted even PRINTED references, not only external links. I have recently read much of Cruise additions and they look serious.

I prefer to assume good faith, and not to scare newcomers to Wiki, so unless SimonP or sb else can prove to me Cruise works is fiction/vandalism, I definetly support Cruise and object to SimonP deletetion of useful info.

<li><b>Keep</b> This article serves to explain the basis behind political simulators and what they are- the user who voted for deletion was the manager of CanadaGovSim and has been banned from several political sims, as has been said, so the case for deletion is biased. --Nightsabre- not a registered user, but knows the politics behind this</li>

<p>just to clear up some misunformation, the only government simulations I was banned from were those I asked to be banned from because of the constant personal attacks against me. the admin of PolCan decided to turn this entire thing political and take a shot at me over wikipedia. this is my responce. whatever the result of this vote is I will respect. <a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPellaken_97c4.html" title="User:Pellaken">Pellaken</a> 18:47, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

Believe it or not: there <i>is</i> a proposal to just standardize infoboxes - which have been used successfully by hundreds of projects. It is not easy to get a Project to work, many die. Imposing rules on the participants will no doubt scare hundreds of users who have expert-knowledge away. The benefits of this standardization are nonexistent.

That is, the outcome of that page could be either "there should be standardization", or "there shouldn't be".

<li><small><s><b>Keep</b></s> maybe. As far as I know, a chinese box is a box within a box, within a box, etc. It's also an expression and a famous thought experiment. In terms of the torture device, it does seem like something that would be written about in the 19th century, when China and the far east were "exotic" and any tale of bizarre torture would please 19th century audiences, whether they are true or not. Both cited sources are real. Thus, if the article were written in terms of how this 19th century term for a torture device came about, etc., then I say keep the article. The device is obviously an exaggeration, but there may be something to the myth which might be worth preserving. Of course the article as such does none of this. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 01:57, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd><small>There is a disambiguation page that provides links to the box-within-a-box and to the famous thought experiment (and to a film as well). There is no need for another one. At least one cited source is real, but as I said, it does not mention this device (which suggests it is not true). The other one is more elusive. As I said above "Sair is not a China scholar so even if the book existed it would only prove that in 1944 people wrote dumb things about China. If it were real a real scholar would have mentioned it. They do not." What is worth preserving and where is the evidence for it? <a href="../../../l/a/o/User%7ELao_Wai_79b4.html" title="User:Lao Wai">Lao Wai</a> 11:10, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</small>

<dd><small>Granted, but even if this Sair fellow is not a Chinese scholar, he might have used reliable sources in his book. I think someone, preferably the original editor of the article, should produce a more specific citation of the Sair book, or check which original sources he used before we discredit the whole thing. That being said, it sounds like this article is more of a myth than a hoax, and from that angle, the myth of the so-called Chinese box can be written about. I think we should at least give the editor the benefit of the doubt. I agree, in 1944 people probably wrote dumb things about China (and about a bunch of other things), but dumb things usually have a source in the collective unconscious of the time and reflect interesting cultural trends. This is why myths are worth preserving, so we can understand how our thinking has evolved over time and why we see things the way we do. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 14:15, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><small>Been there, read that. Not a bad book really. I guess Jane Austen got a little too boring for him. It refers to <i>one</i> case in modern China in which a man was allegedly chained up outside where the mosquitos bit him. And another few cases from the rest of the world. As far as myths go I am happy enough with moving the page to Sexual Fetishism or the like. It seems more appropriate and as long as it is rewritten that way.

<p>I think I'm going to have to renominate this, because otherwise it just serves to undermine VFD process. The article has not undergone a VFU and so should not have been reposted, regardless of merit. I also disagree with the unnecessary inclusion of non-prominent actors in a serious encyclopaedia. 80 films is actually very little for a porn star. Most notable porn actors/actresses have appeared in several hundred.

<li>Actually a contested speedy (and this one certainly was contestable) can be recreated with exactly the same content. The rule against recreation of deleted content doesn't apply to speedies for this reason--such articles should be taken to VfD unless they obviously fall under a CSD. The initial version of this article accurately described the porn star, thus providing ample context to enable the article to be extended, and asserted notability; it wasn't even remotely speediable. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:00, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note</b> Verifying the notoriety of porn stars via a standard google search is highly dubious. The vast majority (over 90%) will be spam or commercial sites, which demonstrate nothing. A more accurate method is to use the Image Search with filtering turned off. This results in about <b>350 hits for "Monique DeMoan"</b> , not many. Comparatively, an image search for "Tower of London" returns 23,000; "The Beatles" returns 170,000.</li>

<li>My point was that a prominent and notable person, such as Robert Countess, only gets 816 google hits because his field doesn't lend itself to internet sites, whereas a much less notable porn star, by virtue of her field of endeavor, recieves a misleadingly high amount of internet hits. Further proof of google's bias: <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clement_Kayishima_789e.html" title="Clement Kayishima">Clement Kayishema</a> gets 962 hits, while <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanchlaeni.html" title="Melanchlaeni">Melanchlaeni</a> get 92.

<li><b>Comment</b> That's a very good point, Scimitar. The deMoan debate has, if nothing else, highlighted how widely good, well-meaning editors can disagree in assessing the notability of persons. A corollary to your excellent point about things that are popular on the net is the differing perception of notability in the things that one does. It has been repeatedly pointed by excellent commentators that the sentence "X is an American porn-star" itself establishes a basis for notability. Being a porn-star is felt to be notable, <b>in and of itself</b>. This is quite extraordinary, when one considers that none of the following sentences, for example, would be thought to indicate notability: "X is an American dermatologist," "X is a British lawyer," "X is a Japanese researcher," "X is a writer," "X is a chess player;" this last of course, being the prototypical CSD candidate. A one-sentence article containing any of the preceding would be immediate candidates for CSD (assuming for the purposes of discussion that X is simply an ordinary, regular member of his or her profession). However, an ordinary, completely unremarkable pornstar has apparently a firm claim to notability, and inclusion in an encyclopedia — <i>simply by virtue of being a pornstar</i>. Ie. we have, incredibly, elevated pornstars to the level of US presidents and senators. It doesn't matter if they are the most unremarkable, unnotable of their kind — they still get in.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><sup><font color="#000">ζ</font></sup></a> 23:19:17, 2005-08-15 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think this may be a confusion between what <i>asserts</i> notability and what <i>establishes</i> it. A claim that X is a porn star is an <i>assertion</i> of notability that (if a sanity check on google seems to confirm it) means the article can come to VfD where we decide whether or not notability is <i>established</i>. And that is something we decide by discussing amongst ourselves. An article about a US senator probably wouldn't end up on VfD; I expect we'd just say "speedy keep" and move on to the next item--not so with an article about a porn star. Monique DeMoan may or may not be notable enough for Wikipedia. That's what we're here to determine. She doesn't get an automatic "in" just for lying on her back and gargling sperm. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 23:40, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Thanks for your thoughts, Tony</b>. That's really the point I'm making: that being a pornstar <i><b>is</b></i> apparently an <i>assertion of notability</i>. <i>Why is it</i>? What is it about simply <i>being</i> a pornstar that automatically makes it an assertion of notability? This view supposes that pornstarhood is inherently a claim or assertion of notability. Yet if we follow the reasoning that merely being a member of the pornstar profession is a claim to notability, that leaves us with problems. Is <b>"X is an accountant"</b> an assertion of notability? What about <b>"X is an epidemiologist"</b>? You seem to be saying that if someone asserts they do something professionally, then they have asserted notability. If you are <i>not</i> saying that, then you are using some method of distinguishing the "notability merits" of professions that I am unfamiliar with. Because if "pornstar" is an automatic assertion of notability but "biologist" is not, how are you distinguishing them? I would find it difficult, if only because being, say, a neurosurgeon means being a member of a <i>far smaller</i>, <i>far more selective</i> group than being a pornstar. Yet if I wrote an article with only the sentence "X is an American neurosurgeon" here, it will be knocked out, almost certainly with CSD (assume X is a regular, ordinary neurosurgeon who when you google him has an office address and online CV). What are your criteria for distinguishing which professions are automatic assertions of notability? If they are WP criteria, Tony, I hope you can point them out to me, because I'd like to learn them to make sure my time on VfD is more usefully spent for my fellow Wikipedians. Finally, if you are not using distinguishing criteria but simply believe that "X is _____(profession)" <i>automatically rules out CSD</i>, since it is an assertion of notability, may I ask you to kindly consider where that leaves CSD A7? It would mean that all those A7s we've been passing, on articles like "<b>X is a computer developer</b>," are invalid. You appreciate the difficulty? Very kind regards—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><sup><font color="#000">ζ</font></sup></a> 00:41:44, 2005-08-16 (UTC)

<li>Well I fought this new CSD tooth and nail because it's very ambiguous. The wording was something like "bakers aren't notable but professors may be". I still thought that was ambiguous, and I believe I warned that in the event it did pass we'd have stub articles about professors being speedied instead of VfD'd (this is important in my country because professors are pretty rare--I know in some countries the title is handed around like sticks of chewing gum). And this is indeed what has happened--sysops on RC patrol are deleting stubs which could be expanded easily.</li>
<li>But we've got it and the compromise interpretation I've arrived at is that if I, a sysop who looks at the article, think a description of a profession amounts to an assertion of notability, then it is. Other sysops may look and see no such assertion. If there's doubt like this (eg: sysops in good faith deciding an article is deletable, and other sysops deciding it isn't) the policy is at least clear that the thing goes to VfD anyway. And I'm reasonably happy with that. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 00:58, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li>Actually, the proposal explicitly noted that "people such as college professors or <b>actors</b> may be individually important in society." This certainly suggests that a person being an actor is a sufficient assertion of notability to demand a VFD. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 04:25, 2005 August 16 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Tony:</b> Participating in VfD has been a productive experience for me, and the main thing I've learned is that it's not straightforward. Many of the guidelines are sensible, but it is no less true that there are a few (it seems especially some newer ones) which offer conflicting interpretations. For example, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, which I don't use when doing VfD, has arbitrary cut-offs that go against the spirit of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>; in some cases it is very illogical in its discrimination of professions. For example, an actor may merit inclusion in WP if he has starred in a commercial film that was seen by just 5000 people; a professional scientist on the other hand only merits inclusion if her "work is recognized as exceptional and likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field." So we have the ridiculous situation where the bar is set ludicrously low for one profession, and extremely high for another. The irony of course is that it is arguable that of the two professions, it is the latter that is <i>intrinsically</i> more notable even to begin with; it is certainly incomparably more selective.</li>
<li>Be that as it may, I do disagree with you wrt the CSD, especially in this particular case, Tony. There is nothing in the CSD that requires "X is a pornstar" to be interpreted as an automatic <i>assertion of notability</i> in and of itself. That's the reason it is difficult for us to provide a reason why "X is a pornstar" is an assertion of notability, but "X is a particle physicist" is not. <b>In truth, in neither instance has the assertion standard been met</b>. If the sentence was, "X is a legendary pornstar felt by many to be the greatest artist in adult movie making in the 1980s," yes, <i>that</i> is an assertion of notability. "X is a pornstar" simply isn't. The old deMoan "article" clearly qualified for CSD, and was validly deleted. (Equally, I think the recreation was valid). It is instructive to note the concluding sentences on notability on the <a href="../../../d/v/a/WP%7EDVAIN_b5dd.html" title="WP:DVAIN">WP:DVAIN</a> page: <i>...For instance, if the person's profession is cited, a reasonable guideline would be how many people have the same profession: there are tens of thousands of porn models, but very few senators.</i> Kind regards—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><sup><font color="#000">ζ</font></sup></a>&#160; 12:01:30, 2005-08-16 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, my point being that I interpreted your point as being one about the bias of Wikipedia rather than the bias of Google; e.g. I read your point as being we are already too inclusive in this area, and need in some way to stem the flow.

<li>This rather overlooks the fact that Monique DeMoan has performed in principally VHS and DVD-based pornography, rather than website-based porn. In fact some of her most prolific years were immediately prior to the era of internet porn. Google is never much use for gauging the notability of anyone, it's just a useful sanity check. The large number of mainstream porn movies (rather than net-based shorts) that she has appeared in is a much better guide. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:56, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The debate over this article shows that there is a serious dispute over just what people considers is a "notable" pornstar. This argument will keep resurfacing until a consensus is reached, so I'm offering a few facts to try to poke this debate into a consensus:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="../../../6/0/_/60_Minutes_b078.html" title="60 Minutes">60 Minutes</a> segment on the porn industry noted that 70% of the women who start out as porn actresses survive only 1 movie.</li>
<li>Is the individual somehow acknowledged for their work in some way other than the kinds of sexual acts she/he engages in? I ask this because if one were to detail the activities of these people, a lot of what they do in front of the camera either conforms to a job description from a resume/CV (e.g., "while working for this producer, I not only had sex with every man, woman or animal as the script demanded, but also convincingly expressed my satisfaction with that individual"), or resembles the typical Monday morning boastings of the previous weekend (e.g., "you won't believe how drunk/stoned/etc I got the other night"). Before someone accuses me of dismissing all people in this category, I would defend individuals like <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linda_Lovelace_f18d.html" title="Linda Lovelace">Linda Lovelace</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Chambers_3921.html" title="Marilyn Chambers">Marilyn Chambers</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandy_Alexandre_%28pornstar%29_74b7.html" title="Brandy Alexandre (pornstar)">Brandy Alexandre (pornstar)</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunset_Thomas_a088.html" title="Sunset Thomas">Sunset Thomas</a>, &amp; a few others as worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. (Note: the Wikipedia article on Brandy Alexandre currently fails to even mention her significant 'Net career.)</li>
<li>Can something worthwhile be said for the movies they appeared in? I ask this because whle some porno movies did have an effect on popular culture (<a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_throat.html" title="Deep throat">Deep throat</a> is a defensible example), can the same be said for, say, "Sleezy Lovin' Sisters #22"?</li>
</ul>

As others have said, that VfU should never have happened (and was never required) in the first place. Notability already seems to have been established above and in several previous discussions. Additionally, Erwin seems to be mistaken about the fashion in which this article was deleted, saying that it would "undermine the VfD process." To my knowledge, this article was never the subject of a successful VfD in any incarnation (but it was the subject of one botched one that appeared to be heavily leaning towards "keep"); therefore no outcome here could possibly undermine the VfD process. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 22:30, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Might I humbly suggest that this should be an end to star chambers where a sheep-vote is rendered as a rubber stamp on the summary deletion by a single person. Once undeleted, a disputed speedy can be seen, and edited, and submitted for deletion if necessary. VfD has been criticised of late, but it's not as tyrannous and anti-wiki as VFU, where votes are carried out concerning an article most people cannot see and nobody can edit during the vote. VfD and VFU should be amalgamated and no speedy deletion challenged by any administrator should ever remain deleted merely because its deletion has already been challenged by a non administrator. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:58, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. As a result of my objections to the ridiculous criteria involved in classifying people as "Jews", I think my vote is appropriately regarded as a superfluous afterthought. The only reason the article was even created was as a result of splitting up the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jews_2000.html" title="List of Jews">List of Jews</a> article, per the discussion that took place on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Jews_bb79.html" title="Talk:List of Jews">its TALK page</a>.

In any case, I'll suggest to the site owners that they catalogue this site in wikipedia (it is a notable resource in the saltwater aquarium hobby, and "The Sump" is the off-topic discussion area).

<li>What constitutes enough baring on anything to allow a word to be recorded in the annals of this illustrious internet word bank? Let’s not forget, wikipedia is an internet based phenomenon that allows people to change the meaning of the language with modern speech. This word is internet related in nature, and therefore, it relates to this internet based site. The word is new and not widely used because it is internet forum based. Ask someone what a “blog” is a few years ago and see if they thought the word had any baring on anything. Thanks…I’m done now.
<ul>
<li>A few years ago, when blog was not a notable word, it wouldn't have merited an article. Now it is a notable concept, so it does. Wikipedia is not a means by which to spread your little in-joke made-up word.

<li>New words enter the lexicon all of the time. Someone above cited "blog" as an example. I'm sure that there are many examples of words that are new and strange at first that are now considered a normal part of the lexicon. --- Bierboy</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>I for one think that fjact should be a part of the English language. Why? Well, because there are all kinds of English words that give teachers teaching young children to read absolute fits because they are not spelled the way they sound. Furthermore, adding Fjact to Wikipedia will increase Wikipedia's accuracy. There are people in this world who use the word Fjact all the time. And I do mean all the time, in fact some of those people use it so much that it just gets tiring, and I end up making my way to bjed for the evening. -- kjnucklehead</li>

<p>It seems hopelessly confusing to have two separate lists: a list of Mormons and a list of Latter-day Saints. The biggest problem is the redundancy between lists. If a Wikipedia reader sees one list, they may not think to look at the other list, or if they add an entry to one list, they may not think to add an entry to another list. If there is to be made a distinction in some cases between Mormon and Latter-day Saint, that can be done on the one-page list itself, and not through nebulous and unstated differences between the two lists. 149.169.29.84 18:44, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

I wouldn't even consider it fan fiction; it much rather includes 3D art, original musical themes, etc. I vote to <b>keep it</b>, since I'm also aware that he's been working on a feature film project, which he'll be directing, for quite some time.

<li>Wow. I just wanted to set straight that (as Jim24 suspected), Alex in fact did <i><b>not</b></i> create that page himself. He doesn't even know about it. I know that because it was me, a very good and old friend of his. In fact, Alex would be the last to even consider doing something like this. If you read his blog, you get a sense that he's a modest and quite funny guy. Anyway, I don't feel I have to right to vote, so do what you believe is right. Just wanted to prevent you from getting a false impression of the guy I call a friend. Have a good day!&#160;:-)</li>

<dd>Comment: The <b>Delete</b> votes (including this one) aren't concerned with <i>who</i> wrote the article. Vanity is a frequent assumption when a non-notable bio appears, but regardless, it's still a non-notable bio, which is (regardless of authorship) grounds for deletion.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: If a user thinks an article inaccurate a user is welcome to enhance it. Inaccuracy is not a basis for deletion. I certainly do not think it makes sense to redirect this page to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreskin.html" title="Foreskin">foreskin</a>. It is quite clear that <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">user:jayjg</a> is intent on using wikipedia as soapbox by censoring all information on it that contravenes his ideas about circumcision, the foreskin, or even antisemitism. He is not open to even including information that others do not share his views. Take a look at his edits for proof. He chronically complains of other users not co-operating with him, yet shows little interest in co-operating with others. For example he did not bother to explain his reasons for redirecting the page on the discussion page when he did so. His edit summaries read as arrogant, demeaning and even threatening. This is the basis of the <a href="../../../r/f/c/Rfc.html" title="Rfc">rfc</a> that has been filed against him at Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Jayjg. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESirkumsize_bddf.html" title="User talk:Sirkumsize">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sirkumsize_41f5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sirkumsize">contribs</a>).

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>redirect</b>. "Very rare" is likely notable when extrapolated from the general population, howerver, this article is dictionary definition in scope.

Still, there's always wikitictionary, dictionary.com, etc., to draw out that sentence as pertaining to Aposthia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Looks like a reasonable article to me. Agree with the unsigned comment two above that redirecting a condition meaning "no foreskin" to "foreskin" could quite easiy cause confusion unless it it mentioned right up in the first paragraph. I also think there is plenty of scope for expansion: Are other mammals born with this condition? Is it ever treated - perhaps with reconstructive surgery? Who are the "key people in Jewish history"? Which other notable people have had this condition?

<li><b>Comment</b> Yeah, you'll notice the actual term "Typoglycemia" doesn't appear in the Snopes article, nor did it in the original email I got a year or so ago - it seems like at the very least that the word itself was made up recently in that way that internet memes evolve... <a href="../../../k/j/l/User%7EKjl_4874.html" title="User:Kjl">Kjl</a> 01:36, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Well, I originally started this Vfd (my first - be gentle, please) but now that the article is being expanded, it looks like a keeper to me as well. How do I go about removing the Vfd? In other news, where is the correct place to discuss the accuracy of the article? In particular, I don't think there is any element of truth to it at all - I think the "random jumbling" of letters in the email is not random at all; in particular, you'll notice that in all of the words, the ordering of the consonants is kept consistent, or if consonant order has been changed, only adjacent consonants have been switched, and then not separated by intervening vowels (e.g. <i>according</i>-&gt;<i>aoccdrnig</i> (accrdng-&gt;accdrng) &amp; <i>phenomenal</i>-&gt;<i>phaonmneal</i> (both phnmnl), <i>Cambridge</i>-&gt;<i>Cmabrigde</i> (cmbrdg-&gt;cmbrgd)), but it is much harder to read, of course, if the letter order is actually jumbled: (e.g. <i>phenomenal</i>-&gt;<i>pneanoemhl</i>, <i>According</i>-&gt;<i>adinroccg</i> or <i>Cambridge</i>-&gt;<i>Cimgadrbe</i>). I'd just go edit the article myself, but I don't want to be all POV about it&#160;;) <a href="../../../k/j/l/User%7EKjl_4874.html" title="User:Kjl">Kjl</a> 00:36, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>To close a VfD, you sit back for a few days until the lag time is over and an administrator determines there are enough Keep votes to keep the article, and (s)he will remove the VfD tag.

I assume it's a legit thing, although I always thought that Lord Lieutenants only were assigned to places with a degree of independence from the UK, but I guess not. As I said, a real article on the subject would be fine, but a redlink with a question mark after it is not an article. The fact that you read it and still have no idea what it isevidence of that. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:34, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>OK, I reviewed the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord-Lieutenant_b2dc.html" title="Lord-Lieutenant">Lord-Lieutenant</a> article and I think I have a decent idea of the situation.

It's an article that is intended to explain the differences in ontology and methods between the two different sides on the Creationism-Versus-Science, Intelligent-Design-versus-Evolution, camps. There are currently several different articles that discuss these different issues, adn all of them share this same difference of views. Rather than have multiple articles report the same chunk of text, the idea was to have one article cover the difference in views and have all teh Creationism, ID, Teach the controversy articles reference this article. The article title sucks, but that can be fixed. I just wanted to start piecing something together so teh editors on the Creationism/ID/teach the controversy articles could take a look.

<dd>I've renamed the article "Ontology and methodology of evolutionary alternatives". I don't want to use a name like "one sides critique of the other side" because it's inherently POV. I did use the term "evolutionary" because that's the one term that all the debates have in common. evolution v creationism. evolution v intelligent design, and because "intelligent design" folks usually distance themselves from the term "creationism", and also some of the "teach the controversy" folks don't even argue that they are <i>for</i> intelligent design, but that they are simply arguing that evolution has methodological problems, so they wont even want to be associated with the term "ID". Therefore the word "alternatives" was intended to reflect (evolution, creationism, creation science, intelligent design, teach the controversy, etc). as for my "pocket" definitions, the current definitions of terms were taken from dictionaries. And I've started to add quotes to show how the different sides use the terms to defend their side and/or criticize the other side. <a href="../../../f/u/e/User%7EFuelWagon_d995.html" title="User:FuelWagon">FuelWagon</a> 13:53, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When creationists accuse evolutionists of "methodlogical naturalism", and when the reply says that is different than their "ontological supernaturalism", then this article applies exactly, and explains and represents both sides of those two points of view.If someoen is arguing for creation because "the bible says so", then this doesn't apply.

<dd>This article was intended specifically to report the different philosophical/ontological/methodological views around evolution, creationism, intelligent design, and teach teh controversy topics. Yes, there is a methodological naturalism article, but that doesn't have to be limited to how life began on earth. and an article like Ontological supernaturalism really covers everythign from religious beliefs, mysticism, and transcendentalism. I'm specifically trying to limit this article to how these four views relate to the topic of how life began on earth. The term "methodological naturalism" has become an insult hurled by creationists against evolutionists. And evolutionists often respond that their methodology is separate from their ontology, i.e. that they can be natural scientists around evolution but still believe in god. So I want one article that explains ontology, that explains methodology, and how the different views show up in the debates around evolution, intelligent design, creationism, and the like. If a reader is going through an article on "Intelligent Design" and sees the term "methodological naturalism", for them to actually get all the different points of view around that term, they would have to go to four different articles. And those articles wouldn't neccessarily be limited to how life started on earth. <a href="../../../f/u/e/User%7EFuelWagon_d995.html" title="User:FuelWagon">FuelWagon</a> 14:05, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The ontology and methodology of evolutionary alternatives (evolution, creationism, intelligent design, etc) have been attacked and defended by both sided of the debates.</p>
<p>Creationists call evolutionist's subscription to methodological naturalism a "religion to be accepted on faith"<a href="http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=565" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=565" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> and claim that "methodological naturalism cannot be justified as a normative principle for all types of science--without doing violence to science"<a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=94" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=94" rel="nofollow">[23]</a></p>
<p>Evolutionists respond that "methodological naturalism is not a 'doctrine' but an essential aspect of the methodology of science, the study of the natural universe."<a href="http://chem.tufts.edu/AnswersInScience/MethodologicalNaturalism.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://chem.tufts.edu/AnswersInScience/MethodologicalNaturalism.htm" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> "Science must assume that everything can be investigated empirically, but this doesn't force the abandonment of the supernatural, for those who want it."<a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/naturalism.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/naturalism.html" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> Evolutionists defend their methodlogical naturalism and argue it does not exclude holding a religious belief system or an ontological supernaturalism.</p>
<p>These differing views implies four distinct worldviews: <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontological_supernaturalism.html" title="Ontological supernaturalism">Ontological supernaturalism</a>(OS), Ontological naturalism(ON), Methodlogical supernaturalism(MS), and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodological_naturalism.html" title="Methodological naturalism">Methodological naturalism</a>(MN) which separate the debate.</p>

<p><b>Comment:</b> FuelWagon, as it is much of it still looks like original research. I am not saying that it isn't interesting, only that much of it isnt applicable to wikipedia. Sections 1 to 3 don't have any references at all, they are just presented as bare statements. Who wrote the book or authored the website or wrote the essay that first presented this schema? Who later then further popularised it? Who are its proponents, who are its critics? et cetera. You should describe how this classification came about, proposed by so and so in this book or that website etc etc. If you can't do that, delete the above three sections</p>
<p>OTOH the Introduction and section 4 (Science and Religion) are good and assuming they aren't already covered elsewhere and this article is deleted they can be inorporated together on one of the other pages on the Creation-Evolution debate.</p>
<p>But the overall article at present is not valid as an encyclopaedia article as it is, although it could be made encyclopaedic if you address the above concerns. Also Goethean makes a very valid point that this whole classification would be limited or meaningless to those who hold or represent other perspectives. If the article is retained, this also has to be specified.</p>
<p>so <b>Delete as is</b>, <i>or</i> <b>Make encyclopeadic and acknowledge other points of view</b></p>

<ul>
<li>I don't. College baseball players are no more notable than college athletes in any sport. Only exceptions are for major, national awards. His award was not even for best player in his conference, only best "rookie". If he won the college baseball MVP award, then he would be notable. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 01:02, August 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>My sense is <b>no</b>. The event recieves sparse enough media coverage in Canada, and the only place most Canadians would ever hear about a particular athlete, even a champion, would be in a university or neighborhood newspaper talking about a native son/daughter. -<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Tom_5b57.html" title="User:The Tom">The Tom</a> 14:53, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There is virtually no way to determine the quality of any school league from year to year. It is possible for some lower quality player to win one year while hundreds of better players in other leagues don't have a chance since their league has too many excellent players. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 05:52, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - it also bears mentioning that most of the best pro baseball players in the USA/Canada do not usually attend college but are drafted straight from high school (with a few notable exceptions). College baseball players are typically less well-respected as a result than their peers in football or basketball, where most pro players at least put in a couple of years at college. Because of this, a college baseball player is going to have a mighty notability hill to climb until he makes a major-league roster somewhere. <a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a> 07:22, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
