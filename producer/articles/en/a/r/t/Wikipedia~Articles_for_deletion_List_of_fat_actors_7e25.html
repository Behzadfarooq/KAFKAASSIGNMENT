<p><b>Delete</b> - there is no possible objective definition of what makes for a "fat" actor. Especially in body-conscious Hollywood, what's "fat" there is healthy weight for height and age somewhere else. Being "fat" is not a permanent condition and actors frequently gain or lose weight to play parts. See for example <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_actors_who_gained_or_lost_weight_for_a_role.html" title="List of actors who gained or lost weight for a role">List of actors who gained or lost weight for a role</a>, none of whose gainers are listed as "fat actors," as an illustration of the subjective inclusion criteria of this list. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:42, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. More like actors who are known to be fat <i>and</i> who play characters known to be fat, as I interpret the lead paragraph.

There is no objective definition for 'fat', so the reliable sources label them for you. If the list doesn't contain any actors you feel should be on it, it means the list is in progress so you should add them, and there shouldn't be much of an overlap with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_actors_who_gained_or_lost_weight_for_a_role.html" title="List of actors who gained or lost weight for a role">list of actors who gained or lost weight for a role</a> as nowhere does it say those actors are known to be fat.

<li><b>Keep</b> Well-referenced. And let's stop making pointless euphemisms here; the older actors would not have flinched at the word "fat", and modern ones tend to be playing the humorous part of "the fat guy" (or gal) - calling them "obese" is just confusing. And you <i>know</i> that in 20 years people will be saying, "Don't call them "obese", that's a slur - call them 'metabolism-challenged'." <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 14:53, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I'm surprised someone has put this much effort into digging up sources for one of these lists. Anyway it really needs a new title as the current one implies something that the article is not. I disagree with Obesity in film as it's just a list of "fat man" character actors and not obesity in general. Obese actors in Hollywood suffers the same issues as the current title. The title needs to convey the fact that this is a list of character actors whose role is a fat person, but in a more succinct way. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 15:26, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Please take a look at the article, its talk page, its numerous references, and its history before "voting" to keep or delete or rename. The primary reference is to "Warner Brothers' Fat men"<a href="http://www.danagioia.net/essays/efatmen.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.danagioia.net/essays/efatmen.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> by Dana Gioia from the book "O.K. You Mugs: Writers on Movie Actors." All names are referenced to sources such as that book about the character actor genre of the fat man. None are just someone's personal opinion that an actor needs to go on a diet, and there has not really been a problem with keeping such original research out of the article. The list has been stable for months. It does not include present day comedians who put on a fat suit to play a role, or who happen to put on a few pounds, but only those whose girth was their fortune. The men listed made their livelihood by working as a character actor in that genre. Most of the individuals are from the golden age of Hollywood, such as Sydney Greenstreet, who played "The Fat Man" in "The Maltese Falcon". He certainly did not play "The Obese Man." Likewise on the list is silent movie comic "Fatty Arbuckle" who we should not try to rename "Obese Arbuckle." I searched each name which I found on the original list in such databases as the New York Times to confirm in their obituaries that they were there referred to as "roly-poly character actor" or "rotund character actor" to conform to the definition made in "Warner Brothers Fat men." Disagreements should be dealt with by the normal editing process, not be eliminating a valid type of character actor from the golden age of movies. The nominator should also have notified me on my talk page since I am the principle contributor to the article with 49 edits, per [[WP:AFD}}. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:12, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am finding nothing on Google indicating that there is such a thing as a "fat actor" genre. Even your essay source does not assert that there is such a thing, only that the author likes some actors who were fat. One opinion piece does not a genre make and we are left with the same problem, that there is no objective definition of "fat." <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 18:46, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> please note that the "essay" was a chapter in a published book, which should satisfy <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. The term used for the genre varied over the years. In the obituaries of many of these men or in reviews from the 40's they were often referred to as "rotund character actor" or "roly poly charactor actor" which seem more objectionable than "fat" but if the collective wisdom is to term the genre "obese" I could live with that. It was and is clearly treated as a genre like "leading man" in reviews and casting calls. At present it is still a genre. The IMDB bio of John Banner refers to him as "roly poly character actor" <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0052308/bio" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0052308/bio" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Ditto for Buck Taylor <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0852076/bio" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0852076/bio" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Please check the references for documentation of references to all the names listed as "roly poly " or "rotund" character actors. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:32, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genre.html" title="Genre">Genre</a> means what you think it means. That a number of actors shared a physical <i>type</i> and as a result may have played similar <i>roles</i> in a number of films does not mean that a <i>genre</i> exists. There is no "fat man" film genre any more than there is a "scared Negro servant" genre or a "sultry French maid" genre or "stock character of your choice" genre. The actors on the played a wide variety of roles across a wide variety of genres, everything from menacing murderer to comedic foil to romantic lead, and they cannot be classified as "fat actors" on the basis of a genre that simply doesn't exist. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:49, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Grouping actors by physical type could serve a useful purpose to anyone studying acting, including actors and comedians themselves (but others, too). The footnotes show that some actors were known for being fat and the proper use of sourcing provides an adequate way to regulate the list.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> <b>(1)</b> because the existence of the character type (or types) in the movies is shown in the footnotes; <b>(2)</b> because the list is well regulated by insisting that any actor included on it must have a citation showing at least some responsible party out there thought the actor was known for being fat; and <b>(3)</b> because there is at least one serious purpose to the article (it is a good first step in looking into how fat actors use their size in their roles). <b>"Strong"</b> because the article is cited so impressivly and because insistance that there must <b>always</b> be some objective outside standard (other than citations) for who can or can't be included in a list would unnecessarily restrict Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 21:05, 13 March 2007 (UTC) (minor change made in first line <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 21:13, 13 March 2007 (UTC))</li>

<li>So if I wanted to make a List of black American presidents and add <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> to it, you'd be OK with that because I have <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=/Nation/archive/200110/NAT20011001e.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=/Nation/archive/200110/NAT20011001e.html" rel="nofollow">a citation</a> from a responsible party that says so?

<li>I think your point is a classicly bad <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reductio_ad_absurdam.html" title="Reductio ad absurdam">Reductio ad absurdam</a> argument. If such an article were nominated, it wouldn't be nominated for improper sourcing but as a hoax (if it treated the claim seriously). If it didn't treat the claim as true, or more precisely treated the "Clinton is the first black president" meme as an encyclopedic subject, it could potentially make an interesting article (if a bit trivial). If, say, you were to find a more serious example, where a bad article had sourcing that was seriously deficient, then you'd have something to discuss. But you haven't argued that the sourcing is deficient, and if you did, the first step would be to tag it as poorly sourced and explain yourself on the talk page, not to go first to an AfD discussion. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 22:50, 13 March 2007 (UTC) (edited my first sentence <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 22:55, 13 March 2007 (UTC))</li>
<li>As I said in different ways twice above, "proper" sourcing from "responsible" parties. What you're looking for Otto (correct me if I'm wrong) is a Wikipedia standard where we can't list anything unless some outside authority certifies all of its items as being on the list. Cultural lists can't work that way, so it seems you want them all out. Well there's a value to lists that aren't quite like the Periodic Table of the Elements or some genus of fauna or family of flora. You make some of the same points at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Christmas_dishes_ee21.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Christmas dishes">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Christmas dishes</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 23:04, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>But I'm not saying that there are not sources in which these guys are called "fat." The problem with this list is not sourcing. The problem with this list, as I've said repeatedly, is that <i>there is no possible objective standard for "fat"</i>. There is, infamously, a published source that calls Karen Carpenter "fat" (or "chunky" or "chubby", I don't recall the exact word, doesn't matter for purposes of this discussion). 95% or more of the population would not have considered her "fat" at the time the source was published or thereafter while she was starving herself to death, yet because it exists she would by your standard be eligible for List of fat musicians. It's not unreasonable to expect that lists like this be restricted to things that are objectively defineable. Compare this to the aforementioned list of actors who put on or lost weight for a role. I have no problem with that article because it restricts itself to factual, defineable entries that don't rely on the opinion of either Wikipedia editors or external people. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:33, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Objective" is not the proper standard. "Fair" is the proper standard and it is necessarily going to have some gray areas on the edges. If that results in some debates on the article's talk page in the future, why not let the editors who are interested in the subject deal with that — they certainly are willing to take the risk of that. And the risk seems a fair price to pay in order to keep the article. If some editor puts Karen Carpenter on a list and provides the citation, other editors can counter that with other citations or pictures that would convince 95% or more of the population. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 01:07, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Fair" is the standard? I'm not familiar with WP:BEFAIR, but if you say so. So if it's not "fair" that actors are listed as "fat" then I can take them off the list? Fine, then in that case it's not "fair" that any actor is listed as fat so the entire list should be deleted. Or, we could use an actual standard that makes some sort of sense, which would be <i>objectivity</i>. Expecting that a list article have an objective definition for existence and inclusion may or may not be perfect, but it's a damn sight better than sitting around trying to figure out whether it's "fair" to put someone on the list. Encyclopedias are not supposed to be popularity contests or votes and the idea that editors should spend time trying to convince each other that it is or isn't "fair" to call Karen Carpenter "fat" is bizarre. Expecting editors to spend time trying to convince one another that an actor is fat enough to be on a fat actors list is ludicrous. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:35, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, here's what you sit around and do: You discuss whether or not the authority being cited is correct. You do that by first trying to find other citations that either help or hurt the assertion made in the questionable citation. And when you've exhausted other resources you only have your common sense to rely on and you use it. That's being fair. When we sit around and do that, we do the actual editing that Wikipedians are here for. What's bizarre is that you don't think Wikipedians can use their heads. There is an area between rote rule following and complete subjectivity and you don't appear to recognize that, but it's in that area of reasoning things out and judging what weight to give the opinions of particular sources where encyclopedia editors make many of their most important decisions. The solution is not to run away from subjects where this kind of work needs to be done. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 04:50, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The list does not arbitrarily claim some actor as fat. Most of the entries are externally sourced. However, if one needs an objective definition of fat, there is <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_Mass_Index_%28BMI%29_f1cc.html" title="Body Mass Index (BMI)">Body Mass Index</a> to calculate that. For that, every actor's weight (at a particular arbitrary age) and adult height have to be known! It goes without saying the process would be cumbersome! With such detailed referencing, the list should be kept.

<li><b>Comment</b> No objection to List of obese actors.

Does it seem right to restrict it to male actors (some actresses refer to themselves as "actors") and would it be ok to limit it to nonliving ones (takes out some <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> issues and maintenance issues everytime a present day actor puts on a fat suit for a Saturday Night Live sketch.)
