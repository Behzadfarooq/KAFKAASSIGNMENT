<p>There have been no significant edits to the article in months. The article has few sourced statements, and it cites information out of context. Statistical data from questionable sources are deliberately slanted to make India look like the poorest country in the world (a patently false claim). There is no precedent on wikipedia to single out the poverty situation of any country as an article, while statistics show that poverty situation in some other countries are far worse than in India. Why is India being singled out? Plus, the pictures are placed out of context and have no text in the articles to support their placement. As it stands (and has stood for months), it is offensive. There is a better article <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_of_living_in_India_2aab.html" title="Standard of living in India">Standard of living in India</a> where the matter of poverty in India can be put in at length so this article is also redundant with a POV title. <a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 14:25, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<b>Comment</b>:A merge with <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_of_living_in_India_2aab.html" title="Standard of living in India">Standard of living in India</a> is not necessary (IMHO) as most of the NPOV information (incl images) is already there in this other article (put there by the same user too). The issue (I think) is the redundancy, 100% POV (loading the title itself to a certain POV) and misrepresented information placed with no context (for months!).<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 14:31, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>:Like I said, my main issue is redundancy. There is no need to have two articles <a href="../../../p/o/v/Poverty_in_India_b565.html" title="Poverty in India">Poverty in India</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_of_living_in_India_2aab.html" title="Standard of living in India">Standard of living in India</a> both of which discuss the same things, so much so that RF copied text from one and put it in the other. What good does that redundancy do? There is no content in poverty article that isn;t already there in Standard of livin article so merging is unnecessary. Only fair solution is to delete the poverty article or merge the Standard of living article into the poverty article.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 23:35, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree that the article could be redirected as long as it only duplicates the section of the Standards of living article, which it does now, and as long as nobody expands the article. --<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayfield_f2e4.html" title="User:Rayfield">RF</a> 11:21, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Then put up the Standard of Living article for deletion or redirect it to this one.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> There is NO NEED to merge. The article is already copied from the other Article. If some one can come up with a good write up (not duplication) from a neutral point of view, we can review that and then decide. As of now, this should be deleted. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno"><font style="background:black" color="gold"><b>Doctor Bruno</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoctorbruno_78fe.html" title="User talk:Doctorbruno"><font style="background:gold" color="black">Talk</font></a> 14:26, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> any non-duplicate content to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_of_living_in_India_2aab.html" title="Standard of living in India">Standard of living in India</a>, with redirect.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and expand. Type "Poverty in" into the Wikipedia search box and you will find a bunch of "Poverty in Country X" articles. Poverty exists in many countries including the United States. Poverty is a major problem in the Less Developed Countries (LDCs). It's a key focus of the United Nations. The topic is not POV per se although it is possible for an article on poverty to be written in a POV way. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 07:06, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> on principle--not necessarily an endorsement of the current article. Poverty is within the scope of standard of living in many ways... but, it also is an important social issue and for that reason as much as any other it deserves its own article. How is poverty and vagrancy (related) treated under law? I know the issues comes up in the U.S. and it has to in most countries. Also countries have interesting ways of dealing with poverty... favellas in Brazil, etc. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 07:47, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Poverty in India exists and is a well-documented issue. It is possible to write a NPOV, verifiable and informative article about it. That is the only thing that matters. Not the intentions of the person creating it, not whether there is a similar topic on India's enemies, not whether the article is NPOV in its current state. — <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavikiran_r_a4a3.html" title="User:Ravikiran r">Ravikiran</a></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- wheter or not articles appear about provery in other countries is irrelevant. Deleting this article will not delete poverty. As far as statistics are concerned even the Govt. of India changes it statistics on a day-to-day basis depending on what it wants to potray. To expect a civillian to have appropriate statistics is not possible.</li>

If government of India does not provide correct facts, what are the IMF and UN for? If the editors are commited they can find correct reports. The article is already growing.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>, obviously. There are a million academic studies of poverty in India. Four-fifths of the people who live under the poverty line as defined by the UN are Indians. The current article is appropriate, not terribly unsourced, and NPOV. The <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_of_Living_in_India_a2e8.html" title="Standard of Living in India">Standard of Living in India</a> article contains several other details, as well as a summary of this article. This is exactly how things should be. The standard of living could be measured by several different indicators, including for example life expectancy, female literacy, degree of political freedom etc., and not just income-related indicators. See <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Development_Index_c588.html" title="Human Development Index">Human Development Index</a>. POverty is strictly defined as income below a certain level, that level being defined as the minimum required for the purchase of a diet with enough calories to maintain average bodyweight. The two things are not the same. Frankly, this argument is ridiculous and this should never even have been brought to AfD. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 08:55, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b>: From one perspective, you're right. The debate is whether to delete this particular article about Poverty in India. However, deletion inhibits writing and editing. If we believe the topic is worthwhile, it is better (IMO) to take the current article and expand it than to delete it and hope that someone will write a better article from scratch.</dd>
<dd>Merging is certainly one solution. Another is to trim the "Poverty" section in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_of_Living_in_India_a2e8.html" title="Standard of Living in India">Standard of Living in India</a> down so that it is a summary of this one and then expand this one. This article certainly needs expansion. There are many, many ways in which it could be expanded. One would be to describe the government programmes in greater detail. If we delete every article because it doesn't meet Wikipedia's standards now, then we will tend to limit Wikipedia. If we work to improve articles, then we will grow Wikipedia in both quantity and quality.</dd>
<dd>I recognize that the opinions expressed here are just my opinions and represent an "inclusionist" philosophy rather than a "deletionist" philosophy. Nonetheless, those are my thoughts and you may adopt them or reject them as you will.</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>:As of this moment I am doubtful as to whether the article should be deleted or not. It would seem that the better solution is to shorten the poverty section in the standard of living article and expand the poverty article and cross-reference when needed. To all those who have been following this AfD (and any other interested parties) I would be very happy if you would peruse the poverty article, as well as the standard of living article, and fix any redundancies by cross-referencing.Thanks.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 22:14, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
