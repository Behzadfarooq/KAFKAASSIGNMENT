<p>A non-notable term. Adherents of the ideal of the (extremely) free market certainly have their say on the web, yet Google shows a tiny number of references to this strand of libertarian thought, which (if I understand and correctly and am to believe) can never legally be explained. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 08:40, 2005 Jan 11 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> for a moment. This is almost certainly not a term in common use, but Andrew Joseph Galambos (or Joseph Andrew Galambos, he seems to use both) appears to be real, and likewise the term (never mind that <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Joseph_Galambos_4813.html" title="Andrew Joseph Galambos">Andrew Joseph Galambos</a> was an ad listed on VfD, and is now inappropriately listed as a "reference" on <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_enterprise.html" title="Scientific enterprise">Scientific enterprise</a>). It's possible Tuccille just singled it out for ridicule or dissemination, but there is information here that should be put <i>somewhere</i>. I don't know where, though. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 09:48, 2005 Jan 11 (UTC)

<li>Clarification: he's dead, according to <a href="http://www.harrybrowne.org/articles/Galambos.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.harrybrowne.org/articles/Galambos.htm" rel="nofollow">harrybrowne.org/articles/Galambos.htm</a>. And according to that article, he "never wrote a book or appeared on national radio or TV". -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 10:11, 2005 Jan 11 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Since today is notability day for me, I'm going to pretend I don't have a personal policy of not voting on it for a moment. Your source also says he was "influential". Your source is also not quite right: someone cared enough to have his notes published in book form (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0880780029</a>, and yes, it's genuine). The author of the quoted web article clearly has a personal slant ("his renown will be limited mostly to those who came in personal contact with him") but the article seems quite honest. One does not have to write a book, let alone appear on national radio or TV, to be notable. If he's notable enough to be mentioned in a book, get a lengthy obituary article, have his notes published and get his extreme but interesting idea written up quite adequately by someone else some thirty years later, that's good enough for me. This is a definite <i>merge</i> with an article on Galambos himself. Since we don't have that, <i>Keep</i>. This guy may not have rocked the boat <i>that</i> much, but he's notable <i>enough</i> for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 11:11, 2005 Jan 11 (UTC)

<li>Sorry I didn't think of looking for a book of his material; since the article I looked at (and cited above) seemed scrupulously written (a bit hagiographic but with warts and all), I wrongly believed what it said about this. Right, so our man's utterings are published in a book. It's not in Copac, it's not in the Library of Congress, it's not in the NYPL, and it's not in Harvard or Chicago university libraries. (I gave up looking after that.) This suggests that it's not much known. Oh, I see at <a href="http://www.bookfinder.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.bookfinder.com/" rel="nofollow">bookfinder.com</a> that there was also <i>Thrust for Freedom: An Introduction to Volitional Science</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0880780061</a>&#160;; I couldn't be bothered to look that one up too). His ideas certainly are extreme (if you can say that to you they're interesting, then I suppose I can say that to me they're 30% repellent and 70% risible); and he seems to have been a lot less a scholar than a sort of invertly-charismatic "motivational speaker". I've no objection to his career choice, but the virtual absence of this "ism" from the web suggests to me that it isn't noteworthy. Or if it really is judged to be noteworthy, I'd suggest that it merits a paragraphy either in some article where libertarianism meets the utterly potty or maybe even one on Galambos himself, though I suggest that cranky theorists had better have something special before getting their own articles here. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 13:50, 2005 Jan 11 (UTC)

<li>I believe that Galambosianism is notable because (a) it is a notable failure (much in the way that <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_as_she_is_spoke.html" title="English as she is spoke">English as she is spoke</a> was), (b) it (or rather the spectacle of its absurdity) made enough of an impact to be mentioned in discussion as a bad example, and as such, an entry describing what this Galambosianism thing was can be useful, and (c) it is Wikipedia's strength that it has room for obscure ideas which would be editorially culled from more limited mainstream reference works. I agree that there should be a biographical entry for Galambos himself, and would be willing to countenance Galambosianism being folded into that; though, in the interim, Keep. <a href="../../../a/c/b/User%7EAcb_9b8c.html" title="User:Acb">Acb</a> 14:07, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>I have to say, Acb, that you're rather persuasive. I'm all in favor of discussions of failures as long as they're notable. <i><a href="../../../e/n/g/English_as_she_is_spoke.html" title="English as she is spoke">English as she is spoke</a></i> was sufficiently notable to be published by Dover (etc.); <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archimedes_Plutonium_ac8f.html" title="Archimedes Plutonium">Archimedes Plutonium</a> probably isn't notable but is hilarious; is this chap notable? I've already granted that he's funny, but of course factions in the libertarian bloc may object to that and present him as an unappreciated hero. First the sollogites (sorry, "fans of <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sollog.html" title="Sollog">Sollog</a>), next the Galambosianites? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 14:27, 2005 Jan 11 (UTC)

<li>He was notable enough to get into a sparring match with <a href="../../../a/y/n/Ayn_Rand_c548.html" title="Ayn Rand">Ayn Rand</a>, not to mention to be eulogised by other libertarians decades later. Meanwhile, while Galambosianism as an idea didn't catch on, intellectual-property maximalism as an idea has never had it better (look at the <a href="../../../d/m/c/DMCA_bb76.html" title="DMCA">DMCA</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/p/WIPO_7cd8.html" title="WIPO">WIPO</a> treaties, copyright-term extensions, business-model patents, and such). Perhaps Galambosianism is an increasingly relevant metaphor for our times? As such, a Wikipedia search for it should not draw a blank. <a href="../../../a/c/b/User%7EAcb_9b8c.html" title="User:Acb">Acb</a> 19:19, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Merge</b> whilst I certainly have some innate respect for the iconoclasts of the world, morely the fact that someone has an idea does not make that idea inherently notable. Although perhaps "original research" would be a hard one to apply to something allegedly five decades old, it's plain to see that this concept never got anywhere at all. 19 google hits for something that's been around since the 60s? Come on.

<li>The problem with the "Google Test" is that it is inherently biased in favour of things occurring within the past decade, a criterion which in itself does not translate into relevance or significance. And yes, one can argue that the point is that older events not shown by Google have failed the test of time (at least as far as the web goes); however, the precise point is that more recent events which are no more inherently significant pass the Google Test. If we're going to delete Galambosianism on the strength of the Google Test, we should also, in the interest of consistency, delete <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toynbee_tiles.html" title="Toynbee tiles">Toynbee tiles</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Chiu_00e3.html" title="Alex Chiu">Alex Chiu</a>, not to mention half of the entries on <a href="../../../u/n/u/Wikipedia%7EUnusual_articles_dd7d.html" title="Wikipedia:Unusual articles">Wikipedia:Unusual articles</a> and most of the articles about <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base are belong to us">ephemeral</a> <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot_trolling_phenomena.html" title="Slashdot trolling phenomena">internet</a> <a href="../../../m/e/o/Meow_Wars_55bb.html" title="Meow Wars">subcultures</a> which just happened to have cropped up in the past few years.

<li>No I don't, not with all of it. Yes, I certainly agree with much of what you say. Putting aside the question of what (if anything) "relevance" is <i>to</i>, I heartily agree with the first sentence. I agree with your "precise point" as well. (More could be added, e.g. that what's on the web has a heavily anglophone and particularly north American bias.) But it seems to me that the Google test is one valid test of significance. If a subject (or, as detractors might put it, a non-subject) fails the Google test, then the proponent is free to put forward other arguments, for example that <i>The Encyclopedia of Libertarian Ideas</i> (4 vols, Podunk State University Press, 1997) [I've just made that one up] has a two-page article about it. Incidentally, the Google test is a pretty good one for recent academic significance, as very many academic journals are available online from Kluwer, Elsevier, etc etc etc, and their abstracts at least are open to Googling. But was Galambosianism a matter of ideas, or was it more a matter of "motivational speaking" with the now all-too-familiar line of "greed is good"? Browne's essay suggests the latter to me; and if my hunch is right then maybe Galambos deserves no less attention than do the other dodgy characters in the dreary "management" and "psychology" sections of an average bookstore. (I notice that every US purveyor of evangelical Christianity seems to get an article -- as indeed does anybody who's ever done anything with a ball in front of a paying audience.) -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:57, 2005 Jan 13 (UTC)</li>

<li>How many Google hits does something need to get to pass the test? 'Galambosianism' gets about 20, not counting this page. It's obscure, but it does actually exist and has been referenced in books and papers. Anyway, I think the salient point of Galambosianism as a notable subject is not simply that it's another "greed is good" construction (which, IMHO, would not be notable), but that it is specifically an absolutist theory of intellectual property, and, as a notable failure, illuminates some of the contradictions between ideas and property. <a href="../../../a/c/b/User%7EAcb_9b8c.html" title="User:Acb">Acb</a> 12:23, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
