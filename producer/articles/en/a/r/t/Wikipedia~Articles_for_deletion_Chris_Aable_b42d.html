<p>Copied promotional material.

<li><b>Apppeal</b> as per AableFan 10:23, 18 July 2006 (UTC) Bare with me, as we (The Chris Aable Fan Club) are new to this. I'm Paul Johnson, the president. I assume we delete the "scheduled for deletion" template if we appeal or vote? If not, forgive me, I'm still learning. This biography is useful, and many "smug" details have thus far been left out, but we will work on this so as to minimize offending anyone as best we can. I think Chris' philosophy of Self-Evolution is quite the contrary of being "smug" in that his lectures and speeches at CSULA, LACC, SMC, etc. emphasis that everyone is equal at least in the respect that we all have unique accomplishments that we should share in the spirit of "I can do this, and so can you". Black and white words in a few biographical paragraphs cannot completely capture true motivations, behavior and attitudes, so I would never jump to the worse possible negative conclusions based on a list of accomplishments or work history of any person posted. Please keep in mind that Aable was away from Hollywood during the mid 90s when much information about actors was being placed on the web by publicist. He was teaching sociology, philosophy and psychology at CSULA in the late 1990s and his actual letters of references (with phone numbers) from other professors can be viewed on the reference link of self-evolution.org He may be "nn" partly because he was born as Chris Brown, he had to use the screen name Chris Aable when he joined the Screen Actors Guild in 1988, as there cannot be two people with the same name, in this case, "Chris Brown" for the purposes of Television and Screenplay credits. He authored the book "Life Songs" and "A Value Guide to U.S. Coins" as Christopher Willis Brown in 1981 and the ISBN and copies can be found at the Library of Congress. Aable interviewed over a hundred celebrities when he hosted "Hollywood Today" - a TV show aired in over twenty cities, including most of Los Angeles and New York City. This can be varified through his guest's contacts or their agents, which included newsmakers such as Marc Christian, Gedde Wattanabe, comedians Gilbert Godfrey, The Lovely Carol, etc....Should we list all hundred of them? SYR Productions will be promoting and distributing these historical shows on the internet and DVD in 2007, this part sounds commericial so was purposedly left out along with many other associated facts. We have a fan club committee gathering this information. Board members are Paul Johnson, Steve Torpin, Terry Mills, Jose Silva, Mary Sutton and Barbara Mosher. We don't know how else to write these things without soundinig like a commercial, but we see actor's and producer's upcoming projects throughout Wikipedia. But more importantly, a little known but significant fact is that Aable was the original producer/writer of "America's Craziest Home Videos" long before "America's Funniest..." was known, and this can be varified by Mark Justin, who was a Project Developer at Fox Television back in 1987 and a guest on Aable's show. It can also be verified by John Cedar, Stephen Valentino, David Thursdale, casting director Steve Fugi and dozens of others, names listed upon request. Thanks for listening, and my apologies for the length - there's much to explain. I'm not saying he's Ayn Rand, Aristotle or Jefferson, but nevertheless everyone deserves to have some of their work mentioned when it has effected tens of thousands of people over the years, and will perhaps continue to do so. We could not locate any "copyright violations". If there are any copyright violations or other objections, please be case-specific and wewill be happy to delete or edit to meet all guidelines.</li>
