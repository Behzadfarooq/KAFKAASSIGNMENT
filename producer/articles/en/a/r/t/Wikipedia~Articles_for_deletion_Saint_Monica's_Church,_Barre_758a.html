<dd>What's the problem here? Information is on organisation website and denominational website and corroborated with information from local govmt and elsewhere. That's clearly verification. There is zero chance of a hoax. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is satisfied - to demand more is to introduce a systemic bias against information that is static rather than spectacular. The internet and media pic up on new phenomena not 19th century local institutions.

<dd>As I've said in discussions before, I can write an article on my <i>car</i> that would clearly be more then a directory, and source it to publicly-available records. (Accident reports are publicly available, I was rear-ended once, detailing the accident and sourcing it to the accident report would go beyond a directory.) At a very technical level, that would satisfy <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> (not my original research as it was done by a police officer, sourced to publicly available material), <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> (a neutral description of an event from a neutral, reliable source cannot be POV), and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (not a directory entry, not soapboxing, etc., etc.). What my car is not, however, is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>, because <i>unrelated</i> sources have not covered it in any non-trivial manner. The same applies here, from what I can tell, so I argue to delete. It should not be to us to determine what is notable, it should be to those who write secondary sources. As to your argument above, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notre_Dame_Cathedral_e852.html" title="Notre Dame Cathedral">Notre Dame Cathedral</a> may noy be in the newspaper today, but there are certainly plenty of books and other secondary sources available on it.

<dd>You are confusing notability with sources. Source it all you like, no-one is interested in your car. Whilst, a nineteenth century church connected with the history of a locality, operating a school (heavens, if I removed the rest and only mentioned a school it would be kept!) is obviously more than personal information. The problem with your criteria is it leaves us keeping passing internet fads which get mentioned in the media and then forgotten, but excludes perfectly verifiable information that will be of stable interest in 100 years time. It is a systemic bias, and it weakens the encyclopedia. And further, you still have given no reason why the encyclopedia benefits from removing this factual verifiable information, other than that it is the logical conclusion of legalistic pursuing of a supposed objective definition of notability. Objective standards of notability are a dangerous mirage - leading to foolish decisions. WP:NOT paper. No reason in policy or logic to remove this.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 13:41, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If the subject is genuinely of as much interest and historical value as you state, someone will have taken note and written a book on it (or have devoted significant mention in a book to it at least), or studied it in a scholarly paper about old churches or the region, or the like. The news media may be a reliable source, but they're certainly not the only reliable source. If sources such as those were cited, again, I would happily argue to keep, and I looked, but I just can't find any such thing. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 13:54, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

Unfortunately, we have not come to a good, consensus decision as a community about how to judge the notability of churches (or schools), but this does not pass as the guidelines currently stand.

<dd>Seriously flawed. If merging makes for better organisation of material, then merge. If it doesn't don't. I mean we might merge 6 articles on battles into an article on one war simply because we don't currently have much info on any other them - equally we split pokemon characters into separate articles because we do. Merging has nothing to do with notability. If the information is verifiable and encyclopedic, we keep it. We then decide how to organise it. If merging improves this information's delivery, and that of Barre, fine. But we don't bugger up articles just to allow us to keep information without 'rewarding it' with its own article.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 17:01, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
