<li><b>Delete</b>. The edit summary for the creation of the page is pretty much all you need to see. "Since media criticisms + explanations are removed from Gore controversies page(for the fact of not being a controversy) this page explains media misconceptions and criticisms of the public figure Gore". And as Derex alludes to, you have to go back to November 2006 to see the article creator even editing the source article he forked from -- and back to <b>June 2006</b> to find him posting to the talk page of that article. Even as a <i>last</i> resort POV forking is not acceptable; as nowhere <i>near</i> a last resort it should be shut down hard. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 03:13, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> POV fork. I've seen discussion on how having the "controversies" article is a POV fork (a way to keep the negative stuff out of the main article). So why are we forking out content again? The large majority of the material is copied from the controversies article, so there is a lot of redundancy. This makes me think that we do not need a spinout article for this already spinout article. Also, the creation intentions (and some recent editing over at the controversies article) leads me to lead that this is nothing more than a POV fork. I'd like to hear a defense of this as a simple spinout article. -<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 03:26, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> All of the stuff here has at one time or another been inserted into the "Al Gore controversies" article and subsequently deleted because the info is either not notable or spurious. Some discussion on the controversies talk page indicates that particular article could be construed as a POV fork, and this ridiculous off-shoot is even worse.-<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 03:42, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

From what I have seen <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_controversies_08f6.html" title="Al Gore controversies">Al Gore controversies</a> has discussed the controversies from both sides and so has avoided being a POV fork. This article, however, practically announces in its very title that it's going to take a side -- and it does. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 04:03, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>All of the information on here is sourced and documented. Actually any info on here that was on Al Gore controversies was removed because of people saying it was non notable or it did not generate a 'storm of controversy'. How is it not notable when it appears in major news outlets?? Not every story that makes the news generates a storm of controversy, yet is very important, especially political stories that do not get front page news for political reasons. All the stories on here are from major news sources, the Washington Post, Newsweek, the New York Times, etc. At least these stories should be merged on Al Gore Controversies and not wholly removed.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_great_grape_ape_is_straight_out_of_the_know_f1b1.html" title="User:The great grape ape is straight out of the know">The great grape ape is straight out of the know</a> 02:16, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> As an editor on the controversy article I would be happy to have a chat on the discussion page about what should be included.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> the subject is useful and serious. I get the idea from comments about politically controversial articles that merely addressing a controversy is itself POV. If POV is a problem with something like this, then let other editors add the other point of view or edit out bias.

<li><b>Comment</b>: "I get the idea from comments about politically controversial articles that merely addressing a controversy is itself POV." No, that's a fairly frequent misconception, but addressing a controversy is not POV. What <i>is</i> POV is addressing only <i>one</i> side of a controversy, or trying to arrange boundaries of discussion of a controversy that would limit discussion to one POV. That's what this article does, as it is titled "Al Gore criticisms and misconceptions". -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 03:56, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete or Merge(parts)</b> The article is actually a good read and theres a lot of references but its too much of a POV view, especially since hes a living person. I think that some of the content has merits and perhaps the most well written, notable and well reference of it could be merged into a critique on the actual Al Gore article. . In any case this is just far too much, mostly non notable, criticism for an encyclopedia, espcially the Al Gore quotations criticized by the media section. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordHarris_aa9b.html" title="User:LordHarris">LordHarris</a> 04:08, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>I apologize if my methods are in the wrong, but my thoughts were to show content that critiques with explanation of the media and Al Gore. I attempted to reference it all with sources and boths sides of view the best I could, and hope some of it can be merged without POV in a way that I have obviously failed to do. I believe the information is relevant to show all sides of a person, seeing that the 'good' side is shown with no mention of past actions that show a different story.

<li><b>Merge</b> I've said it before and I'll say it again...why is Al Gore not allowed to have a criticisms section, either as a separate article or (better) on his main Wikipedia bio page, when almost every other public figure from Presidents to stand up comedians on Wikipedia does? The "controversies" page is not a criticism page, it is an obnoxious fork intended to split off and then remove criticism of Al Gore from his Wikipedia biography. How can we justify treating him completely differently than any other public figure and still argue that the main article has a shred of neutrality? As it stands now, his Wikipedia biography reads like a press release for an upcoming election bid. -- <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.82.38.150 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.82.38.150_0053.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.82.38.150">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> You make a very good point.

However, even though there is an <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html#Controversies" title="Al Gore">Al Gore#Controversies</a> header, there's nothing there but a link to <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_controversies_08f6.html" title="Al Gore controversies">Al Gore controversies</a>, and the only one of the controversies I see touched on in the article is the "created the Internet" kerfuffle.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would suggest that both articles be returned to the original under the title "Controversies and Criticisms", as was suggested once before, and they can then be summarized and NPOV'ed by the usual editorial process. As it is, both articles basically exist outside of the Wikipedia process and represent dueling POVs. There is information in both articles that, unless it in some way represented in Al Gore's main biography, gives us an incomplete view of the man. If we continue to allow this kind of splitting off (even at the short term gain of some civility or stability in the editorial process) we'll lose the heart of the main article.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> No criticism pages. Really those are the worst things you can do to wikipedia. It's just my humble opinion but no living person should have a criticism page. They are nothing more than pov magnets. Controversy pages are fine (Al Gore does have one) because there has to be some sort of legitimacy behind accusations. This page has little or nothing to merge. <a href="../../../j/i/f/User%7EJiffypopmetaltop_3d5a.html" title="User:Jiffypopmetaltop">Jiffypopmetaltop</a> 04:40, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I understand your feelings about criticisms pages/sections, we are probably all sick of them. But the fact is virtually every article on Wikipedia on a major living public figure contains a criticism/controversy section. I'm not sure how we cannot have one on Al Gore and argue that we are being neutral. As you say, they are POV magnets but that doesn't remove our responsibility for addressing these issues in a NPOV way in the main Al Gore article. It sure makes it easier not to have them in the main page, but it doesn't make the article better, it makes it worse. I'm very leery of just having a section called "Controversies" without the term "Criticisms"; semantic debates on the definition of the term "Controversy" have been used in the past to delete large sections of biographical material on Gore, and it's become a sore point for some contributors. I'm not saying those sections shouldn't have been deleted or edited, I just would have liked a better argument for dumping them than that they don't fit a strict definition of the term controversy. I think our primary focus should be on making better articles, even if that sometimes makes things harder for us, having to deal with POV nuts and flamers. As things stand now, I'm worried we are copping out of our responsibilities. No doubt, the Al Gore page is a magnet for attack right now because of his visibility, but many pages go through these periods and still maintain a civil discussion process and ultimately a neutral POV. If we have problems with this article and the "Controversies" article, I think it is best to return them to the main page and deal with them there, fact by fact, issue by issue. Just deleting them or favoring one over another is going to cause a justifiable resentment to the whole process. We'll have avoided dealing with the issues and over time it will just get worse.</li>

Bush substance abuse controversy</a> which accuses Bush of being a "Dry Drunk" on the word of some unknown hack from Iowa without a license to practice medicine adn without ever meeting the man. Seriously, people, Wikipedia is never going to be taken seriously when this blatant bias is allowed to run rampant here. Any and all negative information regarding certain select politicians is continuously segregated from main articles or censored altogether while other politicians are smeared repeatedly.

If there are valid criticisms of public officials they should be mentioned and articles should exist; If there are well-known and documented <i>smears</i> they should also exist. It is not up to us to determine if something is unfair. If the info can be validated by reliable sources that is all that matters. However, it is hypocritical and extremely damaging to this website to try to delete an article dealing with criticisms of an important public figure without a Wikipedia-wide purging of all criticism of everyone. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayzel68_b0f1.html" title="User:Jayzel68">Jayzel</a> 23:14, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Holy cow, I've read the main Al Gore article I don't know how many times and never connected the fact that, in an article where we don't allow a criticism section about its subject, there is a long criticism section of another public figure (Bush). I guess by logic, if we want to see public criticisms of Gore or his administration we need to go to the Bush page. In all seriousness, I think this illustrates the problem with not having a criticisms section. As it stands right now, the article allows Gore's criticisms of other public figures and topics, but doesn't allow any criticism of him or his actions. This policy just can't be regarded as fair or non biased and its a recipe for long term disaster. Ultimately it will make the article one sided and neuter the subject.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If we can get back to the discussion now, I see that the main Al Gore article has had the above discussed "Criticism of Bush Administration" section removed. I don't see how this helps things or the article; these are Gore's own words and personal beliefs, I can't think of much more essential to summing up a man. I think we are better suited by publishing Gore's criticisms of other people and the criticisms of him, just like every other public figure on Wikipedia. It is essential that we have both sides of the story if we are going to understand him as a man and try to give a clear view of his life. At this rate the article will have absolutely nothing left except that Al Gore owned a dog, and then that section will be removed by someone who owns a cat. BTW, so that everyone can clearly know my bias on these issues, I own a cat.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I an going to be Henry Clay here. Everyone shouls come to an agreement on how this article should be worded. If you don't think an article on Al Gore's downsides should be included in Wikipedia, that's fine. But you should have a criticism section on his regular article. All politicians have their downsides and none of them, are perfect. George Bush isn't perfect and Hillary Clinton isn't perfect. Come to an agreement on what to do with this article.</li>
