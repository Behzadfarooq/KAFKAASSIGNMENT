<p>The Angry Video Game Nerd is the new title for the formally dubbed Angry Nintendo Nerd. The name change was to avoid future copyright and trademark issues with Nintendo.</p>
<p>AVGN (Angry Video Game Nerd) is still refered to as ANN (Angry Nintendo Nerd) by many of his fans. Played by the film marker James Rolfe he berates and degrades classic video game titles. His early and present works focus mainly on NES but he has stated on ScrewAttack's Sidescrollers and on the ScrewAttack forums that he plans to do other games and systems in the future.</p>
<p>ANN began as an upstart on YouTube and found a place on ScrewAttack (<a href="http://www.screwattack.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.screwattack.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.screwattack.com/</a>), a website devoted to gamers. Since then it is estimated there are well over 1 million views of his collective works.</p>
<p>His reviews are full of profanity and violence and are definately not suitable for children.</p>

The angry pirate is a slang term for a certain manner of ending an oral sexual act. In this finishing method the male ejaculates into the eye of his partner and then kicks them in the shin so they limp off squinting and making an 'arrr' noise.</p>

<p>This refers to a supposed "free edit" online encyclopedia.. however, the truth is that the content is zealously protected by a group of narrow-minded geeks that will respond to any attempts to correct their self-laudatory opinions with quick lockouts of any subject that is edited beyond their narrow definition. Beware of so-called "administrators" that respond to any attempts to seed their project with truth and reason with accusations of "vandalism"... if they don't agree with it, it's criminal. See also "Circlejerkapedia". For a real belly laugh, check out the definition of "weak atheism".. some philosophy major actually believes that that definition has logical value. Hint: 1 + -1 = 0.</p>

<p>Amor a Palos is a Venezuelan <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telenovela.html" title="Telenovela">telenovela</a> that aired in 2005.</p>
<p>The show is about different men and women who deal with issues such as romance, family, education, work, and cheating.</p>
<p>The main characters are Ana, Juan, Rene, Magdalena, Victorino, Virgina, Jairo, Greta, Wilfred, Beltran, Rocio, Pamela, and Maya.</p>
<p>Ana is a radical <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminist.html" title="Feminist">feminist</a> studying to become a lawyer. She meets a lawyer named Juan whom she supposedly kissed in her childhood. Their relationship is a bit rocky at first, but they eventually fall in love. What she does not realize is that Juan has made a bet with a friend of his that he could date 70 women by a certain date for $100,000. Juan is also still married. His wife Oriana is an insane drug addict. When she has to go to rehab, he asks his boss Pamela, the head of the firm he works at, to file for a divorce. She does, but she makes sure that it does not fully go through for revenge- she was his #1! Ana finds out that she is pregnant. To avoid a wedlock pregnancy, Juan and Ana are married. Little do they know the dangerous path they are treading on, especially when his wife comes home totally clean and sane! Will his bigamy be exposed?</p>
<p>Magdalena is a nurse who discovers one dreaded day that her husband Victorino is cheating on her. She runs out of the medical center in tears and takes a drive to clear her head. She accidentally runs over a dirty homeless man named Rene and takes him to the hospital. They have a hard time cleaning him up because of his water phobia. Magda discovers that he is actually a successful lawyer, but he caught amnesia after a chaotic event claimed the life of his children. She befriends him in order to help him gain his memory back. But their friendship soon buds into a romantic relationship. But Victorino won't give up his wife, his house, or his daughter without a fight.</p>
<p>A lawyer named Virgina(who happens to work at the same firm as Pamela and Juan!) wakes up on her 40th birthday and realizes that she has never been married or had any children. That same day, she meets a gardener named Jairo. Of course, someone of her financial status would never want to even be seen with a poor worker like him. But gradually, he wins her heart. Their relationship will not be an easy one, though.</p>
<p>Greta, a high school student, bumps into a young man named Wilfre one day. He lives with his girlfriend named Rocio and they raise their baby together. Greta wins Wilfre's heart, but Rocio will not give up her man. Also, a young man named Beltran will enter Greta's life, but she refuses to have anything to do with him. Her mother Pamela is adamant on her marrying Beltran. The only one who supports her is her grandmother Maya.</p>

He drew theatre out form the confines of the folk and the urban styles and into the Third Theatre – exposing us to an unconventional theatrical dimension of free theatre, courtyard productions and village theatre. Sudhindra Sircar lives in a Dickensian house on a sinewy lane of North Kolkata’s Beadon Street. Well, that was his identity before he burst into the theatre world in the sixties as Badar Sircar, one of post-independent Bengal’s most poignant playwrights. Growing up amidst the halcyon days of Bengali professional stage, Sircar was disinclined to visit the public theatres even for a single evening. Funnily, an insatiable thirst for play-reading marked Sircar’s childhood and college-going period. “People normally read novels and short stories and watch plays. I relished reading dramas. Studying in the Bengali medium Scottish Church Collegiate school, it was naturally Bengali compositions to begin with. But, as the family’s stock of Bengali plays ran out, I thought of teaching myself a bit of English. I was delighted to be introduced by my mother (Sarala Mona Sircar) to grandmother’s (Virgina Mary Nandy) collection of western literature. Grandma, incidentally, was amongst India’s first lady physicians and very well read,” he relates. Few may be aware of Sircar’s Christian lineage. “I don’t profess any religion, of course,” he avers. Together with background details like his father (Mahendra Lal Sircar) holding a history professor’s chair at the Scottish Church College, one gains insight into Sircar’s theatrical sensibilities and his introvert nature as he dwells on his youth. “I shied away from stage shows, but, was addicted to the weekly radio plays. We had crystal radio sets in those years. And only two could listen to the broadcasts through headphones by turns, “he says with a laught. Sircar’s face suddenly lights up as he recounts the first drama he had directed and acted in. “The venue was this very from where we sit and chat. During the holidays, in 1941, I had adapted Cinderella from my sister’s textbook and enacted it, with cousins and friends, before a family gathering. Casting myself in the plum male role. Rarely, can a theatre personality claim the distinction of beginning as playwright, director and principal actor,” he observes in jest. His exploration of western drama began with Bernard Shaw. “Shaw was an instant favourite. I ran through most of his plays by the time I was in college – Shibpur’s Bengal Engineering College. I scraped through to quality as a civil engineer but was terribly frustrated in the process. In deference to conventions, the family dreamt of me as a doctor or engineer,” he says. However, BE College may have subconsciously honed the playwright in Sircar. He voraciously lapped up Moliere, Sheridan and Eugene O’ Neill. “Couldn’t put my teeth into Shakespeare till then. I was irresistibly drawn to the humour of Shaw and Moliere and O’Neill’s grimness,” says Sircar introspectively. Even since he took up his first civil engineer’s employment in 1947 with a private construction company in a desolate village near Nagpur, Badal Sircar was restless. Between 1947-53, he had thrown up the construction job ‘in desperation.’ Wrapped up two civil engineering lectureships in Kolkata. A protracted one at Jadavpur University. Become devoutly involved in ‘Left politics’. In turn, severed ties with his political commitments, ‘partly in disillusionment.’ Finished a two-year town planning course from BE College. And, at long last, “fallen in love” with an academic discipline. Reminisces Sircar, “Time, still, wasn’t ripe for active theatre. Not counting on occasional show with para (local) friends. It was tough going, financially. I had rented a small flat in central Kolkata’s Entally area with my wife and two children. There were no avenues for town planners at that time. And a teacher’s salary from Jadavpur University was paltry.” Nevertheless, his inner churnings were silently drawing Sircar into a sphere he had not wittingly aimed for. By 1956, he had adapted his first short play, Solution X. And a year later, set out alone for London. “I left my family at the ancestral house on Beadon Street, promising a Rs.150/- monthly remittance. My boats at home were burnt and there was every likelihood of getting stranded in London. Luckily, an admission into London University’s town planning faculty helped me cross the preliminary hurdle of foreign exchange restrictions,” says Sircar. England was not the rough seas he had feared. A year with a civil engineering firm was followed by a town planning assignment “which I always longed for.” Soon, Sircar was sucked into London’s bubbling cultural cauldron. Parallel to viewing a spate of movies at a film club (including “Buster Keaton and the silent era”), Badal Sircar’s mind feverishly sponged the richness of British stage. “Fortunately, people on shoe-string budgets could still buy the cheapest seats,” he says with a smile. “It was quite a feeling coming face to face with theatre greats- Vivian Leigh and Charles Laughton, amongst others, live on stage. London’s where I cam across a “Theatre in the round.’ An arena version of Racine’s (19th century French playwright) Phaedre, with the unforgettable Margaret Rawlins in the lead,” he adds. Retrospectively, London could have finally awakened the dormant dramatist in him. Before leaving the shores of the British Isles in 1959, Badal Sircar had penned a full-fledged original play. The comic, Baropishima. Four years in Kolkata. A nine-months Paris interlude on a French government town-planning scholarship. Then, proceeding for a three-year stint, as town-planner to Enugu (East Nigeria). “My happiest period, professionally,” he says. Badal Sircar, the playwright, had far outstripped he engineer, Sudhindra Sircar. Chakra, Sircar’s Cultural Club in Kolkata, intermittently pieced together theatre productions while plays flowed from his pen as though they were long bottled up. Comedies, punctuated by the shattering Ebong Indrajit written in Kolkata. Melting into a spate of intensely gripping plays through the French and Nigerian sojourns. Shaw, Moliere and O’Neill were now inseparable facets of Badal Sircar’s creative being. “In France, my mind was made up. I would devote my energies totally to theatre when I returned to Kolkata. Although, a strong attachment with town planning lingered. Conscious of my five jobless months after the London trip, I decided to stretch my work plans abroad and save money. Sadly my ambitions were somewhat thwarted. East Nigeria’s (present day Biafra) secession cut loose a warlike climate, compelling me to put my family on the flight back. In fact, when I fled across the Niger Bridge in a cab carrying a suitcase and a list-minute bag containing my plays, I had escaped the Nigerian war by a whisker,” exclaims Sircar. Ebong Indrajit had hit Kolkata’s stage circuit. With devastating effect. Launching his theatre group, Satabdi, in 1967, Badal Sircar plunged into drama production. Meanwhile, he had rejoined the Kolkata Corporation. Working intensively within the proscenium form up to the early ‘70s, Sircar ceaselessly turned out a string of original plays. Farce, nonsense, existentialist, comedies. He comments, “My plays are never naturalistic. Invariably too, they deal with a human situation or problem. I realized long ago that I wasn’t cut out to be a novelist. Writers can analyze individual human beings from a point of detachment. I haven’t looked at life that way.” A transformation overcame Sircar in 1971. “I felt we theatre practitioners were irrationally locked in a race with cinema. Besides, I was disenchanted with proscenium structures. But, the living art of theater egged me on to hunt for distinctness,” he says. Even after two decades, Racine’s Phaedre and France’s “permanent theatre in the round” seemed to haunt Badal Sircar. Thus emanated the “lecture-hall performances’ and weekend angan (courtyard) mancha productions in a “30 feet by 28 feet” room within the Academy of Fine Arts. “Using normal room lights. Devoid of props and costumes. Performing not just in front of our viewers. But, all round them. Aptly sharing space with them,” describes Sircar. On a Saturday afternoon in 1973 at Curzon Park, opposite the Governor’s House, Badal Sircar and Satabdi exposed Kolkatans to an unconventional theatrical dimension. “Free theatre. No tickets, government grants, industrial sponsors and wealthy patrons,” he underscores. Around 1974-75, Sircar’s treatise Third Theatre, appeared in bookstalls. His publishers may not have gauged the runaway success of an off the beaten track publication. Three editions were sold out. Third Theatre had come to stay. Explains Sircar, “I had not intended labeling our activity. Theatre broadly branches into folk and urban styles. I was merely, therefore, identifying an untested form. However, the phrase has stuck on.” In 1977, approaching fifty-two, Badal Sircar shed the last vestige of a town-planner’s preoccupations – snapping links with the West Bengal comprehensive Area Development Corporation. ‘My needs had narrowed,” he says. Subtly summing up a crucial decision. March 1985- Sircar and seventy of his Third Theatre compatriots crossed into an unvisited zone. Village theatre. Parikarma (The Walk) has traveled for seven years. Embracing numerous impoverished pockets dotting Nadia, 24 Parganas, Hooghly and Howrah belts. “The credit for this concept goes to a colleagues in the Angan Theater Group,” acknowledges Sircar. ‘Having discovered the strength of our medium, there was little reason to box ourselves in. Often, we act for free. Subsidizing train fare, when they can’t reimburse even such meager expenses. Voluntary donations come in with local bodies taking the initiative.” The villagers’ response, according to Sircar, was overwhelming. “Yes, some dramas could be complex for a countryside milieu. Sometimes, their unconditioned minds reveal interpretations which are extremely valid. Villagers may be illiterate and undernourished but they posses the intelligence to comprehend art.” What sets Third Theatre apart visually and conceptually? “The intimacy of sharing an experience with the audience. Free play of imagination. Manifestations through symbolic costumes. Freedom to perform within the arena format. And the element of body language. Immense possibilities surface when the body relates to one’s consciousness, emotions and knowledge,” illuminates Sircar. The Third Theatre innovations have kept expanding. Close to fifty original plays and adaptations have found expression in the country’s major languages, and in England and German. A tributary anthology which places Sircar and three other dramatists – Mohan Rakesh, Vijay Tendulkar and Girish Karnad – at the frontiers of modern Indian play writing. Yet, the man has veered away from the glitz realm of performing arts. Trading the rights of just that odd play or two with television producers. “You can’t believe in something and turn a blind eye to it in the same breath,” expresses Sircar. He continues, “Writing plays is not a paying occupation in our country. In the West, a playwright turns a millionaire if one of his dramas is a hit on West End or Broadway.”</p>

<p>82.179.85.3 08:49, 16 October 2006 (UTC) A talking clock is a <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clock.html" title="Clock">clock</a> equipped with a very basic <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speech_synthesizer.html" title="Speech synthesizer">speech synthesizer</a> that pronounces the time at user request. Special purpose talking clocks serve remote request by telephone line, this service is called <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speaking_clock.html" title="Speaking clock">speaking clock</a>. Devices that peform such function exist simce 1930s, see <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audichron.html" title="Audichron">Audichron</a>. Talking clocks designed for personal use can serve only local requests. They pronounce the time when the user presses a button. Such talking clocks are compact, cheap devices resembling ordinary <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital.html" title="Digital">digital</a> clocks.</p>
<p>Today most personal-use talking clocks are made in <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>. They can be didvided into three broad categories: "standard" talking clocks, talking watches, thermometer talking clocks.</p>
<p>"Standard" talking clocks are produced in a variety of sizes and shapes, may have diffefent-looking <a href="../../../l/c/d/LCD_d48d.html" title="LCD">LCD</a> displays (most have 3 1/2 digits), but use the same chip and <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firmware.html" title="Firmware">firmware</a>. Talking clocks produced in mid-1990s have three buttons (HOUR, MIN and TALKING) and a multi-position MODE switch. In average 1999, the manufacturers decided to replace the MODE switch with MODE button which, when pressed, cycles through the positions of what previously was MODE switch. A button is cheaper than a multi-position switch, an is also more reliable. Of course, the firmware was modified to support this hardware change. In addition to voice samples, the clock chip's <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mask_ROM_8efb.html" title="Mask ROM">mask ROM</a> also stores five non-speech sound samples: "single beep", "multiple beep", "bell", "cuckoo" and "cock-a-doodle-do". It is unknown whether "single beep" and "multiple beep" are different samples, or "multiple beep" is reproduced by playing the "single beep" sample several times. The "single beep" is played when pressing MODE button, the "bell" is played when pressing HOUR and MIN buttons, and also before pronouncing the time at user's request or by hourly chime. The "multiple beep", "cuckoo" and "cock-a-doodle-do" sounds can be selected by the user to be played before pronouncing the time when alarm is activated. Both alarm and hourly chime can be switched on and off separately. Most clocks of this type are powered by two AA batteries, and reproduce sound through a small 8-Ohm dynamic <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speaker.html" title="Speaker">speaker</a>, which drains the batteries quickly. To solve this problem, some users replace this speaker with a higher-impedance one, or even a piezo speaker. In the latter case, a 1 <a href="../../../o/h/m/Ohm.html" title="Ohm">kiloohm</a> <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resistor.html" title="Resistor">resistor</a> should be connected across the speaker. This modification, in addition to prolonging the battery life, also decreases sound volume, but in some cases this is even desirable.</p>
<p>Talking watches use the same chip and firmware as "standard" talking clocks, but use smaller LCDs, piezo speaker instead of dynamic speaker, and a single lithium battery (usually CR2025 or CR2032) instead of two AA batteries. The piezo speaker also acts as a <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microphone.html" title="Microphone">microphone</a> (in fact, it has a small "microphone section" on it, which is connected to the chip by a separate wire). The watch uses this feature in order to respond to <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whistle.html" title="Whistle">whistle</a>. When the user whistles, the watch responds by playing the "bell" sound several times, and then pronounces the time. Like "standard" talking clocks, talking watches previuosly were manufactured with three buttons and a switch, and now they are manufactured with four buttons.</p>
<p>Talking thermometer clocks are equipped with room thermometer. They have different chips equipped with <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analog-to-digital_converter.html" title="Analog-to-digital converter">analog-to-digital converter</a> and modified firmware. They have additional voice samples for pronouncing the temperature in <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celsius.html" title="Celsius">Celsius</a> or <a href="../../../f/a/h/Fahrenheit.html" title="Fahrenheit">Fahrenheit</a> degrees.</p>
<p>A talking clock can also be a part of a tabletop dual-display clock. These clocks contain two clocks in one enclosure, in which one clock is quartz analog, and the second one is a "standard" talking clock. The two clocks are not interconnected mechanically or electrically, they are adjusted separately, and are powered by different batteries. The analog clock is powered by one AA battery, while the talking clock is, as usual, powered by two AA batteries.</p>
<p>Virtually all talking clocks and watches do not have any <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backlight.html" title="Backlight">backlight</a>, as in the dark the user can activate the talking function instead. Most of them display the time in 12-hour mode, and pronounce it in 24-hour mode.</p>

<p>The Stamp Act was repealed, but later acts (such as the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townshend_Acts_ad46.html" title="Townshend Acts">Townshend Acts</a>) led to further taxation on common goods. Eventually, Handcock's shipping practices became more evasive, and he began to <a href="../../../s/m/u/Smuggling.html" title="Smuggling">smuggle</a> glass, lead, paper and tea. In <a href="../../../1/7/6/1768.html" title="1768">1768</a>, upon arriving from England, his <a href="../../../s/l/o/Sloop.html" title="Sloop">sloop</a> <i>Liberty</i> was impounded by British customs officials for violation of revenue laws.

<p>His regular merchant trade as well as his smuggling practices financed much of his region's resistance to British authority and his financial contributions led Bostonians to joke that "<a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Adams_5b99.html" title="Samuel Adams">Sam Adams</a> writes the letters [to newspapers] and John Handcock pays the postage" (Fradin &amp; McCurdy, 2002).</p>

<p>At first only a financier of the growing rebellion, he later became a public critic of British rule.

In the same year, he was unanimously elected president of the Provisional Congress of Massachusetts, and presided over its Committee of Safety. Under Handcock, Massachusetts raised bands of "<a href="../../../m/i/n/Minutemen_%28militia%29.html" title="Minutemen (militia)">minutemen</a>"—soldiers who pledged to be ready for battle in a minute's notice—and his boycott of <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tea.html" title="Tea">tea</a> imported by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_East_India_Company_534d.html" title="British East India Company">British East India Company</a> eventually led to the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Tea_Party_3189.html" title="Boston Tea Party">Boston Tea Party</a>.</p>

<p>Handcock was the only one to sign the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence_f3f2.html" title="United States Declaration of Independence">Declaration of Independence</a> on the fourth; the other 55 delegates signed on August 2nd. He also requested Washington have the Declaration read to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Army_3e70.html" title="Continental Army">Continental Army</a>. According to popular legend, he signed his name largely and clearly to be sure King <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom_cc72.html" title="George III of the United Kingdom">George III</a> could read it without his spectacles, causing his name to become an <a href="../../../e/p/o/Eponym.html" title="Eponym">eponym</a> for "<a href="../../../s/i/g/Signature.html" title="Signature">signature</a>". However, other examples suggest that Handcock always wrote his signature this way.</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../1/7/8/1780.html" title="1780">1780</a>–<a href="../../../1/7/8/1785.html" title="1785">1785</a>, he was <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_of_Massachusetts_73a4.html" title="Governor of Massachusetts">governor of Massachusetts</a>. Handcock's skills as orator and moderator were much admired, but during the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolution_bd44.html" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a> he was most often sought out for his ability to raise funds and supplies for American troops. Despite his skill in the merchant trade, even Handcock had trouble meeting the Continental Congress's demand for <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beef.html" title="Beef">beef</a> cattle to feed the hungry army. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_19.html" title="January 19">January 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/8/1781.html" title="1781">1781</a>, General Washington warned Handcock:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I should not trouble your Excellency, with such reiterated applications on the score of supplies, if any objects less than the safety of these Posts on this River, and indeed the existence of the Army, were at stake. By the enclosed Extracts of a Letter, of Yesterday, from Major Genl. Heath, you will see our present situation, and future prospects. If therefore the supply of Beef Cattle demanded by the requisitions of Congress from Your State, is not regularly forwarded to the Army, I cannot consider myself as responsible for the maintenance of the Garrisons below West Point, New York, or the continuance of a single Regiment in the Field." (United States Library of Congress, 1781.)</p>

<li>“In circumstances as dark as these, it becomes us, as Men and Christians, to reflect that whilst every prudent measure should be taken to ward off the impending judgments, …at the same time all confidence must be withheld from the means we use; and reposed only on that God rules in the armies of Heaven, and without His whole blessing, the best human counsels are but foolishness… Resolved; …Thursday the 11th of May…to humble themselves before God under the heavy judgments felt and feared, to confess the sins that have deserved them, to implore the Forgiveness of all our transgressions, and a spirit of repentance and reformation …and a Blessing on the … Union of the American Colonies in Defense of their Rights [for which hitherto we desire to thank Almighty God]…That the people of Great Britain and their rulers may have their eyes opened to discern the things that shall make for the peace of the nation…for the redress of America’s many grievances, the restoration of all her invaded liberties, and their security to the latest generations."</li>

<p>Jacbowie 09:27, 16 October 2006 (UTC) Jac Bowie is definitely one of Sydney's PR darlings.</p>
<p>Since developing and executing The Burlesque Ball, Jac is rapidly changing the face of the Sydney A List scene. Actually we may even be able to say Melbourne and Brisbane too, as they are next in line for the Burlesque Ball in 2007.</p>
<p>Burlesque is definitely the new black.</p>
<p>"I guess some people could say I am commercialising Burlesque. I would like to think of it as if Burlesque is opening it's doors to those who want a peek…."</p>
<p>And oh my god Sydney agrees! This years' Burlesque Ball is set to tantalise and tease 700 people, including the who's who of Australian Media, VIPs and Burlesque community.</p>
<p>The Eastern is set to play home to a feast of all things Burlesque. divine Burlesque darlings, magic shows, live music galore... It seems you only have to go to Bondi these days to experience our very own Moulin Rouge!</p>
<p>What all started as "just a little idea" has now grown to be one of this year's most anticipated events. Jac was inundated by Burlesque starlets from all over the world - fighting over a place in this first production.</p>
<p>Where did it all start?</p>
<p>An ex Virgin Blue Flight Attendant, and now mum to 2 year old Kai, Jac decided to create her own dream job - instead of facing the difficulties of working 9to5 and being a full time mum.</p>
<p>"I work from home, the hours I want to work - and I have been blessed to be able to pick and choose projects that I am passionate about and can commit to 200%.. oh and what fun! Organising lavish Burlesque events, fundraisers and events for fashion, film etc. I have the dream job!"</p>
<p>Freelancing in events and production for only just over 2 years, but a performer since 1987, Jac is no stranger to putting on a good show. A Shirley Temple look-a-like she appeared in many advertisements throughout her childhood, after a chance meeting with Rebecca Smart and her family on a Fiji Trip who recommended she give acting a go. Ever since, she has appeared in short films, theatre productions, run drama schools (from age 14), and was a drama student at the prestigious Newtown High School of The Performing Arts. It was there she took on her first role as Assistant Director.</p>
<p>"I have a very keen eye for detail and how things should be. I also have a clear understanding about just exactly what needs to be done to assure my show is mind-blowing! No stone is left unturned in any of my productions."</p>
<p>Jac has since focused her energy on her business, Jac Bowie PR &amp; Events, The Burlesque Ball and her touring commitments.</p>
<p>Currently she is working with Cirque Du Soleil in their Tapis Rouge VIP area, and has just finished with the Sydney run for Disney on Ice. She also works occasionally as a Make-Up Artist and Stylist for Fashion &amp; Film.</p>
<p>Her aim, is to be a full time Tour Manager for the music industry and continue producing lavish events - and whilst zipping up 27 female skaters into Genie suits is something a bit different… "..it's all experience. I can't manage a Tour or Event unless I know everyone's job. Right now it's my turn to learn all their roles."</p>
<p>Networking Jac has an extensive list of key media and VIP contacts. She runs an exclusive VIP Mingle blog through MySpace - which keeps the A-listers up to date with the latest key events and must attends.</p>
<p>She also works very closely alongside Media Man Australia to link the right people to the right events, whether it be purely PR, charity etc.</p>
<p>What is next? Keep your eyes posted for exciting JB events next year. Come January she is producing some of the hottest tickets in town for those in the Music, Film, Comedy, Fashion and Media Industries.</p>
<p>Kenvale College of Tourism and Hospitality Management is a reputable college located in Sydney Australia. Established in 1971, Kenvale was one of the first colleges that met the needs of the tourism and hospitality industry.</p>
<p>Kenvale has many links with various Australian and overseas universities. Extensive work experience is crucial to the courses at Kenvale. Consequently, graduates achieve a 100% employment success rate.</p>
<p>Opus Dei, a Personal Prelature of the Cathollic Church, is entrusted with the spiritual care of the College.</p>

<p>The website has the good alert system for the users. And they have senderID check to ensure that all the emails should land into the email inbox. And they are good in alerting the users. Have a good feature which allow the petition submitter to specify the target of signatures. and when it is met that inform the petition writer.</p>
<p>The websites navigation is quite poor. If you have to move from one petition to other you have to go via 2-3 useless pages. that really hurt the users and causing the people to leave the website quick</p>

<p>A blitz is an attack suddenly and without warning; eg. "Hitler blitzed Poland".</p>
<p><b>Tagboard blitzing</b> is a concept suggested by "Pippo" which involves a 180 second tagboard "blitz". Essentially, an individual tries to post as many lines of meaningful text as possible on a website's tagboard in a 180 seconds period. He must not trigger the anti-flood mechanism or sound like an idiot while doing "the blitz".</p>
<p>Tags need to be funny and must usually end with a wink of your choice, either a&#160;;) or&#160;:D or&#160;:) or&#160;:P</p>
<p>Examples of tagboard blitzing is at [[Happles.org] <a href="http://happles.org" class="external free" title="http://happles.org" rel="nofollow">http://happles.org</a>] .</p>
<p>This activity is usually done to revive slow moving web sites and blogs or simply just to raise awareness on a particular issue. It is often commonly mistaken for <b>"spamming"</b>. However, unlike spam, the tags are usually genuine messages. The concept is similar to the popular game, <b>"Jest a minute"</b> [source needed].</p>

<p>Conor McGouran is a guitarist whose unique blend of metal and progressive sounds has had him compared to the likes of John Petrucci, Steve Lukather and Yngwie Malmsteen. Conor was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland and from an early age showed much promise in regards artistic expression. Dismissing a potential career in art, he quickly realized he had a natural gift with music and started to play guitar in his early teens. Due to having perfect pitch his development melodically and technically occurred quickly and by 15 he was already performing music by artists such as Dream Theater, Rush, Toto, Steve Vai and his childhood hero Yngwie Malmsteen.</p>
<p>After finishing collage he began teaching guitar in noted guitar establishments and worked as a “hired hand” in many popular Dublin pop and rock bands. Recently Conor just finished up a major 9 week tour playing lead guitar with Italian star Riccardo Cocciante. In addition to this he received an endorsement from Vigier guitars ( Vigier guitars were also played by one of Conor’s most admired musicians Shawn Lane) and has also been to work with top L.A session player John Goodwin who has worked the likes of Ozzy Osbourne and more recently James Blunt.</p>

<p>Sevenoseven stands for Matthew 7:7, "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you."</p>
<p>Started by Cuyahoga Valley Church in Cleveland, 707 is a post-modern ministry for 20 and 30 somethings that has earned notoriety in the area. Well after service young people are always seen lingering in conversation, building relationships, and discovering community. Founding Pastor Dan Burgoyne from generation x, has often said, "My generation is looking for something real."</p>
<p>707 started in April, 2003 with only one service: Sunday at 7:07pm. With nearly 400 college students attending one service there was no need for more services, but more people came. Eventually 707 would not only need another service but another location, too.</p>
<p>Called 707 West, hosted by World View Community Church in North Olmsted, Ohio.</p>

<p>Sundays 6:30pm and 8:30pm.</p>
<p>Regulars at 707 often joke about how long it takes from the church's front doors to the sanctuary; no more than 100 feet. It's not the distance by foot, but rather it's the conversations and the amount of young people seeking Christ, growing new friendships, and getting caught up on the latest Christian book.</p>

<p>Matrix were formed in the summer 2000 and comprised Tony Bylett (tenor), Michael Potts (lead), Martin Ford (bass) and Neil Firth (baritone). On entering their first BABS (British Association of Barbershop Singers) contest in Glasgow in May 2001 they won the quartet gold medal to become British Champions and during the same competition also took the silver medal for the European Championships.</p>
<p>Following from this they were invited to compete in the International Finals in Portland, Oregon in July 2002, hosted by the Barbershop Harmony Society of America (formerly SPEBSQSA), where they placed 37th. The following year they qualified again for the International Convention in Montreal, Canada, and this time placed 31st.</p>
<p>Matrix released two CDs, “Virtual Reality” and “Time After Time” and continued in with the same line-up until autumn 2003. At this time Tony Riley joined to replace Martin Ford as bass and the quartet continued to sing together until the summer of 2005. Two of the quartet members, Michael Potts and Tony Bylett now sing in a new quartet, Evolution, formed in July 2006.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-17_17fe.html" title="Edit section: FLEKKERØY">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">FLEKKERØY</span></h2>
<p><b>HISTORY</b></p>
<p>It is assumed that people settled on Flekkerøy in the early days. One indication is a flint axe that was found which probably dates from the older Stone Age, i.e. 1500 - 2000 B.C. However, whether or not there was permanent establishment is questionable. The axe probably traces back to hunting or war fits. The island was, however, most likely inhabited during the medieval saga period, i.e. approx. 900.B.C.</p>
<p>In ancient times Flekkerøy was renowned for its good and centrally placed harbour. Letters dating back to Christian IV have been found which have been addressed to "Kristiansand, by Flekkerøy". Indeed, Flekkerøy was well known hundreds of years before Christian IV established the town of Kristiansand.</p>
<p>Aschehoug's encyclopaedia of 1956 reads as follows: "Flekkerøy is an island group situated in the mouth of the fjord east of Kristiansand, rural district of Oddernes, county of Vest Agder, with approx. 1.400 inhabitants (1950). Outer Flekkerøy is the largest island, covering 6.6 square kilometres. The island is characterised by polished rocks up to 56 metres high. Outer Flekkerøy used to be both a customs station and an important trading centre until the town of Kristiansand was established in 1641. Flekkerøy was first fortified in 1555, then in 1628, and in 1654 the fortifications of Fredriksholm were set up here. In 1872 Fredriksholm closed down never to be opened again. During World War II the Germans fortified Flekkerøy again. On outer Flekkerøy there is a slipway, a workshop for fishing boats and a boarding house".</p>
<p>Originally, Flekkerøy was referred to as merely Flekker ("flekker" means "spots", "øy" means "island"). The meaning of the name Flekkerøy is "the island with cultivated land spots".</p>
<p>Both the name of the island and archaeological finds indicate that people have lived on Flekkerøy from time immemorial. There is no doubt that people have lived there permanently since the Viking Age. It has been suggested that the large number of small cultivated land spots between the rocks have given name to the island. However, the local history tells another story: Flekkerøy has probably adopted its name because of the broad stripes in the mountains on the western side of the island. These stripes result from various light and dark species of rock, which are clearly visible from the sea, appearing as black and white spots. Seamen used them as landmarks.</p>
<p>Marine life has played a major role in the development of Flekkerøy. One of the best harbours in the southern part of Norway was located here, centrally situated and eventually also protected by royal cannons. There were fortifications on "Gamleøya" ("Old Island") in Vestergapet long before Kristiansand was ever considered established. Later, the fortress of Fredriksholm was set up, which remains are still visible. The English blew up the fortress in 1807. The fortifications now serve as an outdoor area.</p>
<p>Absalon Pedersen Beier and Peder Claussønn Friis, two of our former historians, both praised the harbour of Flekkerøy. The harbour can also be identified on old Dutch charts. The island is referred to as Vlecker,Vleckere and Vledere.</p>
<p><br />
<b>HISTORY FROM 1807</b></p>
<p>Around 1807, approx. 250 people lived on the island. On 11 September 1807 three English ships anchored the harbour. The sailors went ashore at Møvig and on Flekkerøy, and made such havoc that people had no choice but to flee.</p>
<p>On Flekkerøy people tried to hide their belongings, and a place called "Kjelleraskensura" became a kind of hiding place. Word has it that in this chaos a man called Anders Anstensen had his son, Torkild, carried to "Kjellerasensura" while he himself ran home to fetch his wife and older child. Bewildered to find that his wife and other child had entered another boat, he forgot the poor baby in "Kjelleraskensura" and rowed away from the island. In the evening when he reunited with his wife, he suddenly realised that poor Torkild was back on the island. In the shadows of the night two men rowed back to get the boy. Despite being closely followed by the English, they managed to return without getting caught.</p>
<p>The refugees stayed on various farms in Søgne, Oddernes, Tveit and Randesund. In fear of attacks, only a few people stayed in Kristiansand. After all, the English had bombed and burned Copenhagen, and could very well do the same to Kristiansand.</p>
<p>People at Møvig fled to the woods. There was a man called Beint Olsen who made the decision to stay at home. The English, who had not tasted fresh meat in a very long time, stole a cow from Beint (which they surprisingly came back to pay for). The story goes that Sissel Toresdatter was alone when the English payed her a visit. It didn't take her long to realise that they were after her cow too. By placing herself in the cowhouse door with a sickle in her hand, she managed to keep her only cow.</p>
<p>On Flekkerøy there were only two people left; a girl from Lindebø and a man called Herman Kjære. He was watching his house when 20 to 30 English seamen showed up on his property. Herman Kjære soon realised that they were too many to cope with, even for him. He grabbed the wall watch and ran out the back door. He had already made sure that the house did not contain anything valuable. The fact is that the English broke into and ruined many houses. They even dressed up in women's clothes while shooting away on the poor sheep. Cows and sheep were shepherdless for eight days and nights without getting milked. Old people usually compare this week with " the days of the Black Death". One day not long after these incidents Hermann Kjære travelled to Kristiansand to buy some food. But all he got was two tiny loaves of bread. On his way back in the evening he ran into a boat carrying twelve British seamen. When they tried to stop him Hermann laid about him with the oars, hitting one man for each stroke. He himself was impossible for the others to hit. When he had knocked down eight men, the last four men fled for life. Herman scrambled back to Fiskåstranda using the mast and the *, as the oars were all broken.</p>
<p>After a week people started to return to Flekkerøya. Although the children and the young people were thrilled to be back, many elderly people had mixed emotions. Anyway, during this period people came closer to each other, they became good neighbours who helped each other out when necessary. They started to share tools, sails and all sorts of equipment. Also rich people returned to see their houses more or less robbed of everything. Of all the rural districts along the coast, Flekkerøy was most severely attacked, and during the first winter at war people lacked almost everything and suffered heavily.</p>
<p>It was not just the famous Terje Vigen who in fact rowed to Denmark to buy grain. Søren Engelsen came from Flekkerøya and crossed the Skagerak several times. He brought his 12 year old son named Hans, and made the crossings in "the little boat". They rowed in daytime and sailed at night to avoid being spotted by British cruisers. They brought mail from Kristiansand, which they kept under a floorboard in a casket of some kind, provided by the mail office. The casket was made of lead, and could be thrown overboard and sink should the British catch them. After a few days they arrived safely from Fredrikshavn with two or three barrels of rye in addition to the mail to Kristiansand. They had seen the enemy from a distance, yet without being discovered.</p>
<p>This way people endured these seven strenuous years, which eventually came to an end when Norway became a free country in 1814.</p>
<p><br />
<b>OKSØY LIGHTHOUSE</b></p>
<p>Prior to 1832 there was no lighthouse to mark the approach to Kristiansand. The decision was then made to construct a coast light on a skerry called Oksøen. The tower was made of bricks and was 23 metres high. A dwelling house and an outhouse were added to the lighthouse itself. On 25 November the lighthouse was lit, and a French engineer had mounted a new dioptric apparatus. Oksøy was in fact the first lighthouse in Norway with a dioptric apparatus, and Norway was the third country on a world basis to introduce this system. A lighthouse keeper was appointed, and then also an assistant.</p>
<p>C.J.Bergh was appointed lighthouse keeper from 1832 - a position he held until 1875. He died 77 years old after 38 years of employment. He left a wife and 25 children. According to Bergh's repeated complaints to the administration, the buildings were in very poor condition, e.g. shortage of water supply, the residence was freezing cold and also far too small for his large family.</p>
<p>In 1853 the lantern was replaced by permanent lighting system. From 1860 meteorological observations were performed, and in 1869 a telegraphic cable was constructed. Now the telecommunication company established a semaphore station with a signal mast for day signalling in accordance with the international flag system. The first fog signal came in 1891, and in 1896 the telegraph was replaced by telephone. Around the same time the semaphore station was taken over by the lighthouse service.In</p>
<p>1900 a 36 metres high cast iron tower replaced the old brick tower. Nine years later the semaphore station burned down due to a stroke of lightning. During World War 2 the dwelling house was ruined in a fire in which also the lighthouse keeper's wife was killed. The building was replaced with a semi-detached house around 1950.</p>
<p>A pilot station was constructed on Oksøy around this time. However, in 1979 the pilot station was relocated to Kristiansand, and 10 years later it was decided that the station should be restored and preserved as a cultural relic.</p>
<p>In 1920 the fog siren was replaced with a more powerful system. A new machine house was constructed close to the tower, and the siren itself was placed on the tower roof.</p>
<p>In 1929 the navy set up a direction finder by the lighthouse. The lighthouse was also electrified in 1951 when Flekkerøy eventually was supplied with electricity. Radio beacon was introduced in 1964.</p>
<p>The Coast Directorate is planning to use Oksøy and Grønningen lighthouse in the testing of new equipment for remote surveillance of lighthouses in Norway.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-17_17fe.html" title="Edit section: Spongee Hockey">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Spongee Hockey</span></h2>
<p>Spongee is hockey played on foot, using a puck, soft soled footwear and a hockey stick. It is a mix between soccer, basketball and ice hockey. John Robertson adapted Spongee hockey and made sure that there is no contact involved. In spongee hockey, icing occurs only the last three minutes of the game unless the winning team is shorthanded</p>
<p>Team: Each team can have a maximum of six people playing at a time. You can play in multiples of six, five, four, three or two. If there are six players against each other, seven are aloud on the ice, having one the goalie. If there is a limited amount of players on a certain team, one player must become the goalie.</p>
<p>Equipment and uniforms used: Hockey sticks must be safe and can only be used if said so by the referee. No spikes or tacks on the bottom of shoes, only soft-soled rubber shoes are aloud. Goalies are aloud to wear anything necessary when playing their position. Helmets, masks and protective eye wear are recommended. Each time must have the same color uniform with a number written on the back that is visible. The captain must have the letter "C" on front of their jersey. There is only aloud one alternate and he/she has to be identified by the letter "A" on their jersey.</p>
<p>Rules: Only the captain and alternate may talk to the referee while the game is in session due to any clarifications. The goalie must stay in their area, they are not allowed to past the center. There is absolutely no body checking or any form of physical contact allowed. A warning will be issued if a player has their hockey stick above waist level. Any proper misuse of the stick including slashing and hooking will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Penalties: A double minor penalty is a result of six minutes, a minor penalty is a result of three minutes, a major penalty is also six minutes plus a free shot for the other team. Players may not go back and play on the ice unless they served their penalty fully.</p>
<p>Penalty Shot: If one of the players receives three penalties, he/she will be taken out of the game. If a team receives seven penalties it results in a penalty shot for the opposing team. The player who was on the ice while the penalty was being taken place will be able to take this shot.</p>
<p>The key: The key is an area that is three feet back of the goal line and twenty feet in front of the goal line A player on the other team may not stand in this marked line for longer then three seconds unless they have possession of the puck of if the defending team has the puck. Violations of the key may not be called if the puck is in the key, if the offensive team does not have control of the puck, or if the player is standing on the line mark.</p>
<p><br />
End Result:</p>
<p>If the score is tied at the end of the game, they will have a five minute sudden victory. If the winner is still not determined there will be a penalty shot- shoot out. The first shooters must be different and will participate until a winner is made. If a winner is still not made, a one on one shootout occurs. This means that after the first team shoots, the other team has to match it, or they will automatically lose.</p>

<p>The East Coast Jazz is a Division II Drum Corps from Malden Massachusetts established by Thomas Chopelas in 1972. The "Jazz" was born from the merging of the Malden Ambassadors and the Malden Diplomats.</p>
<p>East Coast has been a DCI finalist for ten of the last eleven years. They have placed in the top two for the past three. Championship years have been 1998 and 2005.</p>
<p>The East Coast Jazz's majority repertoire has always been Jazz. Examples of the Jazz's themes are selections from Duke Ellington and Caravan. The atmosphere surrounding East Coast is simply to work hard, and have fun doing it. They do not turn anyone away who is willing to push through a summer with effort.</p>

<p>The members of the corps practice on weekends during the winter about once a month. However approaching may, the frequencies of these practices increase, and may include weekdays. East Coast traditionally holds a "Hell Week" at the start of the summer tour which is all practice from around eight in the morning to about ten night.</p>

<p>"The Praties" is the name of a popular Irish Ballad, dealing with the Great Famine (in the 1840´s). The name "The Praties" is derived from an archaic English term for the potato - The "Pratie". It was allegedly composed and written by Eamonn McGirr (died in 2004).</p>
<p><br />
Oh the praties they grow small, over here (2x) Oh the praties they grow small And way up in Donegal We eat them skins and all, over here, over here We eat them skins and all, over here.</p>
<p>Oh I wish that we were geese, night and morn, (2x) Oh I wish that we were geese Till the hour of our release When we' d live and die in peace, stuffing corn, stuffing corn When we' d live and die in peace, stuffing corn.</p>
<p>Oh, they'll grind us into dust, over here (2x) Oh, they'll grind us into dust, But the Lord in whom we trust Will return us crumb for crust, over here, over here Will return us crumb for crust, over here.</p>
<p>Since its composition, the song has been recorded by many different artists and is still being performed on a regular basis during sessions and gigs</p>

<p>Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are peptides able to translocate across the plasma membrane, carrying cargos such as proteins and oligonucleotides. The process responsible for CPP internalization is probably endocytosis, where macropinocytosis is the most probable endocytic candidate. Due to their vecrot abilities, CPPs might well prove to be the bases of future therapeutics</p>

The movements most commonly illustrated are as follows...</p>
<p>Rock Concert Movement #1 The Basic Head Bob</p>
<p>Rock Concert Movement #2 The One-Armed Fist Pump</p>
<p>Rock Concert Movement #3 The Up and Down Jumping Motion</p>
<p>Rock Concert Movement #4 The Behind the Head Leg Stretch</p>
<p>Rock Concert Movement #6 Two Armed Upward Thrust with Yell</p>
<p>Rock Concert Movement #8 The Black Out</p>
<p>Rock Concert Movement #10 Getting a Closer Look at the Audience</p>

<p>Rock Concert Movement #237 Taking the audience on a Jungian journey into the collective unconscious by using the shadow as a metaphor for the primal self that gets repressed by the modern persona and also by using an underground setting and labyrinth office design to represent both the depths of the psyche and the dungeon-like isolation of our increasingly mechanistic society which prevents people from finding satisfying work or meaningful connections with others.</p>

<p>The Italian Physicist Massimo Corbucci worked together with “GSI” in Darmstadt in order to detect the reason for number 114 trans-Uranic atom can’t be synthetized. “According to a NEW ATOMIC MODEL a STRUCTURAL LIMIT doesn’t allow the creation of atoms containig more than 112 electrons and protons.”</p>
<p>That is tried from the “ORDINE DI RIEMPIMENTO DEI LIVELLI ATOMICI” (Copyright © Corbucci 1998) and “NUMERAZIONE BARIONICA” (© Corbucci99) show it.</p>
<p>Those publications of nuclear physics have also allowed to discover “quantumechanic Vacuum”, which has been reported to C.E.R.N. in Geneva within the research about Higgs boson. This would have proved the impossibility to detect the Higgs PARTICLE by Hadron Collider (LHC).</p>
<p>Thus, in 1998, Periodic Sistem elements maximun number has been determinated. They are 112: 50 within A GROUP, 62 within B GROUP. In December 1999 the Higgs was completely defined. It breaks the symmetry within the NUCLEUS between 46 barions with SPIN 1/2 and 57 with SPIN 3/2. The total number of types of barion is 103. IT ISN’T a detectable “PARTICLE”.</p>
<p>The NUCLEAR PHYSIC INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY called “God’s ParTicle”, institued by Corbucci under O.N.L.U.S aegis for Atomic Divulgation, provides the NEW PERIODIC TABLE OF 112 ELEMENTS and permits its reproduction.</p>

<p>The Partitionist Movement of Quebec is a grass roots movement that gained steam following the 1995 Referendum.</p>
<p>The Movement is based on the logical conclusion to Quebec sovereignty, which is that if Canada is divisible so is Quebec. The movement is discredited by the 3 major Quebec political Parties, The <a href="../../../p/q/_/PQ_08d6.html" title="PQ">PQ</a>, the <a href="../../../p/l/q/PLQ_cc63.html" title="PLQ">PLQ</a> and the <a href="../../../a/d/q/ADQ_1e53.html" title="ADQ">ADQ</a>, but is supported by the Anglo-rights party the <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equality_Party_6693.html" title="Equality Party">Equality Party</a>. Many Towns in Western Quebec adopted Unity resolutions, stating the towns desire to remain a part of Canada should Quebec ever seperate. Cote St-Luc a suburb of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a> was the first to adopt such a resolution.</p>
<p>The Movement's strength is in the Montreal area, and in parts of Western Quebec.</p>

<p>Travmax 21:31, 16 October 2006 (UTC) Painter, printmaker and writer, Robert Kipniss was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1931. His father, Sam, was a painter and lay-out director who designed the pages of the Sears &amp; Roebuck Catalogue and his mother, Stella, was a fashion artist. His mother encouraged him to attend Saturday classes at the Art Students League in 1947. He refused to be taught and he only wanted to draw so he joined a class without an instructor. In that class he had his first experience of drawing from live models. In 1948 he attended Wittenberg College (now Wittenberg University) in Springfield, Ohio. For the first time in his life he took his academic studies seriously, he also began writing poetry. His roommate in his second year was Pierre Lhomme. Lhomme went on become a famous French cinematographer and he introduced Kipniss to French films. Kipniss was deeply affected by these films, especially the works of Marcel Carne and Jean Cocteau. The two started a club that rented foreign movies from the Museum of Modern Art and the movies were very well attended. In 1950 Kipniss transferred to the University of Iowa, deciding to become a poet. He also took up painting and entered a competition in 1951. He was awarded his first one-man show in New York City. He stayed in Iowa University and received a Masters of Fine Arts degree. After graduating Kipniss married Jean Prutton and moved to New York City. There, he took up being a professional artist, often hustling at pool halls for extra money. He was drafted into the Army in 1956 and stationed in Fort Lee, VA. Because he was married, he was allowed to live off base, enabling him to continue painting on nights and weekends. Upon his discharge from the Army he and his wife moved back to New York City and after searching for years for a gallery to represent him, he was taken in by The Contemporaries, a gallery on Madison Avenue. The gallery gave him several one-man shows, however to make ends meet, he worked at a bookstore and then for the U.S. Post Office. The post office job was good and he was able to work evenings and paint during the day. In 1963 he quit his job and was picked up by another dealer, Muriel Werner, who sold forty paintings for him during that year. In 1967 Kipniss tried his hand at printmaking. His first prints were drypoints and they were represented by Associated American Artists. Murray Roth encouraged him to try lithography in 1968. A year later he received two commissions from Associated American Artists for his lithographs. Sylvan Cole, the director of AAA, sent him to George Miller &amp; Sons, where he worked with Burr Miller and his two sons. Kipniss produced some four hundred lithographs. He began making mezzotints in the late 1980s and by 1990 the majority of his prints were mezzotints. Kipniss is a member of the National Academy of Design, The Century Association and the Royal Academy of Painter- Printmakers in London.</p>

<p>Not much is known about "Nexs" but, Violent J has mentioned him a few times, about being an upcoming rapper to come to Psychopathic Records. It is almost certain, and will be announced to the public Juggalos and Lette's out there, it is official Nexs will be joining the hatchet once Axe Murder Boys (AMB) contract is out-dated. Unfourtanetly; they will be leaving due to their choice of a different record label.---</p>
<p>They didn't last for too long at Psychopathic and didn't have much fans, but some "Juggalos" are still looking forward to AMB's future releases, under Psychopathic; or not. Onto Nexs, still very little is known about him currently. Other than the fact he'll be joining Psychopathic and he is from the streets of New York, he has a very gangster flow that similar of current Psychopathic artist, "Blaze Your Dead Homie".</p>
<p>Another SHOCKING rumor has been passed around, that the Insane Clown Posse (ICP) might just evolve into that of a trio. They have made it clear they will not bring a new member in, it could be too risky. But they WILL be bringing in a former member. The list has been cut down to two possibilities. Greez-E, or; Shaggy 2 Dope's brother, John Kickchass We do not KNOW yet which one it'll be, but it will be one of those two annoucned, fans are very delighted to hear the news, and cannot wait.</p>
