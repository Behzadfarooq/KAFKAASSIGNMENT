<p>The Heinen's stub is not intended to advertise the store whatsoever. It is merely providing information on a local community-based grocery store. Perhaps it could be placed within a larger group of articles that discusses community-based grocery stores and their importance in modern suburban areas. Notability need not be a concept of national concern. Grocery stores small and large contribute to the growth of cities alike. They equally bring about the ideas of economy, consumerism, and small business.</p>
<p>Heinen's is comparable to many other grocery stores such as Giant Eagle, and it can furthermore be identified as a competing force against these stores. It should not be considered non-notable simply because it is a local chain in its infancy.</p>

<p>I don't understand why <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> must be the basis for acceptance. Small and growing businesses have little or no chance against it and should be judged using other criteria. Heinen's is a well-known grocery competitor in Ohio and the greater Cleveland area. For information about Heinen's, view <a href="http://www.heinens.com/HeinensMemberApplication/default.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.heinens.com/HeinensMemberApplication/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Additionally, Heinen's is a grocer partner of Continental Airlines. <a href="http://www.continental.com/onepass/earn/grocers/heinens.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.continental.com/onepass/earn/grocers/heinens.asp" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluebul1989_7d7d.html" title="User:Bluebul1989">Bluebul1989</a> 01:53, 31 May 2006 (UTC)bluebul1989</p>
<p>Here is a site listing financial information and rankings of top Ohio businesses between 2003 and 2004. Heinen's is ranked within the top 100 on this list. Its sales volume was calculated to be between 100 and 499 million dollars. Heinen's had 2,200 employees at this time and its ranking had increased 42.7% in a one year period. <a href="http://www.odod.state.oh.us/research/files/B100000004.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.odod.state.oh.us/research/files/B100000004.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluebul1989_7d7d.html" title="User:Bluebul1989">Bluebul1989</a> 02:20, 31 May 2006 (UTC)bluebul1989</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Companies like this are precisely why <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is in place. Wikipedia is not the Yellow Pages. The intent is to only document companies that are newsworthy and notable. A small local grocery chain with 2,200 employees is neither. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 03:33, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Though the chain is small, upon further research I have discovered that it passes 2 out of 3 of the criteria required to be considered notable listed in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. A company known as Wyse Advertising has decided to work for Heinen's and to conduct research for the business. <a href="http://www.wyseadv.com/news/news_link8.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.wyseadv.com/news/news_link8.asp" rel="nofollow">Wyse Advertising</a>. Moreover, as I stated before, Heinen's is listed as a top 100 private Ohio business (it was ranked 51 in 2004) and continues to grow in size and volume. Please consider that Heinen's, although not newsworthy, is indeed notable and competes with many large businesses within its operating area, including <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giant_Eagle_dbff.html" title="Giant Eagle">Giant Eagle</a> and Tops to name a few. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluebul1989_7d7d.html" title="User:Bluebul1989">Bluebul1989</a> 03:59, 31 May 2006 (UTC)bluebul1989</p>

<li>You know, I think the standards laid out in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> are too high (that doesn't change my vote), but I'm wondering something. Why, exactly, are you so intent upon getting this store an article? Do you work for them? Are you an owner? Friends of yours? If you really think that people are interested in learning about this small chain because it's interesting or notable, then fine, but it doesn't seem to me you're very objective here (<a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>). I'm sure it plays a huge role in your local community, much like any grocery store does. I'll bet it's a wonderful store, and may very well be notable someday. Right now, though, it simply doesn't meet the standards for an article. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 07:59, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>As I said before, I am not trying to advertise the store. Yes, I am from Ohio and I in fact live near a Heinen's. Yet I have no bias towards Heinen's and consider it as one of many grocery stores in the Ohio region (these other businesses being recognized in Wikipedia). I feel the chain is an important and influential business in Ohio, and should additionally be recognized as a business competitor. I do not work for Wyse Advertising as I am a 16-year-old junior in highschool. Please consider everything that I have discussed in my posts above. If you still do not believe that Heinen's should be submitted as an entry in Wikipedia, at the very least perhaps it could be grouped with other small, less nationally known businesses (or regional businesses), in a "small and notable businesses" article. This would give an opportunity to many smaller businesses that are important but are left in the dust only because they are not nationally recognized. It would also expand Wikipedia without giving too much attention to each individual business. I know that Wikipedia is not the Yellow Pages and I agree that not any ordinary or local business deserves a place in an enyclopedia. My only intent is to enter Heinen's as a rather notable and competitive supermarket chain in Ohio, and to eventually bring light to other small and growing businesses in the United States that deserve to be known and recognized as important parts of the economy. <b>-Author of Heinen's Article</b> <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluebul1989_7d7d.html" title="User:Bluebul1989">Bluebul1989</a> 20:07, 31 May 2006 (UTC)bluebul1989</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I think if a business has 2200 employees and is a chain it should be kept. I Think the idea behind WP:CORP is to keep the random hot-dog stands off of WP... not the company who owns 400. Seems to pass WP:CORP in any case.

<p><b>IMPORTANT</b> Heinen's is located on the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarkets_in_the_United_States_8277.html" title="Supermarkets in the United States">Supermarkets in the United States</a> page under the "Smaller Chains" section. It was already on this page before I even created the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinen%27s.html" title="Heinen's">Heinen's</a> article, signifying that the creator intended to eventually link this to a Wikipedia article specifically about Heinen's. Having a spot on this page, it is obviously a notable small business, and the Heinen's stub should therefore be permitted. View the page here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarkets_in_the_United_States" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarkets_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. I would also like to note the permittance of other smaller, regional chains in this section that are comparable to Heinen's. Many of these chains are as small as Heinen's. Here are some examples: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodman%27s_Food_Market" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodman%27s_Food_Market" rel="nofollow">Woodman's Food Market</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westborn_Market" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westborn_Market" rel="nofollow">Westborn Market</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrop%27s_Super_Market" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrop%27s_Super_Market" rel="nofollow">Ukrop's Super Market</a>. There are many chains that are smaller and have a lower sales volume than Heinen's that are located on the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarkets_in_the_United_States_8277.html" title="Supermarkets in the United States">Supermarkets in the United States</a> page and that have been granted Wikipedia pages. I find it absolutely ridiculous that there is an obvious inconsistency and discrepancy in Wikipedia policy and ruling that I got trapped in the middle of. My article was not judged in the same manner that these other articles were and was immediately proposed for deletion without any consideration. The fact that I had to fight so hard to support something that should not have been debated in the first place is even more upsetting. I urge that this issue be settled immediately and that all "smaller chains" located in the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarkets_in_the_United_States_8277.html" title="Supermarkets in the United States">Supermarkets in the United States</a> article be granted a Wikipedia page, as they are certainly important grocery chains. I hope that all future additions of smaller, notable businesses are overlooked with a fairness and consistency that is expected from Wikipedia. A business does not have to be a large, nationally recognized chain, to be considered notable. -Author of Heinen's stub <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluebul1989_7d7d.html" title="User:Bluebul1989">Bluebul1989</a> 03:05, 1 June 2006 (UTC)bluebul1989</p>
