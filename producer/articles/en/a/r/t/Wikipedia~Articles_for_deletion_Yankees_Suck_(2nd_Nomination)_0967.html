<li><s><b>Strong Delete</b></s> <b>Strong Merge</b> A chant about the Yankees sucking does not, I believe, qualify as "baseball lore." It is a mundane chant that could be done by any team's fans against another team that they are playing. The only signifance is that New Englanders in general (Red Sox fans in particular) yell this chant at non-Yankee related events. This suggests to me that, at best, this article should be merged with Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry. The fact that there are youtube videos of other teams chanting it is only significant in as much as that other team's fans feel strongly about the Yankees when in direct competition. <a href="../../../d/j/d/User%7EDjdickmutt_a527.html" title="User:Djdickmutt">Djdickmutt</a> 01:22, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't feel like I've heard a single convincing argument yet for why this requires a standalone article. Chanting, whether it's "Yankees Suck," "Boston Sucks," or "Cubs Suck" is clearly a part of baseball rivalry. This particular chant would appear to only be notable because it is part of one of the most notable rivalries in all of sports. Include it in the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry page. <a href="../../../d/j/d/User%7EDjdickmutt_a527.html" title="User:Djdickmutt">Djdickmutt</a> 22:11, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment.</b> I'll do my best to expand on my points above. It a notable, well-documented chant that has also become a marketing phenomena and has sparked legal and civil rights debates. <a href="http://www.anchorweb.org/old%20site/Sports/041503/tshirt.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.anchorweb.org/old%20site/Sports/041503/tshirt.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. It is not simply a phrase that one team's fans yells at the expense of another team. This chant is well-documented and has influence in the way that a phrase like "Blue Jays Blow" does not. -- <a href="../../../n/o/_/User%7ENo_Guru_cc59.html" title="User:No Guru">No Guru</a> 22:31, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'll concede that it is a more significant phrase than "Blue Jays Blow" or any other chant directed at a specific team, but it still seems that the main reason for the phenomenon is because of the Yanks/Sox rivalry, and don't you feel that all of that could be covered with a merge into the Rivalry's article? <a href="../../../d/j/d/User%7EDjdickmutt_a527.html" title="User:Djdickmutt">Djdickmutt</a> 23:31, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't. The rivalry is well known, without a doubt. The issue is that this phrase itself has taken on a life of its own outside the rivalry. It's referred to in non-baseball contexts, it's cited as one of the more unsavory aspects of sports chants, and it's responsible for a fairly consequential merchandising situation, to boot. If people search for "Yankees Suck," they're not looking for information on the rivalry, they want information on the chant and the things around it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:29, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
