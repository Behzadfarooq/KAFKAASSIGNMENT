<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Psalm 23 is one of the most well known passages in the Bible, one that has been made into song lyrics in thousands of languages, and an important element in the Christian and Jewish faith. Many non-adherents of the faith may also be interested to find out what it is actually about. There is enough information on this Psalm to discuss as an indivudial article, and personally I find it a good and very practical source of information. --<a href="../../../g/c/_/User%7EGc_susetyo_a8f7.html" title="User:Gc susetyo">gc_susetyo</a> 15:20, 31 March 2006 (GMT+1)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - utter rubbish. The translation Psalm 23 ('The Lord is my shepherd') is the most popular poem/hymn in the English language, Psalm 51 not far behind. Their impact on language, art, music and Christian and Jewish theology cannot be underestimated. Wikisouce is for primary sources not for a description of the importance, impact, and influence of these texts. There are only 150 Psalms (compared to millions of schools and barely notable bands), so having an article on every one (which we don't yet) is perfectly appropriate. Ridiculous nomination. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 22:06, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Agree with above. If there is enough to say about a Psalm, besides its translation, then it should have its own article, otherwise, there might be a case for merging content into the main <a href="../../../p/s/a/Psalms.html" title="Psalms">Psalms</a> article.

<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a>. But I don't think it's unreasonable to assume good faith on the part of the nominator. Many people in western society today are not familiar with the Bible, its real influence, and what parts of it are more significant than others.

<dd>These psalms are not grouped in any meaningful way. They're individual articles on diverse psalms that nom is just happening to afd all at once. Besides, psalms aren't "bible verses", nor does their numbering really correspond to the chapters of other books, both of which divisions are of relatively recent origin. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 23:41, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I realize that psalms are different than bible verses, but I think that they are analogous enough that the dicussions would be relevant. As e.g. <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Whole_bible_chapter_text_86f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Whole bible chapter text">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Whole bible chapter text</a> states, "as per <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_include_copies_of_primary_sources_e36f.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't include copies of primary sources">Wikipedia:Don't include copies of primary sources</a>, entire chapters of the Bible do not belong on wikipedia. Since the Bible already exists in several different translations and different languages at its proper location (Wikisource), any article containing only Bible text should be speedily deleted or redirected as is necessary, and article should only contain as much source text as is necessary for purposes of example." See also <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_200_verses_of_Matthew_a94c.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/200 verses of Matthew">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/200 verses of Matthew</a> <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 23:59, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I agree that a lot of the primary source material could be deleted, but I think the articles themselves should be kept. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 01:08, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Esquizombi, if you actually look at the articles, you'll find that only <a href="../../../p/s/a/Psalm_23.html" title="Psalm 23">Psalm 23</a> <a href="../../../p/s/a/Psalm_51.html" title="Psalm 51">Psalm 51</a> contain the entire text of the psalms. (In several different translations for Psalm 51 -- I would support cutting them out.) Even in these cases, however, the text is not the entire content of the article. While all of them could use expansion, they are primarily articles <i>about</i> the individual psalms, not the psalms themselves. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 01:11, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While I'm for merging a lot of the verse articles I think these are good enough. They aren't just replicating the text in different translations, focusing on trivial details to fill space, or could they been merged into something more in a logical way that I can think of. We shouldn't set any precedent though, each needs to be judged on their own merits. (There has been a lot of discussion over bible versus, I think most of them are linked from <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Matthew_1%7E9_d9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Matthew 1:9">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Matthew 1:9</a> including the arbcom case that is on going.) kotepho 00:32, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>We should make that decision on basis of what makes a good article. Clearly including the whole text of Psalm 119 would be disproportionate. But other Psalms are very short (some just 3 sentences). As with <a href="../../../l/y/r/Wikipedia%7ELyrics_and_poetry_a5f5.html" title="Wikipedia:Lyrics and poetry">Wikipedia:Lyrics and poetry</a> it may make sense to include copyright free versions where available.
