All of the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Jumper%21_27ae.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Jumper!">links</a> are user pages, VFD pages, and a single article about another game by the same creator.

<li>That is exactly my point. I hate when well written articles are called "non-notable". We don't know when that content will be wanted. If people want it, they will search for it or click links to it. If they don't, they won't. It is a loss for the Wikipedia when we delete good articles. -- Reinyday, 14:35, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Well written and as noteable as other content on site, 200 results is easily enough to keep something on here. Not redundant it also needs to be rewritten for perspective.--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMachtzu_1410.html" title="User:Machtzu">Machtzu</a> 05:19, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Abstain</b> Not sure whether this is notable enough for a "Keep", but I see no reason for deleting it either, once someone has taken the time to write it (and quite well too). <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKissl_4f16.html" title="User:Kissl">Kiss</a><a href="../../../k/i/s/User_talk%7EKissl_a765.html" title="User talk:Kissl">L</a> 08:44, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>; I would argue that it's well-written, at least marginally notable (200 hits isn't glory, but it's not vanity or nonexistance either), and seemingly-significant to some populaation segment.

<ul>
<li>"Is it as or more notable than an individual Pokemon character?" Most Pokemon stubs have been merged because this was a notorious VfD joke, but the individual character (e.g. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charmander.html" title="Charmander">Charmander</a>) is still a good marker for just bare notability. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tock</a>) 22:05, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>You need to be careful about that, as there are a LOT of Pokémon that have appeared in two games and maybe one episode of the anime. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charmander.html" title="Charmander">Charmander</a> isn't a bad breakpoint for notability (I use <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor_Frink_a0bb.html" title="Professor Frink">Professor Frink</a> as my personal test), but then you have <a href="../../../b/e/l/Beldum.html" title="Beldum">Beldum</a> or <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trapinch.html" title="Trapinch">Trapinch</a>... - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 22:09, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

The following stuff is: First, it doesn't seem to provide much information one can't get from helixgamesinc.com or jumper fan sites. Also, the entire JCP section sounds like a sales pitch. I honestly think Jumper should have a wikipedia article, but not an ad campaign within Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.223.142.107 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.223.142.107_5282.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.223.142.107">contribs</a>) 04:30, 3 September 2005 (UTC).</small>

<li>I don't really know enough about it to expand the article. (If I did, why would I have tried to look it up?). Also, I'll admit I don't really know much about how Wikipedia works, but what exactly would be the point of expanding and revising an article that's about to be deleted? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.223.142.107 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.223.142.107_5282.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.223.142.107">contribs</a>) 22:40, 4 September 2005 (UTC).</small>

<li>It's not necessarily about to be deleted. AFD isn't an automatic death sentence, just a review to see if the article is worth keeping.
