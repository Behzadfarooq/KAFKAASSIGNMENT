<dd>They cannot post HBO logo's its not their property, nor can I believe HBO told them they can while the film is still showing on HBO, nor do I believe HBO would ever give anyone permission to display HBO logo's. So please stop your stories. Further where on their website does it even state they put it on YouTube? Do you really think because the uploader says they are PIP, that they actually are, that its factual proof? --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 21:00, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The most dispicable part is if you actually believe this stuff then you should be supporting the makers of the film, not attempting to hurt them. Issues like this being on HBO is not too common and for HBO to see noone is watching the documentary, apparently cause they are watching it on YouTube, will only lead them to believe there is less and less of an audience for it. So while it may be cool and convenient to think that a YouTube uploader saying they are PIP is perfect justification for watching it there instead of HBO, its only hurting the cause you preach for in the end. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 21:06, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Removing the article on the grounds that the article is a dumping ground for distribution of copyrighted works is a very silly idea, it would serve the better interest of wikipeida readers to apply some protection to the article rather than an outright deletion. There are many wikipedia articles about copyrighted works, should they all be deleted becuase some bad apples are linking to a download of questionable legality? The clear answer is no.
<dl>
<dd>While I normally would agree with you, I am not going to air any more issues about the user in question to admins and semi protect would not solve the issue, full protect would stop editing all together, hence the reason. So what level of protection would you reccomend? The sad part is you mistakenly think I am arguing that all articles with questionable links should be removed, however I am only discussing this article, if you check the history I was very much in favor of keeping, however I cannot vote to keep an article that is highly vandalized with pirated material making this article a legal worry for Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 21:47, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Copyright in the film is owned by Teale Edwards LLC and Simon Ardizzone, Robert Cohen and Russell Michaels, not by HBO. Thus it is not an infringement of HBO's copyright for the producers (i.e. the copyright holders) to put this film on google video or youtube. It MIGHT be an infringement of an exclusive contract between the producers and HBO, but that's no concern of ours. There's a tiny tiny tiny outside chance of HBO wanting to sue for trademark infringement over its logo (but why would they? It's good advertising) but I don't think Wikipedia could be sued for contributory infringement in that case. This argument smacks of strawclutching--<a href="../../../a/i/m/User%7EAim_Here_37ff.html" title="User:Aim Here">Aim Here</a> 01:29, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
