<p>These are articles, which on more careful examination than last time, were created by <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlscherer3_538e.html" title="User:Karlscherer3">User:Karlscherer3</a> (who uses IPs User:210.55.230.18 and <a href="../../../2/0/2/User%7E202.37.72.100.html" title="User:202.37.72.100">User:202.37.72.100</a>, and User:210.55.230.20, and <a href="../../../2/1/0/User%7E210.55.230.17.html" title="User:210.55.230.17">User:210.55.230.17</a>, and User:222.152.25.248, and User:219.89.37.58). They are a non-standard (i.e. original research) categorisation of a class of puzzles.</p>
<p>Although the history includes many other editors, careful examination reveals that they mostly performed copyediting rather than adding content (except for a picture or two of a puzzle that fits the definition in the text).</p>
<p>It should be noted that <b>over 100</b> articles (about 200 including images) created by Karlscherer3 were deleted simultaneously in a single VfD, by a 90% majority (see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Zillions_games_a7c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Zillions games">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Zillions games</a>). The only reason this was not included amongst them was because I had mistakenly assumed the other editors had added content, and thus that there was something worth keeping. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 3 July 2005 14:19 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Furthermore, <a href="../../../p/a/c/Packing_problem.html" title="Packing problem">packing problem</a> <b>is</b> an article about the mathematical issue of packing. The disambig page <a href="../../../p/a/c/Packing.html" title="Packing">packing</a> even says so. —<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlotwell_e987.html" title="User:Blotwell">Blotwell</a> 4 July 2005 02:47 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The disambig page would have been created when someone typed "packing" in on the search bar, or created/clicked on a link to <a href="../../../p/a/c/Packing.html" title="Packing">packing</a>, noted there was no article, noted that the search brought up <a href="../../../p/a/c/Packing_problem.html" title="Packing problem">packing problem</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/h/Sphere_packing.html" title="Sphere packing">sphere packing</a>, and then added links to both. It is unlikely to have been created as a reflection of accuracy, but just as a reflection of the existance articles named or concerning "...packing..." in wikipedia, but no article named <i>packing</i>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/a/c/Packing_problem.html" title="Packing problem">Packing problem</a> is <b>not</b> about the mathematical issue. Read it, it simply gives two examples already in <a href="../../../s/p/h/Sphere_packing.html" title="Sphere packing">Sphere packing</a>, states that there is a result that <i>many mathematicians are surpised to learn</i> (because it is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, and most would dispute its existance and/or noteworthyness), and then states that it is a class of puzzles, which is also original research. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 6 July 2005 22:22 (UTC)

<li>Blimey. Obviously we disagree about the interpretation of the predicate "is an article about the mathematical issue of packing". Readers can decide for themselves: I added the comment because when I did click through to read the article, I felt that your assertion had (I'm sure inadvertently) misled me about its content, and I didn't want others to feel they had been misled. —<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlotwell_e987.html" title="User:Blotwell">Blotwell</a> 8 July 2005 03:00 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Merge</b> as per Blotwell. I have a couple of Burr puzzles and Disentanglement puzzles myself and they are notable (if you like that sort of thing). I can only imagine these pages have got caught up in the crossfire here. <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeithp_3c9a.html" title="User:Leithp">Leithp</a> July 4, 2005 14:59 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disentanglement_puzzle.html" title="Disentanglement puzzle">Disentanglement puzzles</a> are well-known, as can be seen from pictures. I would rename <a href="../../../p/a/c/Packing_problem.html" title="Packing problem">packing problem</a> to <i>packing puzzle</i>, since it's a well known class among puzzles. I think (I am not an expert in puzzles, just have some interest in them) the classification is somewhat questionable on <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanical_puzzle.html" title="Mechanical puzzle">Mechanical puzzle</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wire-and-string_puzzle.html" title="Wire-and-string puzzle">Wire-and-string puzzle</a>. I would also probably go for merging some of these, as per Blotwell (except that <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burr_puzzle.html" title="Burr puzzle">burr puzzles</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wire-and-string_puzzle.html" title="Wire-and-string puzzle">wire-and-string puzzles</a> (including only wire ones) are quite well defined categories and would merit a separate articles). Classification is of course a problem, but where isn't? For all those who don't believe these are real, please try visit a local puzzle shop and you'll see.&#160;;-) <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamohyl_Jan_6337.html" title="User:Samohyl Jan">Samohyl Jan</a> 5 July 2005 04:34 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The point is not that there are things which satisfy the description (e.g. the images), but that the division into "mechanical vs. other" is not standard, and in this case, original research by Karl Scherer. Obviously if someone categorises puzzles, e.g. Turquoise Puzzles, many things will fit the description, and allow images, and thus can be discussed, but this is obviously still original research, and a non-standard division. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 5 July 2005 08:21 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just because the classification scheme may be original research does not mean that these articles should be deleted. The solution is to reorganize the content, not discard it. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> July 5, 2005 17:37 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is the articles themselves that are the classification scheme. The only way to solve that original research is to remove the articles. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 6 July 2005 22:26 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm voting keep until we can sort this all out. I'm not comfortable with these multiple deletion entries. I think each article should have its own vfd entry. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> July 5, 2005 04:52 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I appreciate that grouping them together is not ideal, but had I kept the last lot seperate there would have had to be 199 VfDs rather than 1. To give you an idea of the articles worth, the VfD for those 199 was a 90% majority to delete all of them. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 5 July 2005 08:23 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And I also appreciate the problem with having a large number of related problematic articles. But I don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water, and I don't want an article deleted because it was written by a problematic editor, or because it has the "wrong" title. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> July 5, 2005 17:27 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b>. These articles are too dissimilar for a combined vfd. I don't see what is wrong with these articles. These puzzles exist. It seems that you object to the name of the articles. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarSch_3340.html" title="User:MarSch">MarSch</a> 5 July 2005 16:14 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The issue is not that puzzles exist which satisfy these definitions (e.g. I could define Puzzles made from red plastic, and obviously some would exist), but that the division of puzzles into such classes is not standard, and is Karl Scherer's own original research (he admits as much on another VfD). The articles serve only to push his own agenda as to how puzzles should be classified, when puzzles simply are not classified in this manner - indeed they are usually not differentiated at all. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 5 July 2005 19:07 (UTC)

<li>I notice that when Scherer makes assertions about circle packings you're the first to say he's probably lying so as to get it deleted (see below), but when he claims that something is his original research (oh, and can you reference a link for that?) you cling dogmatically to the assumption that he's telling the truth so as to get it deleted. From your claim that puzzles "are usually not differentiated at all" even you should be able to guess that you haven't spent as long looking at the literature as those of us telling you these are standard classifications. As <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamohyl_Jan_6337.html" title="User:Samohyl Jan">Samohyl Jan</a> says, you should go to more puzzle shops. —<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlotwell_e987.html" title="User:Blotwell">Blotwell</a> 6 July 2005 01:13 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason that I trust him when he claims something is his own original research, is that I can find absolutely no reason for him to say so if it is not true, since it would prove the case against it - that it is his original research, thus violates <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, which thus requires deletion. There is no reason I can see that he would lie so as to delete his own work even if it is genuinely valid. Thus I see no circumstance where I would doubt his claims of committing original research; on the other hand, I can see many circumstances where I would suspect something of his is original research and/or lying. These are by no means mutually exclusive, and indeed are virtually identical. In both cases I suspect it to be original research, its just that in one, he admits it. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 6 July 2005 22:31 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Anyway, why don't you believe other people telling you that the topics (except maybe <a href="../../../p/a/c/Packing_problem.html" title="Packing problem">packing problem</a>, but such puzzles definitely exist) are legitimate and mostly contain no original research. There probably isn't some official classification of puzzles, since there is no authority (and also, there are crossovers). But please understand that <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burr_puzzle.html" title="Burr puzzle">burr puzzles</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disentanglement_puzzle.html" title="Disentanglement puzzle">disentanglement puzzles</a> and maybe packing puzzles (where you have a couple of pieces and the task is to put them into a box or square or make a cube from them) are different large quite well-defined categories, which are actually used commonly in practice. We could argue about exact names, but this is a fact, which you would quickly understand if you visited some puzzle shop. It's also very hard to argue about all these pages together. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamohyl_Jan_6337.html" title="User:Samohyl Jan">Samohyl Jan</a> 7 July 2005 17:07 (UTC)</li>

<li>Packing problem is not about the mathematical issue, which even the article notes is at <a href="../../../s/p/h/Sphere_packing.html" title="Sphere packing">Sphere packing</a>, it is about how they constitute a (non-standard, i.e. original research) class of puzzles. Note the highly abnormal terminology used in the article. <a href="../../../p/a/c/Packing_problem.html" title="Packing problem">Packing problem</a> consists solely of Karl Scherers original research definition of different classes of such problems, the problems are not divided in this manner in mathematics - see <a href="../../../s/p/h/Sphere_packing.html" title="Sphere packing">Sphere packing</a> (which also covers circle packing). The only other content in <a href="../../../p/a/c/Packing_problem.html" title="Packing problem">Packing problem</a> are two examples which are already in <a href="../../../s/p/h/Sphere_packing.html" title="Sphere packing">Sphere packing</a>.</li>
<li>The only content which is not at <a href="../../../s/p/h/Sphere_packing.html" title="Sphere packing">Sphere packing</a> is his own definition of how to break down packing problems into different types, and his own claims about how this connects to puzzles. Thus there is absolutely nothing in it worth keeping, as all the non-original research is already at Sphere packing.

<li>It is a list of word puzzles, I see no harm in that (I also see little research in it).

<li>It is an artificial categorisation - if you note the items in the list, most of them were already VfD'd.

<li>When it comes to mathematics, there is a very fine line between original research and old research. Unlike most other endevours, math is "timeless"; 2+2=4 was as true 10,000 years ago as it is now. When mathematicians look at wikipedia with an interest in a subject, they don't limit themselves to topics that were known 50 years ago. Yes, it would be nice if he could provide some link to an article in <i>Mathematical recreations</i> or some such journal, but sometimes one can be quite expert and still not be aware of citations. Anyway, if you want to delete original research, I suggest you start with articles on Pokemon, TV sitcoms and rock-n-roll albums. There is a boundless quantity of the stuff in those articles. There's far, far more stuff in WP that is more frivolous and ephemeral than this. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 14:06, 12 July 2005 (UTC)
