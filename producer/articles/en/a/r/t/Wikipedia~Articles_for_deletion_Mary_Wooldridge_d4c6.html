<p>The article currently violates <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (being a relative of notable people is a consideration for notability), and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (from what I see in Google I can't find an article from a third-party reliable source about her specifically - lot of brief mentions, but not a substantial article). I don't care whether she's virtually a lock-in (per Rebecca's comments on the talk page) and the article will be recreated in six months, once she's a candidate (that's predicting the future aka <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">crystal ball</a>); rewrite the article in six months. It seems a little harsh, but I don't want Wikipedia turning into a election platform, and it looks like that's exactly what happened (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Chris_Gymer_faf4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chris Gymer">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chris Gymer</a>). <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 15:33, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>The page isn't here to arbitrarily decide the outcome of an election. It's here because she's notable, on the basis that she will, pending a major upset that no poll I've seen has so far predicted, enter parliament in a matter of months. It may be unsourced at present, but it's fairly clearly verifiable - do some research before complaining. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 02:24, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

If her notability only hinges on the election outcome, then we're predicting she'll win (since candidates are not notable, whereas elected officials are). If she's notable by some other criteria in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, then fine, she stays. However, the onus is on you to get the sources required, since you're arguing to keep the article. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 04:05, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>. I know Mary Wooldridge and she will meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> if she is elected to the Victorian parliament. A search of EBBSCO's Australia and New Zealand database comes up with some mentions of her name. However, it might not be enough to get her over the line at the moment. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 03:18, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What on earth is the purpose of deleting an article now when we know we will have to recreate it in less than a month and it has perfectly verifiable content? This is deletionism gone silly. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 00:42, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as per Rebecca. The difference bewteen Wooldridge and Gymer is that Wooldridge will likely be elected, where as Gymer has no chance. <a href="../../../t/e/i/User%7ETeiresias84_aea7.html" title="User:Teiresias84">Teiresias84</a> 03:35, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Article does not meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (notability) or <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (Verifiability) guidelines. The application of these criteria should be consistent in Wikipedia. The article is furthering the profile of a political candidate while the article of a peer candidate (Chris Gymer) has just been deleted. Also note that she is running in a marginal seat (Doncaster), and may not be elected. If she is, an article would be warranted. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 03:52, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is this supposed to be revenge for the Gymer deletion? Gymer had no chance of being elected, whereas Wooldridge is a virtual-certainty. The article would be easily verifiable if anyone actually bothered to do so, and will undoubtedly be recreated in exactly this state in three weeks time if it is deleted now. This is plainly silly. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 08:48, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, this is not revenge. If this was a real motive I would have nominated this article for deletion, and you will recall that I chose not to. I don't think it is silly to apply policy and guidelines in a consistent manner - I think this is just good process, and quite straightforward. Conversely, I don't think that bending or interpreting guidelines based on perceptions about what may happen in the future is good practice or fair. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 10:45, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We're not bending anything. Deleting a page now, only to have to definitely recreate exactly the same article in exactly the same state is the very definition of stupidity. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 01:49, 11 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think it is stupid at all, so let's agree to differ. I have copyedited the content to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Peter_Campbell/work_in_progress/Mary_Wooldridge" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Peter_Campbell/work_in_progress/Mary_Wooldridge" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and will reinstate the article if it is deleted and she gets elected. However, it does need more references and content to improve it from being an electioneering puff piece. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 03:08, 11 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What is the point of taking it off the site when it has potential readers? Delete it after the election if the unlikely occurs and she actually loses. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 09:56, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> She gets a page when she gets elected, not as part of her election campaign. Besides, she is not a shoo-in.

<li><b>Comment</b> There is an election within 45 days in Victoria. If this article is kept, then from a NPOV I would think that all candidates should be allowed an article. The problem is that a Wiki entry will come up in a Google search, and may give the impression that one candidate is "more notable" than others. The question we should be asking, is strip the article of any mention of her standing for Parliament, and is she notable enough? And BTW I would have voted for the Gymer deletion, too. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Johnson_75b2.html" title="User:Michael Johnson">Michael Johnson</a> 00:16, 11 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have no issue with giving all candidates pages, but I'm clearly in the minority on that one. What I do take serious objection to, is deleting a page on someone who is almost definitely going to win, as deleting a page when one knows that one will definitely have to recreate it in three weeks is madness. And her imminent entry into parliament is the reason why she is notable, so excluding that from the rationale would be rather illogical. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 01:49, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_district_of_Doncaster_190d.html" title="Electoral district of Doncaster">Doncaster</a> would take a <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_legislative_election%2C_2002.html" title="Victorian legislative election, 2002">swing of 0.8%</a> to fall to the Labor party. Given that long-term members are normally supposed to have a personal vote of 1 to 2%, I'd be working hard for her right now, because if everything else stays the same, she is gone. So no, it is not a sure thing. As has been said before, Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. As for all candidates having articles, well perhaps you are right, but that is not the status quo on Wikipedia right now. BTW, it would be nothing to copy the edit page on the article and store it on your computer for a few weeks. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Johnson_75b2.html" title="User:Michael Johnson">Michael Johnson</a> 02:42, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Except that every single poll I've seen in recent months has showed a swing to the Liberal Party, which makes Wooldridge's victory a virtual certainty.
