<li>One has only to read two sentences into <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_unusual_personal_names_033b.html" title="Talk:List of unusual personal names">Talk:List of unusual personal names</a> ("<i>Apple</i> isn't that unusual. Lots of Chinese are named <i>Apple</i>.") to see what the problem here is. What constitutes "unusual" to one culture is often run-of-the-mill to another, and thus for Wikipedia to describe some of these names as "unusual" is for Wikipedia to adopt one particular culture's point of view. There's been some refactoring discussed on the talk page, but the basic question "What is the point of this page?" has not been answered (in a way that adheres to the NPOV) yet. Perhaps refactoring this as a list of personal names that are unique to one person and intentionally chosen to be unusual in the view of the person choosing the name (e.g. people formally changing their name to make a point) might save the article. Of course, that's an exceedingly unwieldy title. ☺ <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 08:11, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. There really doesn't seem to be a way to define what is unusual. The list would be inherently POV and centric to one culture.

<ul>
<li>How so? Movementarian raises a solid point, and I think your response is insufficient to attend to the problem he raises. How do you footnote the fact that Britney is normal in the US and unusual in Sri Lanka? And moreover, doesn't that simply transfer the onus of 'unusual' from one place (this article) to another? And what kind of references do you envision detailing culturaly unusual names denominated by culture, nuanced over time?

Historically ordinary names (Cotton Mather) that <i>now</i> sound amusing to us or non-english names that sound amusing to english-speakers would not apply.

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Let's not stretch the POV argument too far here - almost everything on Wikipedia could be argued as POV in some respect, but unusual names can at least be verified. In truth, the article is really "List of personal names that have been widely considered unusual", but that is a bit of a mouthful. Cleanup and verify, if you must, but do not delete. I think some of the examples on the page are pretty objectively unusual: "Depressed Cupboard Cheesecake", "Eagle-Eye Cherry", "Moon Unit Zappa", "Tee Vee", etc. If they are common in one culture, that's irrelevant to the criteria, as long as most people find it unusual. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 15:40, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> — Interesting but I must agree with the PoV assessment, despite sophistry argument just above. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 16:01, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Almost all of our lists involve some editorial judgement requiring inclusion. Indeed, all Wikipedia articles, even if consisting entirely of verified, sourced material, involve judgement in how the information is integrated, synthesized, and presented. NPOV does not mean mechanical objectivity. This list is borderline. But I come down on the side of "keep" because it is amusing; because it is not as much of an idiosyncratic non-topic as List of songs with titles that do not appear in the lyrics; because although the article is poorly sourced with respect to showing that the names are actually consider unusual, it is <i>fairly</i> well sourced with respect to showing the existence of the people bearing the names; <s>and because I added an entry or two to this article myself.</s> (Ooops, I didn't mean to mention that. Closing sysop, weight my opinion accordingly). <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:34, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Pointless list; will at best be based on debatable opinions <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHanson_59b8.html" title="User:PaulHanson">Paul</a> 19:55, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The term "unusual" is not itself a call for opinions, it is defined as things out of the ordinary and not expected. It may be that the first name "apple" as translated in Chinese is not unusual in China; but it sure is unusual in the English speaking world. I would agree that there would be a POV issue if this were a list of "weird" or "stupid" names since that is a value judgment. Unusual is simply a numbers game. I think there's enough space for this. <a href="../../../j/t/m/User%7EJtmichcock_d337.html" title="User:Jtmichcock">Jtmichcock</a> 22:09, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The term "unusual" in this context is inherently POV. Also, the list seems limited to famous people and celebrity off-spring, so it really should be called "Famous people who named their children names that we thought we odd." And that, of course, is very POV. So, again, delete. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 00:05, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is not limited to famous people. See, for example, our page on <a href="../../../b/r/f/Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116.html" title="Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116">Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116</a>, whose fame comes solely from the name. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 22:23, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This list is simply unmaintainable. A few people may be choosing such names to make a point but many on this list would be offended that their name is somehow considered "unusual". To consider <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotton_Mather_190c.html" title="Cotton Mather">Cotton Mather</a>, for example, unusual is to demonstrate either ignorance or willful bias about the conventions of the time. I do not believe that it is possible to craft a functional definition for "unusual" in a cross-cultural encyclopedia. The very definition of "usual" is too culture-specific. Furthermore, even if we did craft such a definition, I see little value to this list in our goal of making an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 03:20, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

The section on names in that list is a subset of this one since it only contains names which have articles. I would be OK if we only had a list of names which have articles.

<li>Thanks for pointing that out. A related point: if I look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_unusual_personal_names_033b.html" title="Talk:List of unusual personal names">Talk:List of unusual personal names</a> I see relatively little controversy. There's some discussion of categorization, etc. but what I do <i>not</i> see is much <i>serious</i> dispute about whether a particular name should or should not be included. For example, so far nobody has disputed the unusualness of "Audio Science Clayton." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 16:28, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Racist is a absurd. Even though "unusual" is culturally-defined, we could simply list ones from cultures where it is weird to be named Apple or Thursday; that's simple.
