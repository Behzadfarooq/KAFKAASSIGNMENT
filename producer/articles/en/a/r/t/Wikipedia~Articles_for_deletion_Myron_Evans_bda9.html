<dd>At the time of my original vote, I was unaware that speedy deletion was mandated for articles not asserting the importance of an individual. I'm not happy with this policy, frankly, and I don't think it actually has consensus at this point (it only ever passed with 74% support, less than that required to make someone an admin), but I recognize that we can't very well allow individual editors to question policy because <i>they</i> don't think it has consensus (<a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> aside).</dd>
<dd>So let me change my reasoning in this case: Dr. Evans appears to have some hundreds of Google hits (some of the 1,150 appear to be talking about another Myron Evans but most seem to be referring hto the man in question), he has 59 <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Myron+Evans%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Myron+Evans%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google Scholar</a> hits.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Certainly, Evans is a classic crackpot. (Einstein and Cartan are rolling in their graves.) <i>But is he even notable?</i> The Harrison Memorial Prize and apparently indistinguishable Mendola Memorial Prize are awarded annually "to a British Chemist who is under 30 years of age for promising original investigations in chemistry", according to <a href="http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/AwardsAndFunding/Meldola/index.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/AwardsAndFunding/Meldola/index.asp" rel="nofollow">Royal Society of Chemistry list of prizes</a>. Is this really a sufficiently notable prize? RSC lists a very long list of prizes at their website, check it out. <s>As for a scholarship, I dare say most commentators have recieved one of <i>those</i> at one time or another.</s> I have been utterly unable to verify the claims about affiliation with Cornell Theory Center, etc., although this is mentioned at a large number of websites like <a href="http://www.americanantigravity.com" class="external text" title="http://www.americanantigravity.com" rel="nofollow">American Antigravity</a>, <a href="http://www.freeenergynews.com" class="external text" title="http://www.freeenergynews.com" rel="nofollow">Free Energy News</a> whose reliability is... suspect&#160;:-) I did find however that Myron Evans is one of these charming fellows who likes to take legal action to discourage debunkers. Check this out: <a href="http://freeenergynews.com/Directory/Beware/MyronEvansCensorship/Rebuttal/index.html" class="external text" title="http://freeenergynews.com/Directory/Beware/MyronEvansCensorship/Rebuttal/index.html" rel="nofollow">Myron Evans Censorship Rebuttal</a>. The "AIAS" which Evans mentions is something called the <a href="http://www.aias.us" class="external text" title="http://www.aias.us" rel="nofollow">Alpha Institute of Advanced Studies</a>, an organization directed by himself. At least some of the prizes he claims on his C.V. appear to have been awarded by... AIAS! Hence the need for <i>independent</i> verification of alleged notability. The UW library does have three monographs coauthored by Myron Wyn Evans. All in all, it seems very clear that if we decide that Evans' contributions to chemistry are notable (I'd guess they are not, unless we want to have a biography of everyone who has coauthored a technical book, but I'm not a chemist), then the article needs to be rewritten to clarify the dubious nature of Evans's crackpot claims about free-energy and his so-called "theory".---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 23:12, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Colin, we might be getting off the track, but did you notice that your Google Scholar search includes papers from Evans own site which apparently have not been published? So evidently you must be cautious in using Google Scholar to verify claims in suspect WP articles: there is certainly no guarantee that what you turn up there is even referreed, much less appeared in a respectable research journal. (Even then, of course, as the Bogdanov affair shows, problems can arise.) Also, AFAIK there is no "Evans lemma in gtr" except in his mind, and I think I know the gtr literature pretty well. What are your standards for notability? Simply having published a scholarly book or some papers? I think we need to maintain a higher standard than that, while perhaps not setting the bar as high as Brittanica. Still, I don't think you've answered the question: I see evidence for the dirty bathwater, but where's the baby?---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 00:57, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Some of those books and papers are self-published and/or self-referential, but others are legitimate (like <a href="http://product.half.ebay.com/Modern-Non-Linear-Optics_W0QQtgZinfoQQprZ780514" class="external text" title="http://product.half.ebay.com/Modern-Non-Linear-Optics_W0QQtgZinfoQQprZ780514" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, for example). The question is whether there are enough legitimate accomplishments remaining after a thorough sort to make Mr. Evans notable. I personally believe that there are, but of course you're free to differ. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 19:32, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In general, I'd like to see a higher standard of notability, but recognize that many do not agree. I can suggest a <i>compromise solution for what to do with this article</i>, although I hesitate to suggest it because I've had a bad experience in a similar context.</dd>
<dd>Question for all participants in this discussion: would you find it acceptable if some user were to rewrite the article to describe Evan's work in <i>chemistry</i>, which appears to be "mainstream" (it would be best if whoever does this were a chemist! or at least checks with a knowledgeable chemist), plus the Harrison Prize, followed by a <i>brief</i> <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> description of what I would call his "cranky" claims? It should be possible to briefly describe those claims in NPOV fashion, adding a dry disclaimer such as: <i>this "theory" appears to be little known in physics, and is apparently regarded as cranky by those physicists who do know about it.</i> (Whoever did this would probably want to omit the "scare quotes", but I can't bring myself to apply the word "theory" to these particular claims without qualification!) Keep the external links so that readers easily find both Evan's writings and critiques of his writings.</dd>
<dd>Assuming there is a consensus that this would be a reasonable compromise, someone could volunteer to make the changes. But probably only an admin should volunteer for this kind of content cleanup job!---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 22:44, 20 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Maybe. First, I would want to know if Evans is actually notable <i>as a chemist</i>. If not, he may still be a notable crackpot, but in that case the article would have to focus on his theories, his efforts to promote them, and the scientific community's view of his work. In other words, if he is notable, the article should focus on discussing whatever it is that makes him notable.</dd>

<dd>I agree with this comment. If he is notable - for whatever reason, including being a notable crackpot or controversial theorist - he deserves an article. The quality of the article is not really relevant; there is sufficent content and AfD is not cleanup. I simply don't see enough to convince me that he is notable. His tendency to self publish and self award actually works against him here, because it makes it difficult to separate out his actual accomplishments. The Harrison Memorial award seems to be significant, but it isn't clear to me that it is important enough by itself to justify an article. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManoaChild_4445.html" title="User:ManoaChild">ManoaChild</a> 20:53, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, that's why I suggested obtaining confirmation from a neutral chemist that Evans could reasonably be considered notable for his chemistry work. Again tending to want to set the notability bar higher than some, I doubt Evans should be notable purely as a <i>crank</i>, since the only references I could find to his "theory" were on crank websites, which I suspect are very little known except to the tiny tiny minority of freelunchers. However, I am searching for a compromise with Colin, so while I myself would not include a biography of Evans, including one emphasizing his mainstream(?) work at the expense of his obscure crackpottery still seems to me an acceptable compromise.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 12:52, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
