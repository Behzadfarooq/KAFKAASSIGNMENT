<li><b>Keep</b> Arbusto is repeatedly seeking to delete Christian articles. Why doesn't he do that for any other religion? I can understand only adding to the stock of articles about one religion - a person may not be particularly interested in all the religions, but deleting all articles of one religion has got to put a question mark over someone's neutrality. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsenetpostsdotcom_fb92.html" title="User:Usenetpostsdotcom">Uncle Davey</a> <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_talk%7EUsenetpostsdotcom_1e10.html" title="User talk:Usenetpostsdotcom">(Talk)</a> 23:09, 27 March 2006 (UTC)<small><a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsenetpostsdotcom_fb92.html" title="User:Usenetpostsdotcom">Usenetpostsdotcom</a> (<a href="../../../u/s/e/User_talk%7EUsenetpostsdotcom_1e10.html" title="User talk:Usenetpostsdotcom">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Usenetpostsdotcom_4dcd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Usenetpostsdotcom">contribs</a>)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't see any problem with this since we have an article on <a href="../../../t/r/a/TRACS_e3db.html" title="TRACS">TRACS</a> and these schools apparently exist. I also note that this nom tried to have this list speedied as patent nonsense <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_TRACS_members&amp;diff=45750122&amp;oldid=45561403" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_TRACS_members&amp;diff=45750122&amp;oldid=45561403" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which looks like bad faith to me. Furthermore, the so called POV fork seems to have resulted from this nom's edit warring to remove the list. Lastly, what difference does it make that these are Christian schools? For all I care, they could be Jewish, Muslim, or Rastafarian. Why did that need to be immediately specified in the first words of this nom? At the very least, why aren't we talking about merging it back to <a href="../../../t/r/a/TRACS_e3db.html" title="TRACS">TRACS</a>? -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:42, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I put the speedy tag because "this article provides no meaningful content." As for your bad faith comment, you might want to see who created the TRACS page.

<dl>
<dd>You comparing TRACS to the NCAA? I fail to understand the connection. It should not be listed because (as I wrote in the nom.) "<a href="../../../t/r/a/TRACS_e3db.html" title="TRACS">TRACS</a> has a list on their webpage, which is more accurate and informative than this control-c list. Interested parties can visit the TRACS page and link for further information." The list is updated on the TRACS page according to schools that lost accreditation and earned accreditation. Most recently in Feb. 2006. There is no reason to think the wiki page will be updated to be accurate. Thus, the information will be incorrect and provide misleading details on school accreditation.</dd>
<dd>If this list is kept then the other accrediting agnecies will also have lists. That includes <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Central_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools_4015.html" title="North Central Association of Colleges and Schools">North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>, which accredits 10,000 schools. Do you want a list of 10,000 schools on wikipedia pertaining to one accreditation group? Or the 13,000 schools accredited by <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools_eac1.html" title="Southern Association of Colleges and Schools">Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>, which I removed the beginnings of the list one month ago <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Southern_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools&amp;diff=40691340&amp;oldid=39981069" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Southern_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools&amp;diff=40691340&amp;oldid=39981069" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 01:32, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Those are all very weak arguments. What may or may not exist on the web is not my problem. Almost every topic we cover here is covered in greater depth somewhere else. That should never be an excuse to remove content. The bottom line for me is that if we are going to do school lists such as these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_universities_and_colleges_in_the_United_States" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_universities_and_colleges_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, I can find no reason to remove a list of accredited schools from a group such as TRACS for which we have a page. In my view, it is just as essential to know what institutions are under the TRACS umbrella as with any other accreditation agency. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:47, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay, we'll have a list of 10,000 schools linked at <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Central_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools_4015.html" title="North Central Association of Colleges and Schools">North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a> and 13,000 at <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools_eac1.html" title="Southern Association of Colleges and Schools">Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> because you want to keep this list of around 40 schools, which only 12 have wikipedia articles.</dd>
<dd>If you want to know "know what institutions are under the TRACS umbrella" you could just visit the TRACS category or their website.<a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 01:52, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What attacks? What are you talking about? You nominated this for deletion and have other lists on Afd. You also indicated on my user page that you have removed other lists from wikipedia.

<dd>Thanks. I'm not going to waste anymore time arguing semantics with you. I guess I'm just lazy that way. In any case, to use your own words, you "strongly differ" with my opinions on the utility of these types of lists. You have used all kinds of arguments for why this should be deleted (pointless, POV fork, no meaningful content, misleading, list on other web site, will result in 13,000 school list, etc), none of which I agree with. Since you are highly unlikely to withdraw this nom, and I will never revise my vote, this discussion now serves absolutely no purpose. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:27, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, but they are just fine right now on this list, or even better merged to TRACS. In any case, I have no doubt that the Wikiproject missing article list will be deleted too, sooner or later, just as soon as someone nominates it. Just think, a list that encourages people to write articles on schools. Now why would we need that? -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:14, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nobody is likely to nominate a project-space article listing articles for <i>universities</i> which need to be created, even though lists of redlinks tend (as with the Schools project) to spawn substubs of no encycloaedic value. If this was in project space - part of the Christianity wikiproject, for example - I think it's unlikely it would have been nominated. As it stands what this list does is to duplicate the list at the TRACS website (only with much less detail and not necessarily up-to-date). <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 09:15, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
