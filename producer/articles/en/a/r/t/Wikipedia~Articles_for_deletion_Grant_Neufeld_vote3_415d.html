<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm curious what new problems - or new support for previously suggested problems - you've identified with the article that were not addressed in the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Grant_Neufeld_vote2_1902.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Grant Neufeld/vote2">VfD that was closed this morning</a>.

<li>I was going to let this go by until I'd had more time to think, but this was last voted on <i>17 hours ago</i>.

I strongly believe in Wikipedia's "semi-policy" discouraging <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">autobiographies</a> for all of the reasons stated on that page. Users are specifically advised not to create or edit articles about themselves. It needs to be established that this article merits an exemption from those guidelines. Preferably this argument will be backed up with precedents on Wikipedia. The content of the article remains a secondary concern to this matter. If an exception to the autobiography guidelines is made here then this article will serve as a precedent justifying additional exemptions in future Vfd autobiography debates. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurieeto_060a.html" title="User:Kurieeto">Kurieeto</a> 12:56, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, those votes and the associated discussion should not be counted.

<li><b>Strong Keep!</b> Community consensus means nothing if we only abide by it when things go our way. Relisting an article that survived VfD <i>less than a day</i> after closing the last VfD is a blatant attempt to game the system. For the record, I am the admin who closed the last VfD. In that VfD I voted to delete, but when it came time to close it I saw that there was no consensus. By our rules, that means the article stays. Even though I voted to delete, I respected community consensus, which by default was keep. This time I must vote to keep the article to avoid setting a horrible precedent -- if you don't like the last vote, just list it again and again and again... <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 02:57, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>The subject is probably article-worthy. The article is not bad; not great either, but not bad. The solution is to make it not an autobiography.

<p>Just putting in my two cents: I disagree with the relisting of this immediatley after the end of the vote, and normally would have voted keep just because of the disruption this vote causes. However, this person is not only clearly not notable, and the article is also an autobiography, two very clear sins. If it were not for the very nature of the article, keep would be an vote. If it were not for the disruption of relisting, delete would be an obvious vote. I have to abstain, though this person is clearly not notable, and we should not allow not notable people to write autobiographies. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 20:16, Apr 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let's be clear though, I edited this article to make it more encyclopedic, and to remove any last traces of "glow". I think that the article now reads pretty much as someone else would have written it. If it hasn't then I encourage you to edit it further.</dd>
<dd>As far as notability, there is an on-going debate as to whether a defeated candidate from an election is notable or not. In this case, we have a defeated candidate who has several other acomplishments to his credit. This is why I voted to keep. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 21:19, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for making those NPOV edits. My concern is that the precedent set here is that autobiographical creations and edits are acceptable if copyedited by another Wikipedian. This unneccessarily puts additional work and responsibility onto the shoulders of Wikipedians. Also, if we approve an autobiographical article creation here, and approve its content as of today, what do we do if Grant chooses to edit it sometime in the future? With each of his edits there is a much higher likelihood than normal that questions of bias will be raised, encouraging future unneccessary conflicts that will have to be resolved. I maintain that this article should be assessed for deletion based on the autobiographical procedure that has been followed, which takes precedence over its content. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurieeto_060a.html" title="User:Kurieeto">Kurieeto</a> 11:40, Apr 15, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Kuri, Grant is free, as are all Wikipedians, to make edits in the future. The article should be watched, as so many are, to ensure that POV edits are not made. This morning I have adjusted the <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Martin_629b.html" title="Paul Martin">Paul Martin</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Chandler_61f4.html" title="Craig Chandler">Craig Chandler</a> articles to remove POV stuff added over the weekend. This is just a part of having on open-content encyclopedia.</dd>
<dd>If Craig Chandler were to take an interest and started edited his article, would we remove it altogether? Indeed, would we even know? If he were to take an identity-masking userid (Ground Zero, for the record, is already taken), we would not know, nor would we if he edited without registering.</dd>
<dd>Grant has accepted my edits and has made no attempt to revert them. If he did in a POV way, then I would probably have to vote to delete, but it is clear that he is accepting that article on him is open to edits by others.</dd>
<dd>If the article is to be deleted on the basis that it was created by its subject, what would happen if I were to re-create the article with the same text? then it would no longer be "autobiographical", I guess. I don't see the point of going through that. Let's decide on the basis of whether Grant is notable or not. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 13:52, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. While it might have been NPOV'ed, this article still reads like the textbook piece of vanity it is. Autobiographies just don't make good Wikipedia articles. If there was an article on me (would be non-notable, but supposing it wasn't) then if I noticed an inaccuracy, felt that the article was biased, or thought there was some useful information missing, I would say so on the talk page and leave others to incorporate my suggestions as they saw fit. It is simply not ethical to write an article on yourself. I look forward to the day when <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a> achieves the status of formal policy, and we have a clear presumption against keeping articles written by their subjects. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">(Talk)</a> 03:55, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I hate voting on VfD, which I entirely deprecate, but I randomed his page. This is intolerable. There is no policy against autobiographies. Yes, they are frowned on, but they are not banned or anything. And relisting this just shows a contempt for consensus. Why not ask Grant to step aside from this article and work on others? Other editors can verify the information in the article. If it's all verifiable, no harm has been done. Please, everyone, I agree he shouldn't have done it, but it's here now.
