<p>This seems a vanity page. On a question for references on the talk page: no answer. More then 10 languange wiki were flooded around the same time by a few Belgian IP's with the same (translated) article. On nl-wiki, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">Sockpuppets</a> were created to try preventing deletion (see <a href="../../../h/i/g/Talk%7EHigh_Icelandic_426b.html#Vanity_Page" title="Talk:High Icelandic">Talk:High_Icelandic#Vanity_Page</a>).

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It is true that this article and the subject of the article are mostly (but not solely) the work of a single Belgian. However, that does not qualify it for deletion. Neither does any action that the author has taken on other wikis. The fact is that High Icelandic qualifies for a wikipedia article as the subject is notable and the article is balanced and well written. On the issue of notability and references you can for example see the newsgroup is.islenska <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/is.islenska/search?group=is.islenska&amp;q=h%C3%A1fr%C3%B3nska&amp;qt_g=1&amp;searchnow=Search+this+group" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/is.islenska/search?group=is.islenska&amp;q=h%C3%A1fr%C3%B3nska&amp;qt_g=1&amp;searchnow=Search+this+group" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> where the subject <i>Háfrónska</i> (High Icelandic in High Icelandic) and <i>High Icelandic</i> have dosens of posts. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdinborgarstefan_14d5.html" title="User:Edinborgarstefan">Stefán Ingi</a> 12:05, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The Háfrónska movement is being watched with some interest in Iceland and many of the words they create are very interesting and would do well to replace older borrowed words. The head of the movement is a notable Icelandic priest, known for his creative use of language himself and for creating words (known as pétríska). That Braekmans seems to behave irrationally at times and not corteously shouldn't deter from the actual content of the articles, once it has been cleaned up to remove obvious bias. --<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStalfur_f063.html" title="User:Stalfur">Stalfur</a> 16:23, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Abstain</b></s>. Before simply voting, we should notice a few oddities about all this.
<ul>
<li>First of all, in a relatively short period of time, articles have been added to the wikipedia versions in over twenty languages, all by the same person, or at least by the same small group of people.
<dl>
<dd>Yes, in all probability most (all?) of these articles have been written by Mr. Braekmans. That is not a ground for deletion. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdinborgarstefan_14d5.html" title="User:Edinborgarstefan">Stefán Ingi</a> 16:28, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>All these people, mostly anonymous IPs but also a few registered users (in all probability, sockpuppets), are from the same part of Belgium. Despite the fact that he/she/it/they call themself Icelandic hyperpurists, he/she/it/they seem to be able to communicate in any language except Icelandic. See <a href="../../../../is/h/%C3%A1/f/Talk%7EH%C3%A1fr%C3%B3nska_156c.html" class="extiw" title="is:Talk:Háfrónska">is:Talk:Háfrónska</a> and <a href="../../../../da/h/%C3%A1/f/Diskussion%7EH%C3%A1fr%C3%B3nska_31e7.html" class="extiw" title="da:Diskussion:Háfrónska">da:Diskussion:Háfrónska</a>.
<dl>
<dd>Yes it is doubtful that Mr. Braekmans speaks Icelandic. On the other hand he knows a lot about Icelandic words and their etymology and also about the history of the movement in Iceland to create new Icelandic words instead of borrowing foreign words. Of course he has taken this to a ridiculus extreme with the creation of High Icelandic and that is the impression that the article gives, of course without the use of such loaded words. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdinborgarstefan_14d5.html" title="User:Edinborgarstefan">Stefán Ingi</a> 16:28, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>All this creates a quite strong impression of a campaign, no, a propaganda offensive, in which several unacceptable methods are being used.
<dl>
<dd>Yes, many of his actions stink of propoganda, including his insistance to place a link to High Icelandic in the article on the Icelandic language. Still, that does not say that we should delete this article. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdinborgarstefan_14d5.html" title="User:Edinborgarstefan">Stefán Ingi</a> 16:28, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>The vast majority of messages to the Usernet group in question seems to have been written by the creator of Háfrónska himself. Quote: <i>"A loan-word in Icelandic sucks. every Icelander who accepts a loan-word in his language is a coprophiliac. He likes to swallow shit. It is about time that this is going to end. [...] Every Icelander shold stay in a camp for half a year when he is eighteen, he has to wear a device. When he pronounces a loan-word, he shouls get an electro-shock."</i> This is not exactly in line with the moderate language used on the language's homepage.
<dl>
<dd>Mr. Braekmans has repeatedly shown himself to be capable of writing very different style of text and some of his writings can be considered inappropriate. But the text in the article is appropriate and even acknowledges that Mr. Braekmans has made himself unpopular in several places with his work. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdinborgarstefan_14d5.html" title="User:Edinborgarstefan">Stefán Ingi</a> 16:28, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>One question I've asked at several occasions: who is the creator of this language. Well, let's look at the following apology he wrote for the words quoted above: <i>"I came home early in the morning and I was under severe influence of drugs and alcohol, I head-banged all night on black metal music and I was extremely frustrated and foamed of anger."</i> This gives me the impression that Mr. Braekmans is an angry teenager rather than a mature, professional linguist.</li>
<li>Yet, it has to be admitted that some of the arguments used by the supporter(s) do make sense. Indeed, there has been a TV programme about it, and the language seems to have been written about in the Icelandic press.
<dl>
<dd>This is the main point I am making, despite anything, Mr. Braekmans has managed to make High Icelandic noteable and therefore the article should be kept. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdinborgarstefan_14d5.html" title="User:Edinborgarstefan">Stefán Ingi</a> 16:28, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>The supporter(s) of the language claim(s) that the language is véry well-known in Iceland, and that there are lóts of people over there who support it. If so, why are there so little Icelanders involved in these articles, and in the discussion about them? Note that even the article on wikipedia.is about this so-called "President of the High Icelandic Language Association", <a href="../../../../is/p/%C3%A9/t/P%C3%A9tur_%C3%9Eorsteinsson_11c6.html" class="extiw" title="is:Pétur_Þorsteinsson">Pétur Þorsteinsson</a>, was entered from a Belgian IP.
<dl>
<dd>It is an overstatement to say that the "language" is very vell known, but it is known. The Icelandic wikipedia is small and therefore it is not surprising that nobody other than Mr. Braekmans has written the article on Pétur Þorsteinsson but he is infact a minister in an independent congregation in Iceland which has official status. See <a href="http://www3.domsmalaraduneyti.is/raduneyti/starfssvid/kirkjumal/upplysingar/nr/795" class="external autonumber" title="http://www3.domsmalaraduneyti.is/raduneyti/starfssvid/kirkjumal/upplysingar/nr/795" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, Óháði söfnuðurinn in the top right column. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdinborgarstefan_14d5.html" title="User:Edinborgarstefan">Stefán Ingi</a> 16:28, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li>All in all, I don't have the faintest idea what we are dealing with. It could very well be a case of <b>six bored teenagers</b>: one Belgian who together with his Icelandic pen-friend created a list of Icelandic loanwords, substituted them with native equivalents, and subsequently started pushing it all over the Internet. Gosh, I could do something similar for Dutch in two days! And who knows, perhaps suddenly somebody will turn up and say: "There, you see how easy it is to stuff Wikipedia with nonsense?" But on the other hand, perhaps we are dealing with a phenomenon that is notable indeed. Who knows? I'd like to hear some input from Icelandic wikipedians before issuing a vote. —<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 12:55, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes if somebody were to do something like this and two days later write a wikipedia article about this then that article should be deleted as non notable. But since High Icelandic has been discussed both in print and TV media in Iceland it has become notable and therefore should be kept. This is my personal opinion as an Icelandic wikipedian. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdinborgarstefan_14d5.html" title="User:Edinborgarstefan">Stefán Ingi</a> 16:28, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>No vote yet</b>. On something like this, I'd defer to the judgment of Icelanders: is this movement of any note <i>in Iceland</i>? (Though I understand the poet caps are quite fashionable.)

<li>I left a message on their article's talk page and their village pump... Hopefully we get some insights from the Icelandic wiki community. But beware of sockpuppets&#160;!!!

<ul>
<li>I'm an icelandic wikipedian and personally voted for keep. It is a very interesting linguistic movement and one which icelandic linguistics have noticed, many judge it to be irrational (such as translating every name in the world) but they do admit that it contains various gold nuggets which in time might find their way into the language. That the original creator of the language is doing his best to push it forward into the limelight shouldn't be seen as deterring, the articles should be cleaned up (as was done on the icelandic entry) to remove obvious bias on his behalf (and we even had to remove several later of his edits) but the overall impression of Háfrónska is interesting and we will be keeping it. Icelanders care a lot about their language and we have committees who do wordsmithing as we are loathe to copy words from other languages (even if it does happen). --<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStalfur_f063.html" title="User:Stalfur">Stalfur</a> 16:31, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd like to add to this that there is no such thing as a "High Icelandic movement" this is the creation of one man and a couple of his online mates in Iceland.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> in that case. &lt;sneer&gt; "Activists" &lt;/sneer&gt; pose a difficult metaphysical issue. It <i>is</i> possible to impose yourself on public notice by vigorous self-promotion. It seems that otherwise disinterested people in Iceland itself have taken some notice of the armor on the vital egg, and that's enough to make this no longer <i>pure</i> self-promotion.

<p>Dear People,</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am the neologistic skáld Timbur-Helgi Hermannsson. I have indeed 'dumped' 8 articles at once on various wikipedias. I wanted to have a small version on other wikis. That has been interpreted as using wikipedia for the spread of ideas. And I can understand this argument. Many accuse me of fascism and manipulation. I am not like that at all. Read the preface of the High Icelandic language centre.</dd>
<dd>The truth about High Icelandic is that I work 14 hours a day (with Icelanders like Pétur Þorsteinsson, the president and many others) on creating killer-neologisms and I have a lot of Icelanders who support me in my neologistic endeavours. The hreintunguþingið, a forum for Icelandic language purist will come on line next month in order to speed up neologistic endaevours and the development of High Icelandic as a solid language variant</dd>
<dd>There has been an article in the newspaper DV in the early nineties (written by Sigurður Hreiðar). Ari Páll Kristinsson, a former linguistic advisor of the Icelandic broadcast service wrote a column in Tunguatak (1996?), a paper about Icelandic language use. I have done 2 radiointerviews in the late nineties, the first time with Ásgeir Eggertsson, who has been working for the, I don't remember the name, it was "Tölvuverkfræðiþjónustan", I visited the building of the Icelandic language commission at Aragata, Reykjavík twice in the 90's and had a chat with Baldur Jónsson, the president of the commission. But these records can't be found on the net. This was long before Háfrónska.</dd>
<dd>I choose the name High Icelandic in 2003, because it is the most logical name for a purer form of Icelandic (think of High Norwegian (høgnorsk) the most conservative form of Norwegian, or Tolkiens High Elfish (Sindarin).</dd>
<dd>The pictures are important because High Icelandic is also a subculture, the nýyrðaskáldshúfa, Fjallbarnið (I added the webpage of the Mountain child as a link on the English wiki page. It is under construction. It showes that High Icelandic is more than a language variant, it presented as kind of life-style, a fashion and art.</dd>
<dd>A lot of Icelanders do like my project and many Scandinavists in the world love studying the word-list.</dd>
<dd>Two Ductch wikipedians Mig de Jong and Bessel Dekker have pushed other people to remove the article based on their own aversion of the phenomenon. Mig de Jong has send a message to other wikipedias to influence the people to delete the page. Before it was decided whether or not the page should be deleted.
<dl>
<dd>Will you please stop accusing people? Nobody is "pushing" anyone, and the claim that Mig de Jong and Bessel Dekker act out of some kind of aversion against this phenomenon is merely your speculation. If you say that others try to influence voters, you're doing exactly the same thing with your statements - it's called 'discussion'. <a href="../../../x/y/b/User%7EXyboi_c5a6.html" title="User:Xyboi">Xyboi</a> 19:00, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The only thing I ask here is: listen to the facts and make an objective, neutral judgement. Mig de Jong and Bessel Decker are pushing aside evidence (like the TV program) and the statement of Icelanders on this discussion that High ICelandic is a known phenomenon in Iceland along with reference value of the work with regard to etymology, neologistic work.

<dd>It is not completely my own invention. I compiled neologisms that have become obsolete during the last 200 years. This is almost 40% of the vocabulary. My contribution to the whole thing is maybe just 20% of all 12000 neologisms of the High Icelandic word-database. I just made a compilation of words that have existed, work of other neologists (sources added) and words created by myself during the last 15 years. When you add the pure part of the ICelandic vocabulary to these words it is called High Icelandic. So it is a compilation project based on the work of many people and has a high value as a neologistic reference work. It is noticed in Icelandic to an extent significantly enough to deserve a wikipedia entry. Maximiliaan</dd>

<p>"Killer neologism" is a term used in the following sense: It is almost impossible to create a neologism of such a quality that it will uproot an inveterate loan-word. This is called 'the blocking principle'. It is hard to break habits, especially in the spoken language. A killer neologism is a neologism of such a quality that it can break this habit. I was told about this term by some of the Icelandic neologists I'm in touch with. I don't think it can be found in terminology lists. But it expresses the phenomenon well.

<dd>The pictures are necessary to give people people a graphic example of the 4 most important symbols of the High Icelandic subculture: the Hammerflag (Þorsfrónvé), the Armoured Egg of Life (brynfjöregg), the Woman and Child of the Mountains (fjallmæðginin) and the cap of the neologistic poets (nýyrðaskáldshúfa. I disagree with the opinion that it is a vanity page, because I have clearly mentioned the fact that I'm inpopular as a person with many Icelanders because of my behaviour on usenet. Further more, the word 'one-man project is no longer appropriate. The project started out as a one-man project, but now it's a different scenario. I haven't created the High ICelandic symbolism alone. So the text 'Braekmans also created High Icelandic symbolism is wrong.

<dd>Just a little anecdote as input into this discussion, although it seems exhausted at this point: Braekmans' work looks to me like art - an art of parody of Icelandic linguistic purism, along the lines of some other recent Icelandic artists who have challenged the distinction between "art" and "real life". One should not forget that until a few years ago there was a radio program on the Icelandic state radio that specifically and categorically criticised certain developments of Icelandic as being "foreignisms" and suggested "good Icelandic" alternatives. The line between "good" and "bad" Icelandic has indeed been drawn on the basis of the concepts of "pure" and "original" words, vs. the bad foreign loan-words and loan-structures. This is also by no means a peculiarity of the Icelandic language establishment but can be seen in some other recently independent states as well - especially those that promote the idea of "one language - one nation - one state". Braekmans work (especially the images) are attempts to bring these ideas to their (absurd) logical conclusion. Also, his wordlists demonstrate how infinitely poorer and uglier Icelandic would be if it were truly devoid of loan-words. The wordlists are also, as stated here by Braekmans himself, very useful. Myself, as a contributor on the Icelandic wikipedia, have often been able to find there old Icelandic words for historical things, that are nowhere to be found elsewhere on the Internet or in modern dictionaries. Just recently I was able to retrieve there the Icelandic version of the word "carrack" (a type of ship), which I had been looking for all over the place (in specialised literature as well as in dictionaries and on the Net). It is, of course, a foreign loan-word, like most Icelandic words that have to do with ships and sailing, but Braekmans had found the specifically Icelandic version, and suggested a High Icelandic neologism for it that I would never dream of using. But... thank you Braekmans for finding this word for me. In my mind there is no doubt that these word-lists are important and impressive as Icelandic lexicographical work. I cannot, of course, judge whether High Icelandic is relevant on other wikipedias, or how it should be presented as I feel that it is intended to defy classification, but as a contributor I have found it very interesting, funny and also practically useful. -- <a href="../../../../is/a/k/i/User%7EAkigka_0192.html" class="extiw" title="is:User:Akigka">Akigka</a></dd>

<dd>Well Akigka ... as far as I read wikimedia's goal ... it is a goal to produce an encyclopedia about all human knowledge in all languages. So our endgoal is that all lemma's will have equivalents in all other languages. Will this ever happen ... no because it is to much work. But if the Iceland wikipedians judge this article to be worthy I feel that it means (because it is a subject with regards to Iceland) that it has to be placed in all language wikipedia's eventually. As the only way to make all human knowledge available to everyone is to have it in all languages! <a href="../../../w/a/e/User%7EWaerth_c780.html" title="User:Waerth">Waerth</a> 23:16, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't read Icelandic papers since many years so I have no knowledge about the recent articles in newspaper. I do have the first mentionings in the press of my early work in the 90's, when the word háfrónska didn't exist and my work still qualified as a solo-project<br />
These are the only articles from that time I know about.<br /></p>
<p>- A page-long article in DV, one of the four main Icelandic newspapers (edition of Januari 30, 1999, page 51)<br /></p>
<p>- An article in Tunguatak (late 90's, I can't remember the date), a paper about language use for the people of the Radio broadcast service (Ríkisútvarpið), written by the language advisor (málfarsráðunautur) of the service, Ari Páll Kristinsson, a later president of the Icelandic language committee (Íslensk málnefnd). Ten of my neologisms were mentioned in that article.<br /></p>
<p>- In the late nineties Ásgeir Eggertsson had a interview with me on the national radio ( ríkisútvarpið) about my neologistic work. This program was called 'Samfélagið í nærmynd' (May 13, 1996). In the interview the opinion of Baldur Jónsson, the then president of the Icelandic language committee was asked about my neologistic endeavours and said that some of my neologisms were impressive. Ásgeir Eggertsson left the radio broadcasting service short time after. I don't have Baldur Jónsson's e-mail address, but here's Ásgeir's. <a href="http://www.lv.is/employees.asp?catID=12&amp;teg=alphabetical&amp;EmpId=13" class="external free" title="http://www.lv.is/employees.asp?catID=12&amp;teg=alphabetical&amp;EmpId=13" rel="nofollow">http://www.lv.is/employees.asp?catID=12&amp;teg=alphabetical&amp;EmpId=13</a> you can call him on this number: 003545159112</p>
<p>But I can't find the edition of tungutak anymore. Can the Icelanders on this page could help me and search the archives for me? Because some Dutch wikipedians are convinced that I'm a sockpuppet and a manipulator, the above mentioned records are but bullshit for them until evidence is presented. I will scan the DV artcle tomorrow and put it on a page. But Icelanders need to help me find the article written by Ari Páll Kristinsson. These records should shed a disambiguating light on the nature of High Icelandic. For the time being, I added the link to an article about High Icelandic in Birtir, the local paper of Akranes. I happened to find this. Maximiliaan</p>
<p>This is the article in DV, one of the four main Icelandic newspapers (edition of Januari 30, 1999, page 51) <a href="http://users.telenet.be/Hafronska/DV.article.january.30.1999.pdf" class="external free" title="http://users.telenet.be/Hafronska/DV.article.january.30.1999.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://users.telenet.be/Hafronska/DV.article.january.30.1999.pdf</a></p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article and this hafronska linguastic movement seem to be a kind of concept art or a joke and in Icelandic it is very witty. Not untrue but an art of parody of Icelandic linguistic purism like Akigka has noted. There has not been much media coverage about háfrónska in Iceland, I searched through the database of the main Icelandic newspaper and found no occurences of this word. The websites of the movement are like parodies or art and make totally no sense to me but many other movements are the same - strange and unlogical. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalvor_b62b.html" title="User:Salvor">Salvör</a> 03:00, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Dear Madam, the High Icelandic Language Movement is a srious movement. No humour or jokes, but serious neologistic work. Everything that is pronouncable with human sounds must be translated in Icelandic: 50 million place-names on earth, millions of names of organic compounds, all personal names of 6 billion people. With the aid of artificial intelligence this job can be done in one day and low cost by 2070. Now it is still an absurd project in the eyes of most Icelanders. Paying a team of 1000 toponymologists appointed by the ministery of culture would mean that taxes would have to be raised in Iceland. Icelanders would never accept this. So it is up to the High Icelandic language movement to lay the foundations for these projects now so that the first computer expert systems can easily built further on our lists. We have started the fjörgynjaráætlunin, the translation of the earth's place-names into Icelandic. At the end of March the first part of a list with the place-names of Britain (a 5000 names), names from A to E will be published on the net along with information about the etymology of the English place-names and the choice of the Icelandic equivalents.

<dd>Ahoy. This evening I mentioned this debate to a couple of coleagues of mine, who notified me that a certain Icelandic radio show holds regular vocabulary competitions, in which there are typicly five or so words mentioned that people are asked to define; according to my sources said radio show has during recent months had one or two words from Háfrónska per week, which I'd say is a definite reason for there to exist such an article on Wikipedia. Like it or not, Icelandic vocabulary is taking a few words from Jozef Braekmans invention - heck, I even use a few myself. --<a href="../../../s/p/m/User%7ESpm_3fa8.html" title="User:Spm">Smári McCarthy</a> 00:35, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
