<dd>Sorry. Don't have much time right now. But if you look up Troy's band, the Atom Spies, on google, you will find that they get more hits than the articles about the 'Atom Spies,' the people who supposedly were trying to steal info about the H-Bomb. Those <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atom_Spies_9c48.html" title="Atom Spies">Atom Spies</a> have a fairly long wikipedia article. So if you are going by how well known he is, using google as a measuring tool, then his one-person musical group, which has released 3 CD's, not just the ones mentioned in the article, seems to deserve to be included. Since it is covered in his article and prevents ambiguity with the historical atom spies, it seems fair. --<a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIra-welkin_fd28.html" title="User:Ira-welkin">Ira-welkin</a> 04:48, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Maybe you can give specific information about these CD's: titles, labels, dates? My impression is that most of the google hits are primarily about actual spies. There may be CD information for this group out there; I didn't find it easily. I don't find them or him on allmusic. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 04:57, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I don't believe that the bullet headings are appropriate now considering we are discussing and not casting votes.&#160;;) But I am sorry I sounded so harried and rushed before, I always get worked up!&#160;;) Sorry. But I think you will find that the 700+ people mentioned before are not Troy's myspace friends, which he has more than 9000 of, but of people who have joined a group specifically relating to his upcoming book, and interested in pre-orders. I think you should give the guy a chance! This article has been up for two or three months, and nobody has wanted to delete it, and now that people are looking for his books in stores and book stores are ready to order copies of it in less than a month you want to take it down! I think it wouldn't hurt to leave it up for two more months and -then- re-evaluate its usefulness. --<a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIra-welkin_fd28.html" title="User:Ira-welkin">Ira-welkin</a> 16:49, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you can see my points with regards to the site being listed first. It is listed first because it is the most linked to and visited of all of them. So it must be that the band is attracting more visits than the Spies. Conversely, look how high up the wikipedia article is when you search his name: that is representative of how popular that page is than the other pages featuring the words "Troy Blackford". Make sense yet?</dd>

<dd>First of all, inviting all your friends to come and express votes that ignore the Wikipedia standards is not usually productive in these discussions. Totally aside from that, there are a number of issues here: How long the article stayed before someone noticed it and nominated it for deletion is irrelevant: there are over a million articles. Still no word about those 3 CD's; what happened to them? Also, generally with regard to authors we look for sales of at least 5,000 at a bare minimum. You have 700 who say they <i>will</i> buy it when it gets published (by whom? Is there a publisher?). All I see at this point is that, based on a rather imprecise google ranking, there are some unspecified large number of people visiting his website and myspace page. (His site may be visited by more people than any of the individual sites about the real spies, but the ranking certainly won't tell you if he's visited by more than all of them put together.) Am I missing something? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 18:31, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes you are. If Wikipedia is Not Paper than there is <i>always</i> room for expansion of the critera for inclusion, especially considering the completly 21st Century way that Blackford is known. You have to admit, '1967' that you don't know much about the emergent ways of distribution or the 'new ways' the industry is headed in this P2P universe. Why squash something you don't understand? I can contact Blackford and get some site stats that will 'specify' your numbers if you want. I see that all you do is go around deleting pages of people you don't feel are famous, and I think you are lumping this person in with others of a different nature. --<a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIra-welkin_fd28.html" title="User:Ira-welkin">Ira-welkin</a> 18:36, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There's mention of a "Zero Tolerants" CD, but no release date or label. Two "Atom Spies" compilation CD's: no release dates or label. Another CD released in June: no label? There's mention of a book, but no publisher.

<dd>I also think it is fair to list the myspace group as his 'fans' because the first third of the book is available on one of his websites and more than 10,000 people have read them and enjoyed them. And that's from the book he hasn't put out yet! MANY thousands more have read and commented on his eariler writings. Just because he is not charging for these stories makes it less impressive than 7,000 readers? Get with the times! New medium doesn't mean less important. You know in your heart that if the people making the guidelines were thinking about this, they would take more time to think about what they were saying than YOU are, blindly evoking these guidelines in the hopes that they will <i>enable</i> you to do something you want to do. --<a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIra-welkin_fd28.html" title="User:Ira-welkin">Ira-welkin</a> 19:16, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that POD publishers will list a book or CD that only sells a few copies a year, since it costs them nothing to do so.

<dd>Well in three weeks when all of these items are on amazon you can find out. I'm sure you'll think it's interesting. Until then you have no compelling reason to remove this article.

<dd>Considered as a traditional mainstream author, musician, or artist Troy may not live up to the standards of wikipedia for inclusion. But as a purely online presence Troy more than exceeds the requirements. Take him out of the catagory of musican, author, and artist and you will have someone still worthy of note. --<a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIra-welkin_fd28.html" title="User:Ira-welkin">Ira-welkin</a> 02:29, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>'All your base are belong to us' has its own page, despite not being an artist, musican, politican, or anything but a curiousity. Of course I agree that it is interesting and deserves to stay as an interest... why don't you agree about this? --<a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIra-welkin_fd28.html" title="User:Ira-welkin">Ira-welkin</a> 02:31, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, I'm not a big supporter of articles like that, but: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;num=100&amp;hs=GLn&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial_s&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=all+your+base+are+belong+to+us&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;num=100&amp;hs=GLn&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial_s&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=all+your+base+are+belong+to+us&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">Google search for "All your base are belong to us"</a> returns 900,000 hits. On the other hand, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22Troy+Blackford%22&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=Tz7&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official_s&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;filter=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22Troy+Blackford%22&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=Tz7&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official_s&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">Google search for "Troy Blackford"</a> returns 450. People talk about that stupid phrase; it's all over the web. He isn't; the vast majority of those hits trace back to his own site, atomspies.com. Again, it comes down to third parties. There don't seem to be many people, other than him, talking about him. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 02:46, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then spend your time trying to fix that system.&#160;;) You go around curing each and every 'symptom' of what you percieve to be a problem, without fixing the overriding cause. Could it be that you <i>enjoy</i> erasing people's articles?&#160;;) --<a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIra-welkin_fd28.html" title="User:Ira-welkin">Ira-welkin</a> 19:05, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
