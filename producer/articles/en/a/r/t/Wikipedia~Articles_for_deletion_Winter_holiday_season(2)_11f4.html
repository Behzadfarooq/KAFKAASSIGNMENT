Another question is, under which name? <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a> clearly supports <a href="../../../o/l/p/User%7EOLP1999_8f98.html" title="User:OLP1999">user:OLP1999</a>’s argument for "Christmas season": "Generally, article naming should give priority to what the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize".

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia does not imply that it is a politically correct organisation, nor should it. If the term "Winter holiday season" is actually used by people to mean the set of western christian holidays, then it is fine.

<li>That was during a few edit wars concerning the text "In the Northern Hemisphere" versus "In the United States". Since this PC terminology doesn't exist in any other area of the Northern Hemisphere other than the United States (including my country, Canada), I found it offensive to suggest this term is in usage in any other country. Yes, I'm biased against the usage of this term, but clearly <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAME_8ce9.html" title="WP:NAME">WP:NAME</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> suggest this article should be merged (it already has prominent display in the article "<a href="../../../h/o/l/Holiday.html" title="Holiday">Holiday</a>")— <a href="../../../o/u/r/Our_Lady_Peace_c943.html" title="Our Lady Peace">OL</a><a href="../../../r/a/i/Raine_Maida_5d24.html" title="Raine Maida">P</a> <i><a href="../../../o/l/p/User_talk%7EOLP1999_3f52.html" title="User talk:OLP1999">1999</a></i> 17:35, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The concept of a Winter Holiday season is certainly valid, even if not a widely used phrase, people do recognize and understand it. I don't think anybody here is arguing this doesn't exist. If they are then enjoy <a href="http://www.usfa.dhs.gov/downloads/pdf/tfrs/v3i2.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usfa.dhs.gov/downloads/pdf/tfrs/v3i2.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/dailyautoinsider/12027/lots-of-stranded-vehicles-expected-this-winter-holiday-season.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.caranddriver.com/dailyautoinsider/12027/lots-of-stranded-vehicles-expected-this-winter-holiday-season.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and <a href="http://psychcentral.com/lib/2006/10/enjoying-the-winter-holiday-season/" class="external autonumber" title="http://psychcentral.com/lib/2006/10/enjoying-the-winter-holiday-season/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. So far as it goes, I don't see that we should merge Christmas season and Winter holiday season. The Christmas aspects are a seperate part, and if anything, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_season.html" title="Christmas season">Christmas season</a> should be merged to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>. However, there are several aspects of the Holiday season that should be broken off from an article about Christmas. I might be convinced that <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holiday_season.html" title="Holiday season">holiday season</a> (currently a redirect to WHS) should be the name of the main article, if only because there should be content on this time of year in the Southern Hemisphere, where it is summer. However, I am deeply troubled by the arguments that this is "PC Garbage". That is uncivil, and borderline ad homineum, so it should be avoided. Since I don't want to endorse taking actions for such reasons, I'm going to oppose deletion and say keep. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:27, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Note</b>: Please don't dismiss an option because of the way it has been put forward. Before this (second) request was written, the article already was tagged with a merge request, added by someone else (me), for quite different reasons. As far as I'm concerned, while I appreciate your three helpful exhibits, I'm not convinced that they describe something different from what has been traditionally called Christmas season. Please therefore consider allowing a merge.

<li>No, I'm afraid I can't support a deletion with even the suspicion of misconduct on it. Being above reproach is highly important, especially here, where in my experience, there is a great deal of contention. For me to even consider this article, it would have to be propsed by someone who is neutral on the subject. In any case, I think a merge to Christmas season would actually be disadvantegous. If anything, I would say <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_season.html" title="Christmas season">Christmas season</a> should be merged to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> instead, and this article kept to reflect that the holidays at this particular time of year are about more than just Christmas. But I would the Christmas season has enough potential for content as a seperate subject in itself that I don't feel it needs to be merged or deleted. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:33, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is a case of one editor's personal bias disagreeing with what a large swathe of sources actually say. Wikipedia should go with what the sources say, not with what <a href="../../../o/l/p/User%7EOLP1999_8f98.html" title="User:OLP1999">OLP1999</a> (repeatedly) wants Wikipedia not to mention solely because of xyr personal bias. As for merger: As <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holiday.html#The_American_winter_holiday_season" title="Holiday">Holiday#The_American_winter_holiday_season</a> (which is mis-named, note) clearly states, this is a main article and that is a <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a> summary. This should not be merged there. Nor should it be merged to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_season.html" title="Christmas season">Christmas season</a>, which is part of the Christian <a href="../../../l/i/t/Liturgical_year.html" title="Liturgical year">liturgical year</a>. The Winter holiday season is, as the sources clearly say, <i>not</i> specific to Christianity, and <i>not a liturgical concept</i> at all. As per the last discussion at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Winter_holiday_season_d036.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Winter holiday season">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Winter holiday season</a>, all of the citations given above, and the references section of the article, <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:11, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, thank you, that was an eye opener! We're actually talking about two entirely different things here.
<ul>
<li>The <b>Holiday (shopping) season</b> from around Thanksgiving to December 24</li>
<li><b>Christmastide</b>, which runs from December 25 to January 6.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>We should keep these apart, and I am therefore changing my vote to <b>keep</b>. As a consequence, I also think we should:
<ul>
<li>change "Christmas season" into a disambiguation between the two meanings (and <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advent.html" title="Advent">Advent</a>),</li>
<li>make "Christmastide" the title for the page on the liturgical meaning, and</li>
<li>move the first half of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_season.html" title="Christmas season">Christmas season</a> to <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_holiday_season.html" title="Winter holiday season">Winter holiday season</a>. — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> <a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebastianHelm_c25a.html" title="User talk:SebastianHelm">(talk)</a> 21:43, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I disagree with the assertion that Americans don't actually use this term. I live and work in an incredibly religiously diverse area and use the term all the time (in addition to being inundated by it in the media).I also use "holiday season" and "the winter holidays". It's not PC, it is an accurate description of reality (ie. many people celebrating holidays during the winter are not, in fact, celebrating Christmas.) I concur that a better name for the article might be "holiday season". But if anything <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_season.html" title="Christmas season">Christmas season</a> should either be merged into <i>this</i> article, or <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>. To merge an article with information about <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanukkah.html" title="Hanukkah">Hanukkah</a> and <a href="../../../k/w/a/Kwanzaa.html" title="Kwanzaa">Kwanzaa</a> <i>into</i> one called <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_season.html" title="Christmas season">Christmas season</a> would be misleading &amp; unencyclopedic, regardless of one's personal opinions. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 14:28, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
