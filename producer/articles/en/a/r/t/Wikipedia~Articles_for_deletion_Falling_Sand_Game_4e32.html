<li><b>Keep</b> This should be moved to the video games and computer games wikiproject but not deleted. I am busy tracking down the notable references, but it may take longer than five days. Also, considering this article does not point to a particular game exclusively, it can hardly be considered a promotion for a particular game. What it does is discuss a sub-genre of what I would consider the puzzle game genre. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.48.159.136_c0b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.48.159.136">24.48.159.136</a> (talk) 19:48, 23 December 2006 (UTC).</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think this article is useful for the people who play the game, giving guides as to how to play or what to, it is also advertising, earning money for creators who can lead their lives.

<dd>What? First of all, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> wiki is not a place to advertise. Second of all, there's a difference between notability and usefulness. Argue creationism's "usefulness" all you want, but you can't deny it's notability. This game has yet to be proven that it is notable. If you want to save it, find sources. -<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanbomber_10a1.html" title="User:Ryanbomber">Ryanbomber</a> 16:15, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Not really. The first criterion is about works which <i>discuss</i> the game, so that we may cite those sources in this article. Derivative works do not treat the original as a subject, nor are they truly independent. The works must also be published non-trivially -- that is, they should be subjected to some editorial process which filters out unimportant topics and checks for accuracy. <span style="color: #F06A0F">–</span> <small><span style="border: 1px solid #F06A0F"><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony"><b><span style="background-color:White; color:#F06A0F">&#160;Anþony&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User_talk%7EAn%C3%BEony_4ae4.html" title="User talk:Anþony"><span style="background-color:#F06A0F; color:white">&#160;talk&#160;</span></a></span></small> 10:19, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

There's at least one messageboard, which I already linked to. When it came out, it was prominent on community sites - the article lists Fark and Digg, but I remember seeing it on the front page of del.icio.us, as well.

<li>A mention on about.com is more than sufficient to establish notability. Your zeal to delete this article is noted, but it's time to accept that other users may disagree, rather than trying to argue with everyone who is&#160;!voting to keep. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 23:24, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think I really need to point it out, but it's a discussion, not a vote. In most discussions, there's a natural back-and-forth of exchanging ideas and arguments. I do accept that others disagree, but I don't see what's wrong with pointing out flaws in their reasoning or details they've overlooked. Most especially, I'd rather not have new users come into the discussion and see these weak claims go unchallenged as truth. Claiming that the game has been mentioned on About.com does <i>seem</i> like an indication of notability as long as you don't explain what that mention was.</li>
<li>Additionally, a lot of the keep votes are coming from SPAs or rarely used accounts using spurious reasoning related to <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. This is undoubtably due to <a href="http://chir.ag/stuff/sand/" class="external text" title="http://chir.ag/stuff/sand/" rel="nofollow">at least one version</a> linking directly to the Wikipedia article <i>as directions</i> for how to play the game.

<li>Awesome ad hominem and sweeping generalization. The article has a source now, which is the only problem this AFD had. So why is it still open? -<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanbomber_10a1.html" title="User:Ryanbomber">Ryanbomber</a> 04:50, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. I was merely pointing out that the discussion is not as clear-cut as a simple head-count would lead you to believe. It bears mentioning that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> requires <i>multiple</i> sources and there are still problems with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Regardless, the AfD is due to be closed anyway and the final determination is up to the closing admin, which I will not contest. <span style="color: #F06A0F">–</span> <small><span style="border: 1px solid #F06A0F"><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony"><b><span style="background-color:White; color:#F06A0F">&#160;Anþony&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User_talk%7EAn%C3%BEony_4ae4.html" title="User talk:Anþony"><span style="background-color:#F06A0F; color:white">&#160;talk&#160;</span></a></span></small> 05:11, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>The game was also mentioned on <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocketboom.html" title="Rocketboom">Rocketboom</a><a href="http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/archives/2006/02/rb_06_feb_08.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/archives/2006/02/rb_06_feb_08.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which makes two sources and a notable subject. The article in its current state is not an instruction manual (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falling_Sand_Game&amp;oldid=73170819" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falling_Sand_Game&amp;oldid=73170819" rel="nofollow">past versions</a>), nor is it excessively promotional, so I can't see any problems on the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> front. Verifiability problems would be better corrected by linking to stuff like <a href="http://www.fallingsandgame.com/viewtopic.php?t=38" class="external text" title="http://www.fallingsandgame.com/viewtopic.php?t=38" rel="nofollow">this</a> rather than deleting the entire article, which seems a bit extreme to me.

<li>I wasn't not assuming good faith. I was pointing out a flawed argument. Even if there is Sockpuppetry going on, if the argument is good then what's the problem? -<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanbomber_10a1.html" title="User:Ryanbomber">Ryanbomber</a> 17:22, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Anþony, please watch your language and tone. As to this AfD, your complaints about verifiability are unfounded; we have no doubt that the game itself exists, as we can verify this by pointing directly to a site that hosts it. If some of the information in the article is itself unverified, it can be removed, or it can be tagged with {{citation needed}}, but deletion is not appropriate. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 16:41, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
