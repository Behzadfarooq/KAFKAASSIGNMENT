<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't know anything about Mr. Tennyson. However, where is the logic in deleting this and then adding Mr. Tennyson to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_novelists_from_the_United_States_f1d6.html" title="List of novelists from the United States">List of novelists from the United States</a>? That list clearly states that: "Novelists on this list should be notable in some way, and ideally have a Wikipedia article". If Mr. Tennyson has written published novels, then he probably should have an article and this stub should be expanded. If he hasn't, then this should be deleted and his name should not be added to any lists at wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:51, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Tons of esoterica is verifiable. And lots of sites which don't belong in an encyclopedia get tons of Google hits. As for it being 'notable', I really think this deserves explanation. A dissertation on some random aspect of a not particularly popular children's cartoon is not worthy of mention in an encyclopedia.

<li><b>STRONG Keep</b> I love this list, and found it to be a wonderfully useful resource when I need to find portable versions. It makes an excellent starting point for anyone searching for them. It might be nice as a category, but first a lot of work would need to be done to the individual pages that are linked to in order to make that work. Until that amount of work can be done and articles can be created for everything here that does not already have an article, then this page must stay in my opinion. It was even cool enough apparently for it to make the front page of <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digg.com.html" title="Digg.com">Digg.com</a><a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAyavaron_9420.html" title="User:Ayavaron">Ayavaron</a> 02:24, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> with respect to Anry Nemo - he seems like a borderline notable artist outside DeviantART. 240 unique Google hits, 52 unique Google Images, and it looks likely that there is plenty more information on him in Russian. <b>Relist individually</b> with respect to the others - I don't think these are clear-cut enough cases to give a blanket answer to all of them.

<li>240 isn't much for someone with an internet presence, and it pales in comparison to Suzi9mm, which went down without too much fuss. More importantly, I didn't see any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, and the Russian thing is interesting but doesn't help the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> problem that's a big part of non-notability. All that said, I will relist the individual articles as you ask: maybe not in the next few minutes, but I'll get around to it. I just didn't expect much opposition, and I wanted to save myself the work. Finally, if you want to err on the inclusionist side, we should keep the articles where they are, since their handles are much more popular than their real names. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 05:23, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As the original author and no I do not work for the website, this is my defense on my page and reason for what I wrote. I did not say she was the first to use a webcam, I said streaming video AND audio as a webcam, You have to read what is written and not what you want it to say. The first company to make a program that broadcast streaming audio was Ultravid. Landofvenus was a beta tester for it and at the time, was the only one using it. In 1997 there were several sites that had webcams, some even tried to emulate streaming video by using webcam32, but as far as I know, and by doing research, she was the first one to use streaming video and audio as a webcam. At the time, there were only 2 companies (to my knowledge) that made streaming video software, one was ultravid, the other was emulive, which landofvenus is on the cover of their product of as a beta tester also. If you KNOW of someone else who used streaming video and audio prior to april 1997 then state who they are, but just because you do not know of anyone else does not mean you can just say its false. I cannot verify most of what I read on most of these pages, but that does not give me the right to say they are wrong. If we go by the standard which you all are trying to use, then most of these pages will have to be placed up for review for deletion. --Venuscam 0900, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>I think this is justifiable.</b> I am currently in the process of using Wikipedia as a means of producing an image of <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurentian_University_8ea3.html" title="Laurentian University">Laurentian University</a> as a highly credible intellectual institution. It is my theory that if students can see how their university is reflected on the internet, it will stimulate them to become more participatory. So, by putting up my own article is not for the purpose to stroke my own ego, but to allow for students at Laurentian to feel a sense of legitimacy; which I think a valid consideration. To further improve the image of <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurentian_University_8ea3.html" title="Laurentian University">Laurentian University</a> on Wikipedia, I have taken the liberty of the creation of the article on our President, Dr. <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judith_Woodsworth_ad65.html" title="Judith Woodsworth">Judith Woodsworth</a>; as well, I have created entries on Dr. <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rand_Dyck_5104.html" title="Rand Dyck">Rand Dyck</a>; and, I have also created an article to focus credibility towards <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntington_University%2C_Ontario_f34c.html" title="Huntington University, Ontario">Huntington University</a>, one of Laurentian's federated colleges.

<li>Perhaps you're unclear as to what Wikipedia is, Mr. Roche.

<p>Non-notable neologism. Was prodded when called "Pulling a Scottie, but tag pulled with the comment <i>character name is "Scotty" and you get many more links if you search for "Pulling a Scotty"</i>. True: 3,650 for "Pulling a Scotty". '<i>But</i>, if you exclude "NASA" and "captainsquartersblog" (the two refs given), you discover 162 hits: meaning almost all its Google hits stem from two sources. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:16, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I pulled the Prod and renamed it; It's notable in real life and is anything <i>but</i> new... I first heard it in the late 80s in high school. I've heard it on a continuing basis (albeit not every day) throughout the aerospace industry. Lack of google hits is not proof positive that something isn't notable. It's a good hint, but can't be relied on as the only criterion. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 05:44, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You ought to know as well as as anyone else that "because I said so" doesn't cut it as a reference. If it's as common as you say it is, then logically it should haved leaked into Google, or are aerospace engineers keeping it a secret? Maybe it's not as common as you think. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:10, 15 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is plenty of stuff which Google verifyably underrepresents. There are whole professional fields that barely show up in it. Yes, "because I said so" isn't valid as a verifyable reference. I didn't say it was, and didn't put myself in the article as a reference. "it's not in Google" is equally invalid in the other direction. Huge google counts are usually valid positive verifyability; low Google counts are a no-test. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 02:43, 15 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That was a whole lot of words saying nothing much. Yes, "because I said so <i>was</i> used as a reference <b>on this page</b>, and your convuluted rationale about Google doesn't rise to the level of argument, merely being a collection of assertions: that "plenty of stuff" is "verifiably" underrepresented by Google, with the (assumed) conclusion that it applies in this case, along with the associated claims that low Google counts are a "no-test". You have NOT given the slightest nod in the direction of explaining why such an allegedly common phrase doesn't show up in Google other than vague handwaving about the assumed unreliability of Google, so, in short, it <b>still</b> boils down to "because I said so." --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 06:08, 15 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You failed to distinguish AfD comments from WP verifyability of references; AfD discussions do not have to meet article reference criteria, and never have. Notability can be numerically quantified, but usually is not as the research would take far too much time or be too difficult. AfD is a fuzzy logic popularity contest, in which people's personal experiences are perfectly valid input. If you intend to assert that notability has to be referenced as verifyably as article facts, then I respectfully suggest that WP editor and administrator consensus greatly disagrees. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 07:24, 15 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>AfD is a fuzzy logic popularity contest, in which people's personal experiences are perfectly valid input.</i> No, it isn't, it's a discussion about whether an article meets Wikipedia standard for inclusion, which is dependent on little things like verifiablity and notability. In other words, pretty much the same standards for writing the damned article in the first place, so no, I'm not failing distinguish anything, since there's little difference TO distinguish.</li>
<li>So instead of wikilawyering -- and constantly misspelling "verifiability" -- <b>maybe you ought to provide the tiniest bit of verification for all the claims you've been making</b>. Start somewhere: skip all of the handwaving and offer some tiniest shred of evidence of any of the following:
<ul>
<li>1) "Plenty of stuff". Name three. Explain why they are "underrepresented". Explain, come to think of it, what "underrepresented" means and how something can be "verifyably [sic] underrepresented."</li>
<li>2) Explain how your examples of "verifyably [sic] underrepresented" relate to or are analogous to the subject being discussed.</li>
<li>3) Offer an actual hypothesis of why "pulling a Scotty" has a low Google count. Hint: "Google is unreliable" isn't an actual hypothesis unless you answer points 1 and 2, above.</li>
<li>4) Offer alternative verification of the popularity of the phrase. Hint: "Because I said so"? Still not acceptable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is NOT rocket science. This is done here ALL the time, and attempts to dodge questions are usually viewed skeptically.</li>
<li>P.S: If "personal experience" is acceptable, I'll note that I've never heard the term in the sense you claim: this makes THREE people so far to your one. That sword cuts both ways. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 08:03, 15 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Without peeking: have you heard of the term <i>Metacentric height</i>? Have any of the other editors commenting here? Does your lack of having heard it before mean that <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metacentric_height.html" title="Metacentric height">the article</a> should be removed?</li>
<li>Lack of positive evidence from some set of people is not proof of negative evidence. It's one thing to argue that something isn't notable because it's poorly referenced online and only one person here has heard of it. What you're actually saying here now is much more clearly wikilawyering than anything i've said. And spelling flames are lame.</li>
<li>I believe that there's actually sufficient consensus enough for someone to boldly merge and redirect the article, at this point. This discussion has become ridiculous. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 19:34, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for your time, and a response to both: first, with regard to the rules on notability, I think this article qualifies in one important respect: it mentions amateur sports (and indeed, amateur sports players are fairly well represented on wikipedia). Now, calling high school math and science competitions "sports" might seem a bit of a stretch, but I can assure you that there is a significant culture (by a conservative estimate, upwards of 50,000 students each year) that considers them to be just this. Sure, we can't include every minor bit player in these kinds of competitions (like we would with the NBA), but considering that he is a dominant figure for this year (certainly in the top 5 overall, and best overall by most measures), I think it is reasonable to have an article about the best competitor from the class of 2006 in this enormous field.</p>
<p>And yes, I think the label of unprecedented is generally thrown around too sloppily. However, many of these competitions haven't been around for very long, and I can say that qualifying for 4 math/science olympiad camps (and all 5 olympiads, although that is not mentioned in the article) is in fact unprecendented. slightlyconfused1 06:15, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm a bit too tired to come up with a huge array of references at this point, but (to answer your request at least slightly), I'll note that searching for "Yi Sun" right now on google news provides 107 hits, basically all of which seem to refer to him (this is mainly with the STS contest, which is most recent and preeminent). slightlyconfused1 06:24, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Answering Saforrest's comment, I'd refer again to the page on Tiankai Liu, which has been around for some time and was created at a time when he had individual accomplishments of similar magnitude. More currently, however, there is the article on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Viscardi_ec63.html" title="Michael Viscardi">Michael Viscardi</a>, a current high school senior whose only "claim to fame" is in science and math contests, and who isn't as accomplished as Yi Sun.</p>
<p>EivindFOyangen, yes, the definition of "Gold Medal" is very different in math/science international olympiads from its meaning in the conventional olympics: it is set to be given to a specific fraction (although a small one) of the international competitors, who are already a fairly select group. And it's important to remember that he isn't notable merely because he won an International Physics Olympiad gold medal - it's because, first, he did it as a sophomore (which hasn't happened in the recent history of the US team, and possibly never), and more importantly, because he has been at the top in so many other competitions.</p>
<p>UsaSatsui, I'm not sure what you won in high school level competitions, but I think the basic principle here should be this: this general "area" is certainly not notable for us to start creating hundreds (or even dozens) of bio articles on its best students. However, I think that it is entirely reasonable to create articles on the *one* or *two* best individuals each year. And if we're willing to do that, this definitely qualifies.</p>
<p>Note: by "best individuals" I implicitly mean "best individuals in English-speaking countries." While there can certainly be articles on extremely, extremely accomplished individuals from across the world, there can't possibly be an "equal standard" of notability on English wikipedia - there are plenty of articles on Congressmen in America, MPs in Britain, etc., but there aren't nearly as many on, say, Duma members in Russia. slightlyconfused1 04:59, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Yet, this is high school, and unless either the competition itself is highly notable (it's not), or they're going around winning dozens of these things (the article mentions only three), it doesn't strike me as notable. There are hundreds of these competitions in the United States alone. As someone else said, this person will most likely be notable someday, but that day is not today...and think about it, when they <i>are</i> notable, these accomplishments probably won't even be mentioned. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 10:16, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, there are "hundreds" of math and science high school competitions. But things like the Intel STS (which has delivered millions of dollars in prizes in its lifetime, receives extensive news coverage, etc.) are certainly at a level entirely different from random local contests. Using this logic to establish that his accomplishments aren't notable is roughly analogous to saying that an NBA championship isn't notable because there are thousands of rec league games taking place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My reasoning has two distinct (and equally important) steps. First, I think that math and science competitions in high school are notable enough that the dominant *one* or *two* performers (across the full spectrum of contests) at any given time merit wikipedia articles. Second, I'm asserting that Yi Sun is, in fact, the dominant competitor in this year. I'd be interested in knowing where disagreements with this inclusion lie: is it the first or the second? Does this area so completely lack any notability that the dominant performer for a year doesn't merit inclusion? Or is he not, in fact, the dominant performer? I think that once we clear this up, we can get at the heart of the disagreement. slightlyconfused1 05:18, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep and rewrite</b> - if this is genuinely notable and/or refers to some real thing about which there could be an article, then I suggest stripping down this one into a stub and sticking {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpand_6021.html" title="Template:Expand">expand</a>}} at the top.

<li>But then again, how much do you think this thing could be expanded?

<li>OK, I did a little research. The article states that it was originally based on material from the 1728 Cyclopaedia, but it seems it did not make use of all the relevant material from that source. The Cyclopaedia's entry, which I assume you have all read by now, has the note "See COURIER, and POST," which seems to have been ignored. These entries are vital to understanding the context of "Couriers who travel'd on Horseback, or in Chariots." Our article would be much improved by incorporating that information, as well as other sources on the historic role of postal dispatch messengers. (Wikipedia has some broad information on this topic already, but here we want to focus particularly on the role of the anabasii.) Mention should also be made of the four classes of couriers traditionally distinguished in antiquity, two of which are covered by "anabasii." The Cyclopaedia entries: <a href="http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=HistSciTech000900240129&amp;isize=M" class="external text" title="http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=HistSciTech000900240129&amp;isize=M" rel="nofollow">Anabasii</a>, <a href="http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=HistSciTech000900240497&amp;isize=M" class="external text" title="http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=HistSciTech000900240497&amp;isize=M" rel="nofollow">Courier</a>, and <a href="http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=HistSciTech000900250473&amp;isize=M" class="external text" title="http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=HistSciTech000900250473&amp;isize=M" rel="nofollow">Post</a>. The Cyclopaedia is only a starting point, but it should be obvious that our article as it stands has not even exhausted that starting point yet. So, no, this is not an article with no possibility of expansion. Does that answer your question? Jimpartame 10:34, 17 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A minor correction: since the Post entry is split up over two pages, <a href="http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=HistSciTech000900250472&amp;isize=M" class="external text" title="http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=HistSciTech000900250472&amp;isize=M" rel="nofollow">this part</a> is relevant too. It's where the four kinds of couriers are mentioned. By the way, the Cyclopaedia's stated source on that is a treatise by Louis Hornigk, but the title isn't given. Does anyone here know what that treatise was called? If this article doesn't get deleted, it would be worth looking into that. Jimpartame 10:42, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wikipedia is not a repository for articles about relatively infrequent internet snowclones occurring occaisionally on usenet. Basically, non-notable neo-phrasism, and this sort of thing is the gateway article to a mountain of new articles, with variables in their names. Maybe if the article were about the original phrase, with a note that it has spawned many snowclone usages, but for crying out loud, Wikipedia is not your clubhouse. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrorIsland_fc70.html" title="User:TerrorIsland">TerrorIsland</a> 07:34, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

So, really, the comment should have been, "User is new, disregard his comments without considering them on their merits"? is that official wikipolicy? <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrorIsland_fc70.html" title="User:TerrorIsland">TerrorIsland</a> 14:06, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is not exactly like that. There is no official Wikipedia policy to ignore votes from new users. What is meant here is a guideline to give less weight to votes from new users, with little or no actual reasoning or explanation. Your comments on this AfD debate are well-written and reasonable. Therefore I don't think they will be automatically ignored just because you're new. What the guideline is meant for is to ignore votes that only consist of "<b>Don't delete!</b> This is a cool phrase!", and to ignore votes that appear to have been written by the same person with multiple user accounts. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 14:27, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> JIP is correct. We don't treat new users' contributions here as zero-value. I apologize if my note explaining ajm's posting made TerrorIsland or Jiumpartame think otherwise. If you have facts that are relevant under WP policies, please <i>do</i> tell us those facts and cite sources where they can be verified. If you are merely making assertions without factual backing or ones that don't help determine whether the article meets Wikipedia policies, the administrator who closes the AfD debate will usually give less weight to a new user's words (if apparently well-intended), or give no weight to it (if suspected of being intended for self-promotion or feuding or otherwise not to improve the encyclopedia). Remember also that AfD is a discussion seeking consensus, not a vote. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 22:26, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> If this is really a forum for discussion, I am surprised at the number of people who indicated their position as a vote, rather than trying to discuss the matter. Very few people have responded to my contention that a catchphrase, even if popular in variation (like a snow clone) gets an article for the phrase itself, not the template with a variable in it. I don't understand why, if this isn't just voting, very few people are discussing the things I said, and instead list a vote followed by some positive feature, like, "notable". <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrorIsland_fc70.html" title="User:TerrorIsland">TerrorIsland</a> 22:48, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think you're confusing ad hominem and personal attack. A reply can be <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> without seeming like a vicious personal attack. Any response to a challenge that weighs the qualities of the person levying the charge instead of the merits of the charge itself is an argument ad hominem (against the man) rather than against the claim itself. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrorIsland_fc70.html" title="User:TerrorIsland">TerrorIsland</a> 14:09, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As long as we can call me a name before deciding to keep the article, I suppose all is well. I am not a deletionist, unless by that you mean someone who thinks that there are some articles which should be deleted. Because then, sure I am. Phrases of that form get 614 google hits. Can anyone tell me where all of theses uses are that mysteriosly don't come up on google searches? Also, why is this article about the phrasal template and not about the origin phrase, which is how all other snowclones are listed?<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrorIsland_fc70.html" title="User:TerrorIsland">TerrorIsland</a> 13:54, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have struck out my comment as it was not serious, I just wanted a chance to use this phrase. Back in the late 1980s and early 1990s, I was a huge fan of Amiga computers and games. I read many British Amiga magazines regularly, and thus became more familiar with British culture than most Finns of my age. I noticed that several magazines contained this phrase, but I had no idea what it meant or where it had come from. Then I found it on Wikipedia and it explained it to me. These mentions obviously do not show up on Google as it does not yet search through printed material. So that explains why I think it is notable. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 14:17, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Doesn't it seem odd to you that most catchphrase articles are about the original catchphrase, rather than having a variable in their name? Shouldn't the article actually be "You Are Lobby Lud and I claim my five pounds?" Or merged in to the Lobby Lud, article at least? I still think its not notable enough, but I am confused why people who do think the content is notable enough think the article should be kept rather than merged, moved or redirected. Also, I apologize for misinterpreting the tone of your initial vote.

<li>The expression in the title is not notable. In fact, it is either not a complete expression, or it accuses someone of being the letter 'X'. I think you mean the expression "You are Lobby Lud and I claim my five pounds" is notable.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is already in Wiktionary, as is <i>gynotikolobomassophilia</i>. I'm not at all convinced the term wasn't made up by some bored people with an English–Greek dictionary. Lists of paraphilias used to do regular rounds on usenet, and I'm sure people added all kinds of things. It's not quite clear where the double <i>ss</i> comes from; from the verb <i>masasthai</i> (to chew) I'd expect a single <i>s</i>; <i>massein</i> (to knead) would give <i>ss</i> but would refer to a different irresistible urge. But my classic Greek is a bit rusty and I may be mistaken. If this belongs anywhere in Wikipedia, it should be in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paraphilia.html#List_of_paraphilias" title="Paraphilia">Paraphilia#List of paraphilias</a>. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 23:53, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Alan Cantwell is a self-published author of conspiracy theory books, is occasionally published in New Dawn (which publishes fringe theories), and back in the 1980s he published a few articles in the medical press, but under 30 publications is certainly not indicative of a significant research career. So he fails the professor test, is a self-published author (so fails the author test) but might be a valid subject as a conspiracy theorist. The no. 1 Google hit is whale.to (now vaccination.org.uk), <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhaleto_f41b.html" title="User:Whaleto">User:Whaleto</a>'s vehement;ly anti-vaccination website, and some at least of the supposed publications are reproduced (with or without permission) on that site. Article was created by Whaleto, who also added (<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Whaleto_2940.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Whaleto">per his usual practice</a>) links to his site. I would say that this is "just another crank" and not an especially notable one, but I could be wrong. Just to clarify per RayaruB below, the books on Amazon are published by <a href="http://www.ariesrisingpress.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.ariesrisingpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Aries Rising Press</a>; from their website: <b>Aries Rising Press, Los Angeles. was founded in 1984 by Alan Cantwell, M.D., for the purpose of disseminating vital medical research and knowledge concerning the origin and cause of two major diseases; Cancer and AIDS</b>. The site lists <b>no</b> books by <b>any</b> other author. These are self-published books. There are notable self-published authors, like <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Gunther_9e2d.html" title="Robert Gunther">Robert Gunther</a>, but he is notable as the founder of the museum of science at Oxford and the driving force behind the rehabilitation of [Robert Hooke]]'s reputation, not as a self-published author. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:50, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>That's a good point.

<li>Yes, you did say that. And had Mr. Cantwell's books just been sold by some unknown website I might vote delete here. But they are sold by major booksellers. And I see Cantwell quoted in the press on AIDs or being <b>referenced in other books</b> <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22Alan+Cantwell%22&amp;lr=&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;start=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22Alan+Cantwell%22&amp;lr=&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. Your argument regarding self-publishing is also fairly unconvincing given the vast number of articles here that use self-published papers, blog articles and chat board posts as valid references. You should know this, because you are involved in editing some of these articles. Finally, I again note that Mr. Cantwell gets 18 hits in google scholar <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Alan+Cantwell%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Alan+Cantwell%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, while Dominionism gets 32 <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Dominionism&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Dominionism&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. Dominionism currently benefits from an article here, a number of categories, a template and some lists. You yourself have argued that dominionism is backed up by scholarly references.

<li><b>Keep</b> per JJay. The self-published author thing is a guideline, not a set of handcuffs.

<li><b><s>Comment</s></b>. Is it indicated how many of the books have sold? Amazon indicate they have to order half of them (2-3w), are they being printed to order? If another article is using self-published stuff and own website as a reference then there is a problem with <i>that</i> article, it doesn't mean it is OK for other ones. He doesn't look notable to me, but I've learned not to trust the articles out of that author to include what people are notable for, so it may be worth doing some actual research.

<li><b>Comment</b> as JJay mentioned above which may have been overlooked, Cantwell is mentioned in other books.

<li><b>Comment on notability + Weak Keep</b>. This guy seems notable ("Alan Cantwell" "AIDS" = 32,000 hits). Clearly as mad as a bicycle, but notable. Just to clarify- having one's books listed on Amazon DOES NOT make one notable in itself. ANYONE with a chequebook can get a book into the Amazon catalogue- they have deals with numerous vanity press outfits. They may be a major bookseller, but they are not a discerning one. PS- Barring exceptional cases (like, for example, this one), almost any article that's using blogs, chat boards, and self-published papers (ie not peer-reviewed) as references is suspect.

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't see sufficient evidence of him being notable in the article. I would want to see notable sources writing about him (not just his writings). Personally, I think a self-published book, is little better then a personal web site. It doesn't mean you're not notable, but it doesn't mean you are. The evidence of notability, needs to go in the actual article (as opposed to this AFD page). Without citing reliable sources that have been written about him in-depth, we can't really say anything neutral and reliable about him, as a person is not a neutral reliable source about themself. Currently, the article mentions no criticisms of his views. Now, that's not because there isn't criticism of these types of views. It's because nobody (worthy of citing) seems to know or care enough about him to bother directly addressing his views. So the article will never present all major perspectives fairly. But if the article is improved, I'll be happy to be proved wrong, and change my vote. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:06, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>IMO: not encyclopaedic. Reads like it came straight out of a game manual, and no attempt is made at an "out of game world" perspective. Interesting only to players of the game.

<p>I submit that the information in this article is fundamentally unverifyable - people may claim that particular cities are "the oldest" etc etc, which is fine for that city's page, but with the scarcity of evidence, I don't believe that we should have a page containing a list, with dates, that definitively states which cities are the oldest. --<a href="../../../s/i/4/User%7ESi42_1ee3.html" title="User:Si42">Si42</a> 14:04, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. While there may be some cases where priority is contested, this is in fact verifiable by archaeology.

<dl>
<dd>It's not so much some cases of dispute as ALL the cases (look at the first few on the list - they are not as bad as they were, but all the first 3 claimed different things), the archeology involved is far from an exact science, certainly nowhere near good enough for a pseudo-definitive <i>List</i>! All we're going to end up with is a bunch of patriotic, almost nationalistic debate from citizens of India, China and the countries of the Levant - where pride is derived from the apparent status - complete codswallop. --<a href="../../../s/i/4/User%7ESi42_1ee3.html" title="User:Si42">Si42</a> 15:14, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I can see I'm going to lose this.

<li><b>Comment</b>, Keep, but can someome please write an introductory paragraph explaining the criteria (e.g. continous occupation, evidence of earliest occupation etc.) I'm not sure about the use of the word <a href="../../../c/i/t/City.html" title="City">city</a> either, it hints at a size or population requirment. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkb_3e6f.html" title="User:Markb">Markb</a> 19:09, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Since there is consensus here (I still think the page is unverifyable but it seems I am alone) and some major changes have been made to the article, I am proposing that we close the nomination, I will leave the "requires sources" tag on until I manage to sort out the sources for the list (I got the ages from various Wiki articles - it's <b>far</b> from perfect but it's better than it was. --<a href="../../../s/i/4/User%7ESi42_1ee3.html" title="User:Si42">Si42</a> 13:38, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Okay, my citing of Tiankai Liu appears to have had unintended consequences. I just want to highlight the same principle that I have maintained in the other discussion (on Yi Sun's page): first, although math/science academics and contests at the high school and undergraduate level aren't so notable that we should be creating dozens and dozens of articles on them, I think that it is reasonable to have articles on the top one or two of each graduating year (and if you disagree, please let me know!). Considering the combined magnitude of Tiankai's accomplishments, it's clear that he falls into this category: he was a Putnam fellow this year (top 5 of all North American undergradutes, extraordinarily prestigious), and among other accomplishments in high school, he won a gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad his freshman year in high school. A gold medal in the IMO freshman year is absurdly rare, and the other two Americans in my memory who have achieved this, <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reid_Barton_a4e5.html" title="Reid Barton">Reid Barton</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabriel_Carroll_236a.html" title="Gabriel Carroll">Gabriel Carroll</a>, both have well-established wikipedia articles. The only year of high school Tiankai didn't get a gold medal in the IMO was his junior year, when he attended the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research_Science_Institute_3ae2.html" title="Research Science Institute">Research Science Institute</a> instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, this article doesn't even mention what is perhaps Tiankai's most incredible accomplishment: at the International Olympiad in Informatics, he won a special prize (the only such special prize given that year, and one of the only ones ever) for an incredible solution he provided to one of the problems: his program, dreamed up on the spot, was much faster than the "model" program created by the judges of the competition, computer science experts with far more time to think about the problem. I think that this, which I can add to the article once we resolve this dispute (or before, if consensus is that I should), certainly makes Tiankai notable enough - in addition to his other accomplishments - to be featured on wikipedia. He is one of the few brightest young stars in the math/informatics world right now. slightlyconfused1 04:18, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> There really isn't much information on Sam Travolta out there. I couldn't even find a birthdate on him. There are really only four members of the Travolta family that appear to have any individual fame or notability: John, Rikki Lee, Ellen, and Joey. Others only have claim to notability based on relationship to those four, or for the most part to John. I don't see Sam having notability to warrant an article. I tried to look for sources that list his name on the internet and couldn't come up with much. I would suggest Merge into Travolta Family, but again outside of the four individuals, the family may not be notable enough for a page itself. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingJamesCav_b946.html" title="User:KingJamesCav">KingJamesCav</a> 11:44, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I don't think this is a crystal ball deal. Burnlounge has 10,000 paying retailers at this point. You can buy music online at their sites. It is a working, functioning music download service right now. The beta thing is a technicality which covers the fact that for their official launch they will add some more functionality to the software and it will be "official." Finally, the "beta" period is supposed to be over in a month, so by the time you delete this, it will be valid again. And I certainly am not coming back and recreating it then. Again, this isn't a crystal ball, Burnlounge exists now, they are selling the mogul packages like crazy. There are tens of thousands of individual sites already up and running. It is a topic that should be in an online encyclopedia. We're not saying "there is going to be a Burnlounge service." It EXISTS now, and is in a "working beta" so-to-speak.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This page is very balanced and includes a fair bit of useful, factual information about Burnlounge as well as links to celebrity endorsements and discussion pages.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think the main point to address is Sam Blanning's; he may be right that the newspaper article is partly based on the old Wikipedia article. First of all, we don't know if that's true or not. In the given article, Wikipedia is not mentioned. We have no reason to believe that Wikipedia is the <i>only</i> source of that material, in which case I would agree that it would not be a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. As has been pointed out, it's easy to convince yourself that people know what The Game is and play it by doing a web search: that may not be good enough for Wikipedia, but it's good enough for a newspaper article. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 17:51, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's only one additional source which does not make it verifiable, it was recreated way outside of policy (this should have been taken back to DRV not recreated and sent here) and it's just another excuse of a reason by a group that will do anything including sockpuppetry, meatpuppetry, and blatant violation of consensus to delete and policy regarding deletion to get this article on Wikipedia. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 18:28, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

It was brought up during the DRV and was taken into account by the admin who closed it. Their decision was to <i>keep deleted,</i> and protected the article from recreation.<br />
However, the protection was removed and the article recreated <i>by the very same user/admin who initiated the DRV in the first place!</i> I can't be the only one who sees a problem with that, and I noted it on the article's talk page.<br />

<li>I really don't think it's fair to say it was "shot down" in the deletion review. The only comment made on it after it was brought up was by the closing admin. And I see no reason why a newspaper article should be considered unreliable just because it's not sourced. I know of virtually no newspaper articles that are. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 21:17, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fair enough, I changed my reasoning accordingly. The reason the source of the article is important (at least to my understanding) is that there was some talk on Talk:The Game (game) about whether the article used WP as a source. I'm not sure I buy it myself, but that is one of the arguments being used against the newspaper article. At any rate, these are things that need to be brought up in another DRV. Quoting directly from <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>: "Deletion Review is also to be used if significant new information has come to light since a deletion and the information in the deleted article would be useful to write a new article." This is what should have been done in this situation, instead of going against a just-closed DRV and restoring the article. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanG_1aea.html" title="User:BryanG">BryanG</a> 21:31, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Even if Deletion Review were the correct place to take this discussion, it seems to be pretty policy-obsessive to vote for deletion now solely based on that.

<li><b>Relist</b>--oh wait =( Kotepho 22:55, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't feel I'm being policy-obsessive here. The fact is that both the most recent AfD and the DRV have been closed as "delete". I believe it sets a dangerous precedent if we allow users to ignore two successive debates and recreate a substantially similar article just because one source has been found. That's exactly what DRV exists for, as I noted above. To answer your question, I would probably say that the article is non-notable and vote to keep the article deleted anyway, so my vote stands. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanG_1aea.html" title="User:BryanG">BryanG</a> 23:07, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No Wikipedian who wasn't already "playing The Game" would read the newspaper article and consider it worth basing an article upon.

<li><b>Delete and protect</b> as annoying internet meme, based on WP:V and notability. A single newspaper blurb (especially in a foreign-language newspaper) isn't enough for notability for something like this.

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> The article has stirred up a huge amount of interesting discussion, but it boils down to the question of whether we should accept something that is real, despite it not being widely documented in traditional source material. I think that we should. The Game is a real phenomemon, and as such it is Wikipedia's duty to document it. By its very nature it does not have much written source material, but it is nevertheless not simply a 'childish game'. <a href="../../../d/b/m/User%7EDbmag9_1efb.html" title="User:Dbmag9">D<small>aniel</small></a> (<a href="../../../d/b/m/User_talk%7EDbmag9_aa02.html" title="User talk:Dbmag9">☎</a>) 18:00, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep.</b> I wanted a source, and one has been found. I wish it were in English because the majority of our readers can't read Dutch, but I trust the translation and I trust the newspaper. I do hope that someone contacts the author of the newspaper article to ask what sources he/she used in writing it... doing so will either confirm that we're now referencing ourselves circularly or will provide us with more sources for our own article. Until we can prove without a doubt that the author used our article to write his/hers, I'm going to assume he/she didn't, and hopefully that's not shooting myself in the foot. If the result is keep, it will require a fair bit of policing, I'm sure, to keep the original research and general cruft out, but the promise of cruft in the future is not a valid reason for deleting the article now. —<a href="../../../s/e/q/User%7ESeqsea_4341.html" title="User:Seqsea">Seqsea</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/q/User_talk%7ESeqsea_914c.html" title="User talk:Seqsea">talk</a>) 20:47, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>The content of the article is uniquely hard to pin a source down to. Meme phenomena tend to lack the publicity or scholarly research that an article on a current event or the astrolabe would. Specifically, addressing Gsham's point, it's a bit elitist to disregard any attempt at justification solely because the article doesn't happen to be in English. If it is really of that much concern, then maybe have it translated by someone? Or check the qualifications on the publisher itself? If it's a newspaper issue, and if it can't be translated, then see if the source is a credible one. Reiterating: Memes are regional, cultural, etc. phenomena. Just because the New York Times has not piped in an opinion does NOT mean that the information is either any less true or any less informative than any other regional quirks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, certainly, if the article was blatantly dumb, then it merits deletion. However, I can testify that this actually is a true meme. I've talked to people across the state that play this 'game' just as myself and my friends do.

<li><b>Comment</b> I tried searching usenet for +"think about the game" +lose. I figured those would be in all versions of the game; I didn't find <i>any</i> of the results referring to this game. The only post I can find definitely relating to it is one from April 17, 2005 that links to the WP page. There's one from February 20, 2006 that states "You made me lose The Game" which might refer to it. I think it's important to find references that predate the article's first creation on WP. When was that? The first VFD was posted 30 Sep 2004. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 07:11, 16 April 2006 (UTC) On April 6, 2004 195.92.67.75 added a description of the game to the disambig page <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Game_def0.html" title="The Game">The Game</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Game&amp;diff=3086150&amp;oldid=3086062" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Game&amp;diff=3086150&amp;oldid=3086062" rel="nofollow">diff</a>.

<dd>Actually it can be, as someone posted a scan of it on the talk page, but you're not missing anything. It is next to useless with respect to WP:V, as it does not explain how it got its information (which newspapers <i>do</i> generally do when they have a source, contrary to Ssbohio's claim, even if it's unnamed "senior government officials") and we're forced to resort to "they probably know what they're talking about". It seems to score some points in the notability game, though, but personally I don't play it, hence my own continued deletionist stance. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 23:06, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This seems to be a much stricter application of that sentence than we normally use. I'm particularly puzzled by your comment that a newspaper saying "senior government officials" is in fact any better, since we have no guarantee that that came from such officials at all. Would you feel better if the article said "we heard about it from all the annoying idiots who keep playing the game and announce 'I lost' in the middle of lectures" or "we kept hearing friends talk about it?"

<li>I've tried hard to see each side's point on this, since I am uninvolved in this particular article, having had no edits or previous votes. Until I read the article here in Wikipedia, I hadn't heard of this "game." As a fourth attempt at deletion, I'm having a hard time seeing a consensus to delete. Further, when a source is provided to overcome the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> issue, those in favor of deletion argue against the verifiability of the newspaper story, despite any evidence that calls its verifiability into account. Secondary sources fall within <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and to presume the story unverifiable because it contains no explicit sourcing (in keeping with newspaper tradition) doesn't <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> on the part of the keep faction. If the newspaper story is dubious (for reasons grounded in fact), then this article can't rely on it for sole support.
<p>In the end, having read the discussions here, at DRV, and in the talk page, I have to come down in favor of <b>keep</b>ing the article. I can't see where a consensus for its removal has been demonstrated, and the fact that it has been ruled a <b>keep</b> in AfD twice, but <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forum_shopping.html" title="Forum shopping">forum-shopped</a> back to AfD by those favoring deletion, then <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forum_shopping.html" title="Forum shopping">forum-shopped</a> again into DRV by those favoring keeping the article, only to end up back here again. This has taken on an unpleasant aspect through all these actions, and I find it hard to believe that a true consensus in favor of deletion could be reached. The article needs wikified &amp; sourced, but not deleted. So, <b>keep</b>. --<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 22:56, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>- I don't think it's possible to interpret the article as other than a unacceptable document for wikipedia--imputing as it does an extremely malicious intention to the Site and our research and content policies. I accept that it may not have been wise to speedy it; deletion is like that. So I find the situation of the consistent undeletion and deletion of this article disruptive, but the constant outcries for it trips my troll alarm. I honestly don't believe this article to be notable enough, sourced properly or even apporpriate for this encyclopedia. -<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegaman_Zero_2b31.html" title="User:Megaman Zero">Zero</a><sup><a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegaman_Zero_f80e.html" title="User talk:Megaman Zero">Talk</a></sup> 15:23, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>- Extremely notable, verifiability seems to depend on interpretation, and therefore the controversy over the legitimacy of the source should be included in the article as per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> as first mentioned by Kernow: "In some cases, there may be controversy or debate over what constitutes a legitimate or reputable authority or source.

<dd>That's a funny link. We all know that just because something is printed doesn't mean it's true.

Do you have a reason to doubt <i>this</i> newspaper article? What part of it would be in doubt, anyway?

<li>There are hundreds, even thousands, of hits on google for this. This does not make the article any more or less verifiable. What it does, however, do, is make it (in my opinion) notable. There's also the numerous people here on Wiki from across the world who say they've played it. Of course, I'm not sure what the person who put this up for deletion is intending to get at with notability, since it's a bit of a nebulous concept (at least as I'm reading it). The person who sent this to AfD explaining what they mean by declaring this article non notable would help. Of course, as far as I can tell, notability isn't specifically Wikipedia policy.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, there's the matter of NFT, but I think that if we resolve Verifiability, then NFT becomes a moot question. Which, of course, brings us back to the original question (the one causing so much discussion): Is this verifiable? Which leads me to ask, what (if anything) makes this article unfit? Admittedly, I'm not an expert on Wiki Policy, but could someone point out to me what makes this new article unverifiable? I understand hesitancy to use an article printed in a language many do not speak, but the policy on Reliable Sources states that English sources are prefered when possible. This seems like a juncture in which English sources are not possible. Further, the article goes on to state</dd>

<dd>I suspect that no one will be heavily quoting the article, but even if they were, since this is intended as a source, it will surely be linked.

<li><b>keep</b> I knew about this game from experience about 2 years ago. I checked Wikipedia then to see if we had an article on it. Sure enough, we did. That was good enough for me then. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> has a flaw. Wikipedia is not allowed to be the first source to report on a fact; we have to wait until some other source that is deemed a verification source has already reported on it. We should not have to wait until there is a single "good enough" source. Having some number of Google hits should be good enough to say "yes, this is verifiable", even if none of those hits are good enough on their own to merit verifiability. What that "some number of hits" should be may need to be left up to interpretation. In the case of The Game, it certainly exists, there is sufficient Google hits to document the information and therefore verify the article. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> <a href="../../../u/t/h/User_talk%7EUtherSRG_26f3.html" title="User talk:UtherSRG">(talk)</a> 13:40, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No one has ever given me a good reason why the newspaper article does not count. Is it because it isn't in English? That is an obviously spurious claim. Is it because it is subscriber only? Also unfounded. Is it because it doesn't cite it's source? What? Most newspaper articles do not nor books. Small subscription base? It has around 8% of the subscription base of the Wall Street Journal Online. It isn't exactly small. Kotepho 15:22, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I seen Cashville Records website and looked at it clearly. I believe that it's possible for it to true, but there is no official word from Interscope Records. Interscope has the say in that matter. To me, personally, it looks like a fan site devoted to Young Buck. The B.G. is in talks with G-Unit, but not a signed member of the group or an artist established to any label other than Chopper City Records, his own established label. I doubt B.G. would be a part of any label after Cash Money cheated him out of money.

<li><b>Delete</b> Whoever put the G-Unit South made the inaccurate comment that rap artist B.G. is on this "supposed" label. I am not saying it's a crystal ball or saying it true. You perhaps think that G-Unit has expanded over with Cashville Records whenas there is no official site other than that squanter site with Google advertising among others. And besides how can Lil' Scrappy break ties with Warner Bros/Atlantic without comfirming. Show me proof and again I will recend my nomination. Right now I see a fansite not a webpage devote to G-Unit Records. Whoever made this page just copy the information from the website and posted it on the Wikipedia site! And beside it doesn't cite sources. #D-Tay- Fellow Tennessee rapper released mixtapes with Young Buck before Young Buck signed with G-Unit and has just linked a deal with G-Unit South. He is now preparing for his first big label debut. So therefore this is false. #B.G.- Former Cash Money rapper and Hot Boy has just signed to G-Unit South after weeks of speculation. So therefore this is false. B.G. is currently on Koch Records, but recently signed to Atlantic Records. #Lil' Scrappy- Former BME Records rapper, has finally signed with G-Unit South after tons of web rumors.” So therefore this is false.

<li><b>Comment</b> WP doesn't have a guideline for notability of movies, which makes things difficult to decide what to do about them. IMDb's criteria for inclusion was mentioned above; it's at <a href="http://us.imdb.com/updates?update=title" class="external free" title="http://us.imdb.com/updates?update=title" rel="nofollow">http://us.imdb.com/updates?update=title</a> if anyone is curious. There are a couple of movies I had a devil of a time submitting to IMDb, though I'd bought one in a video store and the other from online after hearing about it (if I recall correctly) on Leno. Factual observations about a primary source that others can consult and make the same observation are AFAIK permissible. E.g. you don't need to cite a secondary or tertiary source to note that a given person is in a movie, or to quote it. Such sources are needed when the article starts getting deeper; what the meaning or ramification of things are, whether it's good or not, etc. See the part of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#Primary_and_secondary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary_and_secondary_sources</a> that states "In some cases, where an article (1) makes descriptive claims the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge, and (2) makes no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, or evaluative claims, a Wikipedia article may be based entirely on primary sources (examples would include apple pie or current events), but these are exceptions." <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 22:53, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Excuse me, can you read? If so, please try to exercise that capability before calling someone else incorrect. (1) The stated reason for nomination is "original research", and not "non-notable".

<dd>General Theory of Relativity would not be on Wikipedia if it had not been peer reviewed and especially if it had been posted by Einstein himself. It would have been an Original Research vanity posted by Einstein until it could be reviewed by an outside source and validated. In fact, I think that's how science treated it when it was originally published. It's certainly how Einstein treated Quantum Mechanics.

<p><b>Delete</b> non-notable fancruft page with no sources, so unverifiable. Has been created and speedied five times since September. On the talk page, the creator of the latest version claims it is more substantive (and has contested speedy and prod notices). Only claim to notability put forward so far is a link to a post on an external noticeboard claiming to be from GGFan. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_Esperanza_97e1.html" title="User:Gwernol/Esperanza">Gw<font color="green">e</font>rnol</a> 17:22, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Claiming to be from GGFan? Take a look at LionheartGGFans profile. Date joined: July 16th, 2005. Hey, The Alternative was created on July 16th, 2005! I gave you two valid sources, so you're wrong by saying there are no sources. So it is verifiable. I can provide more proof if you want BTW. It may have been created and speedied five times but this version isn't a life story or anything like that. It just gives all the good and bad details about a well known person in the Pokemon community, Gamefaqs and even in SDA (SpeedDemonsArchive).</p>

<li>I don't really see what all the fuss is. "E-fedding",to me, is a hobby as interesting to some as MMORPGs are to others.

<li>Call me biased, but why is an e-federation which claims to be nothing more than an e-federation being accused of anything? It's fiction, correct - that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. For example, is it really so different to <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_rings.html" title="Lord of the rings">this?</a> And in response to the question of how one can be a, "professional e-wrestler;" the answer is simple. A fictional charcter who's profession is wrestling. What's not real about that? <b>Nebzilla.</b><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Nebzilla (<a href="../../../n/e/b/User_talk%7ENebzilla_aa07.html" title="User talk:Nebzilla">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nebzilla_c81b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nebzilla">contribs</a>) 15:43, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li>The main reason isn't that it is fiction, the main reason is that it isn't notable, thus doesn't meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> nor is it verifiable as there are no third party sources and thus it doesn't meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<ul>
<li>When one first chooses to consider that which is notable, one should invariably take account of the facts and figures. www.hiwsuperstars.com is a veritable hive of activity. At this precise moment, there are 22 (13 members and 9 guests) people viewing the forums on which the fiction is written. Notably, 9 guests. Third parties. The naming of something as objectively notable poses a difficult question, but perhaps I can argue a favourable answer in Matt Essex's case. Quantitively, The Archives (which contain most things over six months old) are 30gb's in total. This I think you will agree is a notable collection of work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 11,593 threads viewable on the forums. Once again, I think it would be folly to denote such a figure as not being notable. There are 499 registered members to the forums. This does not include traffic to and from the website by non-members. There are non-members who in fact come to the forums on a weekly basis to read the wrestling shows put up by those who write them, so much so in fact that for a number of months HIW incorporated a ratings system into its News sub forum to keep track of how popular it in fact was.</p>
<p>Before this was removed, HIW scored a 7.1 rating on its last Pay Per View Event (Fictional, of course, and thus free to view). By the forum moderators calculations for rating events, the total score is found by taking the number of hits during the day of posting (bear in mind the shows are available, and actively viewed, for a number of days thereafter) and dividing it by 1000. That means 7,100 views of a single show in a single day. That again would have to be, by a person of sound mind, considered a notable achievement. This should also assuage your concern of there being no third-party sources. Those who are in no way actively involved in the production or competition aspects of the product presented view the product presented regardless.</p>
<p>HIW's name and purpose furthermore do not coincide with any other entries, or indeed possible entries, as High Impact Wrestling is an original and innovative RPG e-community of which there have been several notable spin-offs (including OTB -<a href="http://otb.booyah.net/efed-" class="external free" title="http://otb.booyah.net/efed-" rel="nofollow">http://otb.booyah.net/efed-</a> and XW2 -www.wrestlingdistrict.com/forums) over the five years it has been action. Chronologically, one would have to suggest five years of operation is a notable length of time for a non-profit organisation dedicated to encouraging the literary creativity of the wrestling fan.</p>
<p>To use the ongoing example of Lord Of The Rings, I believe the point Matt was trying to make is not that HIW is as popular per se as Lord Of The Rings, but rather that it is chiefly literary fantasy, enjoyed by all who read it. I might remind Englishrose that The Lord Of The Rings is not a popular series of films, rather a popular series of books, of which the films were spin-offs. Again, a philosophical point can be taken from this- one authors work is considered notable, while the work of hundreds of authors is not, viewed by literally thousands, is not. Notability I assume is not relative. Ergo, it is considered presently to equalise the balance. The number of viewings experienced by the average author for a single piece of work might be 26, bear in mind these pieces are approximately 1/200th of the length of one Lord Of The Rings book. Multiply 26 by 200 and one gets 5,200. Proportionately then, while not as popular by any means, one would still reach the conclusion that it is indeed notable.</p>
<p>Verily I am perplexed by the fervour with which the opposition petitions for this pages deletion. After all, philosophically at least, this is supposed to be an encyclopaedia for the people, by the people. How would anyone hope to overcome ignorance of anything if the repositories of knowledge did not contain information that which one seeks. Gravity was once but an apple in Isaac Newton’s eye. Evolution, in Darwin’s. If he had been opposed to vigorously by those who disdain that which is unfamiliar to the point of requesting its removal from tomes of knowledge, scientific advancements would have been terribly stunted. Meanwhile, the creativity, innovation, advancement and achievement of generations both young and old as channelled through a specific medium (wrestling) is being shunned as being unworthy of representation herein. It seems in conclusion that the deletion of this page would move against the fundamental precepts upon which the site is based, merely because of a subjective sense of practicality.</p>

<li>Typing in "HIW e-fed" brings up HIW as the first and second search results on Google. Typing simply e-fed it is the seventh result. Typing in "High Impact Wrestling" (it is important for the protesting author to realise that HIW is infact an acronym) it is half way down page two. On Alexa: "HIW e-fed" brings up HIW as its first result. Simply "e-fed" the seventh result. Typing in "High Impact Wrestling" it is two thirds of the way down the second page. "HIWsuperstars" finds HIW the first result on both engines. Ergo, your search was the problem. It is important for the protesting author to note the needs of the community that use and view the product. There are literally thousands of e-feds on the net, and thus anyone using Google or Alexa would not search for the letters "HIW" they would search for "e-fed" and whereupon they searched for "e-fed" they would undoubtedly find HIW among the first results.</li>

<p><b>Strong Delete</b>: This is ridiculous and as a former player of PBeM and PBM wrestling games this is just blatant self promotion. An e-Fed caters to a very specific cross section of people and is not notable by any means.

<li>Again, call me biased, but to be fair being a "former player" of anything doesn't justify what's essentially just an assumption. Regardless of what's apparently so "blatant;" the first of the three pages in question to be created was actually Matt Essex. Thus I feel inclined to ask how it is exactly that one promotes, not an efed, but an efed character? Hopefully your answer clarifies my point, because, you see, the idea, in essence, is to document the character's history and thus give a real-life example of an actual efedding character as well as how that character and any other efedding character's career can indeed develop. As for the page for <a href="../../../h/i/w/HIW_2755.html" title="HIW">HIW</a> itself, as far as I'm aware, the same thing applies. It provides the example, documents the history, etc etc. Topping that, considering the uniqueness of the fed in itself, I'd say it's somewhat worthy of being classed as "of note." Nevertheless, anything anywhere can be regarded as not being "of note." I could easily say that as an example, The Lord Of The Rings doesn't quite appeal to everyone, because in all honesty, it doesn't. Sadly, in the case of the support, it's quite unfortunate that apparently as long as the deletion of a page is the initial outlook, no amount of convincing and/or opinion will suffice. <b>Nebzilla.</b><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Nebzilla (<a href="../../../n/e/b/User_talk%7ENebzilla_aa07.html" title="User talk:Nebzilla">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nebzilla_c81b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nebzilla">contribs</a>) 22:07, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</small>
<ul>
<li>It is self promotion because it is patently forgettable knowledge. Like most roleplaying genre's it is not really important to have an example of the game. Regardless of how popular a Dungeons and Dragons game gets, we do not need an article detailing a character and the time period. As popular as a Minds Eye Theatre game could be Wikipedia doesnt need a detailed article about the setting and the characters. It is simply not necessary. I would yield what unwritten guidelines have been established about other roleplaying games, It is not about any specific game it is all about the genre and maybe you can put your name on a list. Otherwise this is merely complete juvenile arrogance.</li>
<li>And as for how it is self promotion. Basically this is the same thing as a "vanity pressing" of a book. While the book was indeed published and the like, its sole purpose is mental masturbation for the author. This is basically the same thing, Mental masturbation. Keep this out of Wikipedia and on a bio webpage where it belongs. If you want this to stand up to the test I am going to start requesting respectable secondary sources to back up all of these claims. <a href="../../../n/e/g/User%7ENegroSuave_0441.html" title="User:NegroSuave">NegroSuave</a> 17:02, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>One would hasten of course to argue that masturbation, as a form of pleasurable physical exercise, and in this case of the mental variety, is the singular function of wikipedia. To exercise ones mind by broadening ones basis of knowledge through research. Ergo, such a phrase does not accurately describe the actions of the pages author as either reprehisible or reprimandable. As for a reputable secondary source, I had no clue Matt Essex had a page on wikipedia and was in no way involved in its construction, yet I have visited it and learned many useful things on it which I have gone on to use in writings of my own. This page has been a useful resource to all who have viewed it, and an encyclopaedia should want nothing more than that. <b>Rob.</b></li>

<li>The High Impact Wrestling e-federation does not have 5000 active members, this is true. It may not even have 5000 active viewers. These may be the guidelines, but is it too much to ask for the powers that be here to look at the world of e-fedding in context? It has been pointed out, I believe, on the e-fed page on Wikipedia itself also, that an e-fed typically lasts around a few months before disappearing into the void. As an e-fedder on and off for something like five years I think it is fair to say that the reason this is the case is that a lot of e-feds are poorly designed, poorly staffed and hardly dedicated institutions. I think that is also fair to argue that High Impact Wrestling is the opposite to these things as it maintains a stunningly professional etiquette resulting in, for a literate wrestling fan, outstandingly constructed shows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason HIW deserves a Wikipedia page is because in a declining world of e-fedding it is, you must agree, a beacon. While it does not have 5000 members like a guideline might wish it did, it <i>is</i> a place that is worthy of note for the maybe hundreds of english-speaking e-fedders that exist and sift through the poor quality piles of feds. It <i>is</i> almost undeniably the only e-fed that can state it has been operating for five years and will not close down; that is has and is breeding <i>writers</i> through fair competition rarely seen in the e-fed world. In its context, High Impact Wrestling is the most notable of its breed.</p>
<p>I quote a colleague when I say if "E-wrestling itself deserves to have a Wikipedia page ... so does perhaps the most popular and detailed example of that hobby." Are the guidelines so tight to deny this logic?</p>

<li>As an e-fedder, I should hope that you would be sympathetic to such a cause of this. After all, I presume that before you stated your objection you first viewed the forums, whereupon you as an e-fedder would certainly have had to realise that the overwhelming number of arguments already made in this particular cases defense are justification enough for the site to be granted representation herein. If the nomination to delete the pages is made purely on the basis of it causing "arguments" I would remind the protesting author that the discourses undertaken here are strictly discussions. I would further seek to remind the author that without such discussions, no protest could be made for those which rightfully deserve to be here. The absolutionist approach your nomination implies is most worrisome for a peer-edited encyclopaedia. Using the grounds of silencing those whose vase is legitimate for the sake of ease seems counterintuitive to the aims of the site.</li>

<li>irrelevant? to what? to whom? you? isn't that subjectivity? and isn't the point of making wikipedia a user-maintained community to facilitate many perspectives on things? (this being a perfect example) and as for poorly-written, you should really read the material in question before making sweeping statements like that. I assure you that in HIW, some of the writers are quite exceptional in character-driven dialogue. you may disagree, you don't like it, fine, we all understand that. however there are plenty of people who do. does it harm you (or in fact, any single person in the whole universe) to allow these pages to exist? if the answer is yes I question your mental stability, if the answer is no then what the bloody hell are we arguing about? this whole campaign for deletion just strikes me as utterly arbitrary, as many often say "we weren't hurting anyone" metaphysical 00:15, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I take offense to poorly written. One would do well to actually read the arguments heretofore stated before questioning the quality of the writing with which the objectors state their side. Furthermore, it has not at any point been stated that the quality of writing on any page included on wikipedia must meet a certain 'verbose' criterion, though I am fairly sure that the current author could easily make such a bar. If I may draw your attention a fact earlier raised though not in the same context, it perplexes the current author how precisely one would go about stroking the ego of a fictional character. Equally, if only to match the pedantry of your objection, the page and its contents all make perfect sense. Any failure to percieve such sense would be surely the fault only of the protesting author. A quandry to state then that what is poorly written is beyond the protesting authors comprehension? Perhaps one should be more reserved with ones sweeping statements when first you decide to make them against a respectable and legitimate use of this page.</li>

<p>Personally, as an e-fedder, I feel this has a right to be here. And why? This is an encyclopedia, and this simply gives a clear view of what the word "conflict" is due to the commotion. It is a valuable information source. Also, to understand that Matt Essex is not real, people must have been reading to the bottom. This shows it has been made in a clear interesting manner and is a valuable information source to show the talents of e-fedders in a unique interesting way.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Some quick searches turned up other newspaper stories about Mr. Cranky, one of which is <a href="http://www.highbeam.com/library/doc0.asp?DOCID=1G1:67604715&amp;num=1&amp;ctrlInfo=Round19%3AMode19a%3ASR%3AResult&amp;ao=&amp;FreePremium=BOTH" class="external text" title="http://www.highbeam.com/library/doc0.asp?DOCID=1G1:67604715&amp;num=1&amp;ctrlInfo=Round19%3AMode19a%3ASR%3AResult&amp;ao=&amp;FreePremium=BOTH" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Unfortunately, most old newspaper stories require payment to access, so it's hard to get enough details to verify whether or not it's "nontrivial." Although I would submit that being written about by the New York Times is essentially nontrivial by definition. <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,37353-0.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,37353-0.html" rel="nofollow">Here's</a> a set of audio interviews with Mr. Cranky (real name Jason Katzman) in Wired, although it's from 2000 and the MP3 links are broken. There seem to be a lot of other random brief articles and mentions, as well (Google "Jason Katzman" "cranky"); enough that I think the quantity would help make up for whatever "triviality" they possess.</li>

<dd>What if the article was about Jason Katzman instead, or about Cranky-as-person rather than Cranky-as-website? There are plenty of far more trivial web-content-only articles on Wikipedia that have as much or less notability than Mr. Cranky (a number of webcomics, for example).

<p>Reason why the page should be deleted Sturgeonslawyer 19:10, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm recommending this and several related articles for deletion as they seem to me to be advertisements for the products of the Dyson company. Prior to making this recommendation, I searched for articles about similar products, such as Hoover and Electrolux vacuum cleaners, to see if these articles were in line with Wiki community standards. They do not seem to be.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon this article by accident, playing with the "random article" button. The full list of articles I intend to recommend for deletion include the articles on the <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dyson_DC01_e36f.html" title="Dyson DC01">Dyson DC01</a>, <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dyson_DC02_2e13.html" title="Dyson DC02">Dyson DC02</a>, <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dyson_DC14_73f9.html" title="Dyson DC14">Dyson DC14</a>, <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dyson_DC15_7f08.html" title="Dyson DC15">Dyson DC15</a>, and Dyson G Force.

<dd><b>Comment</b> If you google as "Elizabeth Sallay" instead of Beth you do find a large number of entries for an "uncredited" performer in a variety of TV and film projects. Looks like IMDB has her cleaned out (they have a listing for her but no credits) but all sorts of other sites have her as a performer in all kinds of things. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 20:15, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just how do you think such results counts as respectable sources for the central claims in the article: that she (a) did not actually perform in these projects, and (b) herself fradulently added her name to various sources?

<dd>I'm not aware of anyone other than you claiming fraud... and that is a very serious legal charge. I'd be interested in your sources for the facts stated in the article being fraud if true. I've reread the article, and don't find any claim of fraud at all, much less as the central point. But the laws may be different in your country.</dd>
<dd><b>Keep</b>. There is legitimate question of whether or not it is wikipedia material (as I have said before), however the reasons for the deletion (the facts being wrong) are bogus. IMDB cleaned her out because the credits were fake. I personally have [As Henning is very well aware] given a talk on the effect here last year. (By the way , my page here gives the reason that <b>I</b> didn't write a page on the effect, commentary that has been there since last year) But I don't think that there is any reaonable doubt that it was a hoax. (And obviously IMDB didn't think there was doubt either either.) And there is the common sense point that the filming of several of the movies were in geographic different areas at the same time...&#160;:) And a look at the parts Henning alleges may be some specific "real bit part actor" clearly don't look like each other. Disclaimer: I've been following the project for years with great humor, and know her personally, so my opinion is biased. <a href="../../../n/a/h/User%7ENahaj_bfe3.html" title="User:Nahaj">Nahaj</a> 03:09, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The facts may or may not be bogus. The problem is that they seem to be unverifiable. Can you provide any citations or publications to support the story?

<li>I'm afraid Lexis/Nexis doesn't come up with anything, suggesting the phenomenon is possibly not notable and definitely not verifiable.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think many people might regard it as notable, if it could be verified. Certainly we've seen a lot of suspicious "uncredited" credits on aspiring actors. Maybe if she can document and publish her results, the story would get picked up, and this could legitimately be recreated. Looks like it fails both notability and verifiability right now. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 16:10, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Keep</b>. I am obviously in favor of keeping it but I think the topic needs more research. I would like to get a response from some of the sites, and including imdb, who have plagarized this info and see their view but I doubt they would be willing to do so. I plan on doing a write-up and possibly posting it on Wikipedia again. FYI, if there is any doubt that I actually did this, yes, my name is uncommon so there isn't another 'Elizabeth Sallay'; actress I am attempting to libel. It's not difficult to do this via imdb either as I have added some of my friends to various movie projects, also as 'uncredited' and their listing has yet to be pulled.

<p>I was going to try to clean this article up but, reading through, realized the entire article is conjecture based on what the article readily admits is a failed attempt by a handful of student councils and if I deleted the crystall-ballism, there would be nothing left of the article. MagnoliaLeague.com, from which most of this is based, is a sort of hypothetical fantasy site which loudly states it's under construction. This seems like a semi-vanity article for promoting the premise of the Magnolia League, and perhaps the website, indirectly.

<p>This article is a mixture of biography and likely slander. It might possibly be saved, but the subject may not be considered notable enough for Wikipedia. It was put up for speedy deletion, but this was contested on the discussion page. No vote. <a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadfium_9104.html" title="User:Gadfium">gadfium</a> 22:14, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I definitely think D'Agata should be considered "notable." He's simply a brilliant writer, and has made important contributions to creative nonfiction. At best, he's often credited with inventing the "lyric essay" (this isn't true; it's a form with a long tradition, but the fact that the misattribution is so prevalent [read a profile of him that <i>doesn't</i> mention it] is testament to his role in renewing the essay as literature. At worst, he's won major awards (a PEN) and regularly travels the country because he's in demand as a lecturer, workshopper, and general bright young thing. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.56.250.181 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.56.250.181_3f60.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.56.250.181">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> This "theorem" is something one would expect any high-school student to derive in a moment, and if they're at all mathematically inclined, one would expect them to have figured it out without ever having heard it mentioned. <b>Some</b> things that are simple and obvious deserve articles (e.g., the "law of trichotomy", because one can consider in which structures it holds and in which it does not, etc.). But this is not of that sort. Would the author of this article please tell us who "Soni" is? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 23:17, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This is a rather simple observation, that contrary to the article author's claims, is in fact used widely outside of the Art of Problem Solving community. In fact, it is a most basic theorem of arithmetic progressions. The fact that it was used in a Duke Math Meet is not notable. Nor is the fact that I derived this theorem years ago and used it in a class. Perhaps most importantly, I have studied number theory (formally and informally), and I have never run across this fact being referred to as "Soni's theorem". Perhaps Soni was some ancient mathematician who stated this theorem somehow without the benefit of say, mathematical symbols, or in any case, long enough ago that this was some kind of breakthrough. But I doubt it. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 23:23, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wikipedia is not a dictionary, or a usage or jargon guide. Wikipedia articles are not:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dictionary definitions. Because Wikipedia is not a dictionary, please do not create an entry merely to define a term. An article should usually begin with a good definition; if you come across an article that is nothing more than a definition, see if there is information you can add that would be appropriate for an encyclopedia. An exception to this rule is for articles about the cultural meanings of individual numbers.</li>
<li>Lists of such definitions. There are, however, disambiguation pages consisting of pointers to other pages; these are used to clarify differing meanings of a word. Wikipedia also includes glossary pages for various specialized fields.</li>
<li>A usage guide, or slang and idiom guide. Wikipedia is not in the business of saying how words, idioms, etc., should be used. We aren't teaching people how to talk like a Cockney chimney-sweep. However, it may be important in the context of an encyclopedia article to describe just how a word is used in order to distinguish among similar, easily confused ideas, as in nation or freedom. In some special cases an article about an essential piece of slang may be appropriate.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It covers not just terms but also elements of strategies, various glitches, and things of the like; it probably should be expanded to something like "fighting game general terms and strategies" though... right now as far as stuff like strategy content goes, it's just the basic level of it all (IE things like wavedashing are generally used as parts of strategies, but alone aren't technically a "strategy"). In short: keep, but expand it to include more than just terms at the basic level... also try to keep it from game-specific examples, and more towards things that are common or are existant in a number of fighting games.
