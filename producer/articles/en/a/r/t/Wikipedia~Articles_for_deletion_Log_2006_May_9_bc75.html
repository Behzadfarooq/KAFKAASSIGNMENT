<p>I think this AfD is premature and should have been preceded by a Verify tag to give editors, who are probably not familiar with all the Wiki procedures, a chance to provide substantiation.

<p>It seems most people's problem with the list is the fact that it says 'nymphet and faunlet'... if it was strictly the POV they were worried about, they'd've also tagged the list of sex symbols and other 'POV' lists... but go ahead, delete it.</p>
<p>A lot of the people on this list are not children, either. Many of them also appear on the list for sex symbols66.181.234.82 01:20, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>What is the statute of limitations on trying an AFD again? Looking at the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_sex_symbols_4246.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of sex symbols">List of Sex Symbols AFD</a>, the vote was 10-7 in favor of deletion. Of the 7 voting to keep the list, four said that it needed to be trimmed substantially. It hasn't. Two of the keeps gave silly reasons. I guess technically 10-7 could be said to be no consensus ... but honestly, not too much has been done to improve the list and it, too, says that it is a subjective list so I would say it doesn't belong here either. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 01:37, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That is true in most cases, I don't go around calling my peers nymphet and faunlet, but I did just read Nabokov for class, and thought it would be interesting to make a list. I see now people are making a much bigger thing of it than I meant for it to be... I was just a bored teenager who put together a list with people my age and older after reading Lolita. Geez, I didn't know: 1. that people would take offense to it and think I was some pedophile, and 2. That wikiedia was ruputed as a pedophile thing... bad editing, yes, but not a pedophile thing. So, I agree that it should be deleted, because I in no way meant for the list to be that, and since it is being taken that way, I don't want to unneccesarilly offend any one else, so please DELETE it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.181.234.82 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.181.234.82.html" title="User talk:66.181.234.82">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.181.234.82_11c7.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.181.234.82">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>nn slang term, used in Persian, which the article admits is mainly used by an underground band in Iran, and would appear to be very recent. This I think would not be particularly notable, as Iran is a conservative theocracy and an underground rock band would probably only be known to a few people who go against the conservative orthodoxy, which most likely strongly disapporves of such music. Also, the band has a website with no alexa rank, so I am dubioiuis of their influence on pop culture.<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">ßlηguγΣη</span></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> - <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Blnguyen_21c3.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Blnguyen">review me</a> 01:01, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, it has been greatly improved. This is a very popular mod and therefore should be allowed to stay. I dont see this as advertising or vanity.

<dd>Depth of the article is not a criteria for deletion or inclusion. I could write ten pages about my neighbor's dog and it still wouldn't be worth including.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I nominated this article because that's all he is: a former mayor of a mid-sized city. There's nothing notable about him otherwise (attracting an unaffiliated low minor baseball team?). This nom isn't about the worthiness of the City of Lancaster or the verifiability(?) of his former position. He's just a guy who was a mayor once.

<dd>You really think it's possible to be the mayor of a mid-sized city for six years and not do anything? Come on. The article itself spells out several accomplishments, and it's easy to find more. He was a WWII pilot who survived for 4 months behind enemy lines after being shot down over Germany, and was finally captured and held in a POW camp before escaping in 1945. He also wasn't elected out as mayor: he resigned so he could serve as Pennsylvania’s adjutant general. He easily passes WP:BIO. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 20:18, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>You really think it's possible to be the mayor of a mid-sized city for six years and not do anything</i>: Yes I do. Quick what's the mayor of Toledo done in his term? Who knows and who cares outside of Toledo. My point is being a mayor shouldn't be an automatic notability qualification. With that said: the sum of all the tidbits you unearthed makes a rather interesting fellow. Too bad the article in its current state doesn't reflect that.

<dd>If you think the mayor of a city of 650,000 people just sits around in a sash that says "MAYOR" on it and gives oversized novelty souvenir keys to visiting superheroes, you're wrong. The <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carty_Finkbeiner_1b10.html" title="Carty Finkbeiner">current mayor of Toledo</a> has an article which lists quite a few accomplishments and controversies, including overseeing Toledo's larlgest building boom in history. He's so popular with voters that, since by law he can't serve 3 consecutive terms, he sat out for a term and got re-elected for a third term afterwards. Just think: as mayor of a city of 650,000 people, how many people know his name? How many times has he been mentioned in the newspaper? How many times has he been on the front page? How big a section will he get in local history books? How many people work for the city, and thus directly or indirectly work for him? How many billions of dollars of public funds does he manage? How many streets, bridges, and buildings are named after him? How many people, every day of their lives, are effected one way or another by the decisions he makes in office? And after all that, think again whether he's worth a kilobyte or two of article space on Wikipedia. The answer, I would think, should be obvious. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 21:17, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> endorses "Major local political figures who receive significant press coverage". I haven't checked, but I would imagine a mayor would have significant press coverage at least during his term in office. He's also a member of the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs’ Hall of Fame. He was also a Major General, which to me, is significant in and of itself. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:43, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not arguing this particular article anymore. I've been convinced. There's more to him than this article states. As far as "major local political figures": I guess I don't interpret that the same as you. To me that means a political figure of a major municipality OR a local politician that through some news event (positive or negative) has transcended their local sphere of influence. I don't feel the need to write up articles about <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Ttb&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&amp;q=%22juanita+crabb%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Ttb&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&amp;q=%22juanita+crabb%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Juanita Crabb</a> or other <a href="http://www.newschannel34.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=D24773A2-53D8-428F-A9A0-679398A15949" class="external text" title="http://www.newschannel34.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=D24773A2-53D8-428F-A9A0-679398A15949" rel="nofollow">former mayors</a> of my hometown.

<dd>The <a href="../../../t/o/l/Toledo%2C_Ohio_6371.html" title="Toledo, Ohio">Toledo, Ohio</a> article cites a metro area population of 659,188. I'm glad you've been convinced of Scott's notability. Oh, and one last thing: the "major local political figures" part of WP:BIO doesn't apply here: it's from the section on living persons, while Scott has been dead since January 2005.

<li><b>Delete</b> There are no press releases from CERN or anything to verify the contents of the article, nor is the article even self consistent. If the wavelength of these rays varies from 10^-18 cm to 10^-13 cm, then the frequency range should be 3x10^23 Hz to 3x10^28 Hz.

<p>This "article" is a simple definition, and of a Japanese term at that, which links from a list of Japanese sex terms that is itself probably a good candidate for deletion. There's already an article at <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">handjob</a>, and this article is beyond POV.

<dd>A comment on redirection. First, if we're to redirect <i>tekoki</i> we should redirect it to <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">handjob</a> (which is what it means), not to masturbation (which isn't the same thing). Second, I'm not convinced it needs redirecting at all. After all, this is the English Wikipedia. Why would anyone do a search on the Japanese word for "handjob"? By that rationale, we should include a redirect for words in every language. It's unnecessary, especially since there are already interlanguage links on the articles. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 22:43, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was asked to provide a reasoning behind my decision, so here goes: 1. If I count&#160;!votes I get roughly 21 dels, 13 keeps, that's a 60% majority for deleting, but really in no man's land between no consensus (ca. 50%) and rough consensus (ca. 67%). 2. The policy on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is very much in flux over whether glossaries are exemptions to the <i>Not a dictionary</i> provision. Unless there is consensus to strike the exemption I prefer to stick with the status quo ante (still reflected in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a>), which is that glossaries are acceptable. 3. Most importantly, the content of the article changed significantly in the last days of the debate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Japanese_sex_terms&amp;diff=88041477&amp;oldid=87583928" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Japanese_sex_terms&amp;diff=88041477&amp;oldid=87583928" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> thanks mostly to edits by <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">User:JJay</a>, and this change was reflected in a number of delete→keep changes and late keep&#160;!votes, so the early "delete not sourced"&#160;!votes are no longer on solid factual ground. Taking these three factors into account I did not see that consensus for deletion was established. This is a no consensus closure though so it can be renominated anytime. I recommend waiting three to four weeks for the policy debate to be settled and to see if the article improves, and consider renomination then. But of course I might be wrong, and that's what we have <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> for. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 22:25, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If you are using the definition of encyclopedic as "an alphabetical organization of fields of knowledge" then you are being pedantic. It is not suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia, no matter how much it tries to fit a dictionary definition of encyclopedic. It is not a collection of verifiable facts. If you are saying that it is, then I respectfully think you are wrong and agree to disagree.</li>
<li>If you are suggesting that articles, without sources, that are little more than stubs, that have existed in the same state for months, are verifiable, do you mean theoretically? Because, theoretically, <i>anything</i> is verifiable to some people.

<dd>Okay, apart from being demonstratably not an inclusionist (I've compared my AfD votes and it's pretty clear I'm a "centrist" on the issue - my keep arguments for articles that are deleted are a percentage of my keep arguments that equal to the percentage of my delete arguments where the article is kept) I'll show what the problem is when you vote to delete an article without first reading it.</dd>
<dd>If an article is appropriate for an encyclopaedia, but not for "the spirit of an encyclopaedia" then voting to delete it clearly fails <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Rather than make value judgements about whether I particularly like a topic or not, I apply <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia, she ain't paper</a> and ask merely "Is it encyclopaedic?" - here even you admit the answer is yes, so I'll move on.</dd>
<dd>I'll ask <i>is it sourced?</i> For this article, the answer is <b>yes</b> - clearly it's important to read the article to determine whether or not it's sourced. Merely guessing can result in the wrong answer. Being sourced (such as this article is) brings the advantage of a vaguely NPOV test of notability - someone else has found it notable enough to document - this is (I believe) a much more NPOV test than <i>Do I personally find this article interesting?</i> <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:47, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd just like to note that people aren't providing reasons for their "keep" votes. It's not enough to say it's encyclopaedic, particularly when so many have argued that it's inherently <i>unencyclopaedic.</i> While items <i>on</i> the list may be verifiable, that still doesn't provide a convincing rationale for keeping the list itself, as mentioned in the original post. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 17:05, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is not a slang dictionary, or even a regular dictionary. A big list of words and definitions beside them is called a dictionary.

<li><b>Keep</b> a precise list of terms on a given specific subject is authorized by policy. Terms such as bukkake, gokkun etc. are extremely well known and verifiable through tons of sources. I don't even understand the objection on that score. The nom seems to be questioning the <i>raison d'etre</i> of this list. Well, for better or worse, Japan and sex have been tightly intertwined in the western imagination since at least the 19th century. The interest in Japanese erotica is thus not new and is today a serious subject for critical examination and scholarship <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Japanese+erotica+&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Japanese+erotica+&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. The vast popularity of specific Japanese porn genres in the west is just a later-day manifestation of the previous craze for Japanese erotic prints.

<li><b>Comment</b>. If this list is going to survive, what is listed on it needs to be very closely monitored. The fact so little of this article's definitions are unique to Japan is a big part of the problem with it. Very little of what was listed is unique to Japan - it simply defines a Japanese word for something which goes on all over the world. This is a deeper problem with Wiki wearby numerous topics of little or no note are documented in great depth, but let's not get into that here. So, what is of note out of the article? Just up to H, I'd argue that at least half of what is currently there is not in anyway unique to Japan and merely serves as a DicDef.
<ul>
<li>Bukkake: A Japanese invention - worthy of inclusion</li>
<li>Chikan: Not unique to Japan - of little note. However, has a long and meandering article (lifting large sections from Rotton.com as a source) suggesting otherwise...</li>
<li>Ecchi: Links to the article for the English letter H. A foreign slang word for sex - of little note</li>
<li>Enjo kosai: The Japanese term for underage prostitution - at a strech worthy of inclusion</li>
<li>Futanari: Japanese for hermaphrodites - of little note</li>
<li>Fuzoku: Defined as meaning "sex culture" in Japanese Doesn't have an article. Of little note.</li>
<li>Gokkun: A genre of Japanese porn. Worthy of inclusion</li>
<li>Hentai: Defined as "pervert." This is a much wider part of sex culture, so worthy of inclusion</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> -- I voted to delete this before, but I've changed my mind, because the article is in different shape now. Wikipedia is not a dictionary, but these are not simply translations of English phrases into Japanese but rather a completely different beast: sociological phenomena of sexuality in Japan, explained, and with articles about (most of) them. This could maybe use a renaming of some kind, but this list is cut down to the essentials and is encyclopedic. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a> and you'll see that this kind of list is much like other kinds of lists given there. I can't help but think that many of the people who endorse deletion under the dictionary argument haven't noticed these points, but rather noticed the "list of ... terms" and didn't like the article concept. So like I said, maybe renaming is a good idea, but I'm not sure to what. Still, this goes well beyond mere "terms." <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:39, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree: just because the word 'Kreis' has a capital letter in German doesn't raise the circle of Wagner enthusiasts to any sort of movement. Let me reemphasize: these enthusiasts did <b>not</b> have a 'great cultural impact on the age', <b>nor were they</b> 'a notable German historical phenomenon'.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I have no specific opinion on whether it is in fact true that the circle had any notable effect - but the existence of scholarly literature such as that cited above indicates that such an idea exists out there and that the term has currency.

<dd><b>Comment</b> This is the problem Eusebeus is pointing out. Someone writes a book with 'The Bayreuth Circle' in the title, to describe a social / political / cultural milieu, someone else puts it on WP as a formal body (it even has an organisation-stub tag, would you believe), and then its kept because there's a published title (in a language many of us don't read). Suddenly Winifred Wagner's music evenings have become the precursor to the SA. Utterly nonsensical. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiddy_078f.html" title="User:Squiddy">Squiddy</a> | <a href="../../../s/q/u/User_talk%7ESquiddy_b0de.html" title="User talk:Squiddy"><small>(squirt ink?)</small></a> 19:05, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

I won't revert your edits without a bit more consensus, since that would be just an edit war, but I hope there is something you could do other than delete my and others' work. By the way, the Bnai Brith you have left with the wonderful comment "does not, as has been claimed by a previous editor of this article, mention the 'Bayreuth Circle'." contains the text: "Richard’s wife Cosima Lizst, the daughter of composer Franz Lizst, was also a vicious antisemite, and after his death in 1893 she consolidated a Bayreuth Circle which attracted such antisemites as racist writer H.S.

<dd>Re the references - I deliberately removed the German references. Neither I - nor anyone who has contributed - knows what these say. Someone picked up two reference titles from [www.copac.ac.uk] or somewhere, with articles in two obscure German periodicals, not exactly available through your local library. And how many English readers of Wikipedia could read thme, even if they could find them? English articles should show English sources, as a matter of principle - if none are available it's a sign of weakness of the article topic. sorry about the so-called 'Bnei Brith' quote - write in haste, repent at leisure. The quote is actually from a review of the autobiography of Wagner's self-hating grandson, and cannot count strongly as a powerful citation for the topic. I still think the article should be deleted, btw. --Smerus 06:52, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You actually removed 3 references, in English, that I put in, including 2 with quotes, from university sites. Please look at the "your edit" link I put in above.

You're quite right that I haven't read the German references, but per <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, we need to assume that the editor who put them in has.

<ul>
<li><b>Acad Ronin</b>: I am the creator of the article/stub. I posted a longer reply to Folajimi on their talk page. My key point is that I can see no value to throwing away factual, documented information. This lead to the article cited could benefit someone researching Indians in East Africa, the impact of the Zanzibar Revolution on the ethnic make-up of Zanzibar, or its economy, and a variety of other topics. The source article is a chapter in an obscure book and I only found it after years of keeping an eye out for any info on Jetha Lila for some work I am doing on the history of foreign banks in East Africa. What makes Wikipedia valuable is not the articles on well-known topics. That information is readily available in many places. It is the information that specialists and hobbyists post on arcana that is Wikipedia's unique contribution. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcad_Ronin_ad22.html" title="User:Acad Ronin">Acad Ronin</a> (<a href="../../../a/c/a/User_talk%7EAcad_Ronin_ff27.html" title="User talk:Acad Ronin">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Acad_Ronin_d0c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Acad Ronin">contribs</a>).</small></li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Acad Ronin</b>: If you are concerned about verifiability, read the source article. The author based it on field and archival research in Zanzibar. The reason I was looking for more info re Jetha Lila was because the name of the bank and the fact that it was a private bank of Indian origin had shown up in various directories of banks, and in a scholarly article of banking in East Asia. As for notability, I reiterate my point that almost by definition there is a surfeit of information on notable topics. One of the things I like about Wikipedia is that for instance I can look up almost any US Navy vessel by name or number, and find a capsule history, contributed by someone who is a ship geek, just as I am a bank geek. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcad_Ronin_ad22.html" title="User:Acad Ronin">Acad Ronin</a> (<a href="../../../a/c/a/User_talk%7EAcad_Ronin_ff27.html" title="User talk:Acad Ronin">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Acad_Ronin_d0c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Acad Ronin">contribs</a>).</small>

(Anyone in the United States who is affiliated with any College or University, or has a library card at a public library has either direct or indirect (via the librarian) access to WorldCat.) I have done this, and the work cited does exist.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I have added a second source to the article. This source is what sent me off on the hunt for further information as it only mentions the bank's existence and its being an Indian private bank in Zanzibar. As for the main reference, the Tominaga article, I just went back to WorldCat and it is available from 39+ libraries, including more than thirty in the US.

Much of the battle over the notability of subjects in Wikipedia article is won or lost in the first sentence of the article; that's why it's best to start with a sentence that clearly defines the subject, hence: <i>Jetha Lila was a private bank founded in Zanzibar in 1880.</i> --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillC_d650.html" title="User:BillC">BillC</a> 18:35, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>strong keep</b>, I think its quite absurd to have to debate this. Making this sort of information accessible is precisely what Wikipedia is for. Further, I'd like to make the point that the original referrer's objection is uninformed, and I will run through the correct procedure because I've seen this error more than once recently. The article came to AfD because he couldnt 'verify notability'. I can't verify the notability of a lot of things, but as long as I read the content of the article, I know the (unverified) subject of the article is notable. I then observe the references, and know that the content of the article is verifiable. I <i>dont</i> combine the two steps. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 07:17, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think you mean civil, not civilised. Nevertheless, if I have somehow offended you, I apologise.

Once again, there are specific 'cutoffs' for notability for educational institutions and academics and bands and so on; but for something of this sort, where a strong argument for notability - namely, control over the finances of a sovereign state - are clearly set out in the article, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is satisfied and the problem reduces simply to one of verifiability. Given the provision of references that satisfy the reliable source test, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is met as well.

<dd>Thank you for your comment, I truly appreciate it. I am very familiar with Russell's Paradox. Did you read what I just stated above? Russell's Paradox is based off the assumption that the set of all sets can not contain itself because the power set of the set of all sets must be bigger than the set of all sets itself. However, this is incorrect and the reason is because Russell did not know or did not realize that the size of the set of all sets is 1/0, and there can be no greater number. Thus the power set of the set of all sets is no bigger than the set of all sets itself, and thankfully, this means that the set of all sets can contain itself. In turn this means that the set of all sets which do not contain themselves may be defined as the empty set, for in reality everything is self-containing and it must be so since there is no greater number than 1/0. Hopefully this clears up the confusion.Bossk2 20:12, 9 May 2006 (UTC)bossk2
<dl>
<dd>No. It isn't. Russell's paradox makes absolutely no reference to power sets. Russell's paradox is merely that a set defined as "The set of all sets that do not contain themselves" is not well-defined. That's it. No power sets, no cardinality, no infinities, and certainly no need to talk about the magnitude of 1/0.</dd>

<li>I strongly respectfully object because it is clear that the empty set is what is defined as undefined, not the compete set, 1/0. This is plainly evident to anybody who can open their eyes to the inherent definitions of these concepts and thus it is not original research. Furthermore WP:NFT is a category I do not understand because it implies that important realizations can not happen to anyone at any given moment, by serendipitous or other fortuitous means. Additionally, the way that you have put 1/0 in quotation marks with two question marks after seems to indicate that you yourself do not understand the concept of 1/0 and thus I do not understand why you think you can identify a bad analogy when you do not understand the concepts involved. I think it is clear that most people do not understand the concept of 1/0 and perhaps they should read the article about the theory of 1/0 so that they can gain enlightenment about this mysterious and all-important concept which has been ignored for centuries and which was only adressed by <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmagupta.html" title="Brahmagupta">Brahmagupta</a>.

<li>I am sorry for the confusion. Yes I am Lee Walstad, but I serve as a spokesperson for the theory of one divided by zero until it is accepted or somebody takes my place. The reason I do not claim to be the author of the theory of one divided by zero is because I believe that it is the sole property of 1/0 itself, and I have merely realized what it was telling me, that it is the number everything. Also I am not the only one who has realized this, Arceliar and Edward Solomon are others that I know of. It would be a discredit to them to claim the theory of 1/0 as original research.

<li>Again I respectfully object to all of the above.

Please provide a reference for why you say the theory is verifiably false.

<p>It presents a novel approach to user-centred interface design, so its not established yet, but well accepted in the research community (if you count peer-reviewed international conferences). Obviously I am the researcher working on this theory, but my description of the approach here on Wikipedia is by all means meant to be objective.</p>
<p>You can find out more about my work on: [<a href="http://hornbeam.cs.ucl.ac.uk/hcs/people/svenlaqua.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://hornbeam.cs.ucl.ac.uk/hcs/people/svenlaqua.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>]. I am part of the Human-Centred Systems Group at University College London. Here you can also find that a second paper on this approach will be published in September in Germany with Oldenbourg, another well known publisher for research along with a presentation at Mensch &amp; Computer conference.</p>
<p>I will revise this article asap besides all the other stuff I have to do, so that it fits as good as possible with the wikipedia standards.</p>
<p>Please let me know what other concerns anyone has with sharing this approach on wikipedia. You can also get in touch with me personally, as I think that the means of communication through wikipedia are by far to complicated and inefficient... --Slaqua 17:30, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The publication record indeed strikes me as if it might make this borderline <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> in our sense. I might reconsider if the article got a better intro that stated more clearly the context and scope of this idea: Name the field of science this belong to, give a proper definition, explain its claim to notability, etc. I'm still not entirely sure, though. Not every novel technical idea that somebody publishes somewhere gets an article here. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 21:15, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I suspect it still doesn't pass muster. It is now a report <i>about</i> a concept introduced in a 2005 paper which described it as "A Novel Concept". It does not, however, appear to be a <u>notable</u> novel concept unless you can show that this concept has been widely reported or cited. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 02:08, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry for causing any inconveniences in this "deletion process", I am new to the "adding stuff to wikipedia process". BUT I have checked the Wikipedia policy on verifiability, which I assume is the crucial one right now (relating to the above comment).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It states: "For the information to be acceptable to Wikipedia you would have to persuade a reputable news organization to publish your story first, which would then go through a process similar to peer review. It would be checked by a reporter, an editor, perhaps by a fact-checker, and if the story were problematic, it might be checked further by the lawyers and the editor-in-chief. These checks and balances exist to ensure that accurate and fair stories appear in the newspaper ... If the newspaper published the story, you could then include the information in your Wikipedia entry, citing the newspaper article as your source." As I mentioned earlier, this research has been peer-reviewed by various experts of the field and confirmed for publication. It is published with Springer, a very reputable publisher for research. It has been presented at a reputable international conference, being acknowledged by fellow researches. Further work on this theory is being published and presented in September (again reputable publisher and conference - it's German chapter of ACM). I think this kind of review process (taking months for every paper) is by far more accurate and reliable than publishing stuff at a newspaper - which all you should know. So stating newspaper level verification as a measure for reliability in wikipedia policies should than by far be met for this article. --Slaqua 14:42, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I'm sorry, do I get something wrong here? These papers have been peer-reviewed, in fact by six international researchers - or do you want to say that I lie&#160;? I do not really understand the measures with which people seem to judge here. I do not know what things you have published, or where - feel free to let me know. I clearly state, who I am, what I do, where it has been published. If you feel that is not sufficient for Wikipedia policies - of course I cannot say anything, after all its a democratic collaborative tool, but please keep in mind these policies when you judge yourself and stay objective.... thanks a lot. --Slaqua 12:00, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I'm just saying that conference proceedings are not <i>necessarily</i> peer-reviewed to the extent of "traditional" journals, in that <b>what was presented</b> is what is published, rather than <b>what was invited to have been presented</b> (which was subject to peer review). (The publications now in the references <i>do not</i> qualify as peer-reviewed. Your thesis does, but that touches on <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>.)</dd>
<dd>Changed vote to <b>Delete</b> without prejudice. The problem is a mixture of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>, so that if someone other than the primary authors of the concept writes an article, quoting published, fully peer-reviewed works (other than conference proceedings, theses, etc.), a technically correct article could be written. It's clear that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is met, as there are articles about web sites based on this model (or metaphor, if you prefer), but the correct, verifiable, name is open for consideration. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 14:04, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: First of all thanks for the productive criticism Arthur, I honestly appreciate the going through the arguments, rather than just voting for delete and then leaving it there. Nevertheless, I am not sure, whether maybe in your area of mathmatics, the common way to publish your work is a different one. I know that especially in social sciences, much focus is on journal publications, often based on the final thesis of a PhD. I am not sure how it is with maths&#160;?! However, in computer science, most researchers publish primarily at important conferences like CHI (other ACM's), IEEE conferences or also Interact. That might have to do with the fast changes in the field that you as a researcher want to stay ahead of as much as possible of course. In terms of peer-reviews, again I am not sure how it works in other fields, but the paper I submit for peer-review is finished paper, including all theory, all experiments, all analysis. What you do after the peer-review are minor revisions for the final version to go to print with the publisher and maybe in response to some reviewers comments. --Slaqua 00:13, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Review other articles at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_wikis.html#Games" title="List of wikis">List_of_wikis#Games</a> - many have gone through a similar process of review in discussion pages, and some as far as AfD, and all have been kept. To me, only one or two of those meet WP:WEB, yet the Wikipedia community chose to keep them in Wikipedia. What is different here to merit holding GameWikis up to a higher standard than what those related/comparable articles were forced to pass? I question keeping any of them; but if those are kept, for consistency and equal handling of all, this one should be kept as well. --<a href="../../../1/6/1/User%7E161.88.255.139.html" title="User:161.88.255.139">161.88.255.139</a> 18:57, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply and Clarification</b>: The fact that they exist is not my reasoning. The fact that comparable articles for comparable other sites/organizations have already gone through the delete review, and in some cases an AfD review within the last month (I learned this when I added prods to those articles, when they were removed, I researched and found many had already been reviewed by the community). Those Wikipedia community decisions on those articles set a precedence, and this one should be kept as well based on that precedence. Regardless of if I agree with the decisions to keep those other articles, I do believe in a level handed and equitable application of policy. I fail to see why this article must be held to a higher standard than what the Wikipedia community used when it chose to keep comparable articles, especially when the decision to keep the other articles was made within the last month, so they are still recent and relevant decisions. --<a href="../../../1/6/1/User%7E161.88.255.139.html" title="User:161.88.255.139">161.88.255.139</a> 17:10, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>GameWikis is not of comparable notability as some of these sites that have survived AfD. <a href="../../../w/o/w/WoWWiki_90d8.html" title="WoWWiki">WoWWiki</a> has half the Alexa rank of GameWikis (even though I think it clearly fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>). <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sensei%27s_Library_cf30.html" title="Sensei's Library">Sensei's Library</a> has been around forever and is widely cited. But some of the others are truly atrocious. Encyclopedia Gamia deserves to be chucked with extreme prejudice (its NUMBEROFARTICLES is a laughable 111). <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Vault_f8df.html" title="The Vault">The Vault</a> is not a wiki. Cunnan is a very borderline case, but if it survives prodding it will make it to AfD eventually. I'll even do the honours. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_Sandholm_9443.html" title="User:Eric Sandholm">Eric Sandholm</a> 23:13, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Alexa.com data for GameWikis is skewed. Alexa's posted score is based only on traffic to gamewikis.org, while traffic to guildwiki.org is tracked as a seperate value. The main problem with this isn't current traffic, it's minimal. The problem is that Alexa's score is a 3-month average. It was within the last three months that the main migration from the guildwiki to the gamewikis domain took place. Because of this, it will be about a month yet until the Alexa score for gamewikis.org will be a valid comparison. While not in itself a means of achieving WP:WEB, it was relevant to mention its limitations as you brought it up as how another Wiki survived the community review. --<a href="../../../1/6/1/User%7E161.88.255.139.html" title="User:161.88.255.139">161.88.255.139</a> 00:23, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>this is psytrance, absolutely small scene. Check if you find the albums of the artsits mentioned above in more places. psyshop, beatspace, juno etc. these are the shops for this scene, and there you find all of the albums. All I say is: If you delete this, you have delete the others too. gfuehlsweid has been sold 2000times, in psytrance meassures, this is a very good value.</p>

With respect, I disagree with the view expressed elsewhere on the AfD that a book written in French that has not been translated into English, nor rated any mention anywhere on the internet on English (taking Google as a pretty good proxy for "the internet") can somehow be notable on English Wikipedia. Feel free to add an article to the French Wikipedia, if that is your wont, but as the consensus (which I don't understand you to dispute), even from the author of the article, is that this is "pseudohistory" - i.e., bunk - it seems difficult to divine a possible conceptual reason for notability in English for this article. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 00:32, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm not going to get to busted up about this, but if it's not been translated into English there has to be an element of interpretation which borders on original research, mustn't there? End of the day, I'm still not persuaded this, whether in French or English, is any more than a crackpot theory that has received no academic or significant public attention. Including articles like this puts Wikipedia in danger of becoming (even more than it already is) a receptable for trash, pet theories and mindless trivia.

<li><b>Comment</b> – This is in general a well-established academic hypothesis, although not all details of the article may be. It is not in my areas of expertise, but I have read articles and even a book about this. As a starting point for people who might want to research sources, look at <a href="http://www.nwo.nl/nwohome.nsf/pages/NWOP_69UBZQ/$file/Honk_eindverslag.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.nwo.nl/nwohome.nsf/pages/NWOP_69UBZQ/$file/Honk_eindverslag.pdf" rel="nofollow">Mapping the Evolution of the Emotional Brain: The Triple Balance</a>, which has several entry points.

<dd>Neither of those two links suggest a separate anatomical entity as the article under review does. The phrase "emotional brain", as in "the evolution of the emotional brain" seems rather to be being used as a phrase describing the emotional capacity of the brain. You could compare the phrase "the evolution of the tool-using ape" in describing our species' development. On the talk page, <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnElder_5063.html" title="User:JohnElder">JohnElder</a> suggested that the article was describing the <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limbic_system.html" title="Limbic system">limbic system</a> - is that the well-established academic hypothesis you're referring to? I should add that I am also not an expert in this field. --<a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughcharlesparker_a9f4.html" title="User:Hughcharlesparker">Hughcharlesparker</a> 21:50, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article may be overstating the case, and also presents as fact what is considered an interesting hypothesis. The <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amygdala.html" title="Amygdala">amygdala</a> is generally considered an anatomical entity that is part of the brain, and is sometimes popuraly referred to as a "reptilian brain" -- although the reptilian brain has more functions than the amygdala. I don't think, though, that it can be equated with the "emotional brain" as meant here, which would be more like a "mammalian brain": kind of the human brain minus the specifically human neocortex. Clearly (this is not the hypothesis but generally accepted wisdom), in the <a href="../../../p/h/y/Phylogeny.html" title="Phylogeny">phylogeny</a> of the brain, an important role is played by the appearance of complex "add-on" subsystems, next to gradual adaptation of existing systems. The triple-balance hypothesis is something like that each next add-on offers more refined decision making capabilities, but has to cope with the cruder reactions of coexisting older subsystems (unless you are <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spock.html" title="Spock">Spock</a>), and must try to (and often fails) to achieve a balance. That's about what I remember, which may be different from what I read. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:33, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nom, &amp; vote<br />
<b>Del</b> on, this pathetic also-ran, who doesn't even qualify as a politician: people who neither are involved in making policy, nor have any chance of starting to do so without an election upset that would be of interest mostly for its bizarreness, are fringe activists, and may be presumed n-n until real influence or attention to them is demonstrated. This guy's greatest distinction is polling best among <i>3rd-party</i> candidates in <i>one</i> state in <i>one</i> year. Running 3rd with 3%, where the victor got a landslide, is the height of irrelevance. I may be too cautious in having made this a ProD instead of a speedy-del.<br />

<li><b>Weak keep</b> The article seems to assert enough notability to warrant being kept. He is only a third-party candidate on the state level, but if Washington state's Libertarian Party- a major third party, as far as third parties go- supports him, he must be one of most important (or, at least, politically active) Libertarians in the state; also, "Bruce Guthrie" + "Libertarian" gets 925 Google hits, of which a little over 200 are unique (which may or may not be enough to say that this guy is notable via Google), and there's certainly a chance that more of the 23,700 G-hits for "Bruce Guthrie" pertain to him. I would usually vote delete on some little-known candidate for Congress from the [Insert name you've never heard of here] Party, but Guthrie is apparently sufficiently notable. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 16:28, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> If a candidate is able to get on the ballot in a U.S. Senate race, he or she is worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. Although it is highly unlikely that Guthrie or the Libertarians will even come close to winning this race, Guthrie's name will appear on the ballot, and Wikipedia would be violating its policy of neutrality by deleting his entry simply because some might consider him irrelevant or an also ran with a "fringe" viewpoint. -- Freedom Lover in Olympia 16:56, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A three-time candidate, even for a notable party, is not enough to make one notable, and the page lists nothing else that he's done.

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> - I'm amazed that people want to delete this article. I restored his bio information. He's an active member of his community, and an active participant of our Democracy.

<li>No change to earlier delete vote. I would consider changing vote if he had a published book or often-cited research papers, or had notable speed skating performances at a national or international level. Simply being a lecturer doesn't automatically confer notability. Simply being a competitive speed skater doesn't automatically confer notability; I know someone with a world ranking in snowboarding but wouldn't consider him wikiworthy. The argument that the page has been present since December 2004 is specious, I'm sure there are hundreds of pages on non-notables that haven't been marked AfD simply because they haven't been found yet. AFAIK no-one is suggesting Guthrie is a bad person - just, in the context of an <i>international</i> encyclopaedia (he's not a participant in <i>my</i> democracy) and on the basis of the information in the article, not notable enough to warrant inclusion. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddles_deb2.html" title="User:Paddles">Paddles</a> 00:30, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Why argue over the existance of a duplicate article? The point of this is not an attack upon your person, beliefs, or identity, it's to keep Wikipedia free of redundancy.

<p>I DO NOT disagree with a redirect. I stated previously it was fine with me. I will go ahead and redirect and just add in a sentence in the Beth Nahrain article that Nahrainean or Beth-Nahrainean is the Anglicized form of Nahraya or Beth=Nahraya which is Syriac for Mesopotamian which is a broader term. Beth Nahrain means "the Land of Rivers" where Mesopotamia is Greek for "the Land between Rivers." There is a distinction. It could be even argued that Beth Nahrain should be merged into Mesopotamia with a statement on that article explaining the two terms.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESargonious_9f62.html" title="User:Sargonious">King Legit</a></p>

<p>Yes i realise this, but im not doing it for every mod made for every game ever made, this is just for that mod, because i think it should be up there, becasue it is a well liked mod. Are there any other reasons you think it should not be allowed?</p>
<p>I see no where in the rules where it says this is not allowed, and i spent 2 hours reading them. None of the views are biased all the information is informative.</p>

<li><b>Delete vote</b> and <b>Response to Delahuex</b>. First of all, this mod is non-notable. If it was released YESTERDAY, there can be no claim that it's "well-liked" unless an extraordinary number of people have downloaded it in the past 24 hours. There's no assertion of notability in the article- a self-released space combat game (or mod) is in no way unique, and the article does not claim why this particular mod is, especially considering the [[Frelancer (computer game)|Freelancer}} page lists almost two dozen mods. Second, OF COURSE the views in the article are biased. There's inherent bias in the second sentence of the article: "The best feature about this modification is its enthusiastic community and the great addition of flyable ships, weapons and new bases." The "Mod Features" section also has an exclamation point after almost every feature, which doesn't exactly scream "encyclopedic." Third, the article was created by one of the designers of the game (see the last name listed under "The Mod Team"), which constitutes an advertisement (which the article obviously is). To Delahuex and anyone else who might read this: I'm sorry for biting the newcomer, which is something I hate doing, but I'm not really sure how to state my argument without being a bit condescending. To Delahuex, don't take this the wrong way, as I'm not trying to attack you. Here's what I am saying: The subject of this article is non-notable, and almost certainly will never be notable; as a result, it does not need a page on Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 16:40, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Delahuex reply:</p>
<p>No sorry, the date i put for release was the new update, it has actually been out for around 3 months now, and therefore is well liked. You say it lists 2 dozen mods, yet we are the only mod to take inicitive to make a wiki page, because we have the confidence that it is worth it. We currently have 211 members to our mod that play regularly. The date i set was for the new server upgrade and the new mod, since this was the massive release with bug fixes and more, and with already 211 members, we can only grow. I realise your argument, but i really think this is worth it. If no-one else agrees with me then fine, i concede, and dont worry about being condescending, i can live with it&#160;;) Plus the best feature line is fair enough, ill chnage that, and the exclamation marks. COme on this is my first wiki page&#160;:) Plus, delahuex and delahue are different people.</p>

<li><b>Reply</b> I understand why you feel the page should stick around, and I sit corrected on the aspects of my argument which were incorrect. In addition, I do complement your initiative in creating the page. With that said, there is still not enough notability for the mod. If having 200 players was a goal, then I congratulate you on having over 200 players, but that's certainly not a large enough number to assert WP notability (I could write a blog read by far more than 200 people that would still not be "notable"). Perhaps the reason none of the other mods have articles (besides people simply not putting in the effort to create one, as you did) is that none of them are sufficiently distinguished. Few mods are. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 18:02, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

It's a shorthand way of saying that the content is more appropiate for a personal web wite, (which wikipedia isn't) as it's written by the subject and doesn't appear to be notable enough for an encylopedia.

<li>I'll just copy what I said in our discussion on my talk page here: I understand that you don't want it deleted, but you have to understand that the subject of the article really doesn't meed Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion. I sympathize, but there's really nothing I can do about it. Not every band and not every person is eligible for inclusion in Wikipedia. Of course, if you think that the subject of the article <i>is</i> notable enough, you can always make your argument for it in the AfD. If it turns out that you're right, it <i>will</i> be taken into account; people change their minds in AfDs all the time when someone makes a convincing argument for notability or importance. But honestly? I don't think you can pull it off in this case, because Natural Born Spitters just isn't an important group yet -- not to the world at large. The fact that you're involved with them makes them very important to you, and I respect that, but that also makes you biased. And please believe that I'm <i>not</i> saying that to be mean, I'm just saying that simply existing isn't enough to warrant inclusion in Wikipedia. It doesn't mean that Natural Born Spitters won't make it big in a year or two, but at that point, someone <i>else</i> will write the article about them. I realize that this probably isn't what you'd like to hear, but I'm not going to lie to you here -- I don't think there's a whole lot you can do about this. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 11:04, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Right now, sure, it's a list of set lists, but you're failing to see what the articles could eventually become. There is a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done in the Phish category and there are a few dedicated editors attempting to reel in the monstrosity it has become. With some diligence, these articles <i>will</i> become encyclopedic. Someone has taken great pains to start the articles, misguided though it might be, and I would really hate to lose the information. — &#160;<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusicMaker5376_f27b.html" title="User:MusicMaker5376"><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 255);">Music</span></a><a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusicMaker5376_b74b.html" title="User talk:MusicMaker5376"><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">Maker</span></a> 18:53, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A question. On the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sign_languages.html" title="List of sign languages">list of sign languages</a> many sign languages have red links, and they all <b>should</b> have their own page. Is the solution then to create almost empty pages like the one under consideration? I have checked all of them in the list, and this is the only one with no additional information, except stating that the Honduras Sign Language is signed in... Honduras. But if this article ends up being expanded soon, all the better of course (but again, does that mean that creating almost empty pages from the red links in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sign_languages.html" title="List of sign languages">list of sign languages</a> is a good strategy?). --<a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJadriaen_8fc2.html" title="User:Jadriaen">Jadriaen</a> 19:22, 9 May 2006 (UTC).
<ul>
<li>I'm not at all a fan of creation of nearly empty (or obvious text restating the title in this case) articles simply to create a bluelink elsewhere. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> though that the originator's heart was in the right place... I wouldn't consider it best practice to create articles like this though. If this survives AfD I'll add it to my "To Do" list and move it/try and make it into a real stub. I'd do it right now, but I'm going to have to do a bit of research because I'm not really familiar with the topic.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 12:18, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi Isotope23, it's nice that you'd want to do that, but there are lots of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sign_languages.html" title="List of sign languages">sign languages</a> that need a page. There is actually a project for sign languages and Deaf culture (<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deaf_601b.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deaf">Wikipedia:WikiProject Deaf</a>): they have an opinion of which articles need the most attention. <s>As for me, I'd go for CSD:A3 <b>speedy delete</b> as outlined by Stifle below.

<ul>
<li>If there is a wikiproject for this then I'll let them clean it up if it gets kept... they are better informed than I. I still don't see any logical reason for deletion though. The subject is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and there is obviously a community here that works on these sorts of articles. The fact that the article is nearly blank is strong argument for keep and expand... not deletion. --<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:21, 10 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ok, let's go for <b>keep and expand</b> (and <b>redirect to Lesho</b>) because this article needs to be written <i>in the end</i>. But I still think the purpose would be better served with a red link than an empty article. Look at all the energy spent in this discussion... bummer.

<li>...and between the 2 of us there is a servicable stub there now.

<p>This probably needs to go through an AfD discussion sooner rather than later. It has the same problems as The Game (game) before that Dutch language newspaper article was found, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_school_pranks.html" title="List of school pranks">List of school pranks</a>. I know this "game," or more precisely, method of bullying exists, but I believe it is subject to too much specific variation and natural evolution to write a comprehensive encyclopedia article about it. Reducing it to its lowest common denominator (circled fingers, look, punch) may just make for a definition. While I think it should be deleted, it's not a strong delete, and even if I could delete articles on my own, I'd definitely get a consensus first. This will make an interesting precedent, at any rate. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G. Crawford">Brian G. Crawford</a> 20:13, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Not only have I been a player of this game for the last 15 years, upon digging for more sources and citations to post to the page itself I'm finding mention of knowledge dating back to the military in the late 1950's. I will continue to post URL's of sources as well as adding to known rules and variations there of. People complain of there being no citations, but it's not exactly easy to cite something that is only known by word of mouth. There is not a lot of hard evidence, but players of the game tend to always find other players, and it continues to shock me on a daily basis as I find more. I am new as an active editor to Wikipedia so I must also ask for your patience as I attempt to learn the proper procedures as well as structure for my postings. Silent J 22:18, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>No consensus</b>.

<p>This was nominated two years ago (see Talk:Nice guy syndrome), and two years later, the concerns expressed by the original nomination have not been addressed. It's essentially original research and speculation and very heavy generalization and exactly what <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> was written to prevent, namely patent crankery. There are a lot of men who don't get what they want out of relationships, but I doubt they're all in the same boat due to some fictitious "syndrome." There's already a slightly better article at <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_shyness.html" title="Love shyness">Love shyness</a>, but I don't recommend a merge as much of the information is duplicated. Acceptance of this term in mainstream psychiatry would make me think otherwise, but right now, I say <b>delete.</b> There's possibly a precedent at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Modern_Gnosticism_7ab6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Modern Gnosticism">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Modern Gnosticism</a>. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

<ul>
<li><b>Redirect to <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_shyness.html" title="Love shyness">love shyness</a></b>. I could see this article sticking around IF it stops trying to treat the subject as science (which is hopelessly original research/crankery) and sticks to describing the "nice guy" as a character archetype in pop culture. That seems to be the consensus of the original nomination. But then the article would have to be almost completely rewritten, and moved, since the title wouldn't be appropriate anymore. I'll start work on writing a new article to place at <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nice_guy.html" title="Nice guy">nice guy</a> (which currently redirects to this article). There are enough sources here to verify the "nice guy" as a cultural concept/archetype, just not "nice guy syndrome" as anything more than a bit of folk psychology that doesn't deserve the pseudoscientific treatment it has here. — <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKADriver_8b44.html" title="User:AKADriver">AKADriver</a> <a href="../../../a/k/a/User_talk%7EAKADriver_2c54.html" title="User talk:AKADriver"><font color="#FF0000">☎</font></a> 22:10, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An article on the character archtype sounds like a great idea. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G. Crawford">Brian G. Crawford</a> 22:21, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree. We should make a <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nice_guy.html" title="Nice guy">nice guy</a> article discussing the character archetype in pop culture. (See for instance the first episode of Sex in the City.) Nice guy syndrome should then redirect to <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nice_guy.html" title="Nice guy">nice guy</a>. The <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nice_guy.html" title="Nice guy">nice guy</a> article can briefly mention claims of a "nice guy syndrome" in Glover's book. If a <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nice_guy.html" title="Nice guy">nice guy</a> article gets going soon, then I will vote to delete this one. Oh, and an interesting study on the subject which might help is: <i>Jensen-Campbell, L. A., Graziano, W. G. &amp; West, S. G. (1995). Dominance, prosocial orientation, and female preferences: Do nice guys really finish last. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 68, 427-440.</i> Though it is inconclusive as to answering the question. --<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondSight_02d5.html" title="User:SecondSight">SecondSight</a> 00:58, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as original research, as well as pseudoscience masquerading as a legitimate concept (the low quality of the sources cited should be enough of a clue there.) Having an article on this implies that "nice guy syndrome" is an objectively recognizable concept like "cancer" or "schizophrenia". It's not. The idea that such a "syndrome" exists is a hypothesis floated in a few popular books, and we shouldn't legitimize it; at best, it could be mentioned in an article on folk psychological theories or on the sociology of heterosexual relationships in the US. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatamorphism_4920.html" title="User:Catamorphism">Catamorphism</a> 22:52, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> - This is not original research (although this version of the article may be).

<li><b>Keep</b>, Currently, <i>nice guy</i> is a popular term for a broad range of symptoms and it is likely to be a term entered in as a search parameter when looking for information about this type of problem.

<p><b>Strong Delete</b> The idea of having this article is a POV. This is as much riduclous as "<b>Metal in Western countries</b>" or "<b>Metal in Christian countries</b>" (How about having that on Asian Wikipedia?!). There is no shared 'Heavy metal' scene in 'Islamic countries'. Infact, the Metal bands in the 'Islamic countries' sing against Islam in most cases, which is why they are usually banned from playing live and their materials are only released in bootlegs. To have an article and put them together under the title of "Heavy metal in Islamic countries" is very much POV from a western perspective, and the whole idea is wrong. I had asked the contributer many times to forget about this idea but sadly he doesn't listen. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKashk_e250.html" title="User:Kashk"><b>- K a s h</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/s/User_talk%7EKashk_0fc5.html" title="User talk:Kashk">Talk</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Kashk" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Kashk" rel="nofollow">email</a></sup> 09:11, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, this was put up in great faith as a compromise to include regional scenes (eg <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_metal.html" title="Iranian metal">Iranian metal</a>) which were not individually notable. However, I don't believe there are enough commonalities between playing metal in these countries beyond perhaps a lack of free speech, which is certainly not unique to Islamic countries. There is no combined Islamic scene for this kind of music, nor verifiable instances of media coverage (eg of problems / arrests / riots due to metal in these countries), and the topic is unnecessary. If it could be demonstrated that there are notable bands in these countries either playing "Islamic heavy metal" or suffering from problems <i>directly</i> related to Islam it would be a different matter. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> 09:25, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: You are correct to say that there is no common theme, I am not too sure about Metal in e.g. Pakistan, but the theme for Metal in Iran for example is about history of Iran.

<li><b>keep</b>. the intention I (creator) have here is the create a generic article about heavy metal in Islamic countries. Currently it is just some stuff that I gathered from other pages that was ill-placed or isn't worth an article by itself. Perhaps the article can be moved to something even more general such as heavy metal acceptance or something. Anyway the broad idea is the actually prevent articles about regional scenes, but cover general issues concerned to all such scenes into this article. However, some one knowledgeable about such issues should step in and write it into a decent album. One problem with most metal genre related articles is that they focus only on Western scenes, where freedom of speech and such is quite common - in countries like Iran, Indonesia, etc etc it is much harder to establish a metal scene. Any thoughts however for improvement are more than welcome. Moreover, I also feel that this is a bit of a personal strike of Kash against me for AFD'ing Iranian metal before and given his comments that I should leave his articles alone (and as such this step was too predictable). Consider his comments on my talk page as well as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Metal_5c46.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Metal">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Metal</a>. In this respect also like to point out that Iranian metal now redirects to a page with merely a copyvio statement. Also not that the creation of this article was considered on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Metal_5c46.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Metal">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Metal</a> as well.

<li><b><s>Keep</s> <s>Unsure</s> Delete</b> as per Deiz and Kash. Much too vague, each country has its own situation and this article would just end up being an arbitrary list of countries whose government is more or less Islamic. It would be far more logical to have a section about heavy metal music in the articles of each individual country's music. I think that the purpose of this page was originally to group together regional scenes whose notability was questionable, but it doesn't look like a good compromise in the end. If we want to make an article on heavy metal acceptance, then that's a good idea; it's just that this title is ill-chosen and, from the comments of some editors, it might be perceived as offending for people from these countries. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_8a98.html" title="User:IronChris"><b>Iron</b></a><a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_Esperanza_81b2.html" title="User:IronChris/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>C</b></font></a><a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_8a98.html" title="User:IronChris"><b>hris</b></a> | <a href="../../../i/r/o/User_talk%7EIronChris_59e6.html" title="User talk:IronChris">(talk)</a> 19:21, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: If it was a good compromise, I wouldn't be going through all this trouble for it. I think fans and the bands of Metal scene in those countries would be deeply offended to see it categorized as this. Their music is against Islam and their lyrics shout out it out clear that their country is not Islamic. There is just an Islamic rule in the country. -- <b>- K a s h</b> <sup>Talk | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Khashayar_Karimi" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Khashayar_Karimi" rel="nofollow">email</a></sup> 20:09, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I changed my vote from keep to unsure, after reading the comment by 67.68.153.43 on the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Talk%7EHeavy_metal_in_Islamic_countries_5067.html#Delete" title="Talk:Heavy metal in Islamic countries">Talk:Heavy metal in Islamic countries#Delete</a> (among other things). I understand that "Islamic countries" is an over-generalisation, and as Kash says, a rather western point of view. The situation of metal is different in different countries, as some have more or less free speech, a more or less authoritarian government, etc. The contents of the article could still be of use, but the title should be changed to not be so general.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The simplest thing to do is probably still to make a section about metal on the article for the music of each given country. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_8a98.html" title="User:IronChris"><b>IronChris</b></a> | <a href="../../../i/r/o/User_talk%7EIronChris_59e6.html" title="User talk:IronChris">(talk)</a> 18:07, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>: The material in this article covers two cases as it appears to me:</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Social acceptance of metal music</li>
<li>Music in Islamic culture</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, there is hardly any need for this particular article which seems to be on the borderline of POV or invented topics. The material should be lumped under the above two broader categories. Also generalising Islamic countries may not be appropriate, since different definitions of the word "Islamic countries" may be used, such as, "country with Islamic constitution", "country with Muslim population majority", "country with significant Islamic cultural influence", etc. Also the reason for heavy metal music ban may depend on non-genre related reasons. For example, playing loud music (which may be even pop or hip-hop) is illegal in many Western countries as well. Then music, irrespective of genre, might be illegal in several countries. Worth pointing out, not all non-Islamic countries - whatever that means - have huge thriving metal scenes. Examples include countries in Africa, India, etc., where loud music is socially unaccepted. So, the given article is generalising based on incorrect parameters. -- <a href="../../../u/r/n/User%7EUrnonav_4b88.html" title="User:Urnonav">urnonav</a> 17:52, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> Over the last few months, articles on Iranian heavy metal, Pakistani black metal, and, I think, Malaysian black metal have been written (sorry I don't have the exact titles handy), and in each case been proposed for deletion due to questions about notability. While any one of these scenes might be non-notable, the fact that this genre seems to be gaining popularity across so many Islamic countries does amount to a phenomena and really should get its own article. Alternately, it could be merged into <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal.html" title="Heavy metal">heavy metal</a> or some article on music in the Islamic world. I also think that the heavy metal/<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_metal.html" title="Black metal">black metal</a> phenomena in Islamic countries does constitute a distinct sociological phenomenon, rather than merely the extension of an established Euroamerican musical genre into a different part of the world. Personally, I find it very interesting that a musical genre that, seemingly at least, so strongly rejects Islamic and Christian values is gaining popularity in much of the Islamic world. Is it a small symptom of a larger cultural rebellion against Islamic fundamentalism? I'd certainly like to know more. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 19:45, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What would be an interesting cultural subject would be to have an article that presents an overview of the social acceptance of heavy metal and its evolution in the past and that contrasts the different situations in various countries, some examples of which would be "Islamic countries". This would be 1) a more interesting article (the perception of heavy metal music and its followers has its importance elsewhere than just in "Islamic countries" and 2) it would be less offending. I agree with Kash that the government of a country does not reflect its culture. If someome then wants to make a detailed description of the heavy metal scene in a given country, they should do so on the article dedicated to that country's music. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_8a98.html" title="User:IronChris"><b>Iron</b></a><a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_Esperanza_81b2.html" title="User:IronChris/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>C</b></font></a><a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_8a98.html" title="User:IronChris"><b>hris</b></a> | <a href="../../../i/r/o/User_talk%7EIronChris_59e6.html" title="User talk:IronChris">(talk)</a> 17:21, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
