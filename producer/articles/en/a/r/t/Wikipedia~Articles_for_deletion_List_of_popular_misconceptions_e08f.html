<li><b>Delete</b> trivia is good for adding spice to individual articles, but this list is useless. Might be better if it had a full explanation of why these misconceptions exist and what the truth behind them really is.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This would be too vague and catch-all to be useful -- even if not for the fact that some of these "misconceptions" are the truth and the "truth" is the misconception.

<ul>
<li>I've never considered the "We have X so why delete Y?" argument to have any validity. X is a separate issue, lets judge Y on its merits alone. I've actually considered putting List of people widely considered to be eccentric up on VfD, but I'm somewhat more in favor of keeping quasi-encyclopedic material that's well written. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Burley_88c3.html" title="User:Scott Burley"></a>-- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Burley_88c3.html" title="User:Scott Burley">Scott</a> <a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScott_Burley_3755.html" title="User talk:Scott Burley"><font color="black"><small><i>e<sup>iπ</sup> + 1 = 0</i></small></font></a> 05:23, Jan 27, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually List of people widely considered to be eccentric was already put up on VfD, and there was opposition. <b>--82.194.62.17 06:06, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</b>
<ul>
<li>List of people widely considered eccentric has survived at least two VfDs on the grounds that it's "inherently non-NPOV." The big difference between List of popular misconceptions and List of people widely considered to be eccentric is that the latter list has a clear purpose and subject: it's a list of people who, for whatever reason, have been labeled "eccentric." Something like, say, List of interesting people would be as unencyclopedic and pointless as this article. <a href="../../../s/z/y/User%7ESzyslak_7117.html" title="User:Szyslak">Szyslak</a> 06:52, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Several of them aren't specific enough to debate logically. Others strike me as true (thus <i>not</i> misconceptions). Others strike me as not "popular". None are attributed. Those that may meet the criteria of the page are not refuted with any useful information.

<li><b>Keep</b>, actually I agree with Centauri on this. If we can have far more trivial music and song lists on Wikipedia, I see nothing wrong in having this list. True, POV needs cleanup but I feel this idea is far more worthwhile than say "List of Songs with No Lyrics". <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 23:46, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The fact that it's no worse than XYZ-other bad list is not, to me, enough justification to keep. The intent of the list is ill-defined. The listed "misconceptions" are not sourced or explained. (For example, who holds this misconception?) I suppose you theoretically <i>could</i> clean up this page but I see no value to doing so.

<ul>
<li>Well I was using it to illustrate my point. I have in the past tended to vote against lists because I really see no justification for them (I am a supporter of categories rather than lists). But all things considered the role of the encyclopaedia is to be informative and as accurate as possible. As I said there is POV in the article but so long as it is cleaned up and expanded (sourced or explained as you say), I have no problems with this list existing albeit not in its present form. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 00:55, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's absolutely useless. It doesn't meet Wikipedia's definition of informative: it is neither actionable nor interesting. A list of popular misconceptions would be useful if it provided (1) evidence that the statement is widely believed, and (2) evidence of what the truth is. The current list does neither. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 13:20, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Inaccurate; piecemeal original research. One problem with these kind of lists is that each entry is just someone's unsourced opinion. The format makes it unlikely that any particular item will go through the wiki vetting/NPOV-ification process, and the "article" just becomes a disreputable holding area for inaccurate POV in the Wikipedia. Two thirds of the current list is likely incorrect: these are not popular misconceptions, or not misconceptions at all. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 15:01, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
