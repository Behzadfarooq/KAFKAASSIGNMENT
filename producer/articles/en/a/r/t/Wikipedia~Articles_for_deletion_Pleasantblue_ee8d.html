<p><b>appeal:</b> pleasantblue doesnt seek followers: it's supposed to be silly by definition. it hardly seems any one else will have a definition for 'pleasantblue', so its not possible for it to confuse anyone by leaving silly information about it. pleasantblue is built on 'koans' which <i>are</i> paradoxical and silly. pleasantblue is not kipple, and has nothing to do with software. it IS however, just silly.

<li><b>fair enough:</b> i'm truly not attempting to take up space on the server with uselessness, but am trying to define a concept, that is an active process, albeit silly. i do understand why it's seen as useless, and have no intent to move beyond the scope of what wikipedia is, but feel a few 'wild cards' in the mix is fairly representative of the dynamic nature of the internet and human culture in itself. (part of what pleasantblue is about). thank you for your input. i remain pleadful, for 'non-deletion consideration'. [Oct 14 2005 - MG]
<ul>
<li>Sure. I don't disagree at all; it certainly <i>is</i> fairly representative of the dynamic nature of the internet and human culture in itself. But Wikipedia is not really here to showcase either. It's a project to build an encyclopedia. I have nothing but respect for projects like yours, silly or not, but Wikipedia isn't designed to include things like this. It just isn't a place for experiments, soapboxes, artistic statements and whatnot. (That said, a new and separate Wiki project could certainly be created to accommodate things like pleasantblue -- might be something for you to look into, if you're interested.) -- �<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 20:35, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The page for pleasantblue seems in outward appearance to be divergent to the conventions of Wikipedia. And yet if such as pleasantblue did not make appearance in Wikipedia then the world of "acceptable human knowledge" would be impoverished to the extent of accepting only the commonly acceptable. In my own view, this would be a tragic mistake. Inspiration comes in many forms from the most humble to the most impressive. Most always, it is silly. Nonetheless, the creative process should never ever be disregarded or otherwise ignored without timely consideration of what may be involved. I also think that a Wiki project closely associated with Wikipedia to accommodate such inventive thinking as pleasantblue would be appropriate. stardance 21:15, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>"In outward appearance," my ass. And it's not being discarded or ignored. It's not like it's being wiped from the sphere of human knowledge, just because it doesn't merit an article on Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 22:25, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, it was a hastily thought out comment. Thankyou for confirming my own afterthoughts. I see that MG has conceded however I am still interested in a Wiki project associated with Wikipedia that covers the huge area of human endeavour that is not classed as being within existing knowledge, and yet is essential or otherwise useful to the progress of human civilisation. I have no idea how to select such items. An interesting question in itself. My respects. stardance 16:30, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>conceded:</b> your argument is clear and founded. i especially understand the concern with 'setting precedence', it shan't be pressed further. however, the "compendium of existing knowledge" - sits a little rough. there are many things i wouldn't have known existed, until i was made aware of them, often by looking them up in an encyclopedia, after having 'heard of them'.</p>
<p>a taste of revolutionary art shaking up dominant wiki paradigm gets my vote. knowledge can become sterile and meaningless without reference to the unknowable. a touch of randomness and aesthetic 'nonsense' is in the tradition of the playful seriousness of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armory_Show" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armory_Show" rel="nofollow">1913 armory show</a>, the insurrectionary sarcasms of the modernists. yes, it is an unusual entry, but i would venture, that given opportunity, the page could grow and become more relevant and meaningful. i agree that leaving the page opens the door to other unusual entries. i'd like to see if the definition evolves before it's deleted. - 'mabel dodge'</p>

<p>I think it was around the 15th century in Italy that artists originally started signing their names to their works. (I havent come to a firm reference for this yet.) Observing the consequent train of celebrity and acclaim, perhaps it would have been better if it were otherwise. For joy. Just silly painstaking wonderful joy.</p>
<p><b>communion:</b> If whales, sharks and suchlike communicate over huge distances within a conductive medium, one might well assume they live within a state of continuous togetherness. When looking at the planet Earth, what really is the difference between water and air in terms of conductivity? And what songs do humankind sing? Instinctively.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not that I don't enjoy a good dose of horseshit every once in a while, but howzabout we concentrate on the matter at hand instead of pretending that we're discussing a profound matter that has tremendous consequences on every level of the human experience? Yo, admin types -- since even the original author of the piece agrees that the article should go, could we just <b>speedy</b> this damn thing and move on to more important things? -- �<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 02:49, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>if this discussion isn't about whether pleasantblue exists or not, whether or not it warrants an entry in an encyclopedia or "compendium of existing knowledge", then it seems that such a compendium doesn't exist for it to be entered into. (oct 15 '05) (-reworded)

<li>A bevy of small strangers made entrance through the city gate, knocking first on the door of a modern and most public pavilion with a modicum of trepidation and some more innocent (some might say naive) playfulness. They were received by the inhabitants with generous consideration; dignified yet subtle assistance; and patient observance of their confusion at finding themselves within such an place of middling-high esteem. All in all, it was a respectful yet pleasant meeting and looks likely to further enable the search for chocolate. Oh, yes, and toes. stardance waves gracefully...</li>
<li>The people were no longer satisfied with "A is for apple". There was a newly formed Institution for the Conservation of Z.
