<p>Subset of the fabled List of non-notable people. A list of non-notables is not made notable by including a lot of them. Article is entirely unreferenced (for months), and I can find no non-trivial secondary source mentions in reliable sources regarding any of these characters. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 16:32, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b><s>Keep</s></b>. Just being a list of minor characters isn't a criterion for deletion that I knew of; B5 just has way too many characters to fit them all into one article. Yet some of these did in fact have a significant effect on the series, like Turhan, and a lot of characters need to be added.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I actually created this list based on some other listings that seem to work well, e.g. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_characters_88b2.html" title="List of Star Wars characters">List of Star Wars characters</a>. Major chars get their own article, minor chars are combined in one. The main B5 list was just supposed to be an index. I wouldn't mind if this gets merged into the main B5 list, as long as a proper contents table is added at the top. However, I don't want to see every B5 character combined in one page. Regarding Static Universe's example, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html" title="List of characters from The Wire">List of characters from The Wire</a> - that page is 220 KB long!

<dd><b>Comment</b> "I saw the episode and observed that..." is the same as "I did an experiment and observed that..."-<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.

<dd>Um...if that was true, we could never cite TV shows. Or books. I think what Manticore is saying is that the episodes themselves are references. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 04:19, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Would agree, TV shows shouldn't be cited. Of course, for plot summaries and the like, there's usually the tv.com's and such of the world which offer plot summaries-that would be a secondary source, but in that case, you're not posting <i>your</i> interpretation, you're posting <i>theirs</i>. That's the definition of source research vs. original research-basically, with proper sourcing, someone who has <i>never seen the show</i> should be able to verify everything in the article. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 04:22, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But isn't that like...I mean, if I'm talking about the character of Hamlet, shouldn't I make references to William Shakespeare? Commentators are great, but they don't completely preclude <i>ever</i> using the original as a source, do they? --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 04:31, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh of course not! However, primary sources should be used in conjunction with secondary sources, not in place of them. I don't think anyone would be hard-up to find reliable third-party analyses of <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamlet.html" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>. There'd be nothing wrong with citing the part of Hamlet the critic cites in addition to citing the criticism-just not <i>instead</i> of the criticism. However, per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, we still shouldn't be offering our <i>own</i> interpretations of Hamlet, only reporting on others' evaluations. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 04:44, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Right. So it seems like "TV shows shouldn't be cited" is a little stronger a statement than what you meant--oftentimes the best commentary on any work of fiction will be in the work itself, like when a character talks about himself. I think the real issue is that TV shows need to be cited very exactly, which is to say, without any extra commentary, unless that commentary is coming from somewhere else. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 05:10, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Right. I think direct quotes from the characters would be perfect candidates for direct sourcing. However, interpretations (such as plot summaries) should be secondarily sourced. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 05:15, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, no, I think I'm quite comfortable with relating simple facts from television shows and other fictional media as quite acceptable. Why? Because anybody else can also observe the thing. It is not an experiment, it is not a theory. It is reporting directly from the media. It is really no different from saying "And Author So-and-So says this about that" . Basically, I don't need some third-party book to tell me Hamlet is about a Danish prince who returned home from England to find his father dead, and his uncle married to his mother. Analysis beyond that, yes, that would need further sources, but to say that we can't report what occurs in a television show (or other fictional work) unless we can find some other source that says it? Far too strict an interpretation of NOR. Sure, if there's some dispute or disagreement as to what happened on a show, or to some specific detail behind it, that'd mean checking other sources, but even then, given that the episodes were named here, I would say a link to a book on B5 or a website would be quite feasible if you desired to do it. Might even be references in the Wikipedia articles on those episodes already. Anyway, the real point is, I don't see that objection as possessing much merit. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:04, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I still disagree, but I'd suggest moving this to user talk-I don't think an individual AfD would be the place for such a discussion. I'm also not sure how it's "too strict" an interpretation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>-the policy is <i>no</i> original research, not "Only a little bit of original research." Anyone can get hold of a lemon and make a battery out of it, but to say "I did this and it works" is OR, regardless of "anyone can do it"-and even regardless of the fact that it's dead-on correct. On the other hand, reporting on a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> stating that this can be done is sourced and verifiable to anyone. Also remember that Wikipedia is worldwide-while probably most anyone can get hold of Hamlet, some of our readers in various parts of the world might find it difficult or impossible to obtain a Babylon 5 episode, at least legally. Using reliable sources would mean that <i>any</i> reader, anywhere in the world, can verify the information. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 05:15, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I would say that <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_video_5ed7.html" title="Template:Cite video">Template:Cite_video</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_episode_0190.html" title="Template:Cite episode">Template:Cite_episode</a> covers all your citation needs.

<dd>"Primary source" is the problem-if some part of a TV series/movie/etc. has not been covered in secondary sources in some form, it isn't <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> enough for inclusion in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 07:14, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Regarding notability - I think the main thing we need to establish is that the work of fiction is notable. If the work, as a whole, is truly notable, then by extension, so are its characters. Minor characters, however, don't earn their own articles - that's why, according to <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a>, it's best to combine them in a list. I made this minor chars list to address that exact concern - I don't really care what list these character bios end up on, but they shouldn't be split up.</dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>anyone—without specialist knowledge—who reads the primary source should be able to verify that the Wikipedia passage agrees with the primary source.</i></dd>

<dd>If the plot summary says "Bob shot Greg", this is verifiable by anyone who watches the show. We don't need a movie reviewer to say "Bob shot Greg" before we're allowed to say it. The key question here is, when does a plot summary turn into original research? I wrote up a "<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_WikiJournal_4020.html#Case_study:_quoting_material_from_fictional_sources" title="User:Quack 688/WikiJournal">thought experiment</a>" on this a while ago - it's not really finished, but given that it's relevant here, I'd appreciate any feedback. I'd just like to re-emphasise the disclaimer at the very top of the page that most of it is shite in its current state - it's just a scratchpad. Still, if you've got any comments, feel free to start up a discussion page there and speak your piece. Hell, if you folks just want to discuss this further on a user talk page, I'm happy to host the party there&#160;:-p <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 15:13, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is much more verbose than just "No original research" even the nutshell statement is far longer: "Articles may not contain any unpublished arguments, ideas, data, or theories; or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published arguments, ideas, data, or theories that serves to advance a position." As these episodes were unquestionably published, the data from them is not a problem. Access to Babylon 5 episodes is not an especially big issue, there are plenty of books used as references I could not easily obtain. And if you really want to do so, there are plenty of books and other material on Babylon 5 you could review and use as a reference. So basically, as a deletion reason, OR is not especially applicable in this case. Feel free to edit some of the content though. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:09, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm also still concerned about <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> here-earlier, you suggested "notability by association", if the show is notable so by definition are all its characters, with which I (and <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>) strongly disagree. <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonald%27s_700d.html" title="McDonald's">McDonald's</a> is notable.

As an example, take Q out of Star Trek-he only appeared in a pretty small minority of episodes. But was he minor? I really don't know you could say he was. By placing anyone on this list, we're editorializing. (On the other hand, placing Q on a "List of Star Trek characters" would not be an editorial, there's no doubt he certainly was that.) But let's not have cruft. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 22:40, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Considering there are quite a lot of Lists of minor characters on OP, this probably opens yet another discussion we really shouldn't get into on AFD. There have been several merge votes, however, which seems like a solid approach. I've even changed my vote to reflect my support. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 23:35, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, on minor vs major, <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> says "the main criterion is how much non-trivial information is available on the character.", but it's intentionally vague on the matter. However, I take your point about editorializing - I'd be happy to see this merged into the main B5 list. In my mind, the only real reason to have separate lists is size (like the Star Wars lists), and that's not applicable in this case. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 23:41, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
