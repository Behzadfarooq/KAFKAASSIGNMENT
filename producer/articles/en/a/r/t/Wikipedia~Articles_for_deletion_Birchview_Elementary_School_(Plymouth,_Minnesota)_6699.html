<li><b>Keep</b> - rewrote article. Its obviously the one in Plymouth, Minnesota - since thats next to Wayzata High School lol. Its an actual school, and our policy on schools is that, for the most part, we keep them. Oh, I only did a stub for the article though.

<dd>So all school articles belong to a magical subset of articles in which no lower bounds of quality exist? They can never be bad enough to merit deletion?

<ul>
<li>It's standard practice.

<ul>
<li>Point taken. I suppose in the long run too when someone does get the urge to write an actual article about this school too it makes it a tad easier to rewrite it. Granted I'd rather history be gone, but that is secondary in my mind to the merge so *shrug*.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 21:13, 29 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think the normal GFDL attribution requirement applies here. We're not using the text of the school article, we're just adding a mention of the school to the district. Simple facts, like a school name, by themselves, aren't copyrightable (as far as I know). There's really no text in the school article to move anyhow (for instance my sentence saying the school is part of the district would obviously not be used in the district article). So, I think the issue of preserving history here is not signficant, and I would be fine either way. Before a copyright holder can complain their GFDL-rights were violated (through lack of attribution), they actually have to show that copyrightable/copyrighted work was actually copied, in my non-lawyered opinion. So, I think what's done with the old history is a minor issue, that can go either way. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 05:31, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay, but please answer the question that was asked: notable in what way? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk back</a></small> 00:31, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>See above, the sentence beginning "notable as," although I'm not sure how you missed it. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 00:47, 1 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see that sentence, however, it doesn't actually state why the school is notable among the millions of schools worldwide such that it merits its own article in a general encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk back</a></small> 01:03, 1 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Once again, it is notable among the millions of schools worldwide because out of those schools, Birchview is among the rare few that are important educational institutions serving Plymouth, Minnesota. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 01:12, 1 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why does the fact that it serves Plymouth, Minnesota make it so much more notable than other schools that it merits its own article in a general encyclopaedia? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk back</a></small> 01:27, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Why would it have to be "more notable than other schools"? We're writing an encyclopedia, not hosting some sort of twisted notability competition.
