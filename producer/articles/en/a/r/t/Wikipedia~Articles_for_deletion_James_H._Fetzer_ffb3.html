<li>Anyone familiar with my work would know that I do not believe that a cruise missile hit the Pentagon! No Boeing 757 hit the building, but a smaller plane--possibly an A-3 Sky Warrior--may have fired a missile just before it impacted. I find it just a bit much that false reasons, which are easily refuted, are being offered to keep me out of this publication. Something is not right. PLUS I am not a "college professor". I am Distinguished McKnight University Professor Emeritus, which I earned. This is a considerable distinction that someone has repeatedly edited off the page. You can check it at <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/~jfetzer/" class="external free" title="http://www.d.umn.edu/~jfetzer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.d.umn.edu/~jfetzer/</a>. Someone edited out my corrections to the Scholars' entry in the past and now they are editing out my corrections to my own entry! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.98.0.27.html" title="User:71.98.0.27">71.98.0.27</a> (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.98.0.27.html" title="User talk:71.98.0.27">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.98.0.27_40f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.98.0.27">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Since Professor Fetzer is now editing Wikipedia, the rules of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> apply and I have removed remarks which could be construed as personal attacks. Even if this is not Prof. Fetzer, there is no reason we can't discuss this issue without making attacks. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 06:44, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I can asssure you that this is James H. Fetzer. I have taken Wikipedia at its word as having a commitment to accuracy. In the past I tried to correct and improve the entry on Scholars for 9/11 Truth, only to have my edits repeatedly rebuffed. Yet who in the world should be better positioned to insure the accuracy of that entry than its founder? Now I discover that someone is offering distorted representations about who I am in order to sabotage my own entry by trivializing my rank as though I were just another "college professor" and by attributing positions to me that I do not hold! I have published 27 books! Anyone who wants to know what I think about the Pentagon can go to st911.org and read "Thinking about 'Conspiracy Theories': 9/11 and JFK"! I have also added several references. Someone may be abusing his position, but I appreciate that most of you are giving me a fair shake. user:jfetzer@d.umn.edu</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> As with the recent AFD on Scholars for 9/11 truth, Fetzer is indeed a notable person. This is ridiculous. <a href="../../../e/y/e/User%7EEyesAllMine_b74b.html" title="User:EyesAllMine">EyesAllMine</a> 16:12, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not only is this ridiculous but someone, whom I suspect is Morton Devonshire, keeps changing my permanent rank as Distinguished McKnight University Professor Emeritus to something else. I am no longer Distinguished McKnight University Professor, but I am Distinguished McKnight Univerisity Professor Emeritus, as my official UMD academic web site states. So why is this person, who is Morton, if I am right, trying repeatedly to trivialize my status? And why did he create this bogus issue in the first place? It is apparent to me that there is a corrosive force at work here that is not interested in truth or accuracy but rather in minimizing the influence of those of us who are bringing the truth about 9/11 to the American people. Something is very wrong at Wikipedia! user:jfetzer@d.umn.edu</li>

<dd>Yes, I nominated the article for Afd. No, I have not been changing your titles. Yes, there is a corrosive force at work on Wikipedia, and that's people trying to use it to soapbox their views -- Wikipedia is not a place of first publication, its role is to gather other information from reliable sources (and that doesn't include blogs and other self-published sources), and deliver it in a neutral manner. That means no advocacy of theories or ideas, just straight reporting of facts. Many of your supporters come here to advocate, and that's just not allowed on Wikipedia.

<li>For some reason, someone is putting a "reference (2)" to "Professors of Paranoia" after the list of institutions at which I have taught as opposed to later in the article when there is mention of my (allegedly) having called for a military coup. At this point in time, I have corrected it repeatedly, only to find it restored again and again. IT HAS NO APPROPRIATE FUNCTION AS A REFERENCE WHERE IT IS BEING IMPOSED. I cannot believe that Wikipedia personnel are this incompetent (since it does not belong where it has been repeatedly restored). I therefore infer that it is a deliberate attempt to perform a subtle smear. Check it out for yourself, but my confidence in the integrity of Wikipedia is being shaken for the third or fourth time based upon my own personal experience. Whoever is responsible for this corrupt act ought to be censured or replaced. It is entirely uncalled for. user:jfetzer@d.umn.edu</li>

Articles of a biographical nature are held to a special standard. If you feel that any bias exists, place a posting to this mail list--it is read by the literal "management" of Wikipedia, including it's founder, and will draw significant attention to any situation of bias or impropriety. Beyond that, the major rule is that articles have to NPOV, or non point of view--neutral. That is, "positive" and "negative" info can be included, so long as it is factual, accurate, and meets a long list of special inclusion criteria. ANYTHING of a negative nature, including ANY criticism, must be sourced and factually cited by a very vigorous standard, or else it WILL be removed per policy. If you have any additional concerns the Wikimedia Foundation, who runs the show, can be contacted if you need to at <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Contact_us" class="external text" title="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Contact_us" rel="nofollow">wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Contact_us</a>.

<li>Thanks for helping me out. Contrary to the insinuation that I do not want references, I have added several to this entry; but I find the one to which I take exception is out of place. (It already appears as the citation for the final sentence.) Those of us who become deeply involved in these matters sometimes become overly sensitive about these things, because we are subject to so many unjustifiable attacks from politically motivated sources. I did not originate this entry but, once I discovered it, I have made an effort to improve its accuracy. I have made no effort to change any criticisms of me that were originally there, by the way, which tracing the history of this entry would confirm. The reasons for proposing its deletion--"not notable", "believes that a cruise missile hit the Pentagon", "doesn't want references"--are easily proven false. My apologies if I have offended anyone. If you are serious, then these objections should not be taken seriously. I just have higher expectations of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Fetzer_f57b.html" title="Jim Fetzer">Jim Fetzer</a> P.S. I believe that my concerns are consistent with the "Five Pillars", though not the way I have expressed them.</li>
