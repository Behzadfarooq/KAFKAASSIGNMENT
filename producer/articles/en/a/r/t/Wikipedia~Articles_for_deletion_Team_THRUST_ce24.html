<li><b>Comment</b> 1) The Andrew Lenahan page is a user page. When you click on the page, it clearly says User:Starblind, indicating such. Users are allowed to have a page pertaining to their Wikipedia edits in Wikipedia. 2) I realize that the nomination was very poor in spelling this out, but there are many <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOLICY_ce11.html" title="WP:POLICY">policies and guidelines</a> regarding Wikipedia, even though to allow access to the greatest number you can start editing without reading them (however, don't be surprised when somebody reverses your edits if they do violate policy). <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> is a guideline for people writing about themselves on Wikipedia. In general, the answer is "please don't", as you are not an <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> source about yourself (you will naturally bias things towards yourself, no matter how neutral you claim you are.). In fact, the issue isn't about hard disk space, as most deleted material is in the database, just not accessible to the general public. The problem here is the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> policy, which is the central tenet of Wikipedia. Because neutrality is so important, we require <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> of information in articles by third-party <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> such as newspapers and magazines (that's the difference between Microsoft and your team). None of the information in the article is verified, therefore it cannot stay. If you can find articles about this team, feel free to contribute them. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 03:02, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Eh</b> While the generality of the article does not help it out any, I am a member of this team and I have to agree with lightingdude that I would like to see it stay. As I think it needs much editing, I see the point lightingdude is trying to make. We are a good team, however, I can also see the point the Wikipedia editors are trying to make. This is basically a vanity article about a FIRST team. After doing some research I haven't found any other articles about other FIRST teams, although a nice section of Wikipedia to do so would be a great contribution to FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology). Lightingdude, I like the thought, but I am afraid Wikipedia cannot keep the article...At least we have a great team website.&#160;:-) -croutzahn 16:23, 4 October, 2006</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think you misunderstand the meaning of "anyone can edit". It doesn't mean "anyone can place anything they want in any article" (and don't bring up the U.S. constitution; Wikipedia is not a governmental entity, so that document doesn't apply.); there are still policies and guidelines regarding content in place to keep the quality of Wikipedia high. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original research</a> is one of them and requires independent third-party verification, such as newspapers and magazines. I've actually found some other articles about FIRST teams (Northern Force, Team 172, <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine_FIRST_Robotics_Coalition_772a.html" title="Maine FIRST Robotics Coalition">Maine FIRST Robotics Coalition</a>), though because they also lack third-party verification they'll be subjected to the same deletion process. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 23:10, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Opinion</b> As a member of this team and the student president, along with the webmaster, i can see the points for NOT deleting i, but i can also see the points for deleting it. If you need proof of the 4-H issue i can get that provided by the 4-H Office here in our county. As far as monocoque goes we are the first team to ever make a robot using true monocoque and not something simular. Not to mention our whole robot is monocoque. I was thinking if this article is such a big deal, could we just add information about us to Hungtington, IN page and the Monocoque page? Obviously many people want to see this on here and many don't and some are split between, they want to see it here but not as a single page by itself. --signed roboticsguy1988. 17:35, 5 October 2006.</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> I also should add that as this teams webmaster i can update this as i do with the website, that is not a problem, i just need to know if this is going to be solved or we are going to keep going back and forth. --signed roboticsguy1988. 17:41, 5 October 2006.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Non-notable high school club. (To answer the above, these discussions run no more than five days. At this point I suspect the outcome is pretty sure. The only arguments for keeping seem to be from your high school, and not in line with Wikipedia guidelines.) <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 21:50, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Correction</b> Actually, FAN-1967, you are <b>WRONG</b> about these only being from Huntington North High School. I am from Atlanta, but I still have a great respect for this team. I would appreciate it if you get your facts straight before you say things. --Signed lightingdude1989 17:53, 5 October 2006</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> FAN-1967, first of all it takes a while for pages to be found, second of all, it seems its wikipedia members who are coming in here. Now don't get me wrong but it seems we should give the public a chance to decide for themselves. As i stated above i can go BOTH ways. I guess i would like to see this team somewhere on Wikipedia, wether (as i also stated above)it is on our towns page, or the monocoque page. ~roboticsguy1988 18:00, 5 October 2006</p>
<p><b>Comment 2</b> I personally think that all the teams in FIRST should have a sub page, you wouldn't believe the amount of research other teams do, and wikipedia is a great source for information, so why not make it a great source for FIRST Team Information also. ~roboticsguy1988 18:00, 5 October 2006</p>
<p><b>Comment 3</b> In response to Sam Clark up there, as the teams webmaster i can say that we get more hits than that, i cannot give an exact figure at this time. If anyone needs proof that this is an real organiztion i can give you all the phone numbers in the world to call, and you can even verify it at the FIRST website www.usfirst.org This is more than a FIRST team this is the Huntington County Robotics team, FIRST just happens to be our main concentration. As far as the search goes you can search multiple phrases and we are the first result. You don't think that you get other non related websites for other organizations too, then obviously you do not know google. ~roboticsguy1988 18:10, 5 October 2006</p>
<ul>
<li><b>COMMENT</b> Basically roboticsguy is saying "get over yourselves, let this article remain on Wikipedia. Give it a chance" Team THRUST is a real organization. Look it up on google. This isn't BS people who would pay for a domain and make such an elaborate website (www.huntingtonrobotics.org) if it weren't a real ORGANIZATION. --Anonymous User. 18:30, 5 October 2006.</li>

    <b>COMMENT 2</b>  Here is a link to IndianaFIRST's page on Team 1501 <a href="http://www.indianafirst.org/teams/frc-teams/team-1501/" class="external free" title="http://www.indianafirst.org/teams/frc-teams/team-1501/" rel="nofollow">http://www.indianafirst.org/teams/frc-teams/team-1501/</a>

<p><b>Another Article</b> Lookie here 1501 is also mentioned on this NASA article. It is almost at the bottom of the page. Surely NASA is a good enough source for you!!! <a href="http://robotics.nasa.gov/events/highlights/highlights.htm" class="external free" title="http://robotics.nasa.gov/events/highlights/highlights.htm" rel="nofollow">http://robotics.nasa.gov/events/highlights/highlights.htm</a></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Whether your organization is real is not the question. Whether it's notable is. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. We have numerous precedents on all sorts of scholastic societies, organizations, fraternities, etc. A national organization may be worthy of an article. Individual school or university chapters are not. (Is it my imagination, or are both "LightningDude" and "Anonymous User" posting from the same IP address: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EConstributions_74.244.8.117_1210.html" title="Special:Constributions/74.244.8.117">74.244.8.117</a>? Remarkable coincidence.) <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 22:44, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Duh</b> Correct I am LightingDude...and anybody with the exception of two others here is going to be able to see the IP address. That was meant as a pun, which I should have been logged in but I wasn't so it didn't take affect. Oh well now you know. Anyways, back to this article. Team THRUST is a part of FIRST, which is a national organization. Perhaps this article should be in a WikiFIRST type of resource rather than in Wikipedia itself directly. This article is worthy of staying, but I agree now and see how it should be. FIRST is an excellent organization. You should really do some reading up on it if you haven't because it provides many high school students with excellent opportunities. Could we get this under a WikiFIRST area on Wikipedia??? ..LightingDude1989</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Only part of the article is devoted to a non-notable organization of some sort; the rest of the article looks like it is instructions for building something. Neither belong in Wikipedia. George J. Bendo 12:09, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
