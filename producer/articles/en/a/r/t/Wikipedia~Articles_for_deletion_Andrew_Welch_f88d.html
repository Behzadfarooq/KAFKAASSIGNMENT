<li>Whoa... it's odd randomly running across a series of delete votes that I strongly disagree with. Ambrosia Software is hugely significant within the Macintosh software community, and quite well known. Andrew Welch, as the lead spokesman has shown up all over the place in magazine articles and so forth. I vote <b>Keep</b> with the hope to expand it, and at the very least if you take the article away it should be a redirect and not a total delete. This person is way more notable than gobs of articles in this encyclopedia. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 22:24, Jan 6, 2005 (UTC)

</li>
<li><strike><b>Keep</b> Ambrosia Software holds a major place in the Macintosh community for both its games and utilities. The articles on the company and its related entries are being updated and I'm sure that that article will become more than a stub. It certainly was not created by Andrew Welch.</strike> <b>Merge and redirect.</b> <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorg_5d0d.html" title="User:Norg">Norg</a> 13:45, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Creation history shows that it was probably created by <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Burch_1a8f.html" title="Matt Burch">Matt Burch</a> when he wrote his own biography (see deletion vote two above): both were created by the same anonymous user at the same time, who somehow knew all about the personal aspirations of Matt Burch. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleduc_26ee.html" title="User:Cleduc">Cleduc</a> 17:38, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Though I stated it in his bio VfD thread, I now don't think this was written by Matt Burch. From what I know of him, it's not his style. Whoever did do it, did a poor job. I've tried to update both this article and the Burch one, the latter being quite spare.-- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorg_5d0d.html" title="User:Norg">Norg</a> 21:25, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Welch_4d68.html" title="Andrew Welch">Andrew Welch</a> is a friendly, intelligent, committed man. <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Burch_1a8f.html" title="Matt Burch">Matt Burch</a> would not create an autobiography like that, he is a very modest man. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProphile_4090.html" title="User:Prophile">Prophile</a> 22:57, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>I suspect that Prophile is a member of the Ambrosia forums and not, as I suspect you're implying, the originator of the original entries. Prophile, would you like to clear that up? --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorg_5d0d.html" title="User:Norg">Norg</a> 05:20, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Friendly, intelligent, and committed</i> does not mean <i>notable and suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia</i>, and my position on <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Welch_4d68.html" title="Andrew Welch">Andrew Welch</a> stands. The compliment paid to <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Burch_1a8f.html" title="Matt Burch">Matt Burch</a> puzzles me - shouldn't that have been made on the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Burch_1a8f.html" title="Matt Burch">Matt Burch</a> <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Matt_Burch_4fad.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Matt Burch">vfd page</a>? -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleduc_26ee.html" title="User:Cleduc">Cleduc</a> 04:47, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Your position was: <i>This article is written in a barely disguised first-person tone and has no possible interest to others than family &amp; friends of Mr. Welch. All content besides spelling, grammar, and NPOV were submitted anonymously. This is a vanity article submitted as cover for another vanity article (Matt Burch).</i> The article has been significantly altered and clearly has interest to persons aside from friends and family, if these comments mean anything. All the content has been updated, changed and reformatted. The vanity portion is clearly unsubstantiated, but even if it were a mask for the Matt Burch article, it's not so in its current form. Your position falls. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorg_5d0d.html" title="User:Norg">Norg</a> 05:39, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I understand your argument and understand that the article is no longer in its original form. I still don't think <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Welch_4d68.html" title="Andrew Welch">Andrew Welch</a> has any notability outside of <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambrosia_Software_0e14.html" title="Ambrosia Software">Ambrosia Software</a>, so I advocate merge and redirect. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleduc_26ee.html" title="User:Cleduc">Cleduc</a> 05:58, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Probably a stretch as an analogy. We could attempt to guess the intention of the anonymous user at IP address 129.219.179.173, but it would be easier if s/he would cast a vote. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleduc_26ee.html" title="User:Cleduc">Cleduc</a> 09:42, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have already cast it, above. The analogy was a response to the modified proposal. Therefore, my vote remains <b>Keep</b> rather than merge and redirect. In principle, I think a change in the proposal should be brought up as a new item and thus considering the delete proposition closed. <a href="../../../1/2/9/User%7E129.219.231.173.html" title="User:129.219.231.173">129.219.231.173</a> 08:57, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. it is an outrage to suggest Andrew Welch is not of note. User: gaming121
<ul>
<li>User's only edit. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 10:26, Jan 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> (Note I edited the above two comments to make them conform to the page) gaming, saying it's an "outrage" is going a bit overboard, especially on a free Internet encyclopaedia. If people don't recognize someone, it's kind of hard for them to consider that person "of note." I certainly didn't know who <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharon_Turner_4150.html" title="Sharon Turner">Sharon Turner</a> is, but someone else did.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Andrew Welch is of high importance in his field. While some people may not know anything about his field, that doesn't mean he shouldn't have his own page. I'm sure some people haven't heard of Woodrow Wilson, does that mean he doesn't deserve his own page?
<ul>
<li>Though I guess this person wants <b>Keep</b>, there are no votes for anonymous uses (207.218.152.146). --<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleduc_26ee.html" title="User:Cleduc">Cleduc</a> 15:26, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
