<p>The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Retrocausality_baf5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Retrocausality">first nomination</a> was poorly stated; here is the real nomination</p>
<p>This article represents <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. From <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 04:38, 18 December 2006 (UTC): This is a novel synthesis of independently published claims. The physics section is, taken on its own, muddled at best; the OR is in the connection to the psychology discussion, in which each of the individual studies mentioned is either a) widely agreed to be plagued with methodological problems (PEAR), or b) entirely unrelated to the thesis (skin conductance and heart rate studies). Seriously - the creator, User:Dicorpo, has <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dicorpo_b230.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dicorpo">contributed</a> nothing outside of this type of material, in particular his linkspamming of <a href="http://www.sintropia.it/english/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sintropia.it/english/index.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> "open access journal" (read: some guy's website) for these ideas. Also, the sources cited in this article may appear to be legitimate, but "Physics Essays" and "NeuroQuantology" are not well-regarded journals, and those sources that are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>, are related to the psychology experiments - which, as I mentioned, are unrelated to the quantum consciousness thesis. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 05:01, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Those sources are unreliable. <i>Perceptual and Motor Skills</i>, for example, is not a respected peer-reviewed journal. Authors pay the journal to publish their articles. Other sources have absolutely nothing to do with the article's basic assertion.<a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maik/hump/2005/00000031/00000006/00000108;jsessionid=ay3tpcnu2hic.alice" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maik/hump/2005/00000031/00000006/00000108;jsessionid=ay3tpcnu2hic.alice" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The <i>NeuroQuantology</i> article addresses supercausality, not retrocausality. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 07:05, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b>. This referencing of random unrelated sources along with a few unreliable sources is annoying, and seems to be happening with increasing frequency. But perhaps Retrocausality and Supercausality should have been listed together? <s>--<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 07:29, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</s></s>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Delete</b> - I will remain as a delete vote for now. Most of the sources given are not reliable sources for the purpose of an article on a scientific topic, and should be removed. MSNBC and the San Diego Union Tribune just aren't appropriate sources for this type of article. The only source that might be remotely considered reliable is the AAAS symposium. I'm concerned that there are no references to papers in proper peer-reviewed journals. Why is this? It also seems that Cramer might be trying to use a concept that he calls "retrocausality" as an abstract formalism for dealing with entanglement, and the popular press is presenting it as traveling back in time. But even then, some of the things don't make sense to me. Cramer's presentation says "the present can affect the past, and the future can affect the present ... retrocausality is perfectly permissible within the known laws of nature". I would very much like to see an explanation as to how this does not violate causality, and how one can have that sort of "retrocausality" without tachyons that cause a breakdown in energy conservation.

<dd>Thank you! Finally a more scholarly source for a portion of the article, and other references we can consider using.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The stub is better than the original, but as of this moment it still contains not a single citation to a peer-reviewed *printed* article on retrocausality. The AAAS symposium is a step in the right direction, but oral presentations aren't citable. We can't go back in time to listen to them, as it were.

<dd>Note that, despite snarkily providing that article link, I do not advocate merger. The arbcom case dictated that even patently wrong ideas that meet inclusion standards should be covered, but that we should take caution not to conflate them with established views (or, often, with science at all), and should give due weight to whatever science and established, peer-reviewed philosophy have to say that falls into the issue. That means, by the way, that we should consider rewriting this article in favor of Feynman's depricated theory of the reverse-causal positron (<i>Physical Review</i> 76) and its refutation by Earman, tachyon theory by lots of people (Bilaniuk was in <i>Physics Today</i> 22, for one) and its refutation by Recami, Price's 1996 discussion about boundary conditions, and probably de Beauregard's quantum paradox work (although I am not familiar with it, and it is mostly in Italian). <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 05:41, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>81.132.177.55 23:07, 22 December 2006 (UTC) <b>Keep</b> Bizarre debate. Clearly retrocausality exists as a theory whether or not we're able to find credible sources for it. Why not have an entry that informs of the concept, but emphasises how its scientific basis is at absolute very best tremendously shaky. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia of general interest, not a dictionary of science. It'd be highly pedantic to delete the entry altogether.</p>
