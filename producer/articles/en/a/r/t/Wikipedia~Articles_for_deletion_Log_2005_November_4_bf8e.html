<dd>That would be interesting, but no.

<li><b>Transwiki</b>? Does Wiktionary take slang definitions? BTW I believe it is "Budgie Smuggler", which has roughly twice as many Ghits as "Budgy Smuggler" (and most of those are from a brand that has taken that name, I believe).

<li>The reason for discussing it is to discover the community concensus. In this case concensus appears to be merge/redirect rather than the original proposal to delete.

<dd>What struck me was the fact that every person here seems to have put more time and thought into thier contribution to this page (a) than went into the budgie smuggler page in the first place and (b) than it would have taken to just fix what is obviously a joke and a poorly excuted one. For a page with a lot of effort, even misguided effort (such as some of Joe Dolcie's pages) it's worth spending time to do the right thing, but not for a one line 10 second joke like this page. IMHO, It shouldn't have been raised for discussion, it should just have been fixed. Courage and all that. Nothing is irreversible.</dd>
<dd>I decided to merge to Speedo (brand) rather than Speedo (suit style) because Speedo (brand) is more focused on that style, while speedo suit style covers pretty much the full range of mens' bathers, short of neck-to-knee. Also, speedo (brand) has a photo, which does clarify the expression, if I may put it thus.</dd>

<li><b>No vote &amp; comment</b> - the Wikipedia community should really try and reach a consensus on individual television episodes.

<li><b>Keep</b> as after viewing the main Sponge Bob page it appears every other episode has it' own page. So unless all those pages are to be deleted also, it appears that this nomination for deletion is based on someones opinion that either this one particular episode or this one particular article is not to their liking. That is not a good enough reason for deletion and anyway, I think it is good to have details of all individual episodes for a TV programme: you cannot just pick and choose certain episodes which stand out as what actually 'stands out' is all POV. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 13:40, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I thought those uses were mainly intended to deter the re-creation of dicdefs where they keep popping up. If we're going to have one for every slightly non-everyday word, then why not just allow dicdef articles, and merge Wiktionary into Wikipedia? "Feat" is really a word that every native speaker past Grade 7 knows; I don't see any reason to need to link it in article text. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 17:08, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thank you all for your comments, especially those who voted to Keep. I made the mistake of putting up this page, then reading the policy and guidelines pages. You are quite right, there was too much vanity in it. I have attempted to make it a more standard encyclopedia type entry. I hope these changes are acceptible. FYI: my HAARP book is NOT self-published and has sold over 18,000 copies and is now in its seventh printing. Our Spear of Destiny book just came out in July and has already sold out the first printing. Jim Keith's best seller, BLACK HELICOPTERS, has sold over 85,000 copies. Which is to say that our works are not without interest. Jim's BLACK HELICOPTERS book was the Number One seller on the subject. I am new to Wikipedia and have made most of the newcommer mistakes. I hope you can forgive and correct. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_E._Smith_fdec.html" title="User:Jerry E. Smith">Jerry E. Smith</a> 22:27, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Err, I actually meant the remarks towards the article creator, not the nominator. When I cast my vote, the article was basically "K-Town is a bunch of streets in Chicago starting with the letter K," making no assertion of notability, or whether that term was used widely beyond that area, or even what significance the term has. To me, that's almost A1 material. My attitude towards AFD has always been to consider the merits of the article <i>as it is written</i>. If the article were to be improved (and it has), I'm more than willing to change my vote, which I'm doing now. <b>Keep</b> after rewrite. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-weight: bold; color: #33C;">howcheng</span></a> <small>[ <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howcheng_7e82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howcheng">c</a> • <a href="http://www.howcheng.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.howcheng.com/" rel="nofollow">w</a> • <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><i><b><span style="color:#0C0">e</span></b></i></a> ]</small> 07:34, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There is no basis for this article to be deleted per the Deletion Guidelines. Mr. Butch IS a notable figure in the recent (past 20 years or so) history of Boston, with a fairly substantial cult following. --RoachMcKrackin 19:27, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep It</b>: Yes, he isn't found on the internet much because he doesn't use the internet himself. Most people I've mentioned him to in Boston know who he is. It sounds like you're basically saying that people who are "haves" rather than "have nots" and are able to slap their names up all over the internet and be promoted in mainstream ways are somehow better people or more notable.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I particularly like the idea of having a person who's chronically homeless and likely has persistent mental illness being listed for reasons other than having committed a crime or been the victim of one, which are the only reasons the mainstream hears about most people in his demographic. He's known for his personality and his artistry, which I think are positive things and should be encouraged.<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriangular_f19c.html" title="User:Triangular">Triangular</a> 21:15, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you've lived in Boston for any significant period of time in the last 15 years, you probably know who he is.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>yeah, definitely leave it in. he's a phenom, a living urban legend.</li>

<ul>
<li>So just because you've never heard of him until recently doesn't mean he's a significant figure in Boston? --RoachMcKrackin 19:27, 7 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But that's the thing: He's not all that significant. "Mr. Butch" + boston gets under 450 google hits, many of which are mirrors. If he was truly significant, he'd be better known and have more notability. I know that you've really only signed up recently, but notability is a reason to have an article here. His musical "career" doesn't show notability, and the idea that many people know him isn't all that established anyways. I'm one to vote to keep most things, but this is such an extreme case that I don't think a desire to highlight a positive homeless person trumps notability precedent. At this point, anyways, the keeps appear to have it to at least leave the article as a no consensus, but that doesn't change what he really is. Or let me put it another way - I've personally been featured in more notable media, performed for more audiences, and have more in the way of "notability" than this little known man in Boston. I'm certainly not worthy of a Wikipedia entry, and if you and I both can rattle off Bostonians who are better known than Mr. Butch who don't have articles, that should probably say something. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> 20:21, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>He's not just a homeless person. I don't think that's where most of the defenders of this article are coming from. He's a Kenmore/Allston cultural figure, and the Google hits he -does- get reflect this. Here's a link to a 2002 documentary about him that was included in the Boston Underground Film festival: <a href="http://www.postwarmedia.nl/els/qt/clips_butch.html" class="external free" title="http://www.postwarmedia.nl/els/qt/clips_butch.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.postwarmedia.nl/els/qt/clips_butch.html</a>. Here's an article from Boston University's grad school journal, The Comment: <a href="http://www.bu.edu/com/comment/archive/2004/kenmoreking.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.bu.edu/com/comment/archive/2004/kenmoreking.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bu.edu/com/comment/archive/2004/kenmoreking.htm</a>. The photographer David Henry includes an 80s picture of him in his online gallery. I know that Google hits form part of the Wikipedia guidelines for significance, but I feel that they are often misleading, particular with underground or subculture phenomenae that is too new to enter the history books, but too old to have been adequately documented on the Internet. Kenmore Square itself is another example. There's not a lot on the net about K.S. in the 70s - early 90s period, but it was a very significant underground cultural center, where bands like The Replacements and The Zulus played in the "Rat" for small, devoted audiences. Anyone who was into that scene knows that Mr. Butch was a notable figure of that period of K.S. whether or not it's much been documented on the Internet.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is a pretty good, informative article, of some interest to more than just a small niche community, and the guy's clearly much more noteworthy than just your typical eccentric homeless person.

<li><b>Keep It</b>: Mr. Butch is a veritable Boston cultural figure. He has been a fixture in Kenmore Square and Allston since the mid-1980s, and has been particularly well-known to several generations of Boston University students. I went to B.U. in the late 1980s, and remember him well, and have seen articles written about him by more recent generations of Boston students. Although perhaps not quite as flamboyant, he is something like a modern-day Emperor Joshua Norton in Boston culture -- a street figure who has gained a high-degree of cultural significance in local circles. Look, there are articles on Wikipedia on a number of transitory internet trends (e.g. Flying Spaghetti Monster) that will likely have little significance in a few years. Mr. Butch has been a well-known figure in Boston for twenty years. This is not a frivolous entry. People come to Wikipedia for exactly this kind of local cultural information that can not be found elsewhere. Please keep this. In fact, I would like to add more to the article when I get a chance -- I have some pictures of Mr. Butch in the 1980s, somewhere. --Tyler_c_gore 13:56, 5 November 2005 (DST)</li>
</ul>
<p>(PS -- I'm new to this, so forgive if I've added to this discussion incorrectly -- I used the edit this page box, but somehow I think that was probably the wrong way to do it.)</p>
<p><b>*Keep it!:</b> I know Butch very well. In fact, I was hanging with him and a neighbor last evening, watching the Patriots / Colts game. He is alive and well and, I'm certain, bemused by all of this attention. He himself would probably be indifferent to whether or not he remains on Wikipedia. But the rest of us in Allston (I have asked people) all want this to remain here. He's part of our collective history far more than any possible reference to pop-fads or one-hit-wonder bands, of which there are numerous at this site. To correct the record: Butch has been well-known around here since the late 1970's. He is a local icon. Further: the statements that there are no links to Mister Butch are incorrect. He has even had a number of short movies made about him, is mentioned in Boston University's Alumni magazine (Bostonia), and is made mention of in many songs and CDs. Wikipedia would be doing us all a vast disservice by failing to retain some mention of him. -- Allstonian 09:42, 8 November 2005</p>

<p>I am an alumnus of NITIE and presently working as a Management Consultant with a leading Consulting firm in India.</p>
<p>NITIE is a premier institute in India and offers admission only to creme` de la creme` of the country for its post graduate programs.</p>
<p>The flagship courses at the institute include the Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Management (PGDIM), the Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Engineering (PGDIE) and the Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Safety and Environment Management (PGDISEM).</p>
<p>The institute is focused on developing techno managers by grooming the elite engineers to take up management responsibilities. The institute takes in top performing students at the Common Admission Test (CAT) for the PGDIM program and the GATE for the PGDIE program.</p>
<p>The illustrious alumni of the institute bear the testimony to the quality of the students and the programs. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 202.149.212.242 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.149.212.242_f8b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.149.212.242">contribs</a>) 08:25, 24 October 2005.</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Thank you for your feedback. I have to admit being new to the addition of pages, but I am at loss to see where you are backing your claims up that this is an advert or overtly resorting to propaganda. Reading the 'What Wikipedia is not' page leads me to believe, in section 1.4, that an article written 'in an objective and unbiased style' on a company that is third party verifiable is allowed. If there are parts of the article that lead to it being biased, I will clear them up, as long as they are pointed out. I do admit to using the company's website as well, though I do not think I made claims using that information that are biased. Lastly, though 'being a business' is not notable, being a business that clearly impacts the community around it is notable. Because of their presence in municipal and provincial government (as well as working with the RCMP in the area), they have a clear hand in the community around Victoria, British Columbia. And, while you may toss this out of hand, I am not an employee of Novus, I am the son of a police officer whose department's network security relies on Novus. Pfizerman 22:49, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If the buisness is significant to the community, and therefore notable, the article should say so, and say why. The tone of the current article feels very much, to me, like a corproate flier. That often gets negative reactions here.

<li><b>Keep</b> By looking at the list of clients it is clear this company plays an important role in Canada. However, there are three links to the company website, which make it sound like an advertisement.

<li>Just a further addendum, on the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> issue, one of the inclusions into wiki's qualifications is "The company holds more than a 20% share in the market area that it competes in." I did some research, and since they handle, or help handle, the majority of CRD networks, I think that qualifies them as having more than a 20% of the share in the area they compete in for CRD networks. If this is too flimsy an inclusion, please let me know. Pfizerman 00:36, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have been with the Paradox Foundation for almost a year, and have proof of its existance dating back to at least October of 2003. So unless this is a very long hoax in the making, the Paradox Foundation was not created for the purpose of supporting a hoax. Just by looking at the sheer amount of material on Paradox Poetry and the other sites, it should be very clear that this is not part of a larger hoax, and should be analysed on it's own merit. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoweman_1dd2.html" title="User:Howeman">Brendan</a> 04:48, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>Looks like advertising. Riboperine is a trademark, a look at http://www.health-search.com/p-vitc.htm showed that Riboperine was marked with the "TM" superscript. It is not a chemical substance which can be found in chemistry textbooks. All the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Riboperine&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Riboperine&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">Google hits</a> point to pages selling the product, I think the only product, which contains this component. Finally the link at the end of the article seems to suggest that this was made to advertise. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 12:26, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> per precident. But I really dislike how it's considered ok to make an article about a municipality without one single link (initially), making it difficult for somebody not familiar with the place to verify, or find more info. I first thought Saint-Lin-Laurentides is the official name of the municipality, which is the lowest order of government, with no furhter legal subdivisions. That's why I initially added a link to their web site. But, comments above, about 2 components, leave me confused as to what the article is about. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 05:26, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Defense: I have maintained an extremely effective social protest weekly newsletter for THREE YEARS with a subscriber base of over 100,000 people internationally. I am well-known for taking creative and serious positions on controversial social issues. This is in no way a VANITY article, by your definition - as thousands of subscribers will attest, (if perhaps you would like me to have them email you directly in my next newsletter with support.) I suggest you give serious consideration to what is intended by my entry - looking at the implications - and the ways that it can be expanded as the Church of Shaddapology is granted status as a registered religion in the upcoming months. ~~Joe Dolce, Nov 4, 2005.</p>

<li><b>STRONGEST POSSIBLE DELETION</b>. - The FINAL Deletion. The MOTHER of All Deletions. " - Ok Folks, I bow to the consenus regarding deletion of Shaddapopogy and The Church of Shaddapology as unsuitable for Wikipedia. Delete away and I trust you get a warm feeling from it. (Although I do recall that Walt Disney had a 'cabinet' of ten advisors and would only go ahead on one of his ideas if NINE of them thought it was bad. I don't think Walt wouldn't have done too well on Wikipedia either. I noticed Shaddapology got one KEEP and even though it was unsigned, thank you O anonymous one! - if it was good enough for Mickey Mouse, it's good enough for me.) Some comments: ' Carnildo - 'anyone can make a parody religion?? Really?? Let those amongst you who have made a parody religion cast the first stone. Biting the newcomer. Go to the back of the Wikipedia class. The deepest comment of course was Ben Aveling's 'agrodolce' (sweet and sour) encouragement, ' I liked your song - but your pages aren't of the same high INTELLECTUAL quality. ' Think about that one. I will admit that 'Shaddap You Face' had more footnotes. Point taken. Say, if anyone is interested on the true meaning of BITING, look at how 'Shaddap You Face' has been trashed (and praised) by every type of critic on this planet over the past 25 years, read the Review Section of my website - I have put them all there to remind me (and all of us) to be humble.</li>

<p>Finally, I think this whole 'vanity' issue on Wikipedia is defective, disempowering and destructive thinking, folks, sorry. In Australia, it is known as 'pulling your head in,' and 'the tall poppy syndrome' - one is not supposed to dress loudly or stand out too much. To Think too loudly. To think outside the box. Otherwise they get the chop. God forbid, you don't get a Google Hit. So one is not supposed to blow one's own trumpet? Would someone please tell that to Muhammed Ali (I am the GREATEST!), Jesus Christ ( I am the SON OF GOD). Salvadore Dali (' Before Dali, nothing!) PT Barnum (The Greatest Show on Earth) and pretty much every pioneering inventor and artist who has ever lived. . . The REVERSE is actually true about trumpet blowing. As Louis Armstrong once quipped, 'Who else is supposed to blow it?' I believe that the best one to write about one's own work - is always oneself. <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Dolce_84a4.html" title="Joe Dolce">Joe Dolce</a>, Nov 5, 2005 Melbourne.</p>
<p>Joe,</p>
<p>You're blowing your trumpet in a library.</p>
<p>My suggestion, and I'll help with this if anyone else thinks it's a good idea, is for the page <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Dolce_84a4.html" title="Joe Dolce">Joe Dolce</a> (the page about Joe Dolce that we all own) to be trimmed down and kept, and most of the lists of achievements and the stuff on the shadapology pages and so on to be moved to <a href="../../../d/o/l/User%7EDolcej_ac5a.html" title="User:Dolcej">user:dolcej</a> (the page about Joe Dolce that (I gather) Joe Dolce owns).</p>

<dd>There are pages dedicated to image boards and unreleased video games as well. What exactly is wrong about a book thats currently being written? There is a page listed for Harry Potter book seven. That book isn't even finished being written, where as The Diary Series 1 (books 1-6) is. The Author is currently looking for a publisher. But Harry Potter Book 7 remains there. I could argue that it shouldn't have its own page and that it should be included on the main harry potter page until released since the book is unpublished.

<li>Two wrongs don't make a right. Many of those other speculative articles are also put up for deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b>; in fact, we have no numerical evaluation of probability of the next Harry Potter book being actually published; we however do not even have a numerical evaluation for the notability of a web site, a blog, a movie, etc. That's why we have this AfD page instead of a bot removing articles.

<li><b>Comment</b>. So the only reason out of that list of 4 "checks" that must pass for it to stay is its veriability? But isn't the fact that it has a reliable source, and numerous other sources that, if read, would prove the information on our entry is reliable?
<p>"Fact checking is time consuming. It is unreasonable to expect other editors to dig for sources to check your work, particularly when the initial content is questionable. The burden of evidence lies with the editor who has made the edit. Editors should therefore be specific, avoid weasel words, and provide references, linking to the source if it's online, and giving a brief citation in brackets after the sentence if it isn't."</p>
<p>We've pointed to numerous sources, all that contian this work. Including an online site that might actually be in the process of publishing it. These aren't personal websites, but more along the lines of Wikipedia that it has a porfessional approach to it. Proof that this is the material of the series has been presented by numerous people who are indeed fans of the series, and have been following it since its release in October of 2003.</p>
<p>The point being that the Diary is known to a group of people, just like fans of a videogame or web comic. This begs me to ask how an Image Board like 2chan (japanese image board) has a huge section dedicated to it? Maybe I'm missing a small point? ~Seth 24.53.55.94 00:34, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>.-I can confirm that I am a gigantic Diary-holic. I live, eat, breathe, sleep, and dream The Diary. I tell everyone about The Diary, and every time I do, they become fans of it aswell. It already has a large following, and given the fact that it continues to grow as more fans pass it on by word of mouth, it has the makings of a Cult Classic (no pun intended, of course).

<li>Just because he mentioned Hitler doesn't mean this discussion will turn to that. That also means he doesn't speak for the rest of the fans. You seem to urge for a speedy closure to something that you probably haven't even given the chance to read. The sources are there, and we've proved the one law (Verafibility)that you've thrown against us to be falsely accused. Bloodcider's comment may have this closed, but by all means not throw this topic (not discussion) into the deleted category. We proved the sources, and nothing has been said. In all honesty all I see are people wanting this deleted. No reason what so ever, especially because I failed to see a written rule that CLEARLY states we cannot have an unpublished source. ~Seth Walker Drew 15:49, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Furthur more, I have yet to see someone actually check the FictionPress sources to verify our reasoning. We have so many naysayers here jumping at us, but when one person trying to back this up makes a small misguided comment its an automatic loss to the argument.

<p>Instead we have people finding other ways to delete the topic, other than trying to finish the origional debate itself. I've brought the topic back to the discussion at hand.

<li><b>Keep</b> Seeing as myself as well as others have already referenced and gone to its availability on the reputable site Fictionpress (that even has Quiki page as well I might add), the fans have spoken out (some more intensely than others) showing that there is a fan base and it is in fact notable. And the idea of the 10,000 sold idea is negated seeing as unpublished works like Harry Potter Book 7 have pages with only speculation. Seeing as the Harry Potter 7 has not even been written yet (per the authors admission) 10,000 copies is impossible. Furthermore, unless this is a standard being taken by Wikipedia as a whole it's merely dumb to suggest it. The data contained within this page is not speculative and is from an already released source.
<p>And while it hasn't been published and brought into print, one could make the argument that seeing as it is displayed on fictionpress it is in fact published on the net. -Chaossaber. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.66.128.62 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.66.128.62_133b.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.66.128.62">contribs</a>) , at 03:34, 2005 November 6.</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Ok, here's the comment I promised. I'm sorry I couldn't get around to it sooner, been doing stuff around the wiki. As I've said above, when writing an article for an encyclopedia, one has to have good sources on the <i>subject</i> one is writing about (in this case, a work called The Diary). Most encyclopedias have very high standards for for "inclusion": the subject must be noteworthy enough that it is a recognized field of study, or at least has several scholarly or otherwise good quality works devoted to it. Wikipedia is a very inclusive encyclopedia, comparatively. Where the Britannica might only accept subjects with at least several high quality books, monographs, these, journal articles etc devoted to it, Wikipedia accepts even subjects whose only basis is, say, a newspaper article (this does not mean the subject will automatically get its <i>own page</i>, but it can find a place somewhere in it). Do note that although Wikipedia is very liberal in this way, it is nevertheless an encyclopedia and has rules for sourcing/referencing that must be followed.
<p>What are these rules? The official documents WP:V and WP:RS provides the basic ones. Multiple independent sources attesting to the claims made in the article are strongly urged, although sometimes a single independent, very reputable or high quality source for a claim is quite sufficient.</p>
<p>For an article on a book, these sources could be many things. For example, a thesis written on a book is a good source for an article written on that book. A book review in <i>The New York Times</i> is a good source. Critiques of the book in scholarly journals are a good source. A book written on the book is an excellent source. A magazine article about the book is an acceptable source (for Wikipedia), etc. Of course, <i>the book itself</i> is one source, the primary, but one generally cannot write a good encyclopedia article on the book if <i>it</i> itself is the <i>only</i> thing available—certainly not on Wikipedia, whose contributors are anonymous editors who cannot write original analysis and let it stand on their names. When writing a NPOV article, you'd have to write a balanced work, and if the book is so un-noteworthy that no one has ever critiqued or written anything on it in a thesis or book or magazine/newspaper article, that suggests the work is not suitable for an encyclopedia article.</p>
<p>There are no works of any kind on The Diary. It's basically something written by a person ("Bodster"—himself or herself anonymous) and placed in parts on the net. There are no sources. To claim that the piece on the net is itself a sufficient source is incorrect: this is self-referential (I cannot write a story about my dog, place it on a website, and then claim that encyclopedias should have an article on my dog using the website as a source. We depend on reputable publishers who are able to fact-check and peer-review to denote noteworthiness for us: if for some reason my dog is very notable—the last of a breeed that has had a story written in <i>National Geographic</i>, for example, then yes, that's a perfectly acceptable source. But not a self-referential website I wrote myself). In writing about a book the book is always a primary source (even one only placed on the net), but it is by no means sufficient for an article. Otherwise, Wikipedia will simply be a directory of things and claims made on the net; it most certainly <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">is not</a>.</p>
<p>For a good example of a proper article written on a book, see <i><b><a href="../../../o/r/o/Oroonoko.html" title="Oroonoko">Oroonoko</a></b></i>. Note the reference not just to the work itself, but to multiple sources <i><u>on the work</u></i>. Note the NPOV nature of the writing. Now, you might say that this is a bit unfair: that article is a feaured article written by one of Wikipedia's best editors, himself a literature professor/expert; shouldn't you be able to write a short stubby piece that might grow? Fair question. However, there must be a good solid reason for us to take the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/eventualist" class="extiw" title="m:eventualist">m:eventualist</a> view, ie., why should we believe that 5 years from now or ten years from now The Diary will be a profoundly noteworthy subject, with multiple reviews, books, theses, or monographs written on it? Will <i>The London Review of Books</i> be saying something about it in a few years, in the way we have no doubt whatsoever they'll be saying on <a href="../../../b/o/o/Harry_Potter%7E_Book_Seven_08de.html" title="Harry Potter: Book Seven">Ms Rowling's seventh</a>? There is absolutely no reason to believe that, and we have no evidence for it. But perhaps. Perhaps one day The Diary will be famous and noted. But until then, until it can satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, I don't see <s>a reason for us to</s> how we can write an article on it. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000066">encephalon</font></a> <i>15:33, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</i></p>

Something can't be noteworthy until there's something there for that adjective to discuss. So... let's not pretend this has anything to do with how noteworthy it is.

I noticed a majority of the deleted requests are just previous statments, most of which have been proved wrong. FIND where it says you need X books to be noted. FIND where it says Fictionpress is noted and see that we've proved a reliable source. I looked at the other sections on Wiki to get an article cleared and we've passed all the requirements. This whole argument we've been refered to pages to get this article cleared and there is nothing saying directly what we can and can't have, minus the help page (which, by looking at, gives us the green from what it says). I want to see those who marked this for deletion to get the EXACT excerpts on Wiki's rules, and link them to this argument, since me (and numerous others) haven't found any significant reason for this article not to go up. Even after searching the rules page. Drew 22:16, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Case in point. Harry Potter Seven and it's three wiki pages. It is not in print. So... do you have anything to argue that hasn't already been discounted? I mean because like you said, Wikipedia is not a crystal ball so regardless of how many little rabid fans are interested in it, it still negates your argument. Furthermore, The Diary has been released so it's no longer in the same category as rabid fans speculating on a book that hasn't even begun to be written. -Chaossaber <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 150.201.116.206 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_150.201.116.206_5911.html" title="Special:Contributions/150.201.116.206">contribs</a>) 23:27, 2005 November 8.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep'</b>. As a longtime user of wikipedia, I do beleive that your grounds for deletion of this article are rather, harsh.. For example "madness combat" a free downloadable game that HASN'T been published in any hard copy format hasn't sold any copies whatsoever yet it hasn't been suggested it should be deleted (url to madness is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madness_Combat" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madness_Combat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madness_Combat</a>)
<p>Also based on your criteria that the diary entry should be deleted, upon the same criteria should not also the runescape entry be deleted (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuneScape)And" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuneScape)And" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuneScape)And</a> yet another entry which should be deleted upon your criteria, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Dead" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Dead" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Dead</a> the urban dead game. 'Wait a cotton picking minute, these haven't been deleted, why? because they are popular of course.</p>
<p>Now just a moment, how can you measure how popular it is? by statistics alone? I think not as no statistics for these online free community based games are readily available or corroborable by any mainstream News papers or the media, so How do you measure that they are worthy of wiki, if its because they have a web location then I present to you a download link&#160;: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/bodster002/diaryseries1.zip" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/bodster002/diaryseries1.zip" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/bodster002/diaryseries1.zip</a> Thankyou for your time, and please... read the diary you may just like it as it is a free endeavour written by bodster and supported by his community and fans. -Termin8tor <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Termin8tor (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Termin8tor_04fe.html" title="Special:Contributions/Termin8tor">contribs</a>) , at 19:54, 2005 November 9..</small></p>

<li><b>Comment for new users</b>. Hi again guys. I realize Wikipedia norms and conventions can take a little getting used to. Firstly, there seems to be a little trouble with signing comments. When you write on any Wikipedia page, you can sign your comment by placing four tildes at the end of your comment. Like so:~~~~. (To type a tilde, use the key just below the Esc key on most keyboards). If you have a Wikipedia account and you are logged in, typing four tildes in succession produces your Username signature. If you don't have an account or are not signed in, it will produce the IP address of the computer you are using. Always sign any post you make, whether or not you have an account.
<p>Secondly (and this goes for everyone here, not just new editors), feel free to express your opinions forthrightly; Wikipedians appreciate your thoughts and the open exchange of ideas. <b>However</b>, please always comment within the confines of our <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">civility</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">no personal attacks</a> policies. These policies are taken very seriously on Wikipedia: please honor them.</p>
<p>Thirdly, do <i>not</i> alter other users' comments. This is almost always frowned upon. Comments by new users are sometimes lightly edited by experienced Wikipedians to make the page readable in accordance with WP commenting conventions or to mark unsigned comments. Outside of such actions, comments by individual users should virtually never be touched or altered.</p>
<p>Fourthly, Wikipedia is written almost entirely through the voluntary effort of thousands of editors (like you and me). Editors are not employed. I do not have any "staff" on Wikipedia; neither does any other editor. Just thought I'd clarify that in reponse to a remark above. If you'd like assistance feel free to contact an experienced Wikipedian, or ask <a href="../../../h/d/_/WP%7EHD_6530.html" title="WP:HD">here</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/o/WP%7ENOOB_55f7.html" title="WP:NOOB">here</a>. Very kind regards <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000066">encephalon</font></a> <i>21:02, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</i></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Alright, let me make sure you guys that want this deleted know you're basic English. I have had the word 'publish' in my vocabulary for years, and if you do not know how to use it, please, save the world, and do not use it. Here is the definition, according to my dictionary and www.dictionary.com.</li>
</ul>
<p>Publish</p>
<p>1. To prepare and issue (printed material) for public distribution or sale.</p>
<p>2. To bring to the public attention; announce. See Synonyms at announce.</p>
<p>Okay. Please look at the number one for a quick second, and read it carefully. Basically, it is saying that you publish means that people can see it, free or sold. Pretty basic right there. But, lets move to the number two.</p>
<p>The second number is the most important one. It informs you that publish means to bring whatever material to public attention, or basically, announce the material. What does public mean? Here:</p>
<p>Public</p>
<p>1. Of, concerning, or affecting the community or the people: the public good.</p>
<p>2. Maintained for or used by the people or community: a public park.</p>
<p>Alright, this one is easier. We are all people, even if we are on the internet. Yes, you are in a world with people, everywhere. So, public also means it can be in the internet, as long as there are people.</p>
<p>So, you might be asking, what does this have to do with the Diary? I'll explain it to you. You guys were arguing that 'The Diary' is not a published book. Well, according to the definition of publish, as long as it has been made, and people could find it, it is published. And the Diary can be found in it's website, <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/the_diary/" class="external free" title="http://www.freewebs.com/the_diary/" rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebs.com/the_diary/</a> , and fictionpress, <a href="http://www.fictionpress.com/~bodster" class="external free" title="http://www.fictionpress.com/~bodster" rel="nofollow">http://www.fictionpress.com/~bodster</a> . Is that enough proof, or do you guys still want to argue? KiteMan 02:36, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is not worthy of a professional encyclopedia for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1) by far, the single most important reason for deletion is that the "poll" was not done with a statistically acceptable method.</p>
<p>2) using a NPOV, entries such as (but not exhaustive) Martha Stewart, Barbara Bush, George H. W. Bush, Laura Bush, Ellen DeGeneres, Brett Favre, Phil McGraw, Condoleezza Rice, and Arnold Schwarzenegger shouldn't be in the top 1000 list, let alone the top 100.</p>
<p>3) using the #1 voted individual, Ronald Reagan, should alert anyone to the unscientific nature of the "poll"</p>

<p>I'd love to verify the veracity of the Misao awards, for instance why they've given this RPG the same award 3 years in a row, but the website appears to not exist.

<p>It's a tree. One particular tree. On the campus of Oberlin College. It's been there for a long time, and a lot of people go sit under it and smoke pot. Julie Adams calls them The Arboreal Sages. I call them, and the tree, non-notable. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 20:34, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree. The tree is just as if not more important to the school and community than many of the buildings and most of the people at the school. If you were interested in the history of the school, you might find this notable.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, there are quite a few London streets that merit articles, but this don't seem to be one, unless there's something more to say (a Vine St. was mentioned in one Pogues song, but I don't think that does it). Besides, according to our <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly_%28game%29.html" title="Monopoly (game)">Monopoly (game)</a> article, the original version does not have a single street with an article to itself (and only <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boardwalk.html" title="Boardwalk">Boardwalk</a> mentions the correct street at all).

<li><b>Comment</b> Two points: First, I think there's a cultural gap opening up here: on this side of the Atlantic the London version of Monopoly - arguably the most popular board game ever invented - is the definitive version of the game. I've no idea how many people (in the UK and elsewhere) have heard of and grown up with this version, but the number must run over hunrdreds of thousands and into the low millions. (So it's hardly a local edition!) Secondly, with something so famous why should there not be an entry for each sqaure of the London board? (Ideally, with copyright permission, to feature an image of the appropriate card). It is of interest to find out that Vine Street has no other claim to fame than it's inclusion on the (over here) most famous Monopoly board.

<dd>Note: There is a difference between vanity publishing and POD (print on demand publishing). Both are self-publishing and sufficient grounds for deletion, but people who work with a vanity publisher actually have to pay to have their book published wile there's also options that allow no upfront costs and give part of the profit to the corporation in question. When there's no upfront costs, it's not vanity publishing (technically) but the result remains vanity by Wikipedia terms. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:23, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I inderstand what you're saying, but I think the term vanity press was coined before PoD was invented and, in the end, it's a difference that makes no difference: the publication is, in encyclopaedic terms, insignificant. But I'll use "self-published" in future. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 20:34, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You all digust me. None of these books are being put down as advertisements. The books DO exist and they are Publish on Demand at Cafepress.com, if you had done a real search for the MOREMONEY front. And who decides what a lack of notability is in a site that is being sold as having conttributions from all regions of the world. If you want to suppress word of my books being spread, then go ahead. Yeah, they're not famous now, no one's ever heard of them, sure,but deleting this article will only be detrimentaing it ever becomig big. Publishing on Demand is a fairly new innovation and all these not book deserve note for that, if nothing else. And check out my books NUKE TALES FROM CVN 70 and AGAINST THE SUMMONER available at Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com. Yeah, you've probably never heard of them either, but their sales are actually pretty good for a nobody like myself.</li>

<li>If "they're not famous now, no one's ever heard of them" as the person claiming to be th author says above, that pretty well proves that they are not notable. Wikipedia is not a venu for eritign about little known or unknown works in hopes that they will become famous. Taht is what blogs, homepages, and other such sites are for. Wikipedia is for writing about things already well know, or important or significant for soem other reason, so that people who whant to know maore about them can learn.
