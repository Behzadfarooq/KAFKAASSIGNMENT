<li><b>Keep Some</b> some have notability and i am working on notability for Union Mill ES. A few have no use but some are notable. Floris is I belive the oldest public school in Fairfax county and Clifton is one of the oldest in Northern VA, although not public in the begining. Union Mill is named after this mill on Bull Run creek that supplied stuff for the battles of Manassas in the Civil War, and has a grindstone from the mill (see photo in article) on display in front of it. I have no notability for Herndon, Sunrise, or Mosby, however. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeepOnTruckin_39c2.html" title="User:KeepOnTruckin">KeepOnTruckin</a> 21:56, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b>. I believe the major problem here is likely the absence of references in this articles or a plethora of relevant links that could help establish a more fine-tuned and reliable article. I believe that if enough information can be presented for an independent article, then in the terms of public schools, the school should receive its own article. The main reason behind notability guidelines is to allow for sensible articles that are not commercially representing or self-representing. If an article is able to provide a good deal of substance that is backed by <i>reliable references</i> then I support it. However, for the meantime, since this article does not adequately meet all of these guidelines, it should me merged. Another option is tagging the article with clean up tags and need references tags to see if that information is actually available. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh17_09da.html" title="User:Sukh17">Sukh17</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><sup><a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh17_5dc2.html" title="User talk:Sukh17">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sukh17_a7a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sukh17">Contribs</a></sup></span> 22:38, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep all</b> per KeepOnTruckin. Fairfax County Public Schools is a notable school district in the US. For example, <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunrise_Valley_Elementary_School_cc97.html" title="Sunrise Valley Elementary School">Sunrise Valley Elementary School</a> has been cited in several news reports, such as <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_3875871" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_3875871" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for its educational program.

<li>The first citation you give is a short mention in the article; the article is not about Sunrise Valley, it is about efforts to teach children about finance.

Also, you have misread the Denver-post/washington-post article, the first half of the article was devoted to Sunrise Valley, more than a "short mention". The article clearly satisfies the criteria of having multiple reliable sources. Also there are now strong claims of notability. I wish to note also that at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rachel_Carson_Middle_School_76af.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rachel Carson Middle School">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rachel Carson Middle School</a>, the notability of another school was overlooked.

<li>I apologize if you feel this is a personal attack, that's not my intention. But I have to note that your arguments were being selective, e.g. you noted that the 2nd reference is of a "community paper", but failed to mention that the first reference is from the nationally-distributed "washington post" posted in Denver. Of course, this bias is probably unintentional on your part, but to avoid further nick-picking, I suggest we just move on, and not to challenge each other's argument unless there is gross error or something significantly new to add. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 07:56, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> All schools are notable to me, and I am happy to read an article on any school on wikipedia, regardless of district. Brianyoumans, you have consitently stated that the reason you want these articles deleted is because they have no assertion of notability/they arent notable enough to be on wikipedia. Let me say this again, citing the guide to deletion (my apologies if I am making the same argument twice) <b>"the fact that you haven't heard of something, or don't personally consider it worthy, are not criteria for deletion. You must look for, and demonstrate that you couldn't find, any independent sources of sufficient depth."</b> "Lack of "notability" is not a criterion for deletion, because (among other reasons) this isn't specifically stated in the deletion policy; and since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Paper" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a> and has no size limits [except those of the server...not important here], there's no reason why Wikipedia shouldn't include "everything" that fits in with the other criteria, such as <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>". If these schools are such a non-notable topic, then people wont search for them. They arent harming Wikipedia, but they are helping anyone who read them. In fact, if "we delete articles solely due to their obscurity, currently obscure, or seemingly obscure, subjects may gain more popular interest at a later date. In such a case, deleted articles will constitute a loss of valuable (and perhaps, in the transitory world of the internet, irreproducible) information." "Non-notable" is a non-NPOV designation, therefore not abiding by policy. The person who authored the article probably believes that the topic is notable enough to be included. "Writing 'Delete, non-notable' is not about whether the articles should be in Wikipedia, but rather that it is a quick phrase that does not tell everyone else why the article is non-notable". Brianyoumans, <i>you</i> need to prove that all these school articles aren't notable. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeepOnTruckin_39c2.html" title="User:KeepOnTruckin">KeepOnTruckin</a> 04:34, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I feel no need to demonstrate their non-notability. I think you are confusing "notability" and "verifiability". I'm not sure where you are quoting from, but my fundamental objection to these articles is that, since they are not (in my view) notable, they then fall under "Wikipedia is not a directory" and "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information" from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. If you come up with something notable on one or two of these schools, the articles can always be recreated. But how likely is it that ALL these schools are notable? This isn't <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Wobegon_eb1a.html" title="Lake Wobegon">Lake Wobegon</a>, where "all the children are above average".&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 05:01, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>KeepOnTruckin has misunderstood the instructions on the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a> which clearly states that the need to check for sources is part of the nomination process. We can therefore assume that the person who nominated the article was unable to find any suitable sources to justify the notability of this particular school. The onus is not on the people involved in the deletion debate to find such sources. We can only judge the article on what is written. If there are sources which prove the school's notability then it is up to that article's editors to do a re-write and include suitable references. As the article stands there is nothing in the article to indicate that the school is in any way notable and it should therefore be deleted. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahliarose_da64.html" title="User:Dahliarose">Dahliarose</a> 20:32, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
