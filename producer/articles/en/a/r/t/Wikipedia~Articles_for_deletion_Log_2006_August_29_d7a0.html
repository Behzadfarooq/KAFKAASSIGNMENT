<li><b>Weak Keep if improved</b> The main flaw with this article is an apparent GTA3 onwards bias. If the article was more appropriately named, this wouldn't be a problem.

<li><s><b>Keep and complete rewrite</b>, per LinaMishima. The article has potential and could serve as the "plot and storyline" segment for all <i>GTA</i> games; it just isn't written in a manner that would be considered encyclopedic (list-only passages, in particular), and disregards pre-<i>GTA III</i> games and also <i><a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Theft_Auto_Advance_3abb.html" title="Grand Theft Auto Advance">GTA Advance</a></i>. Also consider fairly good examples such as <i>StarCraft</i> storyline and <i>Half-Life</i> series storyline. The <i>Half-Life</i> series storyline article in particular was actually spawned from <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Half-Life_2_a32c.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Half-Life 2">FAC comments on <i>Half-Life 2</i></a> that its plot section is far too long for the parent article; thus, to me, a merge to respectable articles is not advisory and a specialized article is a better way to go to avoid needless rewriting in an event any of the <i>GTA</i> articles undergo an FAC nomination. ╫ <b><a href="../../../z/s/_/User%7EZS_3578.html" title="User:ZS">２５</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/_/User_talk%7EZS_8bf1.html" title="User talk:ZS"><font color="green">◀RingADing▶</font></a></sup></b> 10:54, 30 August 2006 (UTC) ╫</s>

<li><b>Delete</b>, as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> specifically mentions that Wikipedia is not a collection of plot summaries. This information should be merged into the respective articles, if anything, but since that information already appears to exist there I don't believe it needs an article unto itself.

I find these summaries hard to follow, and yet I've played two of the four games to completion! I honestly think this is far better covered by the paragraph-style summaries on each page. They tell who Ken Rosenberg is, and <i>why</i> Claude was betrayed, without introducing unproven details like Maria being Salvatore's wife. By all means move it to <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:gta" class="extiw" title="wikia:gta">Grand Theft Auto Wiki</a>, but it doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 21:22, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s>You obviously don't know what your talking about because your so called unproven fact has actually been proven. You may be interested to know that both Salvatore and Maria say that there married in Liberty City Stories. All real GTA fans know this. So next time do a little research before you call something unproven.

<li>I'm talking about proven as in <i>references</i> (either quoting dialogue or even just saying "as revealed in"), rather than it being true or not; it doesn't matter whether it's true, it needs proof and context to back it up. Your response only further reinforces my point: 99% of the 2001 section is drawn solely from GTAIII, but where the wife detail comes from isn't explained, similar to how Claude is called Claude without noting when this name was confirmed. If people who have played one or none of the games are to understand they need to know where the name Claude came from all of a sudden, and why Maria is married when not a word was said about it in GTAIII.

<li>As <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProSieben_9868.html" title="User:ProSieben">ProSieben</a> said below. Its unrealistic to have a link to every detail in order to prove them.

I don't want to get in an argument but what you said is unrealistic. I can assure you that everything in that article is proven fact. Take my word or not. It doesn't bother me.

<li>alright, the title was changed very early for no particular reason, since then it has been changed back, and has gone over a bit of an overhaul. The reason the <i>timeline</i> was brought to life in the first place, was to sort out all the different references to the different games, within the games. All the GTA games in the GTA III era reference another game, and often it gets confusing. The timeline sorts out, what happened where and when. It's not so much a plot summery as it is a timeline sorting out the very confusing sequence of events.-<a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanfon_9d3c.html" title="User:Ganfon">Ganfon</a>
<ul>
<li>I am responsible for changing the title. The initial justification for the renaming was that even with the older <i>GTA</i> games' far more simplistic storylines or the lack thereof, it is worth explaining this in brief and associating it with the expanded storyline of the series' later releases, but not by continuality. The next step is simply sectioning the games by <i>canon and game titles</i>, which would have avoided the confusion resulting from intertwined storylines. The present arrangement, however, with a single linear sequence of location and time, is sure to cause overlapping of all the canons and blur the distinction between the later <i>GTA</i> games and the earlier <i>GTA</i> games, while the <i>GTA III</i>-canon-only exclusivity doesn't invite expansion or proper writing.
<p>I understand your interest of providing a timeline of events in the canon, but the current format of the article is just restrictive and narrow in scope, hence my initial recommendation to have the entire article rewritten with a proper encyclopedia format (but with some designs elements based on the current revision). ╫ <b><a href="../../../z/s/_/User%7EZS_3578.html" title="User:ZS">２５</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/_/User_talk%7EZS_8bf1.html" title="User talk:ZS"><font color="green">◀RingADing▶</font></a></sup></b> 09:58, 3 September 2006 (UTC) ╫</p>

<li>I'd like to applogize to all for my bad, and heat of the moment comment I made earlier on this page. To be quite honest i made it in a fit of anger and actually forgot about it, had I remembered I would have taken it off right away. this is truly embarressing for me and <b>WILL NOT</b> happen <b>ever</b> again. Thank you. that being said I still think that the edits that have been made to the page have made it fit it's title and should <b>remain</b> as it's own article. In response to the thought of including the early GTA games, the timeline is of the recent games that are labled under the <i>GTA III Era</i> timeframe. The earlier games do not play in at all to the events described in the timeline, hence why they are not included.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. RandyWang's justification is valid. Given that the article was created from scratch and is not a result of an article split (otherwise categorizing it as a part of a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_series_3a8d.html" title="Wikipedia:Article series">series of articles</a>) means that it cannot be exempted from the no-plot-summaries criterion in <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">WP:NOT</a>. In addition, the plot summaries in all <i>GTA</i> titles are already sufficient and yet short enough that it doesn't requires any sort of article split.
<p>On the other hand, it has been noticed that substantial amounts of plot summaries were provided in most of the series' character listings; making them hard to track, find and piece together in those pages. It would have been a good idea to move much of these information into a dedicated article, providing easy readability of detailed plot summaries. I have also picked up a long addition in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Theft_Auto_%28series%29_2e74.html" title="Grand Theft Auto (series)"><i>Grand Theft Auto</i> (series)</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grand_Theft_Auto_%28series%29&amp;diff=73202380&amp;oldid=73159663" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grand_Theft_Auto_%28series%29&amp;diff=73202380&amp;oldid=73159663" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> that contains the storyline in the entire series in the form of prose (although it needs work). Merging any of the abovementioned bodies of text into this article would technically categorize it as part of a <i>GTA</i> article series. ╫ <b><a href="../../../z/s/_/User%7EZS_3578.html" title="User:ZS">２５</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/_/User_talk%7EZS_8bf1.html" title="User talk:ZS"><font color="green">◀RingADing▶</font></a></sup></b> 09:58, 3 September 2006 (UTC) ╫</p>

<li><a href="../../../b/u/z/Buzzcomix.html" title="Buzzcomix">Buzzcomix.net</a> definitely has rankings; they're on the front page. (This webcomic is currently 69th.) It and TopWebComics.com are (AFAICT) the main webcomics directories/ranking sites; both rank webcomics based (mainly) on number of user votes. (This has its flaws - webcomics which don't go in for that sort of thing are noticably missing - but enough webcomics take part that the rankings are still useful, as long as you understand and take into account how they work.) - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakomk_1f87.html" title="User:Makomk">makomk</a> 16:22, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> for lacking non-trivial third-party articles about the webcomic; I found a lot of directory listings and a couple of blogs. Google shows only 149 distinct hits out of a weak 735 general hits. Alexa traffic shows a three-month average of somewhere about 1.4 millionth. I don't believe Google is the final arbiter of notability, and Alexa admits its accuracy can be shaky when the ratings are that low, but I think it's symptomatic when a website can't even break a thousand on a general Google hits. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 06:19, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Weak keep</b></s> yeah coverage by reliable sources is the way to go here. Camp has 70+ years of history and is apparently well known and has a lot of alums, the work they do there has been the subject of a multiple published studies <a href="http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=RecordDetails&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ635289&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;objectId=0900000b8007a024" class="external autonumber" title="http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=RecordDetails&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ635289&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;objectId=0900000b8007a024" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. &amp; <a href="http://direct.bl.uk/bld/PlaceOrder.do?UIN=063577467&amp;ETOC=RN&amp;from=searchengine" class="external autonumber" title="http://direct.bl.uk/bld/PlaceOrder.do?UIN=063577467&amp;ETOC=RN&amp;from=searchengine" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which is honestly more than you'd expect from the average summer camp. I can't run a news search from where I am right now, but if it gets 6 results on Google Scholar, I'm pretty sure there's some general news articles on it with meaningful information. No real reason to delete if there's a bunch of reliable information on it... the need for cleanup isn't a reason to delete, and as has been said, there's not a guideline for camp notability that I'm aware of. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 01:54, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

The Cagle website, while very suggestive, does not definitely establish he is actually published internationally, rather than just being pushed around editors' desks. No one has shown he's been published in either the L.A. or N.Y. Times, despite the hints and implications. This is supposed to be a scholarly work, not gossip, and if the documentation isn't there, I can't support a keep nom. 15:32, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ach, I thought it was a town. My whole reasoning was that as a town it probably had better claim to the "Durlan" page than some obscure fictional aliens, and the aliens should be disambiguated to "Durlan (comics)" or something, but at the same time the town article should be deleted until better info came around. It made perfect sense to me at the time.

<li><b>Comment</b> I incline toward a keep, albeit a rather weak keep. It is not particularly notable by itself. In the context of WikiProject Seattle it presumably was included for completeness. The other bridges cited by 24.19.45.139 as part of the same project are of varying degrees of notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> we don't even have a proposed notability standard for structures (masts, bridges, buildings, tunnels, etc...). Without one, I have no rationale to support having an opinion. I do, however, believe that having an standard would be helpful. Modern construction in developed countries will almost always be verifiable due to the way the bidding process for contracts works, but that leads to being an indiscriminate collection of information, so we need something more than just having construction details verifiable. Probably the good old "documents about" with an exclusion for the construction process. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 13:43, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article, as I've stated again and again, seems to not be so much an encyclopedia article as it is a slight bit of a vanity article by the fans of this website. This website has gained a few awards from a site known as DaFastLane, but I haven't been able to locate any information about DaFastLane on Wikipedia (aside from the article proposed for deletion here) or Google (a few hits), and it isn't listed on Alexa. They won five awards in one year, but that does not yet qualify them for notability under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which no other eligibility requirements are met on either.</p>
<p>Until they win these DaFastLane awards again next year, or until they satisfy the requirements another way, I feel it's safe to say that the article deserves deletion. <a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESephylight_3bbb.html" title="User:Sephylight">Sephylight</a> 02:37, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - The actual Alexa rank seems to be 115,037 (as opposed to in the 14000s for Abandonia). I'm not sure it qualifies as "hugely popular", or notable. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 04:14, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Not everything can be measured by an Alexa ranking, Abandonia Reloaded is a site dedicated to freeware games which is in itself a niche market, it is one of the biggest sites in his class providing FREE valuable content to it's visitors through the means of reviews and screenshots. I think this point alone justifies to have Abandonia Reloaded as it's own article. Also even though it might be written by fans (as I imagine is the case for most articles on wikipedia) of the site, the article is written from a neutral point of view. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBraindead1_69c2.html" title="User:Braindead1">Braindead1</a> 20:00, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> - Still, there are standards for what is notable and what isn't, and the site in question hasn't qualified yet under those standards. Merge it with <a href="../../../a/b/a/Abandonia.html" title="Abandonia">Abandonia</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - While the site isn't the most popular by Alexa rankings, it is important to note that the site has gone from being completely unknown to achieve an Alexa rank of 114,065 (as of writing) in just a little over a year. Which in itself is quite the feat, and even though the site was created by four people who originated from <a href="../../../a/b/a/Abandonia.html" title="Abandonia">Abandonia</a>, the two sites are completely different and cater to completely different groups of net-users. Which goes to show that AR has managed to make a name for itself. Another point is that there wasn't really a Freeware center, before AR was created. Generally you had six options before, if you wanted a freeware game, and they were all pretty limited. You could either go to the AGS community or AGI community and get adventure games, go to RPG Maker and get RPGs, go to the Game Maker community and locate games that are mostly puzzle oriented, go to HOTU and try to locate the freeware games in the sea of abandonware (which are mostly AGS, AGI and RPG Maker games), or you could type "freeware" in Google and hope that you would find something you liked after several hours of tiresome searching. AR is truly the first site to gather all freeware games on one site, regardless of age, engine and genre. And due to that diversity the site has active producers with experience from game making in AGS, AGI, Game Maker, as well as independent producers who created their own games from scratch. And while HOTU does have a mix of freeware too, that site isn't revolving around such games. AR is the only site that focuses solely on showcasing these games, and a lot of effort goes into showcasing each game as best as possible, including high-quality banners. Abandonia Reloaded also focuses on helping people create their own games, using whatever engine they themselves want to use (or create). As such, I think the site is worthy to have its own page on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Henrik_98cb.html" title="User:Tom Henrik">Tom Henrik</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - It's difficult to measure anything's notability merely through awards or publications, or by statistics. In fact, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> clearly states that it is meant as a guideline, not as an absolute. The discussion linked to that guideline also shows that even amongst the more dedicated editors, there is no clear consensus on what constitutes notability. Abandonia: Reloaded is a site that is a part of a niche as it is dedicated to showcasing freeware productions, and it is also part of a growing movement to bring these productions to the general populace. The purpose of Abandonia Reloaded, and the purpose of this Wiki article on Abandonia Reloaded is not to advertise or promote traffic (AR is not a commercial endeavor), but rather to educate and inform; which, as I understand it, is the purpose of Wikipedia itself. Allow the editors to revise the article to prevent any tone issues, and expand it so that it may even better fulfill that purpose. Deletion is unnecessary, and considering the site's growth in the last year (from 440,000 to 114,000 in Alexa ranking since January, and from 115,000 to 114,000 in the last month alone), it would likely just be reinstated once this question of ranking is less of an issue, in any case. <a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETaikara_1f91.html" title="User:Taikara">Taikara</a> 21:39, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - As per what Taikara said. Guidelines are guidelines, not specific rules. --<a href="../../../a/b/i/User%7EAbi79_330f.html" title="User:Abi79">Abi79</a> 06:31, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Considering that Abandonia Reloaded has been online for a year and 3 months thus far and to grow that much during that time surely shows a demand for what is being offered. Considering that the site continues to grow and is getting increased views as time is progressing also adds to the fact that the entry should stay. The wiki entry as Taikara has stated is more to educate and inform than to advertise. The wiki will be expanded as time progresses, and the rule that is being expressed for deletion as has been said, is more a guideline than anything and with all the site has managed to accomplish in such a short time, definitely think it deserves it's own entry.<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathDude_3c64.html" title="User:DeathDude">DeathDude</a> 19:29, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is also perhaps notable that Wikipedia is an open project that claims an attitude of anti-elitism in editing. Therefore, it should not matter that I (or my fellow discussion contributors) have edited only one article, or offered my opinion in only one article of deletion debate. However, if it would somehow give my opinion more "power" (though by the definition of anti-elitism, it shouldn't), I can easily copy edit and/or expand other articles (and in fact, I already have). However, in my (apparently less valuable) opinion, it seems that if people care enough about the article to contribute to the discussion regarding its potential deletion, then those opinions should not be completely ignored due to lack of prolificness. <a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETaikara_1f91.html" title="User:Taikara">Taikara</a> 06:50, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've been spending some time reading over the guidelines and principles of Wikipedia, and as Taikara has mentioned, anti-elitism is not an idea that Wikipedia (or it's founder, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a>) support. Jimbo has the only set principles for how to operate Wikipedia in his user page, and it says, amongst other things: "<b>Newcomers are always to be welcomed.</b> There must be no cabal, there must be no elites, there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers." By giving our oppinions lesser value, because we are new to the project is completely against the open-ness and ideology of Wikipedia. And just for reference, just like Taikara, I have been active in other articles in the past, but I wasn't registered then - so you'll have to use my IP if you want a list. But, yes, this is the only discussion I have attended, because I feel that, for once, I have something to contribute to the discussion at hand. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Henrik_98cb.html" title="User:Tom Henrik">Tom Henrik</a> 12:54, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - There're several reasons why this page's not meeting the requirements, even though they've been claimed to be true.</li>
</ul>
<p>For one, those so-called five awards don't belong to Reloaded. They belong mostly to a person, not a site, that person being Kosta, for the work and effort he's put in Abandonia. It's quite pathetic that Reloaded calls his awards as theirs and use them to claim rights on a page on here. The only award that does go to the site, is only a nomination, not an actual award. It needs to be mentioned that for the DaFastLane Awards, anybody can nominate anybody, and the people from Reloaded've all nominated Reloaded for as many things as they could, of which this one got pulled through. Same goes with that "Most helpful scener" award. As Abandonware's spread out over multiple communities, the scener who can have most people vote for him, will win that one, even though I can name ten sceners that're far more helpful, and that's just from one community. The only person that actually's an established value in the scene, is Kosta, who did deserve the awards he got. Those still aren't awards for Reloaded, but for Kosta. In other words, all those so-called awards're self-induced by Reloaded itself, which I don't think will make them count at all.</p>
<p>Another is their so-called claim to be the first site dedicated to freeware games. I don't know where they got that, and everybody knows that's a lie. They even have affiliates on their main page, linking to other freeware sites that've been 'round far longer, so either they don't know their own site or they're lying badly 'bout that.</p>
<p>Yet another thing, which goes hand in hand with the previous part, but seems to've been used as a separate reason, is that they claim that before Reloaded, you had to search the AGS, AGI and Gamemaker communities, and aside from that, using Google. So far, they've pretty much only used the AGS community, so that's been untrue, plus, if they think that's the only way to find freeware games, it just shows the site won't live long enough to become notable, as those that run it show they don't understand what they're focusing on. There are far more ways to get to freeware than just those three, and that's the very basics that should be known to run such a site for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>As far as the notability goes, they have a bit of a point. I know some of my friends know that site, and I know a few freeware game developers that've been in touch with them, and they all think the site provides lowest-quality information (up to the point that some games' information's all in Engrish) and's generally an insult to both the developers as to the games themselves, so they do know the site, but prefer to stay as far away from it as possible. Also, those freeware game developers they did get in touch with, were mostly, if not all, brought in touch with that site by a member they kicked out a long time ago, and although they haven't been in touch with any of those freeware developers, they do seem to claim his work as theirs whenever they can.</p>
<p>Another thing you can notice if you dig around on their and Abandonia's forums, is that they have a high tendency to mob whenever something or somebody has an opinion that goes against them. It's already happening on here, and you can be sure they'll bring more of their croonies in to increase the number of people that back their view up, but always just say the same thing (like Deathdude). So be aware of that. You might see five-six voices here, but they're still just one and a couple of puppets. --195.144.90.5 13:38, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It may or may not be relevant, but the IP of the above poster matches the IP of the mentioned member who was "kicked out", and it seems like more of a personal rant than an attempt to address the issue at hand. To address some of the (fairly decent) points mentioned, however:
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's not relevant indeed, except for that it gives a proper view of the matter, not the heavily-coloured, holier-than-thou view that's given by the AR mob.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It is not stated in the article that any of Kosta's awards belong to AR.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is stated that AR has won "several awards" and it has a link to "Abandonia Reloaded's awards", which clearly shows Kosta's awards there.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It was also not stated in the article that AR is the first site dedicated to freeware, however, I have added a bit to makes sure it is perfectly clear that is not the case.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Tom Henrik said this a bit higher: "AR is truly the first site to gather all freeware games on one site"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It is stated in the article that there is a large ratio of adventure games. However, from the references of the games in the content section of the article, there is obviously more than "just" AGS games on the site.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's true. The ratio's been going from 1/2 AGS games to 1/3th slowly, but quite some people on the forums've been complaining that Abandonia Reloaded should've been called Abandonia AGS or Abandonia Adventures throughout its history, and they all've been kicked out for it. The ratio always've shown this to be a problem, but's always been ignored up til recently, so you can't possibly say it hasn't been focusing on AGS and not on any other engine.</dd>

</dd>
<dd>The issue being discussed here is not quality, or methodology, or the history with the above poster, or his issues with the person who won that "most helpful scener" award or the site itself, as the article makes no mention of any of those. The issue at hand is notability, and the above poster admittedly states that he considers AR to have some notability. <a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETaikara_1f91.html" title="User:Taikara">Taikara</a> 17:07, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>The issue being discussed here is whether or not the page meets Wikipedia requirements. Nor the awards, nor how "special" AR is, nor its notability (as those friends of mine weren't more than five, which can hardly apply as being "notable") That is also what I'm addressing here. If you call countering fake arguments and trying to win a discussion by dropping in as many people that parrot what you want them to say with actual facts a grudge, then yep, I'm talking out of a grudge here.--195.144.90.5 17:51, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We get it, you had issues with the AR community, and you're doing your best to get the article deleted.

<dd>What's having had issues with the community got to do with this? I was talking about why the page doesn't comply with Wikipedia's standards. So far, the "being special", the awards and the notability've been claimed as reasons for that. I don't understand what you think I'm talking about, but that's what this entire discussion's been about. If breaking those Wikipedia policies can be fixed without deleting the page, then please, feel free to let us know how. --195.144.90.5 19:00, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I already have... it's called editing. But as a suggestion, you could probably start by actually reading the <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a> policy, where it clearly states that articles lacking NPOV and containing accuracy issues do not necessarily need to be deleted. However, I think that your objection to the article being kept is quite clear (and we'll just pretend you're refering to notability, and nothing else, as all the other complaints do not require deletion). No need to continue beating a dead horse, unless that's just how you get your kicks. <a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETaikara_1f91.html" title="User:Taikara">Taikara</a> 19:19, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see that I have to both apologize and clarify my earlier statement. (Hopefully without going too far of topic from the discussion at hand). When I said that "Another point is that there wasn't really a Freeware center, before AR was created." and "AR is truly the first site to gather all freeware games on one site, regardless of age, engine and genre." I did not mean that AR was the very first freeware site to have been created. Far from it. What I meant was that AR is the most notable of the lot. If you do a quick Alexa ranking with other sites, you'll find that no-one is ranked as high as AR. (Apart from HOTU, but that isn't a freeware only dedicated site. It just have a lot of freeware games thrown into the mix).</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Traffic Rank for gamehippo.com: 63,957 and Traffic Rank for caiman.us: 31,873 seems to be higher. Besides, if you don't mean that AR is the first freeware site, then it's no use in actually saying it is, as it'll only mislead people that don't know about it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>For instance, www.BigBlueCup.com (The AGS official homepage) has an Alexa rating of 120 353, yet is has a Wikipedia page of its own.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, AGS's been mentioned on various independant sites and's bound to have various independant publications, which's another way besides Alexa ranking to be worthy of a Wikipedia article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There is no doubt that AGS deserves the page, but from a purely Alexa statistical point of view, AR should deserve it more. So, just having a good Alexa ranking should not be the only criteria for an Wikipedia article (as there would be no discussion whether AR deserved it or not, then), but in my mind in order to deserve an article, the site should offer something that no-one else does, and that makes it unique.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The policies're clear on what makes a site apply for being worthy of an article on here and what not. Besides, even if going aside from the policies is a way, then that reason still doesn't apply for AR, as there're other, more well-known sites that've been 'round far longer that offer the same thing.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In AR's case, this uniqueness is found in the effort placed into each single update,</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This effort exists out of "Requirements: Processor recommended", "Bit cheap some enemies" along with other Engrish, leaving entire desktops in the screenshots, so you can even see what song the person that took that screenshot was listening to and a whole lot of empty fields in each information part then? Plus all the mess-ups in the updates themselves?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>the interviews with the makers, the diversity of games hosted (in terms of engine and genres)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, check the ratio of adventure games (which're pretty much all AGS games) against the other games. I wouldn't exactly call diversity of engine and genre a strong point of AR.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>and the banners made for the games. I know that there is an overload of adventure games on the site, and we are trying to fix that. However, as AR is a community driven project, we showcase what people review. As long as we get in more adventure games, than other games - we will continue to put out more adventures.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you check those submissions, that community seems to exist out of Deathdude then. That's one person, who's part of the staff. One person and an occasional passer-by isn't exactly a community, and if that one person's part of the crew, he'd know that there're too many AGS games on there in comparisson with the other genres/engines. In other words, it doesn't exactly show to be a community-driven project, and the focus on one specific engine instead of an equal share of all genres and engines is the site's choice.--Kon-Tiki 18:54, 5 September 2006 (UTC) (aka [User:195.144.90.5|195.144.90.5])</dd>

<p>If you take a look at the forum topic in which we ask the public for help ( <a href="http://www.reloaded.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=116" class="external free" title="http://www.reloaded.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=116" rel="nofollow">http://www.reloaded.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=116</a> ), you will see that the number of Adventure games on that list is very small in comparrison to the other genres. (If the above link is against the rules of this discussion, then I apologize, and a mod should feel free to edit it away). So, in conclusion, I apologize for the above statements that might have been confusing, but I hope that I have managed to get across my views for why I believe that AR deserves an article of its own (and not just be merged with Abandonia).<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Henrik_98cb.html" title="User:Tom Henrik">Tom Henrik</a> 14:31, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I was aware of the existance of this "Salo in Space" article since the day it was created by Mzajac and Mikkalai, and I would probably agree that in part Mzajac and Mikkalai were having fun creating it, as the name "Salo in Space" sounds intriguing for those who are aware of Ukrainian culture and humor. Had the comics be named differently, they would probably not bring that much of attention. But comics' name is a part of the comics. There likely to be other comics, which deserve to me mentioned on wikipedia, and I agree that many need to be mention more than this one. But, it still does not explain the need for deletion of this one.</li>
<li>After spending some time, which I could probably use for a better purpose, I should say that the reference to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> by people who want to delete this page is incorrect. The policy defines web content as "any content which is distributed solely on the internet". The comic series "Salo in Space" does not fail into this category. There is an annual <a href="http://9world.com.ua/" class="external text" title="http://9world.com.ua/" rel="nofollow">Kiev International Festival of Cartoons "9 World"</a>, which takes place in Kiev Planetarium in spring of each year. The "Salo in Space" comics have been <a href="http://9world.com.ua/ru/taxonomy/term/99" class="external text" title="http://9world.com.ua/ru/taxonomy/term/99" rel="nofollow">nominated</a> for presentation at the festival as cartoons of 2005. The festival was open to public. Entrance fee was 2UAH. I think it's not a coincidence that the last "Salo in Space" comics have been released in February, as it coincides with the beginning of 2006 festival. --<a href="../../../k/p/b/User%7EKPbIC_c488.html" title="User:KPbIC">KPbIC</a> 18:07, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - I think Dr. Cat/David Shapiro definitely meets notability requirements.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - The issue is not notability, as I mentioned earlier. I agree, though, that the most logical thing would be to get Dr. Cat's direct opinion. However, I don't wish to call his attention to this article, because to be honest, it's an embarrassment (to both him and myself). Perhaps I should bite the bullet and ask him anyway, since my word doesn't seem to be sufficient (justifiably)... It's frustrating to have written and defended this article for so long and yet be unable to delete it when I feel there is no chance of it meeting Wikipedia policy. -<a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotra_1751.html" title="User:Kotra">kotra</a> 04:27, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. First, less than a <i>month</i> since the last AfD is a bit early to AfD an article again, even when the last one ended with no consensus. Secondly, AfD is not cleanup: We're here discussing whether the <i>topic</i> is fit for discussion in Wikipedia, so it's <i>all</i> about the notability of the person, which I don't think is in question here. Facts that cannot be verified can be removed without deletion of the entire article, but the person's accomplishments are not in doubt. I have no idea whether birth names qualify as "invasion of privacy" etc.; that should be verified with the subject. If it's objectionable and wrong, <i>then</i> the information can be removed or even specific offending revisions may be deleted, but the article as a whole should remain. (I would find it hardly fitting that member of the game industry would stoop to same tricks as certain mr. Thompson, though... =) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 08:44, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Notability is <i>not</i> the only reason to AfD an article. An article may be nominated for deletion if it cannot hope to meet guidelines. Specifically, I do not believe this article can meet both <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> at the same time. The problem is that the only verifiable (despite being slightly incorrect) source available for this article puts forth his birth name. You and I may personally find nothing private about birth names, but that is irrelevant. If the information is removed, then the article is no longer verifiable. This is not something that can simply be resolved through discussion or cleanup, which is why, after weeks of careful deliberation, I decided to put it up for AfD. I understand that it hasn't been long since the last AfD, but I didn't anticipate a problem, due to the issue being completely different from the previous one. -<a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotra_1751.html" title="User:Kotra">kotra</a> 04:26, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>, privacy concerns are irrelevant. This appears to be <s>a bad faith nomination</s> attempting to solve a content dispute.

That said, the subject doesn't meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria.

<dd>My concern is that the only somewhat reliable source (MobyGames) that is able to be referenced for much of the notability of the subject displays his birth name, which the subject has gone to lengths to keep out of the public eye. So, by prominently making reference to such information, I feel that it goes against <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>, specifically <i>"Wikipedia also contains biographies of people who, while notable enough for an entry, are nevertheless entitled to the respect for privacy afforded non-public figures. In such cases, editors should exercise restraint and include only information relevant to their notability."</i> His birth name is not relevant to his notability in this case. Also, <i>"In borderline cases, the rule of thumb should be 'do no harm'."</i> I believe that this is a borderline case and an unusual one, which is probably why I haven't been able to get my point across very well. That and my lack of indisputable proof to back up my claims (although I think that it's apparent from his never mentioning his birth name, even in professional endeavors). I probably made a mistake in AfDing this, but thank you all for commenting and sharing your views. -<a href="../../../k/o/t/User%7EKotra_1751.html" title="User:Kotra">kotra</a> 07:12, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not Notable; this is a local radio show, it's been on the air for about 2 months; as far as I can tell, the article makes no particular claim of notability.

<li><b>Keep.</b> I created the article and I would (obviously) argue for the article's inclusion.

<li><b>Keep</b>. There's no reason to delete this entry, the more information that's available to the public, the better. Plus Adolfo is hilarious.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The show has been on <i>in Boston</i> for two months, after previously being on longer than that in Atlanta. Had a noted flap with Kevin Smith that was discussed on Opie and Anthony.

<p>"Keep". Many local non-syndicated radio shows have Wikipedia entries including Kevin and Bean, Kidd Chris, and The Doghouse with JV and Elvis. Apparently their ratings in Boston do indeed show that they are "notable". The show is known for many national things such as the aforementioned feud with Kevin Smith, and Rich disrupting Martha Burk's protest at the Masters which was covered by every major network and spawned an ESPN Sportscenter catchphrase.</p>
<ul>
<li>'<b>Comment</b>: Kevin and Bean is a show that has been on the air for 15 years and has spawned several albums. The article on Kidd Chris is on him, not his show, and covers his whole career. The Doghouse article is on a show that was supposedly #1 in its market for over a decade. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Toucher_and_Rich_Show_b230.html" title="The Toucher and Rich Show">The Toucher and Rich Show</a> is explicitly on the present BCN show, which has been on air for two months.

<p>Tram stops are, well, tram stops. Except when they happen to be a station they are generally indistinguishable from bus stops.

However, I don't think tram stops are generally not-notable <i>par se</i>. They are more permanent fixtures than bus stops are, and I feel they lie between bus stops (usually deleted) and subway stations (almost always kept) in terms of notability and I feel that stations on light rail systems with separate tracks away from the streets have more in common with with subway stations than bus stops. My delete is without prejudice an article with some more description. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 06:31, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Actually it appears that the Midland Metro acts more like a <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_rail.html" title="Light rail">light rail</a> system, which normally has fixed stops, than a traditional tram. Most of the tram articles seem to have been created in October/November 2005, and have not been updated significantly since. I hope the articles can be expanded in some way, but after this time I'm not sure someone will step up to do it. <s>That said, I'm neutral on this matter.</s> <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 07:43, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I have to say I agree with the above comments (by Tinlinkin and Sjakkalle) that the Midland Metro stops are notable. They have more in common with the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Docklands_Light_Railway_3383.html" title="Docklands Light Railway">Docklands Light Railway</a> stations than they do bus stops, and all the DLR stations have articles. It might also get confusing if too much information is incorporated into the main <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midland_Metro_15dc.html" title="Midland Metro">Midland Metro</a>. I would suggest a sensible course of action would to be to wait.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I spotted these some time ago and we have been waiting for 10 months. If the creator was going to do something substantail he would have done it by now. There seems no danger of too much information; there is virually nothing. If something notable of such length appears that it would overbalance the main article then a separate article could be recreated. The one stop on the site of a former station is <a href="../../../w/e/d/Wednesbury_Great_Western_Street_tram_stop_1dd5.html" title="Wednesbury Great Western Street tram stop">Wednesbury Great Western Street tram stop</a> and there could be an argument for keeping that one. However, the question is why keep them? <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is quite clear - just because they exist is not enough to jusfy an article. This is /policy/ and says <i>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia</i>. What is needed is a good reason for separate articles; remembering all the encyclopaedic info is already in the main article. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 17:40, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This Afd is part of a general anti-piblic transportation slant on Wikipedia. The article is not hurting anyone, and non-notability seems a bit harsh. This appears to be a type of LRT where the stations are "real stations" as opposed to "stops". Just because this happens to be a stub now does not mean that it is not of value to people. I think a lot of people just wish to delete for the sake of deleting. I will point out Wikipedia is not paper. As such there is limitless space for articles. If articles are not used that much, they will not slow down servers. This article appears to meet the LRT guideline, as a "real station" so why not keep it? What are you saving by not including it, except preventing greater access to information about public transportation? <a href="../../../n/l/s/User%7ENlsanand_c56d.html" title="User:Nlsanand">Nlsanand</a> 19:26, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> "except preventing greater access to information about public transportation" is simply untrue. No information is being deleted that is not in the main article. I am arguing that there is no need for 21 articles where 1 would do a better job. It is easier for the reader to find information in 1 place than clicking on 21 articles. /If/ so much encyclopaedic information is gathered on these stops that the main article becomes unbalanced then it can be broken out - initially into a Midland Metro: Tram stops article - that is normal editing practice. "What are you saving by not including it" - you are saving people's time in providing the information they seek in a more accessible form. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 02:34, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

The fact that it was played on the radio doesn't necessarily help either, since that's not exactly hard to achieve.

<li>"'Keep"', If you google "alf house", you get a trail of punk show advertisements dating back to 2002. There's also an article in this weeks Discorder magazine (put out by <a href="../../../c/i/t/CITR_f692.html" title="CITR">CITR</a> radio) a small blurb about this house in the newbies guide to the city. Follow the address below to see it. There are new references on the bottom of the wiki article that are first and second hand information. I'm pretty sure the person who started the wiki article has never lived at the house. The original article was a quotation from a Discorder review of the New Music West Festival (same magazine as above). The show involved a well known band and a dumpster fire. This is a DIY venue in Vancouver Canada, primarily aimed at political and DIY punks. And it's Alf house, not ALF House. What are the 'noteriety' qualifications?</li>

It has a widespread reputation throughout the city, as well as Canada and the United States in general as a venue that has hosted hundreds of shows and many people consider it to be of importance.

<p>As with many list articles, this article has both original research and neutral point of view issues.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Playing two roles in the same film is hardly original research since entries can be easily verified by looking at the cast for the film.

Records</a> appears to be a storefront operation, while Musical Tragedies/Toxic Shock has no Google presence at all. "[B]eing proud to be fat, drunk, and stupid" does not, even in these benighted times, guarantee stardom. I hope.

<li>Uh, I moved this from from a <i>Speedy</i> delete. I don't usually move articles with a good-faith Speedy tag to <i>no</i> delete, out of respect for the original speedy nominator.

<li>I also still think it likely that the article should be deleted, BTW. This is not an AfD on Taang! records. Just because they hooked onto a label that also picked up some later-famous bands in their scufflin' days doesn't necessarily mean a whole lot. Yes they meet the minimum requirement where we are not honor-bound to delete them, but that does not require that they be kept. As the article points out, they were drunk and stupid, and it appears the the subjects of their lyrics were stupifying banal. Absent more information from someone familiar with the band, it seems <i>likely</i> that they were utterly uninfluential and forgettable. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 02:49, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I actually have a problem with the position regarding the relationship of artist to label on Wiki. Anyone signing to a major label seems to get in on that basis alone whereas indie artists have to work much harder. Anyone on their own label seems to get canned straight away. To my mind, this is totally the wrong way around - a label can only be as notable as its artists (FWIW, I disagree with the remarks of Herostratus regarding the bands noted here being in their "scufflin' days" and thus not relevent - getting there first repeatedly is of remark - see <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fierce_Panda_0587.html" title="Fierce Panda">Fierce Panda</a> for an object lesson). Saying an artist is notable because they signed to a notable label is completely wrong as is the notion that an artist that is not signed to a large label cannot be of note. Anyway, having looked at this one a bit more closely, they seem to be an established touring act so it's a <b>keep</b> from me but well worth it for the interesting issue raised regarding transferrable notability. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 20:53, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The conference is notable, since it was a first high-profile washington based apperance of the disclosure project. The BBC report <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1322432.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1322432.stm" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> is a good source, that also testifies about notability. It is not just ANY press conference, it is a conference that is a huge event for the UFO comunity. I bumped on the conference video and imediately checked background on wikipedia, and to my surprise, the article that was there is being considered for deletion. Now, the fact that one can find information on wikipedia about it was great, and deleting it would mean that some people will be denied information about this event. Wiki is not a paper encyclopedia. In short, the conference is a notable event because it is important to the UFO community (btw, i am extremely skeptical to the UFO issue, just as most people, but the conference and the campagn is an event in itself). 137.205.132.170 10:30, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Also, further evidence of notability - this is CNN coverage <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKaMQKaBazU" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKaMQKaBazU" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>These are worth keeping because first of all I spent so much of my time working hard on them. It would be a waste to see them all go. Second of all the majority of these girls have found modeling/acting careers post show. For example Elyse Sewell has done more modeling than all the winners combined.

<dd>For starters, the ones who actually won their respective shows would seem notable (winners of any other reality show seem notable as well, so that solves that quandary). Those who made it to the final episode or however this show works are probably notable for almost winning (that seems to be what the precedent is, but don't quote me off-hand). Those who went on to bigger and better things despite not coming close to winning are probably notable because of what they went on to do. An argument could be made that anyone kicked off or involved in a controversial incident on the show is notable, but I'm not sure if that stands up or applies here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 22:39, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. Unless it's someone like <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Jennings_ed15.html" title="Ken Jennings">Ken Jennings</a>, people don't get wrapped up in the performances of particular game show contestants like they do with those on reality shows. Does anybody watch <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> and root for one of the contestants each night? I watch both game and reality shows frequently...I couldn't tell you who won on Wheel or Jeopardy last night, but I could tell you who got voted off <i>American Idol</i> or fired on <i>The Apprentice</i> last year. With reality shows, you get to know the contestants, their bio info, and their idiosyncracies. That just doesn't happen with most game shows, and that's what makes them more notable. (For the record, I've never seen a single episode of ANTM.) <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirjtc2_8434.html" title="User:Kirjtc2">Kirjtc2</a> 16:56, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well my point is just that in at least these two cases, the nom's stated criteria <i>It is noted in previous AFDs that reality TV contestants generally aren't notable unless they come close to winning the show. Many of these do not assert notability under WP:BIO</i> are not met. A mass deletion is simply not in order here. I don't exactly agree that the competitors on reality shows are no different than game shows -- game show contestants generally appear for only one episide, very little biographical information about them is offered, and game shows in general have a much smaller fan base than shows like ANTM <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 16:43, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My attempt here is merely to simplify a deletion proposal that's incredibly complicated because it proposes 77 (!) articles for deletion. All of my suggestions above are up for discussion. Wasn't it easier for you to check now that I've marked some Delete and you could just skip over them? As I mentioned, I didn't google anyone, but merely tried to sort the stubs from the articles with some content and provide a brief summary of why I think they should be kept, in the interests of inclusion and building a consensus here (which will require compromise for everyone as my first impulse was to keep them all and I've now marked roughly half <b>Delete</b>). It's a tool for the discussion, not the final word on these women's notability. And I realize there's been some unfortunate reversions on the affected pages recently that would get anyone's ire up. And I'm sorry if I somehow misread <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robbyne_Manning_dace.html" title="Robbyne Manning">Robbyne Manning</a> -- I'll have to go doublecheck where I got that she was a Miss Tennesee.

<dd>Most of the sources are the model's MySpace. But we can't use MySpace as a source. Do you understand what I'm trying to say. For example, the Ann Markley page, the majority of the info is from her MySpace. Also ALL these info is available in the hundreds of ANTM fansites.

<dd>There are lots of things that frustrate me with your changes. You ask to cite the obvious. For example you ask to cite about the winner's prize.

<dd>Concerning the source thing again. For example a page like Ebony Taylor's. It is filled with info on the modeling she has done since the show. Yet you ask to source it. The problem is that the majority of the information was taken from MySpace, BUT we can't use it as a source. So what are we supposed to do??

<dd>I can't speak for RMHED, but I generally think when we say a person is NN, we really mean they fail <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. (And <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> if it's a company, and so on, etc.) And I do think the fact that proper sources for many of these articles can't be found outside of their own MySpace pages speaks volumes. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 00:49, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it's still disputable whether or not <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> applies to reality TV characters -- they are real people, but their notability largely depends on their role as characters in a television show. I think a more general guideline, like <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EIMP_460f.html" title="WP:IMP">Wikipedia:Importance</a> might apply here. And when I say that non-notability isn't a criteria for deletion, I'm including <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. There are three official criteria for deletion and notability is not involved, though <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> is, which does, in fact, render some of these articles deletable in my opinion. Though not all. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 01:14, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well... I suppose <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> is right about the link between MySpace sources and non-notability. If we can't find non-MySpace sources for info on the girls, they most likely fall into the NN category. I can find a wealth of information on the winners and several of the girls without going to MySpace, though. <a href="../../../e/l/c/User%7EElcda0_03b8.html" title="User:Elcda0">Elcda0</a> 01:03, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> selective list per Dina. Reality contestants are not inherently notable but may be if they have other achievements outside the narrow confines of the show.

<li><b>Keep</b> the overall winner(s), plus any contestants who have other claims to independent notability. As for the others, I think it's reasonable to keep an article on each one if (1) the show is <i>actively</i> on the air, <i>and</i> (2) the individual contestant is getting regular press from it in the entertainment news. Those two factors give them a reasonable claim (IMHO) for at least temporary notability. Then, after the season finishes, take another look at the article. If the contestant's notability disappeared with the end of the season, merge their article back into the main show article, set up their name as a redirect to the show article, and life goes on. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 07:53, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Many of the "keep" votes seem to be made on the basis of one or two entries on the list. That is not a valid reason to vote "keep" on the entire list. <i>Be specific</i> about which should be kept and which should be deleted, so the nominator can choose to withdraw some of the nominations before the AfD ends. Furthermore, some are voting keep simply because they don't like the length of the list of nominations - that's hardly AfD criteria. If you don't want to slog through the long list, I can't say as I blame you, but don't just blindly vote "Keep all" if you haven't actually read all the articles.

<dd>Wikipediatrix is doing the right thing, actually. Sources should always be given for information, especially when it's about living persons.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think the person who decided to ruin all the articles should be punished. What a petty thing to do just because you don't agree that these articles should be here. Unless you are the owner of Wikipedia you do not have any business messing up stuff people have worked on without at least asking for input first.
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you should familiarize yourself with Wikipedia policies, such as <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, before making such judgements.

<li>That's because the articles are not yet complete. Give it some time instead of removing valuable TRUE information. Wikipediatrix isn't giving us ANTM fans a chance.

<li><b>Reply</b>: I see nothing in your essay that would make me reconsider deleting this article, and your rewrite has, for the moment, no compelling reason to do so either. Arguments about other articles that merit inclusion even less are not valid in this AfD. Basically, either you think that every school is notable per se, and thus should be kept (your position), or you consider each school on its own merits (my position), since there are many, many, many schools worldwide, and most of them would have extremely similar and highly non informative articles which don't convey any important information. One difference between schools and vilages is that for every person, the first info given is his date of birth and death, and the <i>place</i> of birth and death. Schools, certainly before the age of 18 or thereabouts, are very rarely given. This indicates, in my view, that most people don't consider what school someone went to as that important, and that they are from a historic, encyclopedic point of view not much more important than a post office, a bakery or a playground. Unless a school has some truly distinguishing feature, a remarkable history, or some other characteristic that makes it noteworthy or important, it should be deleted or merged to the article about the location it serves. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:54, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ooooh, controversy surrounding SpongeBob SquarePants! Has he been seeing some comely mermaid wench on the side? Does the show carry Satanic messages? Er, no. Actually this is more or less made up, as is evident from the unreliability ofthe sources. Only one item is properly sourced (if you allow Snopes as a reliable source), and there is more then enough room for that short sentence in the main article. Seriously, there <i>is</i> no significant controversy surrounding the rectangular yellow one. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:33, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b>. Yes, it made headlines here too. I suggest we try an {{afd-cleanup}} first, perhaps send it to the Cleanup Task Force. Just because the claims of satanism are nonsense, doesn't mean we can throw out those claims or sources reporting them as unreliable.

<li>Well, the controversy itself was (unfortunately) quite widespread. Part of the problem with this is that even while it was going on I didn't really understand it much at all - it was really quite odd from what I remember. To give you an idea of how widespread it was, just the satanism stuff itself was mentioned weekly for almost an entire year on shows like <a href="../../../c/o/u/Countdown_with_Keith_Olbermann_a488.html" title="Countdown with Keith Olbermann">Countdown with Keith Olbermann</a> as well as numerous mentions on other shows such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_O%27Reilly_Factor_e2b2.html" title="The O'Reilly Factor">The O'Reilly Factor</a>. <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">RN</a> 12:09, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b>. Most of this article isn't about controversy that's real, it's about the innuendo and dirty jokes that WE, <u><b>the viewers</b></u>, see. The article even mentions that Hillenburg says SpongeBob isn't gay. That's all I need. Besides, we all know that he isn't. I have nothing against SpongeBob but we know that this show has had its fair share of controversy throughout its run. And for all those people who are obsessed with proving that "SpongeBob isn't gay": <b>THESE ARE ONLY OBSERVATIONS THAT VIEWERS MAKE, NOT FACTUAL STATEMENTS.</b> He's a cartoon character for Christ's sake, he <b>can't</b> be gay.

<p>Allow me some explanation, as this page does not convey it very well. The article is an <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">essay</a> comparing and contrasting <a href="../../../l/o/c/Locke.html" title="Locke">Locke</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demosthenes.html" title="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a> in comparison to Peter and Valentine Wiggen, two characters in the novel <a href="../../../e/n/d/Ender%27s_Game_202c.html" title="Ender's Game">Ender's Game</a>. They took the two respective names as pseudonyms to write politics. Its all nice and rosy, except its very much original research. In fact it exemplifes original research in the highest degree through a comparative essay by the page's two authors.

<p><b>Keep</b>(Provisionally) Its a fan base article - a 9-3 record does not make you the greatest grappler ever known even if you took out Royce. Still if it could be just fleshed out a bit - where he's from, when he was born, something - then it would have some value. Among the BJJ crowd taking out a Gracie is notable.

<li>Web sites that provide matrimonial services are <i>huge</i> in India. They are certainly widely advertised.

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem that I see here isn't notability or verifiability, but a complete lack of information. How well are these rocks studied? Is there a chance that they'll ever become more than stubs? I'm not an astronomer, so I have no idea how well documented minor planets are.--<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 17:02, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, uh - roughly speaking, it depends. The infobox already has a fair amount of information in it. The "most important information" is there with a few exceptions (colour, at the very least). There's always a chance it'll be more studied - but really <i>this article is a stub</i> isn't a very good criterion for deletion, given considerations like <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia, she is a harsh mistress, but she ain't paper</a> and the like. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 17:09, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Additionally, given that this asteroid was only discovered in 2004 and isn't super-special like 2003 UB313 or the ilk, it's unlikely to come all that fast. But, we know it's magnitude, semi-major axis, eccentricity, as well as some of the less exciting orbital paramatres. What are you looking for, exactly? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 17:11, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, I'm not <i>looking</i> for anything per se. I was just wondering about how much information could ever be gained about this asteroid- I was thinking about the beetle comparison and figured "Hell, at least we can look at a beetle any time. To study this rock we'd have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars." Anyway, I'm entirely neutral on this article precisely because I understand that Wikipedia isn't paper, so even though it's a rather minor article, it shouldn't be deleted on the basis that it's a stub. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 22:30, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge, or Delete</b>. You have to merge it with notable other asteroids; it can't stand alone, as it says nothing about why, of all the asteroids in the solar system, it is particularly notable. Is it its size&#160;? I have no idea, but I'd imagine that was the case. But even if it were really big, I would still think <b>merge</b>, unless it were going to hit the Earth sometime soon. That's the problem with modern Copernican stuff--yes, we can no longer have a geocentric view of the galaxy, but we can still have, and should have, a geocentric view of our encyclopedia.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 08:42, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A geocentric view is definitely a failure of <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a>&#160;;). But seriously, how many articles have all the failures you ascribe to this? <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherry_Valley%2C_Arkansas_8191.html" title="Cherry Valley, Arkansas">Cherry Valley, Arkansas</a>, for instance - we don't merge it - but it's just a regurgitation of census data. There are thousands of other articles on American cities that are just regurgitated census data. That's the kind of precendent most of us are looking at. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 11:58, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I respect that. I think that precedent should not be applicable. People live in Cherry Valley, Arkansas, there's an atmosphere there, in which there is breathable air. I don't think it's overly anthropomorphic to state that Cherry Valley, AR is a lot more notable and important to an encyclopedia than an asteroid article that doesn't give a single reason why that particular asteroid is notable outside of a statistical box. Everything in space cannot be on webspace. At least here. Of course, I could go the hyper-anthropomorphic route and argue for deletion based on the fact that this asteroid could only be notable because it's close to us, and an asteroid passing through space 350 billion light years away, about which we know nothing, that's not notable because we know nothing of it--and so it comes back to geocentrism again. It seems like a circle. I just think that people have to have been, or still are, or will soon be, in a place of a given size, for it to be notable to those same people, with few exceptions. If that's anthropomorphic, it's at least a great degree less anthropomorphic than the other argument I just gave for deletion.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 04:21, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The important issue is notability, but verifiability, which is limiting us. Notability is rather a pointless criterion - if you ask only <i>Is the content encyclopaedic</i> and <i>Is the content verifiable</i> you'll end up with the right result in every AfD (except in highly unusual cases, like POVFORKs. My point I think still stands, that every Assbacks, Ontario can pass through AfD unscathed, every Cedar Meadows High School passes through AfD unscathed - there's a certain "class" of things that are inherently encyclopaedic. At a certain point solar system bodies are intrinsically entitled to pass through AfD. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a> and I don't see a pressing need to delete this content.

<li>cited source, is a planning document - there are many, many, planning documents in the history of the city, that list many, many hypothetical subway lines that never have, or never will, be constructed. However, there are no plans afoot to proceed on, nor have there been any Ontario class or individual Environmental Assessments on the subject, unlike the proposed Spadina or Sheppard Extensions. Do you suggest we create a Gerrard Station link from the 1980's <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downtown_Relief_Line_ceaf.html#Stations_on_the_proposed_Downtown_line_in_Phase_1" title="Downtown Relief Line">Downtown Relief Line</a> plan? Toronto and TTC have clearly stated what they are planning in the next decade or two, and a Bloor west expansion isn't mentioned. At best there should be a page for this dead idea, similiar to <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downtown_Relief_Line_ceaf.html" title="Downtown Relief Line">Downtown Relief Line</a> that lists the stations. <a href="../../../n/f/i/User%7ENfitz_2215.html" title="User:Nfitz">Nfitz</a> 15:26, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't offer (nor have I really formed) an opinion on what should be done with the article. I only noted that planned/proposed/something. This isn't Wikinews, things that were once deserving of articles never lose that quality. As for merging to a general article on the whole line - who knows? That's a fairly minor issue. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 15:42, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The westward <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloor-Danforth_%28TTC%29_b710.html" title="Bloor-Danforth (TTC)">Bloor-Danforth</a> subway extension was included in the <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/pdf/rtes2002.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/pdf/rtes2002.pdf" rel="nofollow"><i>Rapid Transit Expansion Study</i></a> (which was made just 5 years ago), so it was planned, and can be built. Unlike this subway extension, the <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downtown_Relief_Line_ceaf.html" title="Downtown Relief Line">Downtown Relief Line</a> wasn't mentioned there, so that wasn't planned, and won't be built. Geo android 15:43, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>- hang on, that study you cite, considered various options, and as part of the study, eliminated the westward expansion of Bloor subway as a viable option. Since 2001, the only subway extensions that TTC have considered are the Spadina extension, and the Don Mills extension. There's been no discussion of a station at this location, except in this dated planning document that eliminated this as an option for further consideration. <a href="../../../n/f/i/User%7ENfitz_2215.html" title="User:Nfitz">Nfitz</a> 15:57, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>That may be true, but this isn't Wikinews - subjects don't somehow lose encyclopaedic value with time. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 16:01, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It was never encylopaedic. It was proposed and rejected within the pages of an internal planning report. A mention of the station within an article about the proposed extension, is one thing. But a couple of people are systematically creating pages for every proposed subway station within the city. Soon there will be more fantasy stations that real ones. Each page is virtually identical except for the name of the station. <a href="../../../n/f/i/User%7ENfitz_2215.html" title="User:Nfitz">Nfitz</a> 16:09, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Systematic coverage isn't a bad thing - there's even a bot to create a page for every Assbackwards, USA from census data. It passes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and there's even a <i>template</i> for planned infrastructure. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 16:31, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have no problems with planned infrastructure. But that's the whole point - this isn't even planned, or proposed. It was simply tossed out in the middle of a planning report, and then eliminated from further consideration. I could live with it being merged into something though ... <a href="../../../n/f/i/User%7ENfitz_2215.html" title="User:Nfitz">Nfitz</a> 16:34, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. Vociferousness of argument does not equal strength of argument. The raw vote total was 12-6 Delete, on top of which the Delete side had much the stronger arguments. Let us all recall that Wikipedia is basically a tool for scholarship, education, and research. No evidence has been presented that inclusion of this article would markedly enhance the encyclopedia. It appears from the one of the stronger Keep arguments is that she appears in her own frequently-aired TV commercials. As one contributor commented, "<i>I have seen her commercials on TV all the time, she is very notable."</i> That is not a strong argument. The remainder of the Keep arguments are not much stronger. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 03:13, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: It now comes to my attention that this AfD had been spammed trolling for Delete votes. These votes would not have changed my decision (which is mostly based on strength of arguments) but they did change the raw vote totals. If this AfD close is brought to deletion review, commentors might want to take notice of the tainted nature of the discussion. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 03:54, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Looking through the first 5 pages of google hits, I don't see any that are about the <b>person</b>; many appear to be ads for businesses she's been involved with. Others are ads for products from those businesses. I don't see any specific bullet of the bio standards that she would "easily pass".

<li>I would have to disagree with you on this one. When looking at the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22roni+lynn+deutch%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22roni+lynn+deutch%22" rel="nofollow">google search</a> for "Roni Lynn Deutch" the second and third results are both from rip off report.com which both mention her as a person multiple times. Also many of the results are from law related websites which mention her. This goes towards one of the BIO standards, "other professionals whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse) and who are likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field." And try googling <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22roni+deutch%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22roni+deutch%22" rel="nofollow">Roni Deutch</a>, you will see many results in the first five pages mentioning her as a person. I would think that any result on google mentioning her goes towards fulfilling this requirement. Because of her aggressive television commercials she has gained some popularity on the internet, she is mentioned in many blogs and forums. She even has an entry at <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Deutch" class="external text" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Deutch" rel="nofollow">Urban Dictionary</a> about her, and there is even some one who has started their own <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ricearoni5/" class="external text" title="http://www.freewebs.com/ricearoni5/" rel="nofollow">Roni Deutch Fansite</a> Also, if you would have read the articles entry in DRV, you would see that her name is very commonly misspelt. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2006-30,GGLG:en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=%22ronnie+deutsch%22&amp;spell=1" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2006-30,GGLG:en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=%22ronnie+deutsch%22&amp;spell=1" rel="nofollow">Ronnie Deutsch</a> yeilds over 13,000 google results (many of which mention her as a person), and there are many other spellings that also return many results, such as <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2006-30,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22roni+deutsch%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2006-30,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22roni+deutsch%22" rel="nofollow">Roni Deutsch</a> - 1870, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22ronnie+deutch%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22ronnie+deutch%22" rel="nofollow">ronnie deutsch</a> - 938, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22ronnie+deutch%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22ronnie+deutch%22" rel="nofollow">ronnie deutch</a> - 938, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22ronni+deutch%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-30%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22ronni+deutch%22" rel="nofollow">ronni deutch</a> - 759.

Also, look down to my comment on news articles, I think her inclusion in those articles (specifically the one from AP) help to fulfil another requirement "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person. (Multiple similar stories describing a single day's news event only count as one coverage.)" I know that 10 news articles is not a massive amount, but I don't have any, neither does my neighbor, neither do my coworkers... I think that 10 articles would qualify as multiple sroties. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathewguiver_0418.html" title="User:Mathewguiver">mathewguiver</a> 15:19, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There was never any claim that Roni Deutch is a "television personality." She is a tax attorney who is the head of a nationally recognized law firm. She is a busines professional and should be held to the bio standards for business professionals, not television stars. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says that "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person." It says the person needs to be the subject of <b>multiple articles,</b> it does not say they need to have a hundred articles, infact it does not mention a number at all. I think that having 10 articles written about a busines professional could make them notable. I would also like to mention the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Pokémon_test" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Pokémon_test" rel="nofollow">Pokemon Test</a>and that everything included in wikipedia does not need hundreds of news articles. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathewguiver_0418.html" title="User:Mathewguiver">mathewguiver</a> 16:22, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's perfectly up the discretion of the editors to assess the <i><b>quality</b></i> of the news items and draw their own conclusions about notability.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Wow, this one must have slipped through the cracks. It's not an advertisement--she's in advertisements. If it acts like an advertisement, well, then, edit the article. But she's on tv all the time, and we have to remember, as wikipedia is not paper, the quantifiable accountability we have for our edits. Almost no one has heard of a British law from 1850 banning segways on roads, but millions upon millions have heard of Roni Deutch in the English speaking world, in 30 second segments where she is the only speaker, speaking directly to the audience. People wanting to find out more about her, for example, to buy one of the products she is advertising, might very well indeed go to wikipedia to look up her rating in the BBB, as is mentioned here, or just some of the wider summary of what she's done. The article has to get better at doing those things--but I don't see anything horrible that suggests deletion is warranted here.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 08:51, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I am an attorney and CPA and I have been in tax practice for over twenty years. I'm sure Ms. Roni Deutch is a fine tax lawyer and a fine person, but in the world of tax law she is simply not notable. I am straining to think if I had ever heard of her before I came across this. I could make a list of notable U.S. tax lawyers based on pre-set criteria, but I can't think of how or why she would be on the list. Nothing personal -- also I would in no way make the list either. The article is an advertisement for her. Not encyclopedic, and the subject is in my opinion non-notable.

<li>PS: For what it's worth, a few minutes ago I ran separate searches on "Roni Deutch" and "Roni Lynn Deutch" on the <b>CCH Tax Research Network</b> website (it's a "pay" website used by tax lawyers, CPAs, etc.) including the text of nearly every reported Federal court decision (U.S. Supreme Court, the appeals courts, the district courts, bankruptcy courts, and U.S. Tax Court) involving Federal taxation since the year 1913. Both searches returned zero hits. That doesn't mean she's never been to court in a tax case (and most tax law practice is outside of court anyway), but it should at least be taken into account to the extent that she is supposedly "notable for" being a tax lawyer.

The reason ther should be an article on this site is because she is the head of Roni Deutch, a Professional Tax Corporation that represents thousands of people per year, and has tons of ads on television. Millions of people know who she is, google results for her name variations yeild thousands and thousands of results. She is mentioned and talked about in hundreds if not thousands of forums and blogs.

<li>OK, let me see if I have this straight. Because Roni Deutch is the head of an eponymous "professional tax corporation" that supposedly "represents thousands of people per year" and has purchased "tons" of TV ads, and supposedly "millions" of people know who she is (because of those tons of TV ads she bought), and because there are "thousands and thousands" of google hits for her, and she is supposedly talked about in "hundreds if not thousands of forums and blogs" -- that means there should be an <i>encyclopedia article</i> about her?

<li>I would have to think that yes, being the founder and head of a largely known company does warrent an inclusion in wikipedia. Again, just because you haven't heard of some one does not make them non notable, there are obviously plently people who know who she is... Per [WP:BIO] "other professionals whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse)."

<p>Dear fellow editors: Actually, the language at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is "Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse) <b>and</b> who are likely to become a part of the <b>enduring historical record of that field</b>" (emphasis added). Are we seriously trying to contend that Ms. Deutch's work is "widely recognized" in the field of tax law merely because she advertises? Who is "recognizing" her legal work? Legal experts and scholars, or the people who watch her commercials on daytime TV? Please show us where or how her work is part of the "enduring historical record" in the field of U.S. law, or U.S. tax law. <i>Advertising oneself on television</i>? Under that line of reasoning <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes_Jr._444e.html" title="Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.</a> could have rated a Wikipedia article had he never served as a Federal judge or written the scholarly articles and books he wrote, and had simply <i>advertised on television</i> (had TV existed back then). It seems we are saying that what is being recognized is not her legal work, not her contribution to legal scholarship or legal history, but rather the fact that she advertises and is <i>well known because she advertises</i>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Fourth best 17 year old in Norway? That's not notable enough. Being fourth best in one country, at the age of 17, doesn't mean anything until he actually goes pro and shows prowess at his sport. If he goes into pro club ball (if that's what they call it), then I would be all for making this guy's article. --<a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="color:red"><b>Nish</b></span><span style="color:blue"><b>kid</b></span><span style="color:green"><b>64</b></span></a> 14:54, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm the one who nominated it for Speedy Deletion to start with; the content hasn't changed all that much from the article as originally written. I do not believe there is enough content available for him to have an article at this time; that could change. Right now, he's a gay man who has been in five or six porn films in three years and is living with his husband and giving webcam shows. There are plenty of webcam shows; that's not asserting importance. As for being a Falcon Exclusive, that doesn't negate the need for a larger videography, and he's resigned from Falcon and film pornography. While he doesn't need 100 (see the discussion of <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>, he does need a larger videography. The nomination doesn't add importance at all; many newcomers to the industry are nominated their first year or so in it. He has not established himself as a porn star.

<li><b>Keep</b>, and I'd extend that <b>keep</b> to all the bundled articles. I've never heard of these folks before, but I'd have to say that a multi-generational organization with "six congregations in the United States, two colleges, missions in six other countries, and three radio stations," and a history dating back almost a hundred years, meets notability criteria. That being the case, the bios on the leaders over the last century should also stay, by my reckoning. I'm no fan of churches (and missionary organizations in particular), but nonetheless this strikes me as a well-established social entity with international aspects, not some flash-in-the-pan storefront church. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagana_c6a0.html" title="User:Pagana">Pagana</a> 20:08, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I agree: just being "connected to the church" is not notable. But these bios seem like a good-faith attempt to document the <i>leadership</i>, over the better part of a century. It's worth noting that this isn't a "church" in the sense of a single building and congregation, but in the sense of a religious sect that appears to be spreading and growing. They're no Mormon church, but neither do they seem to be trivial. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagana_c6a0.html" title="User:Pagana">Pagana</a> 21:26, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: An organization with the breadth, scope and history of the Pillar of Fire Church is exactly what belongs on Wikipedia. These articles are not merely about the "employees and their children" of this Church, but of its leadership. The top leaders of a religious denomination with the characteristics of the Pillar of Fire Church have a strong claim to notability, and the choice by the New York Times to publish obituaries for several of them is prima facie evidence of notability. I find it disturbing that so many are ready to choose to <b>Delete</b>, and not consider the possibility of a <b>Merge</b>. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:47, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think you are confusing cause and effect. The fact that many subjects of NYT obituaries do not have Wikipedia articles only shows a failure to reach many worthy individuals as subjects of potential articles.

<dd>Comment: Did somebody wake up on the wrong side of their God this morning? *joke* I am the author, I am not a member of this organization. If a 100 year old organization, where each leader has an obituary in the New York Times is not notable, what is? What is the cutoff? When did Google inflation start to take effect? When did 530 hits become insignificant? I also fail to see how the article violates NPOV. What agenda am I trying to promulgate? And how is the commentator deciding it is original research? What phrase or fact is derived from my own thoughts? I am not a member of the organization, and all the facts come from the website listed or the New York Times articles, or the biography of <a href="../../../a/l/m/Alma_White_d40a.html" title="Alma White">Alma White</a>, or the Time magazine references. As I scroll through the Google list, I only see two of the first 5 pages as having Wikipedia hits. The rest are various church websites, the Time magazine archive, and the New York Times archive. What gives?</dd>

<dd>I dont appreciate the joke very much. While I respect the fact that the church leaders had an obituary in the New York Times, that is perhaps basis for they themselves to have Wikipedia entries, not the church they led. The church, itself, doesn't seen notable, but I'm willing to abandon that stance in the face of consensus. Regardless of that, citation for the information present in the article needs to be presented, as it is now, it appears to be only POV or original research, nothing seems to be taken from peer-reviewed sources. -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShazbot85_d6a8.html" title="User:Shazbot85"><font color="DarkGreen">Shazbot85</font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShazbot85_611d.html" title="User talk:Shazbot85">Talk</a></sup> 21:32, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I've never heard of these folks before, but I'd have to say that a multi-generational organization with "six congregations in the United States, two colleges, missions in six other countries, and three radio stations," and a history dating back almost a hundred years, meets notability criteria. That being the case, the bios on the leaders over the last century should also stay, by my reckoning. I'm no fan of churches (and missionary organizations in particular), but nonetheless this strikes me as a well-established social entity with international aspects, not some flash-in-the-pan storefront church. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagana_c6a0.html" title="User:Pagana">Pagana</a> 20:11, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> With all due respect, Wikipediatrix, you're putting words in my mouth. I never advocated for blanket acceptance of the article itself.

<dd>Don't put words into my mouth. This is merely one, and you didn't even dispute the fact that I found Pilar of Fire Church nowhere in the school's website in the information or history section.

You give the article more credit than it deserves when you claim that it does have references. It doesn't, and none have been incuded which makes a firm case for the entire article being POV and original research.

<dd>I can't put words into your mouth, you will have to remove your foot from that orifice first. * "I kid, I kid" * I do give your credit for reading two paragraphs from their website, but research is more than scanning a paragraph or two and then calling it quits and watching TV.

Please write specifics and not generalities. Find another fact you believe is wrong.</dd>

<p>You wrote: "The school never makes the claim of affiliation with the church". If you are still disputing the relationship, here is the text from the website that you say does not contain any mention of affiliation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our school partners with a local church, Coastside Community Church. We are a dual ministry -- a church and a school -- with collaborative leadership, complimentary functions, and shared facilities. Our vision is for harmonious growth of church and school with each ministry strengthening and helping the other. Our school and church belong to a group of national and international ministries founded and directed by the Pillar of Fire, International. The Pillar of Fire provides us with oversight, advice, and material support, and gives us opportunities to participate in congregational, educational, media, and missions ministries around the world. The Pillar of Fire is an evangelical Christian organization that emphasizes personal faith in Jesus Christ and the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit that results in lives devoted to Christian purity and service. The name for the organization is based in the biblical account of God leading his people with a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire by night (Exodus 13:21-22). We believe that God continues to lead His people through all life's circumstances. The Pillar of Fire is headquartered in Zarephath, New Jersey. It has six congregations in the United States, five Christian schools, an accredited Christian college, three radio stations, various publications, and missions/partner ministries overseas in England, India, Malawi, Liberia, Nigeria, and Costa Rica.</p>

<dd>Actually a vote for deletion determines whether the article stays or goes, not whether it uses external links, or in line references. I think at this point you are just vandalising the article and disrupting Wikipedia to make a point. I understand from your page you have a stong Calvinistic background, but why are you trying to delete information on rival religions. Isn't religion supposed to be about tolerance, and all those good things?</dd>

<dd>Since when did Christianity and Calvinism break apart from each other? Are you insinuating that Calvinists are not Christians or Armenianist aren't Christians? What you mean to attack is two differeing views of biblical interpretation and theology, not differing religions. Again, I take mild offense to your insinuations about my motives. The fact that I engage in a different brand of theology than the Pillar of Fire Church has nothing to do with the fact that this article lacks citation.

<p>Please stick to the topic at hand and work to provide sources. Don't try and de-rail this discussion or try and avert attention away from this unsourced article by providing your opinion pertaining to my character. I consider that mildly insulting but will take it in good faith and again reiterate that what is provided remains unsourced. Also, you are incorrect in your assumption that a "vote for deletion" decides whether a page stays or goes. A neutral moderator will weigh the evidence and ultimately make the descision. If you can't provide the sources, and by now I'm assuming you can't through your use of diversionary tactics, I suggest you simply take the article down until some sources can be added. If they can't, then there doesn't need to be an article. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShazbot85_d6a8.html" title="User:Shazbot85"><font color="DarkGreen">Shazbot85</font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShazbot85_611d.html" title="User talk:Shazbot85">Talk</a></sup> 03:08, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not attacking you personally. I just think this has become a religious issue for you and not an editing issue. By removing the template for christianity from the article, you, or your friend, are giving me the impression that this particular flavor of religion doesn't fit into your mind as what you think christianity is, hence your hard work to have it deleted from Wikipedia. People don't burn books or witches anymore, the delete ideas they don't like.</dd>

<dd>But you are attacking me personally, especially with that last comment.

I have not removed a single thing from the actual article page, nor has anyone else at my behest. I suggest you stop baselessly accusing me and stick to the topic at hand.

You know, like major media sources we can click on and see for ourselves? And are these mysterious NYT sources actual full articles, or are they mostly the one-paragraph tiny "local church interest" type of squib-filler one always finds in the Religion section of any newspaper? <b>This church got press in the New York Times because they're <i>a local church</i> and thus, sometimes mentioned in the local papers, just like all the other local churches.

<dd>I used a tool called <a href="../../../p/r/o/ProQuest_2ecb.html" title="ProQuest">ProQuest</a>, which is available through my library system online and provides a fully searchable database of articles from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> going back to 1851, very little of which is available in public domain internet searches. While one or two items are short mentions, most are substantial articles covered in the main section of the newspaper. I encourage you to try to obtain access to these materials, which provide a fascinating look at the Church and its leaders, including involvement with the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s. Given the focus of the New York Times on New York City and the world, a church in tiny Zarephath, New Jersey, 45 miles from Times Square in Midtown Manhattan, might as well be in "Arkansas, North Dakota, or New Mexico" as far as its editors were concerned. Additional items from Time magazine were added, including an obituary of Alma White that discusses the church and her work. These all seem quite notable to me, who only bumped into this because of my participation in <a href="../../../n/j/_/WP%7ENJ_29f7.html" title="WP:NJ">Wikiproject: New Jersey</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree they shouldn't be bundled. If you're looking to piggyback the descision for those articles in with this article, I'm completely against that, whether that descision be affirmative or otherwise. If this page cannot stand alone, with it's own citation and notability, then it should be deleted and/or merged. -<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShazbot85_d6a8.html" title="User:Shazbot85"><font color="DarkGreen">Shazbot85</font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShazbot85_611d.html" title="User talk:Shazbot85">Talk</a></sup> 00:35, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Don't confuse or connect the two. The church itself is <i>not</i> part of my bundled AfD, and it's counter-productive to drag them into this AfD when I've already got them listed in a separate AfD.

<li><b>Keep</b> As verifiability is a fundamental concept of wiki. Here the organisation and the physical church become separate entities. The fact is that the church buildings exist and are considered part of historical Colorado springs. The establishment dates and ownership details of the radio stations and the schools should be easy enough to verify for an american who knows how to search commercial registers. Some of the other events, such as ordination dates, however, are probably folkloric, and thus NPOV.

<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b> Article is about something on the cusp between a church and a denomination. It thus is more notable than individual church articles. Article does lack citation, but that is not evidence that verification is impossible, unless the attempt has been made. Cleanup is needed (for example, deaths of former leaders should go) and citations should be added, but with no evidence in the article history of a serious attempt to clean-up, I can't believe that the issues are unsolvable.

<li><b>Comment</b> Alright, I've already conceeded to consensus on notability, and if that's the correct way to go about requesting citation I'll do that in the future.

Development</i> - Let's address them. Information - there is no additional info over a category. Navigation - more than 1/2 are redlinks so it is just a web directory. Development - are all these magazines actually notable enough to create articles for each? (Hint: I found this list cleaning up behind an AfD on one of them already). — <span style="text-decoration: none;"><a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevragnarok_789a.html" title="User:Revragnarok"><font color="#696969">RevRagnarok</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/v/User_talk%7ERevragnarok_52e4.html" title="User talk:Revragnarok">Talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Revragnarok_e131.html" title="Special:Contributions/Revragnarok">Contrib</a></sup></span> 17:11, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, I'll address the issues seperately.
<ul>
<li>Information - the list does contain some information that the category doesn't (such as where some magasines are based). So it passes the first main purpose of a list</li>
<li>Navigation - there are some redlinks, but also lots of blue links. Therefor, the list does serve a navigational purpose.</li>
<li>Development - if half the magasines are redlinked, there's obviously room to use this article for development, if desired. If not, it at least satisfies two of the three possible uses of a list. The arguments for deletion all boil down to <i>This article is a stub</i> which is a terrible criterion for deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 17:14, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: There's currently not much precedent for magazine lists, and I certainly wouldn't want to see List of cooking magazines, List of swimsuit magazines, List of photography magazines, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_porn_magazines.html" title="List of porn magazines">List of porn magazines</a>, List of tattoo magazines, List of dog magazines, List of cat magazines, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_travel_magazines.html" title="List of travel magazines">List of travel magazines</a>, List of electronics magazines, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_paranormal_magazines.html" title="List of paranormal magazines">List of paranormal magazines</a>, List of wedding magazines, List of southern magazines, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_film_magazines.html" title="List of film magazines">List of film magazines</a>, List of pop culture magazines, List of science magazines, List of science fiction magazines, List of industrial magazines, List of dental industry magazines, List of insurance industry magazines, List of airline magazines, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_game_magazines.html" title="List of game magazines">List of game magazines</a>, List of internet magazines, List of music magazines, or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_holiday_magazines.html" title="List of holiday magazines">List of holiday magazines</a> cluttering up Wikipedia anytime soon. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 17:20, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm aware some people don't like lists, but lists serve a valuable purpose that only become more valuable with time. Navigation of Wikipedia gets harder and harder as more articles are added, and lists provide a way to get a quick overview of a whole subject, while linking to relevent main articles for more information. Sure, this list isn't up to Featured List or even Good List status yet, but I'll reiterate my argument that <i>This article is a stub</i> is a terrible criterion for deletion. Lists are a way of <i>avoiding clutter</i>, not creating it - and as long as they're encyclopaedic, there's no reason to delete them per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia:She be many things, eh?

Using AFD to enforce the best solution to articles that need to go is righteous - using excitable language like you use above requres me to note that, "your conduct definitely "fanned the flames" rather than calming them.

<li>Winnie the Pooh (Disney) was already created and merged back, if I am not mistaken. I support the notion of separating out the Disney characters from the A. A.

<li>This is probably just a judgment call, but the article name is a bit odd and the creator <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Winnie-the-Pooh&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=72511243" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Winnie-the-Pooh&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=72511243" rel="nofollow">said</a> Eeyore is "first and foremost" a Milne character. First, certainly, foremost is more of an opinion. One could argue that far more people know about the cartoons than the original books. Anyway, we're not here to decide which version is best or more important. I don't <i>think</i> anyone is suggesting bad intent on the part of the author tho- I certainly see no reason to assume such. But, there were (or so I thought) subtle indications of "The characters in the books are the real ones, the cartoons are a pale imitation". Of course, one man's POV forking is another man's attempt to correct existing bias. I wouldn't focus too much on the "POV fork" tho- the question is, it is a desirable fork? <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:06, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, as a general rule, any time there's two major ways to look at something, I think we're better off explaining and contrasting both in one article- when you split them, they tend to become "sympathetic point of view" over time instead of neutral.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Trivial is in the eye of the beholder. Some license plate numbers, such as the license plate used for the Firebird in the Rockford Files, represent links to the actor. Other license plate numbers allude to an inside joke or other non-common knowledge. But all license plate numbers are registered with a Department of Motor Vehicles somewhere, and are linked to the individual or entity that registered the vehicle. That's historical information, the value of which can not always be established in the present. Imagine the History Detectives using this article and being able to confirm a car bought at auction was once used in film or television. Or establishing that a now famous person was at one time a grunt working for a production company and was tasked with registering such a car. There are also intangible possibilities, such as finding patterns in the registration of license plates. And as we all know, once a pattern has been found, predictions can be made.

<dd><b>Comment'</b>- any license plate info about a notable show can be included on the article about the show. The article itself is an indiscriminate collection of information. We are talking about <b>fictional</b> license plates. License plate numbers change from time to time, so it would not remain verifiable for later research or pattern finding. Also, who is to say that the license plate number on a car in a TV show is its actual, DMV number? A car on a studio lot in CA about a show in NJ will have a NJ license. But does that mean it is registered in NJ?

<dd><b>Comment'</b>- The problem with including the license plate with a particular show is that the number of plates included could become enormous. If there is an article devoted to license plates it is a compendium of license plate data that can also be linked to a show or shows. I would further argue that "indiscriminate" is in the eye of the beholder as much as is trivial. The limited lifetime of a particular license plate number is true, but irrelevant when it comes to pattern searching. A license plate might be used on one vehicle, and that vehicle may appear in several television shows or feature films. The vehicle itself may even transfer between studios, directors or producers. I don't know that to be the case, but that is the point of pattern searching, which can only be done when there is data available. One valid research example would be in using license plate numbers to connect the use of vehicles to studio/production company spending trends in a given period. In most of the older TV shows I notice that the same vehicles are used over and over as background vehicles. To me this implies limited available vehicles or limited financial resources. I don't notice the same pattern in newer shows, at least to the same extent. If it were possible to compile the VINs of these vehicles I would argue that it should be done along with license plates. Your question regarding shows that are produced in one location but feature vehicles in a different, staged location is valid. But it also supports the existence of an article of compiled license plates. To that end, another valid research question could explore whther there exists a stock of license plates that are used on various vehicles, or whether the license plate is legally registered to a specific vehicle. I would also argue that these are not "fictional" license plates. These are real license plates that are found on real vehicles that are used in fictional productions.

<p>Huon, to correct you; I just googled your designation and got over 400 hits, and from all around the world, especially from former colonies of the UK, and many on reputable sites. The exponential growth of the use of the term on the Internet warrants its placement on Wikipedia. Furthermore, if you delete this term you must most certainly delete the designation of "English people" as an ethnic group. Worldwide the word "English" is used increasingly to denote a linguistic term, especially since English is the global language of the world. I travel the world as an ESL teacher, and believe me, since English has now reached global status, it would be in the best interests of the descendants of the UK to use more appropriate terms to denote their cultural heritage than "English".</p>
<p>I see you deleted my link from the article. So here it is again, another source which suggests mixing of anglo/saxon and celts involving DNA research. I have found other research alluding to similar discussions online, but can't locate it right now.</p>
<p>"At one time it was widely believed that the Anglo-Saxons mostly supplanted the Celtic populations. Recent genetic studies disagree, suggesting the Anglo-Saxons established political and cultural dominance over the Celts and intermarried with them. In particular, analyses performed upon the mitochondrial DNA of modern day English suggest that any continental admixture from the period of Germanic invasions would have been almost exclusively derived from the male line, suggesting a process of intermarriage between male invaders and female indigenous Celts." experts.about.com/e/e/en/English_people.htm</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, it appears that someone might have hacked into the about.com website and made a redirect of the above link to wikipedia's website on "English people" sometime within the past 12 hours- a rather shocking development. Which means that as an educated professional, I am now going to copy and paste all of the submissions on this topic, until this little matter can be cleared up, and until the link to about.com is working properly again. I am starting to wonder whether there is some political and/or racial motivation behind one or more of the people who want this submission deleted.</p>
<p><br />
You seem be be willing to designate "English people" as an ethnic group. I don't know how you can rationalize "English people" as an ethnic group, while at the same time dismissing anglo/saxon celts, or anglosaxoncelts as an ethnic group when there are millions of us all over the world. I am merely changing the spelling from Anglo/saxon celt, a term which is showing exponential growth, largely as a result of DNA research, Furthermore, the reduction of the term into one single word "anglosaxoncelt" is starting to see growth on the Internet. This ethnic designation applies to millions of the descendants of former colonists of the UK and Ireland. It is a good solid term which, by the way, is also 'unifying' and not divisive and full of controversy like the term "English", which is more of a linguistic term, "English" seems to separate the 'celts' from the rest of the inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and furthermore, leaves the descendants of the colonists worldwide forever referring to ourselves as "Heinz fifty-sevens".</p>
<p>You need cultural experts, DNA experts, linguistic experts, anthropologists etc, on this topic. Submissions by bioligists and computer programmers, etc. to delete anglosaxoncelt or, if you prefer, anglo/saxon celt, from wikipedia, although important, I am afraid, are not adequate. The terms, anglo/saxon celt or anglosaxoncelt, should no be dismissed so lightly.</p>
<p>To quote Websters:</p>
<p>anglo-saxon: a person of English descent in any country</p>
<p>celtic: a branch of Indo-European languages spoken by the CELTS: Cornish, Breton and Welsh and Irish, Scottish, Gaelic and Manx.</p>
<p>So why not anglosaxoncelt or if you wish, the more traditional anglo/saxon celt?</p>
<p>I have read the page on wikipedia discussing 'anglo-celt'. I suppose the reason I am passionate about the addition of 'saxon' is because anglo/saxon is more commonly used in DNA research as well as celt. I don't see much of anglo-celt in DNA research papers. There should at least be a cross referencing of anglosaxoncelt and/or anglo/saxon celt to 'anglo-celt' until the matter can be settled. In Canada, an anglo-celt would be a person of celtic descent who speaks English, to be distinguished from a franco-celt, a person of celtic descent who speaks French.

<dd>Anglo-Saxon is used in DNA research papers only when they are investigating the possibility of invasions during the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Sub-Roman_Britain_2ac1.html" title="Sub-Roman Britain">Sub-Roman Britain</a> period. Recently genetic markers assumed to be Anglo-Saxon have been shown to be indistinguishable from those of Danish-Viking origin. A more correct term for your meaning, that would cover the English (who are not exclusively descended from Brythonic and Anglo-Saxon people (see <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danelaw.html" title="Danelaw">Danelaw</a>) as well as the non-English inhabitants of the British and Irish Isles would be something like <i>British and Irish people</i>. You are exclusively describing <i>descent</i> from ancient times, modern English people are not <i>Anglo-Saxons</i>, and the ancient pre-Roman peoples of the islands would not have thought of themselves collectively as <i>Celts</i>. Your search on Google seems to be faulty, did you use quotes around your search words? I get 145 hits, one of which is to <i>Stormfront</i>, a <i>nazi</i> organisation, many of these do not use <i>anglo/saxon celt</i> as a single term, but simply have the two terms <i>anglo/saxon</i> and <i>celt</i> adjacent to each other in the text. The fact that English people seem to be descendants of both the indigenous Brythonic populations of Britain and immigrating Germanic peoples, does not detract from their status as an ethnic group. Not only is ethnicity not the same as descent, but what makes English people an ethnic group and nation has everything to do with their shared identity/history/culture/politics/language/religion in the millenium or so since the <i>Anglo-Saxons</i> ceased to exist. DNA studies can tell us a lot about our biological origins, they can tell us nothing about our ethnic/national identitues. Anyway surely the correct way to write it would be <i>Anglo-Saxon-Celt</i>. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 16:11, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> So, to be clear, you're arguing against the deletion of one article based on the fact that a similar term, which does not have an article of its own, is mentioned in some other article on Wikipedia?

<p>You are truly not being clear enough about why you are so hostile to anglo/saxon. It seems to me that your views have a political base; I WANT to hear them, because I am also interested in the anglo-celtic term, but I would prefer anglo-celt. You have to understand that anglo/saxon is a very well known term in Canada. What's wrong with it...and give me a well thought out, researched response along with your political views. I would like to hear both. I am probably going to start up a web page in Canada, and I need to coin a good term that works for us, but that also won't start a war of words throughout the former colonies and the UK and Ireland....As an aside, Germanics also massively settled in North America. At one time the USA debated adopting German as the official language. So perhaps that move in the USA to designate 'anglo-celts' was a response to the huge influence of Germanic populations in North American. But to tell you the truth, there has been so much intermarriage that anglo/saxon/celt seems most appropriate for North American descendents of the UK and Ireland these days.Ldjenks 14:49, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Celtic_6222.html" title="Anglo-Celtic">Anglo-Celtic</a> has an article. It seems to have the same general meaning as the neologism <i>anglosaxoncelt</i>, given that this seems to be a well accepted term, and given that it uses the word <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo.html" title="Anglo">Anglo</a> in it's proper context (as in English), rather than using the term <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxon_4220.html" title="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> (which has a completelly different meaning), I cannot understand why Ldjenks doesn't just use this term insted. <b>Anglo-Celtic Isles</b> is also sometimes used to describe the <b>British and Irish Isles</b> (search for both of these terms in wikipedia and you will be redirected to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>, a term many Irish people object too) and to refer to the peoples living on those Islands <a href="http://www.anglo-celtic.org.uk/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.anglo-celtic.org.uk/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Anglo-Celtic.org.uk</a>. So to summarise there are at least two terms that are more commonly used and more accurate than <i>Anglo-Saxon/Celt</i>, these are <i>British and Irish</i> or <i>Anglo-Celtic</i>. Ldjenks has failed to produce any verifiability for their term, I find it somewhat hypocritical that Ld then accuses others of not showing evidence of research. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 15:47, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alun, I went to anglo-celtic.org.uk, and I would like to speak with the people who created the site, but they list no contact. How do I get in touch with them? I do wish you would truthfully tell me why you don't like the "saxon" word. Hopefully they will. I don't want to start up a web page until the name issues are settled. And you have to admit that anglo/saxon/celt is seeing growth on the Internet.</p>
<p>I'm relieved to see this anglo-celtic.org.uk page. I'ts time for reconciliation in the UK and Ireland, because the strife has hurt the descendents of the former colonists as well.

<p>Alun, if you give me an email address I can send you a file that will give you information about Canada that will likely rock your world. The file is circulating all over in Canada. It`s a pdf and takes about 900 k of space. Then maybe you will understand better the kinds of grassroots movements that are taking place in Canada, and maybe better understand why, worlwide, the descendents of the colonists are seeking unity.

<dd>Fair enough, but specifically, it's the "highest award for bravery". Hundreds of thousands of such medals have been awarded by all the countries in human history - are we going to give them all articles? Also, the newspaper article and this article aren't saying the same things. The newspaper article starts by saying this man sacrificed his life, but then goes on to say that he's classified MIA, and that his body was never recovered, and that some say "he was alive, but captured by the enemy". <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 14:34, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, dead or alive doesn't matter to notability. If there are discrepancies in the article that's a reason for improving the article, not deleting it. Secondly there are not hundreds of thousands of such medals awarded. There are only a thousand or so VCs awarded, and it's been around longer than most such medals. Thirdly <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. There are probably fewer soldiers like this than high schools. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 14:43, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I bring up the "dead or alive" matter not to question notability on that basis, but to point out that the article's lone source doesn't seem to be sure what it is reporting. Just because Wikipedia is not paper doesn't mean anything goes or that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is out the window, otherwise I'd make an article about my Uncle Ned. Any why are you specifically talking about "VC"s? I wasn't. I'm talking about <i>any</i> country's "highest award for bravery", period. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 14:50, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And long-established precedent says that anyone who receives the VC or Congressional Medal of Honor is automatically considered notable. By extension, that clearly should apply to any country's highest military honor. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 14:56, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Very noble and altruistic, but I can't agree with the logic of that extension. Without naming controversial names, there have been countries where, during certain times, "highest medals for bravery" have been churned out en masse and practically given to anyone who petitioned for one, and many more who didn't. (I won't go as far as <a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> and say that some countries are more important than others, but I <i>will</i> venture that some countries' <i>medals</i> are more important than others.) Aside from all that, anyway, my main concern is the lack of verifiable info about the subject of this article from quality sources. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 15:10, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm putting together a revision of this article using references, but it may take a couple of days due to the fact that all of my books are in boxes because I'm moving. I believe that while the word "canon" is not used, there is a clear separation in some of Toei's literature, specifically their Dragon Ball "daizenshuu" guides, that delineates the levels of manga vs anime vs movie canons. Unfortunately, most of those references are in Japanese so it's slow going. But, I think that I can put together an acceptable and cited version of this article. <a href="../../../j/r/p/User%7EJrp_d96f.html" title="User:Jrp">JRP</a></li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> and give two demerits to any editor who inserts unsourced statements on "canon" into any article on fiction on wikipedia.

It should never be used unless extraordinarily well sourced. In fact, this article admits to being a product of fan-activity in the first 10 words.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This artist is exhibited and included in some of the most prestigious galleries and collections in the world, including the Gagosian Gallery and Charles Saatchi. He is one of only 30 artists featuring in the <i>USA Today</i> show in October, a collaboration between Saatchi and the Royal Academy, London. Google is mostly an inadequate guide to contemporary art. I have cut out the unsourced POV description in this article. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 04:10, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't really think this artist belongs on this list of New York artists [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:New_York_artists" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:New_York_artists" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>] he's just been added to, the other artists on there are much more established. It's premature to add him to a short list with Alexander Calder, Jasper Johns, Nan Goldin, Marcel Duchamp etc. And I believe Google is a good indicator of an artist's notability. There are many online resources for the arts, especially for the trendy New York art scene. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomPeters_4e76.html" title="User:TomPeters">TomPeters</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TomPeters_9d2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/TomPeters">contribs</a>) .</small> (Sorry) <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomPeters_4e76.html" title="User:TomPeters">TomPeters</a> 06:35, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Prod/Unprod so I'm taking this to the community. I'm claiming deletion under notability for this article.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Well I'll withdrawl my nomination if it is a waste of time. I'll merge the content with the W&amp;W article. I nominated it for deletion because half the content talks about things that are about the game; a few more sentences sound like speculation; and, presuming there will never be a sequel, there will never be anything more to say about this character other than he's in 4 W&amp;W games and sometimes looks like a knight or barbarian. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> <sub><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitaphane_f38a.html" title="User talk:Mitaphane">talk</a></sub> 19:19, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> How can an entity that provides products and services to more than 6 million clients worldwide not fall in to the catagory of a company?

<li>Dennis Stamp is a former wrestling tag champion, a well respected journeyman and local legend in Amarillo: <a href="http://amarillo.com/images/112003/7296_512.jpg" class="external free" title="http://amarillo.com/images/112003/7296_512.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://amarillo.com/images/112003/7296_512.jpg</a>. He is a memorable part of Beyond The Mat and deserves recognition in a public encyclopedia.

<li>It's really hard to try to find local proof when it says that nobody is giving it up, and of course it's all on his page because he's probably proud of his work.

All I'm trying to do is give him the credit he deserves, because he is gaining more popularity and fans, and creating a haven for gays and bis.

<dd>This is done to the combination of a <a href="../../../s/o/n/Song.html" title="Song">song</a>'a music and the <a href="../../../l/y/r/Lyrics.html" title="Lyrics">lyrics</a>, forming a theme (or 'mood').</dd>
<dd>Actually, most songs have <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_sciences.html" title="Social sciences">social</a> themes, like <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">love</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/s/Lust.html" title="Lust">lust</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate.html" title="Hate">hate</a> and <b><a href="../../../f/r/i/Friendship.html" title="Friendship">friendship</a></b>.</dd>
<dd>And since all of the above is also studied on the Academic level, there are people who'd like to research on this. Or just read this list for fun.</dd>

<p>This empty page conflates the names of two important Queens of Swaziland who ruled as regents. Tsandzile Ndwandwe (siSwati spelling; Thandile is isiZulu) was the mother of Mswati II &amp; was regent in the late 1830s. Labotsibeni (Gwamile) Mdluli was the mother of Sobhuza II &amp; was regent from 1899 to 1922 i.e. the first decades of British colonization. See e.g. Hilda Kuper, <i>An African Aristocracy</i> (NY: Africana Publishing Co., 1980 [reprint 1947 ed.].
