Even so, under the <i>Alternative tests</i> heading it lists <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Verifiability</a>, which states: "Can all information in the article be independently verified now? (some say) 10 years from now?" The answer to both is yes. The subject is notable because it is verifiable. It was already judged for its notability when it was originally reported in credible well-known news sources like <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Newsday_9115.html" title="New York Newsday">New York Newsday</a></i>. The point of Wikipedia is to be NPOV and chronicle the facts from sources like those; why should we place subjective restrictions on things that are already established as notable? If so, there is a slippery slope, and established information that some editors don't like can be censored for being "not notable enough?" Wikipedia is not censored for any reason. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowrealisreal_0e4e.html" title="User:Howrealisreal">Howrealisreal</a> 03:56, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>True, but <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a commonly cited guideline on WP that establishes a pretty low threshold for notability as it is, and this subject still fails. So I'm citing the failure of the guideline as justification for why I believe this article ought to be deleted. It's fairly common practice. Obviously failure isn't an automatic deletion, or else there'd be no need to get community consensus - somebody would have just deleted it already. GassyGuy 05:08, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Verifiability and Notability are related but not identical concepts. We can verify that this guy lived (which is not a notable fact) that he died (which is not notable either) and how he died (unusual, but not really notable). We can also verify that he was on his high school debate team (not notable again, even if he did well) and that he created some pieces of art (also not notable, even if they were shown publically). What is left about this guys life that makes him notable in any way? --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 05:16, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. If he makes the cut, it's because of his career as an artist; and it appears that his art was not all that well known at the time of his unfortunate death.

<li><b>Keep</b> regardless of the criteria for being included on this site, it was very helpful to find this entry on wikipedia.

<li><b>Reply</b> Please refrain from <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> like calling people Nazi's. You are correct; <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WikiPedia is not paper</a> but WikiPedia is also <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a memorial</a>. The policy is clear, and I quote incase you'd rather not look yourself: "Wikipedia is not the place to honor departed friends and relatives. Subjects of encyclopedia articles must have a claim to fame besides being fondly remembered." I am not doubting people loved this guy. I am not doubting he will be missed. I am not doubting that friends of him would appreciate reading an article about him here. But WikiPedia has clear-cut objective standards by which a potential subject is judged. They can be found at <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Read these and then IMPROVE THE ARTICLE so that it meets these standards. Simply complaining that the article should be kept does not good. If it can be brought up to standard, then do so. It will be kept. If the article cannot be brought up to standard, it will be deleted. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 19:58, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The guy was a notable Brooklyn artisan, if there is any doubt about that you should look up the success of the company he has been an integral part of: Roux Roux. It is an international jewelery business with clients all over the world. Quite notable for a small, Brooklyn operation. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Fowl345 (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fowl345_42bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fowl345">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li><b>reply</b> Ok, then provide references that establish notability, and put those in the article. If it checks out, I would be willing to change my vote.

<li><b>Keep'</b> Vaubel was on the board of the Young Associates of the Chelsea Art Museum. He was asked to found this program because he was such an influential person, which speaks to his notability. I think it is also relevant to note that news of his death was being emailed throughout schools in New York soon after it had occured, including schools that he did not attend. I think the death of a university professor would elicit a similar response. Vaubel was notable for his striking art, his work for the Chelsea Art Museum, and the vast influence he had on people throughout New York. I was not aware that the Wikipedia spent time deciding who is notable and who is not, but if that is the case than Zander Vaubel certainly qualifies as notable. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.107.104.201 (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__70.107.104.201_32f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 70.107.104.201">contribs</a>) 16:07, October 17, 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><b>reply</b> Ok, IF such statements are verifiable, then edit the article, and put REFERENCES in where we can find that such things are true.

<li><b>reply</b> Checked out the new link. OK. We can verify that he held this post. Still, it doesn't get to the heart of his notability. Are there reviews of his work? Do others cite him as an expert in his field? That's the sort of thing that makes one notable. Getting better, but still not enough yet to change my vote. A review in the mainstream art press would be nice. Citations in anthologies or the like would be even better. Examples of widespread use of his work beyond a single museum showing would be good too. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 04:54, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
