<li>delete. No, there is no widespread support of this term you have coined for yourself. Wikipedia is not a place to express your views or attract visitors to your blog.

<li>keep There is no "widespread" support for AJAX either in the scope of the industry. AJAX was coined by Garrett for himself, so that invalidates your second argument. This is not simply "my" view, this is a view that has been expressed by many in the industry. JAXASS has been created out of the animosity of those supporters for REAL innovation with this technology instead of simply renaming the former technology something else. The current JAXASS call for opinions describes client-side support for standard messaging and WSE-n. I did create my own account and haven't posted anonymously. Just because you don't like this idea, or you have some affinity for AJAX doesn't mean that you should be able to squash information about opposing technologies. Your affinity to AJAX is proved by your own blog title "ASP, XML, AJAX, SQL, JavaScript, CSS, DOM. Marketing. 24SevenOffice", and several blog posts: <a href="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/04/c-wrapper-for-ajax.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/04/c-wrapper-for-ajax.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/04/free-ajax-based-crm-invoice-system.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/04/free-ajax-based-crm-invoice-system.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/01/web-applications-in-2005-case-study.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/01/web-applications-in-2005-case-study.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005_03_01_sleepyhead81_archive.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005_03_01_sleepyhead81_archive.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/05/xmlhttprequest-and-domdocument-cross.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/05/xmlhttprequest-and-domdocument-cross.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/05/dhtml-spell-checker.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sleepyhead81.blogspot.com/2005/05/dhtml-spell-checker.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, and the list goes on: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ajax&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sitesearch=sleepyhead81.blogspot.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=ajax&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sitesearch=sleepyhead81.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Your opinion on this matter doesn't qualify you to make decisions on what opposing technologies are allowed to exist in wikipedia, and which do not.

<li>So if I am against Ajax and make up a new acronym on my blog it should be added to wikipedia? That is the key argument here. If JAXASS is added then every guy can coine these little acronyms and theories and have them added to Wikipedia. Please read [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_wikipedia_is_not" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_wikipedia_is_not" rel="nofollow">What wikipedia is not</a>]. — <i>(<a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepyhead81_fac2.html" title="User:Sleepyhead81">Sleepyhead81</a> forgot to sign.)</i>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Not unless it culminates into a real technology. I have three very influential Microsoft MVP's who have joined me in creating the initial call for opinions on JAXASS to replace AJAX. The difference between simply coming up with an acronym and coming up with an acronym for a competing technology is completely different. In the same line of argument, if I'm against Ruby, and I can make the argument that it doesn't have widespread support, should I just go around making calls for deletion of any wikipedia article discussing Ruby? There was no widespread support for the Betamax videocassette, but you can find information about it on Wikipedia, and its a product none the less. This is not the forum for you to voice your opinion on a technology by deleting every bit of information you find on it. --<a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepnomore_fb9f.html" title="User:Sleepnomore">Sleepnomore</a></li>

<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> Its hardly irrelevant in context of Mr Burschik's comment that it's nonsense to him. Valid analogies often do sound worn out -- mostly to those who are on the receiving end of the incontrovertible truth for which they cannot argue against.
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not a vehicle for breaking news or for dissemination of emerging new truths. It is not Wired's "memes on the rise" section. It is an encyclopedia. As such, it a vehicle for presenting generally accepted facts. Articles on controversial or disputed topics are accepted <i>when there is a substantial body of people that accept them.</i> We would <b>not</b> have accepted an article on the Copernican world system <b>when it was first proposed.</b> Only when it became clear that there was <b>widespread belief in</b> the Copernican world system, then the existence of this belief would <b>then</b> be an encyclopedic fact, to be reported neutrally along with the more-accepted Ptolemaic system. In any case, comparing JAXASS with Galileo seems a little... immodest. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:47, 25 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> While I don't purport JAXASS to be a meme on the rise, I would point out that your argument falls flat when comparing against other topics such as <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crazy_Frog_305d.html" title="Crazy Frog">Crazy Frog</a>. Someone else also pointed out that <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a> has its own topic. This is far from receiving <i>widespread belief</i>. Alternatively, I point you to <a href="../../../b/r/a/Branch_Davidian_0995.html" title="Branch Davidian">Branch Davidian</a> which has no widespread beliefs, but still retains its status in wikipedia. Instead, it has a warning stating that its neutrality is disputed. This seems to lean much more toward a neutral point of view than to simply delete the topic based on the bias of several AJAX-zealots and sockpuppets who were asked to defend AJAX against the competing specification presented with JAXASS. Your insistence on what is immodest is a matter of opinion. JAXASS is not an emerging truth as the technologies surrounding JAXASS have been available since 1998. If you consider a 7-year old technology to be emerging, you are mistaken.</li>

I'm also willing to remove links to this topic from AJAX until such time as adoption is more widespread.

<li><b>comment</b>I understand the apprehension at the existence of this topic in the encyclopedia. Several arguments revolve around the technology being vaporware or in its infancy. Those issues have been addressed by pointing out other vaporware topics listed in wikipedia. Others have argued that the idea isn't widespread enough to exist in the online encyclopedia. I argue once again that other projects such as <a href="../../../j/a/v/JavaOS_59dc.html" title="JavaOS">JavaOS</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singularity_%28operating_system%29.html" title="Singularity (operating system)">Singularity (operating_system)</a> exist on Wikipedia that aren't widespread because it doesn't exist. One could argue that while JavaOS is vaporware, the Java language is not. Or that while the C# operating system doesn't exist, it's technological foundations do. Is that not the case with JAXASS? The technical foundations exist, but the concept is still being developed -- just as many other wikipedia-listed topics are. This topic is being hotly contested, in my opinion by a COS (call-for-sockpuppets). Its also being slightly contested because its a direct competitor of AJAX which is obviously well-liked by those of you voting for deletion. While I can sympathize with your plight, the widespread propaganda flair-up of one technology does not negate the need for clarification of another.</li>
<li><b>keep</b> The request to delete this is silly. This is a really cool concept and am looking forward to working with it. I know more than a few other Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals other than myself that are very excited about this and it definitely should be kept</li>
<li><b>delete</b> This is one guy with an ax to grind trying to use Wikipedia as his platform.
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> Just because something came into existence for reasons you disapprove of does not mean it shouldn't exist. One could argue that the word <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a> appears in the encyclopedia because someone has an axe to grid with a race. You could make the argument that <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> appears here because one guy was very anti-semetic -- having an axe to grind with Jews. Java itself came from one guys hatred of a conglomeration of of tools.</li>

<li><b>comment</b> The term encyclopedic keeps popping up, so lets define that from <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=encyclopedic" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=encyclopedic" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></li>

<dd>Main Entry: en·cy·clo·pe·dic</dd>
<dd>Variant(s): also en·cy·clo·pae·dic /-'pE-dik/</dd>
<dd>Function: adjective
<dl>
<dd>of, relating to, or suggestive of an encyclopedia or its methods of treating or covering a subject&#160;: COMPREHENSIVE &lt;an encyclopedic mind&gt; &lt;an encyclopedic collection of armor&gt;</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>How can you suggest comprehensive coverage without inclusion of terms so consequential to the industry. 50 years from now, when someone looks back at wikipedia, how can they get the full picture without inclusion of this term?</dd>
<dd>Alternatively, lets define encyclopedic from the very system we are debating on:
<dl>
<dd><i>Encyclopedia</i> - An encyclopedia (alternatively encyclopaedia/encyclopædia) is a written [compendium] of [knowledge].</dd>
<dd><i>compendium</i> - A compendium is a comprehensive compilation of a body of knowledge. A compendium usually contains principal heads, or general principles, of a larger work or system.</dd>
<dd><i>knowledge</i> - Knowledge is the awareness and understanding of facts, truths or information gained in the form of experience or learning (a posteriori), or through introspection (a priori). Knowledge is an appreciation of the possession of interconnected details which, in isolation, are of lesser value.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Based on this, your own definition of encyclopedia claims to be comprehensive - containing the full body of knowledge. And by knowledge, we are to include something such as JAXASS, which, in isolation is of lesser value <i>in <b>your</b> opinion</i>.</dd>
<dd>This is no different than the work of [Galileo]. This is a hotly contested and widely controversial topic. Many refuse to have it published as it goes against the core of what you believe in -- despite having truth and backhand support from many true technological intellectuals. And now you hold a 5-day inquisition where I'm forced to try to defend myself simply because I published a truth that you don't care to hear. As cardinals in the inquisition, you would have been threatening [Galileo] with torture until he begged for forgiveness and recanted his findings.</dd>
<dd>You state this isn't <i>encyclopedic</i>, but I say wikipedia isn't encyclopedic without [JAXASS] as a topic that will continue to expand in the next few months and years to come.</dd>
</dl>

<li><b>comment</b> And the fact that AJAX was defined a month after being posted on a blog, and before widespread adoption of the word was in place doesn't bother you? There was no hot contestation of that term as it was placed on wikipedia. The original idea wasn't posted on wikipedia. The original idea was conceived locally between several technology professionals, manifested on my blog, and only then brought to the forefront in [wikipedia]. I'm not proposing a new solution here, the solution is already proposed on my blog. This topic is here, just as any other piece of knowledge, to make wikipedia comprehensive. Also, we are not defining terms here. This topic details the information known about an existing technology. --<a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepnomore_fb9f.html" title="User:Sleepnomore">Sleepnomore</a></li>

<li><b>comment</b> why even discuss this, this article arguably falls under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion" rel="nofollow">Criteria for Speedy Deletion</a>: it's short and insulting. Just look at the first external link: AJAX = FRAUD. This goes beyond insulting, its defamatory and possibly grounds for legal action. If the author wants to leave himself open to that on his own blog, that's his own business, but, without looking at the specific criteria, it seems to me that exposing a third party to such risk should be grounds for not just deleting the article, but banning the user
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> how about you not post that anonymously? I do post this on my own blog and I would dare anyone to find some grounds to file suit against me for posting about a project that was concieved in response to the term <i>AJAX</i>. Anyone can be sued for anything. That's both a good and bad concept of many legal systems. I could sue wikipedia for censorship and harrasment based on this very topic, and I believe many of the points I've made give those charges good grounding. I wont do it. I'd prefer to just show how assinine many of you are by proving you wrong over the next few months. Based on that, sure, I could be sued too, but that doesn't give it grounds and that isn't a reason for deletion from wikipedia.

<li><b>comment</b> Actually, if I had intended that as a threat, I can see how you would consider that to be troll bait, but it was used in contrast to your actualized trollbaiting -- stating that I should be sued and banned for simply making a topic based on the new technology JAXASS. Your accusation of troll baiting, therefor doesn't fit me. HOwever, what does fit you is the term <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">Wikipedia:Sock puppet</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> If I'm trollbait, how come I reeled YOU in, considering how you read way too much into my posts. I don't think you should be sued, but I think you are unnecessarily putting yourself into a position where you could be. Your accusation of sock puppeteering is hard to support, considering I haven't used an alternate identity to vote twice on this page: rather, it is to protect myself against possible reprisal by you. You've never threatened such agaisnt anybody, but you seem that unstable to me. On the other hand, your accusation of page vandalism is entirely baseless but not entirely unexpected, and, in my opinion, is yet something else to consider when wikipedia considers not only removing your inane article, but also banning you, which may well follow. Friendly advice dude: you are NOT going to win.
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> Fair enough. I wish you luck, but if I "don't win", neither does the community that won't be able to find information out about JAXASS from wikipedia. In that aspect, you are right, I don't win, and neither does anyone else if this topic is deleted.</li>

Wikipedia may not be a democracy, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_Votes_for_deletion#Discussion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_Votes_for_deletion#Discussion" rel="nofollow">"The votes are a means to gauge consensus"</a>, and the consensus is indisputably and overwhelmingly for deletion. Especially considering that you are incorrect in asserting that "all issues....have been addressed". For instance, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPOV" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPOV" rel="nofollow">"NPOV is absolute and non-negotiable"</a>. In order to assure a neutral point of view, in my opinion you would have to significantly rewrite the article. Bear in mind, this just seems to be the one objection you haven't attempted to refute. You've addressed most of the other objections, but obviously not to anybody's satisfaction but your own. I don't even think you'd find consensus for a rewrite, but that might be one compromise approach you could pursue.
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b>. This from the same guy who vandalized the page and then tried to put it back as he found it? A neutral point of view is definitely possible with this topic should we start discussing the changes rather than deleting information simply because you like another technology better. I said it before (see below) and I'll say it again, I'm willing to come up with a neutral solution that better suits the needs of those around, but I'm not willing to concede that deletion is the appropriate response to this topic. --<a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepnomore_fb9f.html" title="User:Sleepnomore">Sleepnomore</a>
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b>. NPOV has to do with articles themselves. You don't like what I have to say, so you attack me. It's a microcosm of your whole JAXASS concept. Can we expect a Wikipedia article from you about every single thing you dislike? Where does it stop?
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> I haven't attacked anyone or what they have to say. This article isn't JUST about my not liking <a href="../../../a/j/a/AJAX_a34a.html" title="AJAX">AJAX</a>. The fact that this is how the technology started was important to the article about the technology so I included it. Due to criticism from this procedure, I've parred that aspect of the technology down on the page. And, no, I don't expect you to see an article about everyone's opinion -- that's what blogs and rant pages are for. However, when that criticism becomes a competing technology, it is noteworthy. --<a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepnomore_fb9f.html" title="User:Sleepnomore">Sleepnomore</a>
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> To me it seems like you are trying real hard to seem reasonable and say the right things, but your actions contradict your words. Your tendency for insisting on having the last word, for instance, to me indicates that you will not be able to adhere to NPOV, try as you might.
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> I make no appologies for defending the topic, nor for stating what needs to be said when false accusations are made. If that requires me to respond to every comment provided in this delete request, so be it.--<a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepnomore_fb9f.html" title="User:Sleepnomore">Sleepnomore</a>
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> Case in point. Nobody's making "accusations". This, and your sweeping characterization of same as "false" continue to demonstrate your seeming inability to adopt NPOV
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> The very nature of attaching possessive pronouns to negative connotation with myself, rather than the article, acting as the anticedent is accusatory by its very definition. If you believed otherwise, your second observation in the foregoing comment would not have been necessary. I have no objection to the accusations provided they are accompanied with outright claim and admittance so long as my recriminations are also indulged. Backhanded aggression doesn't help your argument, however. You continue to make my point that this process, at least for this topic, is close if not spot-on absurd. I can defend the merrits of the topic all day, but remarks such as, "to me indicates that you will not be able to adhere to NPOV" continue to lean towards clarvoyance which is definitely out of my area of expertise. If we could get this discussion away from your psychological assessments about my future behavior, and back to the topic at hand, I think you'll find that I'm extremely reasonable with regard to how the article is prsented. I've already made some modification based on comments here. While I can promise nothing about personality disorders you attribute to me, I will be more than happy to continue the pattern of effective and constructive modification in regards to the article. --<a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepnomore_fb9f.html" title="User:Sleepnomore">Sleepnomore</a></li>

<li><b>comment</b> Which if your ever-so astute mind would pay attention, I speedily removed. If you look at the talk page for JAXASS, you'll see why. You continue to be wrong and grasp at straws. You've reverted to playing a guess-who's-who game rather than debate your ideas for deleting this topic. You still fail to make a valid point. I would also point out that before I even started this topic on wikipedia, I looked up <a href="../../../a/j/a/AJAX_a34a.html" title="AJAX">AJAX</a> and saw someone placed an external link to my blog before I decided to post my own article about the topic. While I didn't add that blog post to the links section initially, I later returned and modified this entry so it looked cleaner. If you'll note in the AJAX history since my AJAX=FRAUD blog came out, there have been several posts to that page that made the same argument I did. Such as "ajax is not a new approach"-[User:12.33.211.29], "what this link said" -[User:219.95.215.178], "Definitelly not new to us, we have used in various interactive tasks including server-push (experimental implementation of publisher subscribe)." - [User:63.166.226.84], etc. I suppose you would attribute all of those to me as well. But once again, you'd be wrong. I find it funny that you are even acting in this capacity to ask that a topic be deleted when you have overzealously used Wikipedia as your own advertising platform -- adding links to 247 office everywhere that you possibly could. Wikipedia is not your personal opportunity to put up ads for your company. <a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepnomore_fb9f.html" title="User:Sleepnomore">Sleepnomore</a> 00:16, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> The article needs a <b>lot</b> of work, but it should exist. Mark it with a "Current Events" tag. Edit it yourself if you feel that a biased POV is being introduced. Perhaps this article and other articles like AJAX need to be merged into an article about the ongoing development of this sort of software (I don't know what term to use, and I don't care, because VFD pages are about the merits of the article as an encyclopia entry, <b>not</b> the viability of the subject matter of the article). If we delete this article, what happens when a user out there in the world comes to Wikipedia looking for information on this topic, which he or she encountered in some other context? Users are developing a reasonable expectation of finding reliable information about a wide range of topics here. When no article exists for a topic, they end up disappointed. We should seek not to disappoint. I say keep this article, but bring it up to standard. Deleting is so permanent. If you wonder what my credentials are to support this opinion, I have a BA in History and am an U.S. Army officer engaged in the defense of freedom (location immaterial) that makes it possible for projects like Wikipedia to exist. I would like to see some of the <b>delete</b> proponents state their bona fides so that we can evaluate how much weight to give their opinion on this structure-of-the-Wikipedia discussion (as compared to the propensity to discuss the relative merits of JAXASS, JAVA, et.al.).
