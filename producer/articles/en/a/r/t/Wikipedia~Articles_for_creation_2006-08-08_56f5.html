<p>In the Celtic tongue, a ros was a promontory of land. The Norman Family "de Ros" were established in Ayrshire, on Scotland's west coast in the 12th Century. At this time it is believed that the first Earl of Ross allied himself and the clan to the great Irish royal house of Tara. The clan is also otherwise known, as Clan Anrais, from a 13th century chief - MacGilleAndreas, meaning son of a devotee of St Andrew.</p>
<p>There are many Rosses in the Moray-Aberdeen area of Scotland, while some in Ross-shire itself are actually descendants of Clan Rose, which is also pronounced Ross.</p>
<p>The Rosses were prominent in the affairs of Scotland in medieval times: they fought with distinction at Largs against the Norse and at Bannockburn against the English. Indeed the seal of the Earl of Ross is one of those Scottish nobleman affixed to the declaration of Arbroath.</p>
<p>The last Chief to hold the Earldom died in 1372 and it passed, via the MacDonalds of the Isles, to the Crown in 1476. In the Civil War the Ross clan was aligned with the royalist cause against Oliver Cromwell. However, with the imprisonment of the Chief in the Tower of London and the ultimate victory of the Parliamentarians many of the clan were transported to New England.</p>
<p>In the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745 the clan had little involvement although Malcolm of Pitcalnie did side with the Old Pretender.</p>
<p>The chef of the clan was restored at the start of the 20th century, when Miss Ross of Pitcalnie reintroduced the arms.</p>

<p>According to the recent decision by the Vietnam Prime Minister, a new airport namely Long Thanh International Airport will replace Tan Son Nhat airport as the country's leading international airport. The Master Plan for this new airport was approved in April 2006, according to which, the new airport will be built in Long Thanh county, Dong Nai province, about 50 km North-East Ho Chi Minh City and 70 km South-West petroleum city of Vung Tau, by the Highway 51A. The Pre-Feasibility Study for this project is under way. The Long Thanh International Airport will be constructed on an area of 5,000 ha. It will have four runways (4,000 km x 60 m) and is capable to receive all jumbojet (A380). The project is scheduled to start in 2007 and will be divided in two stages. Once the Stage 1 is completed, this aiport will have 2 parallel runways (4,000 km x 60 m) and a Terminal with the capacity of 20 million passengers per annum. This stage will be finished in 2010. The 2nd Stage is planned to be completed in 2015, then this airport will have 3 passenger terminals and a cargo terminal designed to receive 80 to 100 million passengers and 5 million metric tonnes of cargo per year. The total invested capital of this project is estimated $ 8 billion. Upon completion of Long Thanh International Airport, Tan Son Nhat Airport will serve domestic passengers only. With its geographical advantage: location in then heart of Greater Ho Chi Minh City with a population of 11 million people and with GDP accounting for one third of Vietnam's, nearby Vietnam's Mekong Delta with 23 million people, and in the center of ASEAN, Long Thanh International Airport is expected to be the leading airport in Indochina Peninsula, and one of the busiest airtransportation hubs in the South-East Asian Region.

Dustin Conner was born on November 27, 1988. He was born in York Hospital located in York,PA. Dustin had a troublesome start in this world, after 2 months he was placed back into the hospital due to severe asthma. He had another episode of this at the age of 4 months but later grew out of this. When Dustin was 3 his little brother was born. Dustin never got along well with his brother so this shall be the only mention of him in this article. Dustin attended elementary school in Glen Rock, PA at Friendship Elementary.

<p>Town in the southern Brazilian state of Rio grande Do Sul Located on the shores of the Jaguarao river bordering Uruguay. Started out as a small military settlement about 108 years ago. The military settlement had the function to prevent invasions from Uruguay. The number of soldiers which defended Brazil was alot more reduced then the number of the soldiers of the enemy country. So it is why the town is also called herotown.</p>

<p>Davy5000 is a hybrid of both fictional and nonfiction character in a series of simple web animations at Trackdave.net. He is based on a real person who was caught impersonating as a homeless man. As proof of his identity he has a xanga site that bears his name, recent pictures of him and age. His old xanga site was shut down due to early publicity. Trackdave.net claims that they were film students making a film documentary about homeless people until they saw Davy5000. That is how they claimed to have captured him on film and was exposed to the media. He was shown in a video clip where he was completely exposed by revealing his fake beard and wig. Davy5000 got his name through his old xanga site. In the animation Davy5000 plays a character that never opens his eyes due to sleepiness. The admin of Trackdave.net is very vague about his true identity whether if Davy5000 is an actor who acts as a con man doing his con or he is a real panhandler. The admin of trackdave.net still remains a mystery.</p>

Separate admisitrative division within the city of San Antonio. Collects tax for services and agencies within its bounds. These are not easily determined and like the rest of San Antonio's little fiefdoms, its financial doings are not easily discovered either.</p>
<p>It owns parts of US 410 Loop around the city and derives a large ammount of funds from 'speed entrapment' of unwary motorists.</p>
<p>Its commercial center is ignored by most San Antonians, so this fiefdom is not rich like Alamo Heights.</p>
<p>Its bible belt community verges on the puritanical in outlook and behavior. You'll likely see Jehova Witness and other loony sects on its streets as well as the odd 'Hispanic' anti Catholic Orange Order member. It does not advertise its anti-semitic leanings for obvious reasons, nonetheless it has a nasty undercurrent of severe bigoted anti-jewish residents.</p>

<p>The PIano Tuner is a historical novel set in British India and Malaysia. There a willful general is bringing peace and union amongst the princes with a piano. However it is soon rendered useless and horribly out of tune due to the extreme humidity of the tropical climate. Therefore the British call in a local piano tuner to go solve the crisis. This simple mission leads to a whirlwind of sub-plots and intrigue as the general is charged with treason the piano tuner goes to meet the general, against the wishes of the military staff, and is suddenly surrounded in a lush environment teaming with excitment, consequently his brash run into the desert ultimately spells his doom.</p>

<p>The Honda VF500F "Interceptor" is a 0.5L displacement sport motorcycle manufactured from 1984 to 1986. It was part of the Honda's family of 1st generation V4 engine motorcycles (Interceptor - VF400F VF500F VF700F VF750F VF1000F). The VF500F was derived from the Japanese market VF400F (0.4L engine). The basic engine was bored and stroked to 0.5L. The VF500F was made for the North Marican and European market. The European market also had a Vf500F2 model which utilized a full fairing, whereas the VF500F had a upper half fairing with a lower cowl in front of the motor.</p>
<p>The VF500F utilized a skeleton square tubular frame with front female slider forks and a rear mono-spring/damper suspension. It used a 16" front wheel with a 100/90-16 tire for reduced rotational inertia to make sterring easier. The rear wheel is a 18" with a 110/90-18 tire.</p>
<p>It was replaced by the CBR600F Hurricane motorcycle in 1987.</p>

<p><b>Vadula</b> (Vadhula / Vatula / Vathula) is a <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word that has several meanings including "enlightened, lashed by the wind to the point of losing one's sanity, god's madcap, detached from the world, and seeker of truth."</p>
<p>Vadula was a <a href="../../../r/i/s/Rishi.html" title="Rishi">Rishi</a> who gave his name to a <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotra.html" title="Gotra">Gotra</a>, or a Hindu Brahmin line of descent.

<p>Creatine-Alpha-Ketoglutarate is alpha-ketoglutartae (AKG) added to a molecule of creatine to aid in absorption and uptake. Creatine-AKG is creatine bonded to a molecule of AKG, a precursor of glutamine, an essential amino acid required for muscle growth. AKG is absorbed by the intestines, which eliminates the possibility of gastrointestinal problems associated with other forms of creatine, such as creatine monohydrate. It also does not need the help of a creatine transporter to enter cells, but it taken directly into muscle cells. After the creatine is taken in, the remaining AKG is used as energy for the muscles by being converted into creatine phosphate.</p>

<p>The village radosda is found in the municipality of struga, Macedonia. The village has a population of about 1000 inhabitants. The village is located next Lake Ohrid and is a very popular tourist destination. This is because some of the best beaches of the lake are within close proximity to the village. The village also offers good mountaineering in the nearby kjafasan mountains (which is home to many bears and other animals). The village is inhabitated by ethnic Macedonians which comprise 100% of the population and belong to the Macedonian Orthodox Church. The village is one of the most religous in the Republic, home to eight churches. The nearby village of Mali Vlaj is also a historic village, located in the mountains directy above Radosda. Here approximately 100 ethnic Macedonians live but in recent years this number has began to drop.</p>

T3chn0ph0b1a is a five member band born under the dark and synthetic arcades of Turin, Italy in 2003. Their roots crawl upon many musical genres, from Metal sounds to futuristic and violent Ebm: the first weapon of mass destruction was in their hands when they self-produced “Albedo Level: 0%”, a 4 tracks long killer mix of industrial decadence, deep space sounds and corroding hellectrowaves feasting under a grey velcro sky, among acid smokes and toxic clouds: morbid and screaming vocals meets lasergun massacre guitars and cold martial beats, adding lyrics concerning rusty landscapes, xenothropic invasions in sci-fi and horror movies style, future destruction and the Mind Body Problem, orchestrated in the key of fear. Then, the new era is coming.</p>

<p>Tricreatine Orotate is a molecule of creatine bonded to orotic acid, a precursor of the nucleic acids that are used for DNA construction that increases the amount of carnosine in muscle cells. By increasing the level of carnosine found in the muscle, this buffers the acidity levels produced in the muscle cells during strenuous activity. Orotic acid also enhances the formation of creatine phosphate, a source of energy converted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) while the muscle is resting, as well as supporting muscle-protein synthesis.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-08_56f5.html" title="Edit section: Mount Pisgah (Oregon)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mount Pisgah (Oregon)</span></h2>
<p>Mt Pisgah is a hill in Lane County, Oregon, rising 1060 feet above the surrounding countryside to a maximum elevation of 1531 feet. It is situated between the Coast Fork and Middle Fork of the Willamette River, just two miles SE of their confluence. Springfield is immediately north of the Mt. Pisgah, and the city of Eugene is a few miles east. It hosts the Howard Buford Recreation Area managed by Lane County, and the non-profit <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Pisgah_Arboretum_fa62.html" title="Mount Pisgah Arboretum">Mount Pisgah Arboretum</a> sits at its base.</p>
<p>Recreation</p>
<p>The summit is accessible by a 1.4 mile trail from a parking area near the base of the hill. Several other trails wind through the adjacent arboretum and up the slopes. The summit offers a panoramic view of the Southern Willamette Valley and includes a bronze relief sculpture of the surrounding topography identifying many nearby geographic features.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Pisgah_Arboretum_fa62.html" title="Mount Pisgah Arboretum">Mount Pisgah Arboretum</a> covers 209 acres at the base of Mt. Pisgah and offers visitors 7 miles of trails through natural riverside habitat featuring hundreds of plant species. Admission is free.</p>
<p>Parking</p>
<p>Lane County manages a gravel parking area at the base of Mt. Pisgah adjacent the arboretum. The Parks Departments charges $2.00 for all day parking through a self pay station. In 2006 fines for parking violations are $94, down from $141 in past years.</p>
<p>Controversy</p>
<p>Wildish Land Company owns 1400 acres of land adjacent to the park and has filed an Oregon <a href="../../../m/e/a/Measure_37.html" title="Measure 37">Measure 37</a> claim seeking $15 million dollars in compensation or be allowed to develop a large subdivision on that land. Opponents of the subdivision assert that it would dramatically change the character of the park and seek to acquire the instead of allowing it to be developed.</p>
<p>Geology</p>
<p>The hill consists of <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basalt.html" title="Basalt">basalt</a>, or more likely its intrusive equivalent<a href="../../../d/i/a/Diabase.html" title="Diabase">diabase</a>, and resembles many other hills throughout the Southern Willamette Valley of similar composition. Small crystals of calcite and various <a href="../../../z/e/o/Zeolite.html" title="Zeolite">zeolite</a> minerals are often found where rock outcrops, especially near the summit.</p>

<p>Wiki-Jumping refers to a phenomenon that started at the dawn of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to begin jumping</p>
<p>1. As the database grows larger, people often find themselves looking things up. When they successfully find an article on their desired subject, the user begins to read. During the article (depending on the life and connectivity of the article) a reader may encounter links. A Link is a word usually underlined in blue and stands for a different article. (Usually about that word in blue)</p>
<p>Example: The trivia game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is based on a variation of the concept of the small world phenomenon which states that any actor can be linked, through their film roles, to Kevin Bacon. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon</a>)</p>
<p>The words: Trivia, game, Small World Phenonmenon, actor, Film, and Kevin Bacon are links, or in other words, Wiki-Links. Clicking on anyone one of thise words will bring you to a whole new article, and thusly, a whole new set of links. These Wiki Links have been known to lead someone looking at Tidal Breaking, all the way to the Kabballah.</p>
<p>2. Typing in a word or phrase in the Wikipedia search box that yields no intended returns, may force the user to pick one from the search result list. Although, this form of jumping isn’t as common, it’s plausible, and has been used to find out new topics completely unrelated to your original subject.</p>
<p>Jumpers (people who frequent the plunge from one subject to another) often find themselves immersed in extra data or knowledge, and rarely get frustrated by these tangents. What started as a search for Clocks might end up looking at African Pygmy Hedgehogs, but with a new wealth of information.</p>
<p>This was created by Erik Chipman, a 20 year old College Student from Minnesota. This article is about a public and (observed) common subject that happens to Wikipedians (or Wikipedia users). The Author expresses that this article be released as public domain so it can be expanded upon.</p>

Doncha kim who was born in 1988 is a Korean American who lives in sunland. Her real name is Monica Kim. Doncha is her nick name because Moni is pronouced MONEY and CA is CAR pronouced in English ( england ) and money-car in Korean is pronounced don-cha. She was born in Korea and came to the US in when she was 13/14. She lives with her mom, her little sister juliee and her step dad. She stayed in Burbank and attended Burroughs junior high. She went to Burbank high for a year and then later on moved to Glendale near her second high school Glendale High. A while later she moved to sunvalley in the middle of high school but still got to attend Glendale High where she graduated the year 06 and got accepted to UCSD her college of first choice.</p>
<p>Monica loves animals especialy dogs. Her favorite pet was a pugg named WOOGLEY. He past away in a freak accident which no one saw comming. However he had a great life living under his owners who loved him through good and bad. Currently she has 3 dogs, Tai which she got around the time Woogley died, she also has lucky, and wonbin. Tai is her favorite pet which is a mixture between a korean jindo and a pit bull. He's very selfish and foolish at times but is a great dog/friend/family over all.</p>
<p>Monica also has a best friend she met at her church Gkumc (glendale Korean United Methodist Church). His name is David Kang and is 3 years older. They have been through good and bad times but mostly good. They feel the most comfortable when they are together. They support each other when times are bad and rejoice together when things are well. They both promised they would be Best friends forever countless amounts of times. They'll probably be this way if they can stay just friends but is this possible? Mabe they'll become a couple sooner or later, only time will tell..</p>
<p>Monica playes the Sax. Although she never had private lessons she playes very well. she played in her school orchestra and also performed a solo in her senior year. She is a music person no doubt. Monica also enjoys singing. She is a better singer than she gives herself credit to be.</p>

<p>Rudolf Ralph Hannigan is often referred to as the great R.R. Hannigan. He has come up with many famous quotes that all reveal something about the heart. He was born on February 15, 1829 in Richmond, Virginia. He grew up as a very wealthy plantation owner with many slaves. He freed many of these slaves and never made them do work if he kept them. He believed that everyone was created equal. Rudolf faught for the Confederacy during the Civil War for reasons such as taxes. He once declared himself president of the Confederacy and was almost killed by Jefferson Davis. Rudolf believed that no man deserved power over another and so he moved to France. He picked up the language very well and went by the name of Raphael. He maried a woman by the name of Mary McIntosh, who wasn't Frecnch herself, and moved back to the United States. He settled in a home in Washington, D.C. He had a son named Floyd McIntosh Hannigan who would later become a great novel writer in Canada. Rudolf also had a daughter named Evelyn Mary Hannigan who died at the age of 12. In 1878, R.R. Hannigan was struck by lightning and got a "second chance at life". He became one of the most celebrated optimists of his time and came up with over 1200 quotes all about the heart and the secrets he revealed. On July 17, 1904, the great Rudolf Ralph Hannigan(now famous) died of a second stike of lightning, thus killing him this time.</p>

<p>Honeybees use nectar to make honey. Nectar is almost 80% water with some complex sugars. In North America, bees get nectar from flowers like clovers, dandelions, berry bushes and fruit tree blossoms. They use their long, tubelike tongues like straws to suck the nectar out of the flowers and they store it in their "honey stomachs". Bees actually have two stomachs, their honey stomach which they use like a nectar backpack and their regular stomach. The honey stomach holds almost 70 mg of nectar and when full, it weighs almost as much as the bee does. Honeybees must visit between 100 and 1500 flowers in order to fill their honeystomachs.</p>
<p>The honeybees return to the hive and pass the nectar onto other worker bees. These bees suck the nectar from the honeybee's stomach through their mouths. These "house bees" "chew" the nectar for about half an hour. During this time, enzymes are breaking the complex sugars in the nectar into simple sugars so that it is both more digestible for the bees and less likely to be attacked by bacteria while it is stored within the hive. The bees then spread the nectar throughout the honeycombs where water evaporates from it, making it a thicker syrup. The bees make the nectar dry even faster by fanning it with their wings. Once the honey is gooey enough, the bees seal off the cell of the honeycomb with a plug of wax. The honey is stored until it is eaten. In one year, a colony of bees eats between 120 and 200 pounds of honey.</p>

<p>Produced between 2001 and 2006, this collection of animated shorts from the uncommon mind of Eric Leiser reveals the artist's unique vision and otherworldly aesthetic. By mixing color and black-and-white, live action and stop-motion, and puppetry and pixilation techniques, Leiser has created an animation style that's drawn comparisons to that of Jan Svankmajer and Robert Bresson yet remains distinctly his own.</p>
<p>Eric Leiser displays his boundless creativity in this collectible shorts collection; A stunning compilation of works presented with a mixture of live action, stop motion animation, puppetry and pixilation techniques, produced between 2001 and 2006. From a vast array of obscure images, wild locations and masterful set creations, Leiser presents a stark and comprehensive world with unrelenting vision and an original voice. Original music by Jeffrey Leiser</p>
<p>Short Films</p>
<p>1. Forest (2006, 2 min.)</p>
<p>"Forest" is a canonization of many symbolic ideas that have endured the test of time within Eric's psyche. He stop motion animated this film taking full advantage of the density that can be obtained through creating a moving picture frame by frame. The film contains multiple shadow energy narratives that he dually constructed both consciously and unconsciously. A forest of blinking birch trees, a girl, translucent spirit animals, and a dying nephilim constitute the ensemble of characters within this psychic experiment. Through this piece he hopes to reveal a forgotten 'other' world which resides somewhere in the more blurry spaces of his imagination.</p>
<p>2. Beyond The Forest (2006, 18 min.)</p>
<p>"Beyond The Forest" is an original folk-tale portraying a Roma girl's pilgrimage from Prague, Czech Republic to Transylvania, Romania and the subsequent transformation which takes place as she returns home.

<p>3. Prelude (2001, 9 min.)</p>
<p>Prelude is a mixture of stop motion animation and live action which deals with issues of the media's influence on sexuality, the idea of the drug within the span of civilization, and the concept of self hopelessness. Prelude offers a clue towards hope.</p>

<p>5. Psalms (2003, 18 min.)</p>
<p>Psalms composites a mixture of stop motion animation, 2d animation, computer animation, pixilation, and live action to produce a surreal adventure into the soul. Psalms delivers a journey of visual emotion which portrays the pains of humanity and it's need for redemption.</p>
<p>6. Terra Incognita (2003, 4 min.)</p>
<p>The race for the poles is on! An 1800's exploration for the last "terra incognita" told through cut-out animation; an historical portrayal of the world-wide race to claim the North and South Poles.</p>
<p>7. Schism (2002, 1 min.)</p>

<p>We enter a special place where Autumn is the season of the world and beauty can be seen through innocent eyes.</p>

<p>Long short "Waking A Dream" follows Julian, a sensitive video clerk and dreamer who tries to balance his relationship with his girlfriend, his job and his walk with God but fails, quitting his job after breaking up with his girlfriend and questioning God's motives. Distraught, he travels to a distant forest, where he seeks and inquires further into the mysteries of the life, the line between his dreams and reality distinctively blurred.</p>
<p>11. Lot In Sodom (2005, 5 min.)</p>

<p>13. Imag Trailer (2005, 3 min.)</p>

<p>Fire Inc. is a wild, psychotic pyromancer from the graphic novel series <a href="../../../r/e/a/Read_or_Die_b5c4.html" title="Read or Die">Read or Die</a>. She is hired by a man she refers to only as 'Employer', another <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bibliophile.html" title="Bibliophile">bibliophile</a> like <a href="../../../y/o/m/Yomiko_Readman_c0c5.html" title="Yomiko Readman">Yomiko Readman</a>, to keep Agent Paper at bay so Employer can be alone with his favourite author, Nenene Sumiregawa.</p>
<p>Despite working for Employer, Fire Inc seems to have her own agenda in mind. She allows Yomiko to escape from her holding cell and loves to see her near tears when Inc sets an entire library of books on fire. A young, voluptuous woman, Inc. firmly believes that fire will win over anything. As she says, "Paper, rocks, metal, animals, I burn them all." Her clothes consist of red high-heeled shoes, black flared trousers, a tight midrif-showing top with long sleeves and a pair of black leather gloves. She keeps several smaller matches hidden in her shirt, and wears two large horseriding chap-like holsters on her hips where she keeps up to six very large matches which she wields like a pair of swords.</p>
<p>Her obsession with Yomiko borders on the sexual, as when in Yomiko's cell Inc licks the side of Yomiko's face near her lips and laughs, commenting that she tastes nice. After Yomiko has woken from a bad dream, Inc also comments on how sexy she looked in the pitfalls of sleep when in a bad dream.</p>
<p>Obviously, Fire Inc. is a high level pyromancer, and although the source of her powers is unknown she mentions that both Yomiko and herself are very much alike. Inc uses mostly psychology when fighting, taunting Agent Paper with her flames by destroying books and mocking her for how weak paper is when compared to flames.</p>
<p>Fire Inc. eventually meets her demise when, after a powerful attack by Yomiko, her flames turn on her and she catches fire herself. She laughs lightly, whispering that she couldn't do it and "that everything was burning". Yomiko tries to save Inc, but a nearby fuel tank catches fire and explodes, finally destroying the pyromancer with her own beloved flames.</p>
<p>Her name is presumably taken from the american band <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_Inc_a470.html" title="Fire Inc">Fire Inc</a></p>

<p>Vrankovina denotes an idea or a work by Ing. Arch. Anton Vranka. The term was established by his students and derives from the Slovak word "volovina" - which means "nonsense". Due the extensive usage in context with the artworks by Ing. Arch. Anton Vranka, it has got more and more a methaphoric meaning and describes an idea or a work which amazes by its complexity and esthetic impact.</p>

<p>South America has proud, if not particularly long, Anarchist tradition. Unlike most other indigenous civilisations, whose structure tended to be loosely Anarchic, the Aztec and Inca Empires were rigidly heirarchical and authoritarian. The new Empires of Spain and Portugal, however, were just as rigidly structured and based almost entirely around a feudal system of racism and ruthless exploitation. This tradition of injustice and inequality continued right into South America's Industrial Revolution, fuelling class hatred, rebellion and the newfound fire of Anarchy.</p>

<p>The growth of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> in South America owes a lot to the influx of immigrant labourers from Spain and Italy, who brought the Radical ideas of Anarchism, Socialism and Insurrection with them. These immigrants also helped spread the growth of Capitalism in South America as they were a cheap source of Industrial Labour. But it's a common truth that as Capitalism grows, inequality grows, and as inequality grows, anger grows. In 1872 this anger found an outlet in Revolutionary <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-Syndicalism_99a0.html" title="Anarcho-Syndicalism">Anarcho-Syndicalism</a> and the first South American Section of the International Workingmen's Association was formed along with the celebrated Anarchist paper La Protesta. But with the demise of the First International in the 1880's it became clear that a new Anarcho-Syndicalist Labour Union had to be created to combat injustice and inequality through strikes in the short term and Social Revolution in the long term. So, in 1901, the Federacion Obrera Regional Argentina (FORA) was created and not long after that the Uruguayan Workers Regional Federation and Brazilian Conference of Labour were set up too.</p>

<p>After FORA was formed, Argentina erupted into a long and glorious Class War. In one year alone, twelve general strikes were declared and a state of emergency declared five times. The cycle of strikes, violence and repression carried on well into the decade, culminating on May Day 1909 in Buenos Aires when an Anarchist procession was shot at, without warning and without mercy, by the protectors of injustice, tne Police. In rightful vengeance, the young Anarchist Hero Simon Radowitsky shot the Fascist Chief of Police. The cycle continued with more violence, strikes, bombings and repressions than ever in Uruguay and Brazil as well as Argentina. The cycle reached it's bloody peak in the Tragic Week of 1919 when over a thousand striking Anarchist workers were brutally murdered and fifty-five thousand imprisoned by the bastion of oppression, the Police. In the meantime, the worker comrades of Brazil and Uruguay were also facing extreme repression from the State after their many strikes had been savagely broken.</p>

<p>The apparent "success" of the Bolshevik Revolution split the Workers Movement in Argentina and Brazil and the rise of the South American Military Dictatorships forced the Anarchists to go underground. In Uruguay the introduction of a Welfare State and greater democracy led to a general decline of Radicalism. In Peru, after a brief high point in 1918 where a strike for an 8 hour day almost led to insurrection, the Anarcho-Syndicalist Movement declined there as well. In fact, everywhere in South America, the Class War became non-existent.</p>

<p>In 2001, the Argentine Government stupidly decided to "liberalize" the economy-that is, hand over important services like hospitals and trains to a few greedy capitalists who care only about profits and nothing about people, turning thousands of workers out onto the streets creating unemployment and misery for the working man the only person who actually produces anything. In protest against these crazy economics, riots engulfed Buenos Aires. A state of emergency was declared and the capitalist government was forced to flee. For a while, pure, glorious Anarchy reigned in the Capital. The workers kicked their bosses out and the factories and other workplaces were collectivized. Anarchism and new libertarian communist philosophies, like <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horizontalism.html" title="Horizontalism">Horizontalism</a> were implemented by the workers in the workplace. To this day, despite the forces aligned against all progress and equality, this glorious state of affairs still lasts in Argentina. May it Live Forever! Viva Anarchy!</p>

<p>KLDT-TV channel 55 is an independent television station in Lake Dallas, TX serving the Dallas/Ft. Worth market. KLDT is owned and operated by Johnson Broadcasting.</p>
<p>KLDT started its broadcasting activities in 1991 as an America's Collectibles Network (now Jewelery TV) affiliate, competing against KHSX channel 49 (now KSTR-TV [TeleFutura Affiliate]). Then in 1998, KLDT switched its format to become an independent station to broadcast syndicated classic programming, a few movies, college sports from ESPN Plus and Houston Astros Baseball games simulcasted from sister station KNWS-TV (channel 51) in Houston, not to mention Lone Star Park Horeseracing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately in mid-2000, KLDT has dropped most of the programs and some of the time slots had to be filled with Paid Programming, but has maintained sports programming. Then in 2000, most of the college sports and the Lone Star Park Horse racing has moved to former Telemundo Affiliate KFWD-TV (channel 52). In 2005, KLDT has become a temporary home for the FC Dallas soccer team, but like all the sports programs, it also has moved to KFWD-TV.</p>
<p>To this day, KLDT is airing "Bloopy's Buddies", various Paid Programs, and religious programming.</p>

<p>The International Mountain Bicycling Association (IMBA)[http:www.imba.com] is a non-profit educational association whose mission is to create, enhance and preserve trail opportunities for mountain bikers worldwide.</p>
<p>IMBA was formed in 1988, when five California-based mountain bike clubs created an alliance to fight widespread trail closures. The founding clubs were the Concerned Off Road Bicyclists Association, Bicycle Trails Council East Bay, Bicycle Trails Council Marin, Sacramento Rough Riders and Responsible Organized Mountain Pedalers. Gibson Anderson, of Sacramento, was elected IMBA's first executive director.</p>
<p>In 1993 IMBA hired Tim Blumenthal, a former IMBA board member and cycling journalist, as its executive director. When Blumenthal began, the organization had roughly 1,200 individual members and about 60 affiliated clubs. The headquarters moved to Boulder, Colorado, in 1994.</p>
<p>In the late 1990's, IMBA's membership grew in Canada, Europe and Australia. An international summit was held in Switzerland in 1997. Educational outreach programs such as the Trail Care Crews — traveling trailbuilding schools sponsored by Subaru car corporation — helped expand IMBA's reach. At the end of 1999, IMBA had more than 28,000 individual members, 14 staffers and a budget of $1.2 million.</p>
<p>In 2006, IMBA's membership grew to 32,000 members, with more than 600 affiliated clubs and patrols. International programs, including IMBA Canada, are contnuing to grow. In the US, IMBA has established partnership agreements with federal land management agencies, and is widely recognized as a leading source of information for trail-based recreation.</p>

Dan MacPherson started working on Guitars at the age of fourteen under the guidance of master Luthier Steve Smith who made the Heart and Heartwood guitars as well as the early Goodfellow basses.</p>
<p>By 1990 D.M. Guitars was established, and with the wealth of knowledge gained working for Steve Smith, Dan MacPherson was able to continue working on his own providing a first class service as a guitar maker and repairer. By 1995 D.M. Guitars had become a major player in the British Guitar industry as D.M. Guitars was now providing paintwork for some of the most recognisable names in the business, as well as continuing to make Guitars and provide a full repair service. In 2003 D.M.

Continuing to provide paintwork for some of Britain's well known Luthiers and brand names, D.M. Guitars now also provides these company's with timber, bodies and necks.</p>

<p>RPGGateway was founded in 1996 by James Mathe of the RPG Host network, and subsequently taken over by Effie Rover of the RPGNexxus site network in 1999. Since then, it has grown to around 5,000 sites. It has never changed its basic format - that of a categorized directory of site listings.</p>
<p>In the early 2000's, the site added 'Official' designations to differentiate fan sites from designated official sites, and a Top 100 list tied to incoming votes, outgoing links and user ratings. A <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_forum.html" title="Web forum">web forum</a> followed, offering advice for RPG webmasters on site improvements.</p>

<p>RPGGateway relies on a staff of volunteer editors who may change from time to time. However, a core group of editors (called Senior Editors on the site) have remained since the 1990's.</p>

<p><a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_directories.html" title="Web directories">Web directories</a> are an important component to search engine positioning.

<p>Being listed in a niche directory not only brings in targeted traffic, it provides a one-way link from a web site with similar content. Directories are generally highly ranked in search engines, and are considered well respected resources, two traits that are desirable in link partners.</p>
<p>While smaller directories that focus on a specific <a href="../../../n/i/c/Niche_market.html" title="Niche market">niche market</a> might generate less traffic, the quality of the traffic from a niche site is usually highly targeted and will be superior to that generated from general search engines</p>

Zachary "Ed" Phillips was born on October 12,1913 at Longview,Texas. In school he learned few things and recieved his nickname "Ed". When he reached high school he droped out and joined the band called "The Bacon Project" they became well known in their little town but didn't get a record deal. Mad at the fact, he moved to England and went on a killing spree. When the cops finally caught him he confessed that he was insane,but the cops didn't believe him. So "Ed" shot all the cops he could then went to jail. Finally when he arrived in jail, he meet a stranger named Adolf Hitler! Adolf went to jail to bail Ed because he thought Ed was worthy to be a 1st-class Nazi officer in the upcoming Nazi rising and Holocaust. Being 20 at this time he took the opportunity up quick and looked forward to suck a high position. A year during his usually job of taking the jews to the Nazi contentration camps he began to relize his bad actions after being told over and over how evil he was and seeing people die. He soon found a bible and began reading it on his few spare minutes, secretly. He later decided to find a way to quit his horrible job. On April 8,1934, he got his only gun ready for action as he planed to run for his life. Lucky as he was still a head officer all he had to do was watch over his lower officers to make sure they were placing the jews in the right place. That night told all the lower officers to take a rest and that he would take care of everything for the night. During the night he snuck around the camp tellin all the jews that they by free by tomorrow if they followed his orders. Scared the jews thought the orders would be deadly but Officer Zach showed the jews his bible. The jews intently listened after that and so ed began explaining the plan. Ed began re-loading all the jews into the train cars to take to freedom</p>

<p>pH10 is a Electronica production crew that formed in Denver Colorado in 1997 and moved to New York City in 1998. pH10 has toured with such names as Dr. Israel, Trumystic Sound System and Brooklyn Beat Rockers. The group has released three full length albums and several singles but avoided any real notoriety until their 2004 CD 'Helmutvision'. This album was created without the help of long time pH10 member Clark ov Saturn and ends up being a more cohesive and focused album compared to their earlier work. ‘Helmutvision’ and the single that accompanies that album ‘Needless to Say’ feature lyrics by the talented and accomplished Pete Miser. pH10 is often categorized as Drum &amp; Bass because of their tendency to bring the BPM of tracks up around 170 and the bass heavy production will put any good pair of speakers to the test. However, pH10 has never claimed to represent this style and are probably more closely related to the ‘New School Breaks’ sound.</p>

<p>Charles H. Hackley (born January 3, 1837 in <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_City%2C_Indiana_b64b.html" title="Michigan City, Indiana">Michigan City, Indiana</a>) is an important and well recognized individual to the modern day city of <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muskegon%2C_Michigan_6de2.html" title="Muskegon, Michigan">Muskegon, Michigan</a>. He arrived in Muskegon in 1856 and with business partner Thomas Hume created the Hackely Hume Lumber Mill on Muskegon Lake. The business venture was a huge success and made both men very wealthy, though the mill closed in 1894 after the state of Michigan had been effectively <a href="../../../d/e/f/Deforestation.html" title="Deforestation">deforested</a>. While most of the Lumber Barons left for the West Coast and the vast availability of timber, Hackley stayed in Muskegon and focused on urban revitalization of the city.</p>
<p>Hackley was Muskegons biggest <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philanthropist.html" title="Philanthropist">Philanthropist</a> and once stated "a rich man to a great extent owes his fortune to the public. He makes money largely through the labor of his employees.....Moreover, I believe that it should be expended during the lifetime of the donor, so that he can see that his benefactions do not miscarry and are according to his intent....To a certain extent, I agree with Mr. Carnegie ....that it is a crime to die rich."</p>

<p>The S.S. Klondike is a steamship located in Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada. It ran freight up to Dawson City for a number of years.</p>
<p>The S.S. Klondike I was built in 1921 and had the distinction of having 50% more capacity than a regular steamer, while still having the shallow draft and meeting the size requirements in order to travel down the Yukon River. The cargo capacity was 270 metric tonnes (266 long tons) without having to push a barge.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the S.S. Klondike I ran aground in 1936. Not all was lost—the British Yukon Navigation Company (a subsidiary of the White Pass &amp; Yukon Route Railway Company) salvaged much of the ship and rebuilt it the following year.</p>
<p>The S.S. Klondike II carried freight until 1950. It was then converted into a cruise ship, a premature idea, as Yukon tourism was only in its infancy at the time. The venture shut down in 1955 and the S.S. Klondike was beached at the end of the shipyards.</p>
<p>The ship was donated to Parks Canada and was slowly restored until in 1966 it was agreed to move the ship to its present location—then part of the squatter's residence named "Whisky Flats". The task was a difficult one, requiring three bulldozers, eight tons (imperial) of Palmolive soap (“Princess” brand), a crew of twelve men and three weeks of hauling over the logs put in front.</p>
<p>On July 1st, 1981, the S.S. Klondike II was declared a national Historic sight.</p>

<p>Commander Bunny is the leader of the Rodent Revolution and has been the longest continuing running pirate radio operator in the United States. Commander Bunny's station is WBNY, and its been on the air for over 40-years. It is unknown who Commander Bunny really is, but its clear, that he has a working knowledge of how government "spy numbers" radio stations operate and has the technical savy to make broadcasts that are heard all over the world. Its clear that Commander Bunny has been on the inside of some high tech government operations, by the type of programs he does and the frequencies he uses.</p>
<p>He has been credited with running the secret numbers stations on shortwave, he has done a number of programs, that make fun of "ape-humans", "monkey-boys" and other names like chimps, apes and monkeys. Commander Bunny has promised that the Rodents will take over at some point and that the "ape-humans" will be caged. His disdain for humans is very apparent in all of his programs.</p>
<p>However, Commander Bunny does communicate with humans by way of a mail drop. P.O. Box 1, Belfast, NY 14711. He' s been known to send human listeners (monkeys) very elaborate QSL confirmations for their letters of acknowledgement.</p>
<p>All this may seem a bit odd, but the fact is, Commander Bunny has an enormous following, within the radio community. He is known within the legitimate and underground circles.</p>
<p>While Commander Bunny has no regular schedule for his broadcasts, he can be found on 6.925, 6.950, 13.900 and other pirate frequencies. He will also appear on the "spy numbers" frequencies often with messages to "rodent revolutionary" messages.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-08_56f5.html" title="Edit section: Declaration of the Grand Lodge of the 3 Globes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Declaration of the Grand Lodge of the 3 Globes</span></h2>
<p>Official Declaration of the Grand Lodge of the 3 Globes at Berlin Concerning the AASR 33</p>
<p>These Statutes, Regulations, etc., (of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of 33 degree) as translated by Albert Pike, in our opinion, bear internal evidence of their spuriousness, and we have on all proper occasions denied their authenticity. The last steamer from Europe brought us the result of the investigations of the Grand Lodge of the "3 Globes" as contained in its Protocol of Dec. 19th, 1861, which fully sustains us.</p>
<p>The Protocol as translated, is as follows:</p>
<p>"The Grand Master stated that W. Bro. Merzdorf of Oldenburg, the highly estimated honorary member of the Grand Lodge, had sent to the "Directory of the Order" (Bundes-Directorium) a lengthy critical examination of the Constitution and Statutes of the system of the 33 degrees.</p>
<p>"The collection of these Constitutions, etc., has the title "Statutes and Regulations, Institutes, Laws and Grand Constitutions of the Ancient and Ace. Scottish Rite, compiled with notes from authentic documents for the use of the Order. By Albert Pike etc. New York 1859."</p>
<p>"The Grand Master then gave the principal contents of the historico-critical examination of Bro Merzdorf, and mentioned particularly that the above named Constitutions and Laws, which formed at present a basis of a system of high degrees in America, France and England were attributed to King Frederick the Great, who is said not to have issued them himself, but to have approved and signed them at the Grand Orient of Berlin, on the 25th day of the 7th moth of the year 1762, and in May 1786. These documents are in the Latin, French, and English languages. The last of them, May 1, 1786, begins with the following introduction: "Nos Fredericus Dei Gratia-fecerunt" &amp;c. The Constitutions have the following introduction: "Probante praesente. sanctiente-deli-beraverunt" &amp;c and closes with "Deliberatum, actum sancitum in Magno et Supremo Concilio", &amp;c.</p>
<p>"According to the contents of these documents, Frederick the Great is said to have revised, reorganized, and increased from 25 to 33 degrees the system of High degrees in a Supreme Council held at Berlin, and which have often been the subject of critical examination, in consequence of the doubts of their authenticity which have always been uttered."</p>
<p>"Bro Le Blanc de Marconnay directed a letter about this subject, dated May 25th 1833 from New-York to the Directory of the Grand National Mother Lodge of the 3 Globes. He wrote as follows. "The highest tribunal of 33d and last degree of the Ancient and Ace. Scottish Rite (a Masonic authority which has extended its jurisdiction over Europe principally France) claims to have its authority from Frederick II., King of Prussia, the said monarch having, on the 1st of May, 1786, revised the Masonic Constitutions and Statutes of the High degrees, for which he had himself given the reglementes? " etc. Are these historical traditions Founded on truth? Is there any trace to be found of such a fact? Is there any probability for their being a reality?</p>
<p>"The answer which the Directory returned, on the 17th August 1833, says: "The Grand National Mother Lodge of the Three Globes -was founded on the 13th September, 1740, under the authority of Frederick the Great, who was its first Grand Master. He never had anything to do with the organization and legislation of the Grand Lodge. All that has been related of his having, in 1786, originated a high Masonic Senate, etc., has no historical basis."</p>
<p>"Kloss attends to this subject in a long examination in his "History, of Freemasonry in France" (page 409) and stamps the Constitutions and Statutes of the Ancient and Ace. Rite as "the grand lie of the Order."</p>
<p>"As harsh as this judgment may appear at a first glance, the Directory of the Grand Lodge of the Three Globes, after repeated researches in the archives and historical collections, cannot help sustaining it, by declaring the Constitutions and Statutes entirely false (apocryphal), because</p>
<p>(I) King Frederick the Great attended to Masonic affairs for only seven years (from his initiation in 1738 to 1744) and was never engaged in them afterwards. He kept himself aloof from every direct participation in them, devoting himself, with almost superhuman exertions, exclusively to the troubles and cares of government and in the command of his army.</p>
<p>(2) In the year 1762 the third Silesian campaign engaged the whole of the time and activity of the King, and on the 1st of May, 1786 - (the last of his life) indeed a few months only before his death (17th August 1786) he resided, a martyr to the gout, decrepit and weary of life, in his castle of Sans-Souci, near Potsdam, not in Berlin. According to the most reliable information, the King arrived in Berlin, September 9th, 1785, visited his sister, the Princess Amelia, inspected his public works, and spent the night at the mineral springs to attend on the next day (September 10th, 1785) the manoeuvres of his artillery. From the place of review the King returned to Potsdam. He never again came afterwards to Berlin; for, after having passed the winter in great suffering, his approaching end became no longer doubtful to his physicians in 1786, and the suffering monarch moved, on the 17th April 1786, to the castle of Sans-Souci, where he through four months suffered: and died a hero.</p>
<p>(3) It is, therefore, a falsehood that King Frederick the Great had convoked on the 1st May, 1786, in his residence at Berlin, a Grand Council for regulating the High degrees. It does not correspond at all to the manner of thinking and acting of the sublime Sovereign, to have occupied himself near the end of his earthly career with things which he had characterized as idle, valueless and play-work.</p>
<p>(4) The documents kept from time to time in the archives of the Grand National Mother Lodge do not show the slightest trace of the above mentioned documents or of the existence of a Grand Council in Berlin.</p>
<p>(5) Of the persons who are said to have signed those documents, only Stark and Woellner are here known, the others are entirely unknown, nowhere mentioned in any of the numerous Masonic books or writings collected here.</p>
<p>But Stark could not have signed the documents Of 1762 and 1786, for he was from 1760 to 1765 well known in England and France, and in Paris was the expounder of the Oriental manuscripts of the library, Ill 1766, he returned to Germany, and became Conrector at Wismar. Ill 1767 he was appointed Professor of Oriental languages at Konigsberg in Prussia, whence he went, in 1781, as first preacher of the Court to Darmstadt. Stark declares in his book "The Accusations against Dr. Stark and his Defense: Frankfort and Leipzig, 9, 1787, P. 83 and 245, that he had renounced, since 1777, all his Masonic connections, had not participated in any way afterwards with Masonic matters, and had been very indifferent that he did not want to answer letters of his former friends who wrote on such subjects.</p>
<p>Woellner had been elected in 1775 Altschottischer Obermeister and held this office until the year 1791, when he was elected National Grand Master. Nowhere in the archives can be found evidence that he took an interest in the high degrees. A letter sent to him by des Philalethes Chiefs legitimes du regime Maconnique de la R. loge des amis reunis a L'Orient de Paris, kept in the archives of the National Mother Grand Lodge, touches the meeting of a convention in Paris on the 15th June, 1786. It is signed by Bro Lavalette des Langes. The purpose of the Convention was to be, to confer upon Masonic Doctrine, and by the concentration of lights and the comparison of opinions, to clear up the most important points relating to the principles, dogmas, advantages and the true aim of Freemasonry, viewed only as a science.</p>
<p>A later letter from Bro Lavalettes de Langes, received February 9th, 1787, shows that the meeting of the convention had been put off to the 21St February 1787. On this letter is a remark that it had not been answered.</p>
<p>The Grand Lodge resolves to insert this report of the Directory into the Protocol, and so promulgated it to all the Lodges."</p>

<p><font color="blue">Onaje Allan Gumbs</font> is one of the industry’s most respected and talented musical collaborators. He has worked for more than 30 years with an illustrious list of jazz, R&amp;B and pop artists. In 1974, he created a special arrangement of <font color="blue">"Stella By Starlight"</font> for the <font color="blue">New York Jazz Repertory Company</font> as part of a concert honoring <font color="blue">Miles Davis</font> at <font color="blue">Carnegie Hall</font>. He followed that with live and recorded performances with such artists as <font color="blue">Lenny White</font>, <font color="blue">Buster Williams</font>, <font color="blue">Cecil McBee</font> and <font color="blue">Betty Carter</font>. In 1975,<font color="blue">Onaje</font> joined forces with trumpeter, <font color="blue">Nat Adderley</font> as part of his quintet contributing to the group’s releases on <font color="blue">Atlantic</font> and <font color="blue">Steeplechase Records</font>. Producer <font color="blue">Nils Winter</font> of <font color="blue">Steeplechase</font> upon hearing <font color="blue">Onaje’s</font> improvisations, invited the young pianist to record a solo piano project entitled <font color="blue">Onaje</font>.</p>
<p>In 1976, <font color="blue">Onaje</font> provided the arrangement for the song that was to become the signature piece for the late great vocalist <font color="blue">Phyllis Hyman</font>, <font color="blue">"Betcha By Golly Wow."</font> In 1978, the <font color="blue">Woody Shaw Group</font>, for which <font color="blue">Onaje</font> was pianist, won the <font color="blue">Down Beat</font> Reader’s Poll for Best Jazz Group and for Best Jazz Album <font color="blue">(Rosewood)</font>.The album was later nominated for a <font color="blue">Grammy</font>. In 1985, <font color="blue">Onaje</font> lent his keyboard and arrangement skills to <font color="blue">"Lady In My Life"</font> on guitarist <font color="blue">Stanley Jordan’s</font> widely acclaimed debut album, <font color="blue">Magic Touch</font> on <font color="blue">Blue Note Records</font>.This was the 1st jazz album in history to maintain the #1 spot atop <font color="blue">Billboard Magazine’s</font> jazz charts for more than 50 weeks.</p>
<p>In 1986, <font color="blue">Onaje</font> received the <font color="blue">“Min-on Art Award"</font>..."in recognition of his great contribution to the promotion and development of a new musical movement for people with the aim of the creation of Peace...” Previous recipients of this prestigious honor include <font color="blue">Tina Turner</font>, <font color="blue">Herbie Hancock</font>, <font color="blue">Wayne Shorter</font>,and <font color="blue">Buster Williams</font>. Motivated by the goal for World Peace,<font color="blue">Onaje</font> uses the practice of <font color="blue">Nicherin Daishonin’s Buddhism</font> as a philosophical,spiritual and technical approach to his life and his music. His composition, <font color="blue">"Quiet Passion"</font> and his rendition of the <font color="blue">Delphonics</font> classic, <font color="blue">"(Didn’t I ) Blow your Mind This Time"</font> both from his project, <font color="blue">That Special Part Of Me</font> have remained in rotation on the playlists of Smooth Jazz Radio Stations around the country since their initial introduction back in February of 1988. <font color="blue">Panasonic</font> chose his song, <font color="blue">"Dare To Dream,"</font> with lyrics by <font color="blue">Charles Allen</font>, as the theme for their 10th anniversary celebration honoring their project; <font color="blue">Kid Witness News</font>.</p>
<p>In addition to the release of <font color="blue">That Special Part Of Me</font> and <font color="blue">Dare To Dream</font> on <font color="blue">MCA Records</font>, he currently has an independently financed solo project; <font color="blue">Remember Their Innocence</font>. <font color="blue">Onaje</font> has been featured twice on <font color="blue">NPR</font> "Piano Jazz with <font color="blue">Marian McPartland</font>"." He also composed,arranged and performed the original score for the <font color="blue">Showtime film, "Override,"</font> directed by actor/producer <font color="blue">Danny Glover</font>. In 1997, <font color="blue">Onaje</font> again embraced the music of <font color="blue">Miles Davis</font> as conductor/arranger for <font color="blue">Grammy</font> Award winning vocalist <font color="blue">Cassandra Wilson’s</font> concert, <font color="blue">"Travelin' Miles."</font></p>
<p><font color="blue">Onaje Allan Gumbs</font> continues to contribute his talents as a keyboardist,composer, arranger and producer. As he states: “Music has a healing force that is immeasurable and I am committed to being a part of it .”</p>

<p>The son of celebrated painter Jean-Louis-Ernest Meisonnier, Charles emulated his father (whom he named "The Boss") in his desire to become a painter. Born at the family home, Le Grand Maison, in Poissy, France in 1845, he hoped to find favor with his father on horseback-riding expeditions. He neared disaster when, while fencing, he upset his father's master work, <i>Friedland,</i> tearing a hole in the canvas. Luckily, he took responsibility and found a master at restoration, who preserved the work with little remaining damage.</p>

<p>His first notable painting, <i>The Salon</i>, depicted his father at work in his studio. He submitted his work to the French Salon of 1865 where it was accepted (perhaps due to the influence of his father, a juror at the Salon that year). Another of his paintings, <i>While Taking Tea</i>, was accepted into the Salon exhibition the next year, where it won a much-coveted medal.</p>

<p>Charles had a long-lasting courtship with his neighbor, Jeanne Gros. After letter-writing and observing her from afar for many years, they were married in November of 1868. Soon after, Jeanne bore a daughter.</p>

<p>Caroline Crachami was supposedly born in 1815, although this is disputed. She was famous for being the smallest person in recorded history. She had primordial dwarfism, and was only about 19 inches tall. When she died in 1824, her body was stolen by Dr. Gillian, the man whom her family had display her at freak shows, and sold to the anatomist John Hunter for $500. Her father tried without success to get her body back. To this day, her skeleton is on display in the Hunterian Museum.</p>
<p>Gaby Wood wrote a book about her titled "The Smallest of All Persons Mentioned in the Records of Littleness."</p>
