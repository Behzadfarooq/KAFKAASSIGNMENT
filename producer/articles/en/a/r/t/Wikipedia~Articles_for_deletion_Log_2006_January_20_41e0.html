<p>The result of the debate was <b>MERGE</b> to somewhere. But as Penya points out, this is not an AfD issue; AfD is for discussing deletion, and merges/redirects can be more usefully discussed on the respective talk pages.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>, no merge. I agree that most every other one of them should be merged.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. This is a tough one. There are good arguments made on both the keep and delete side (exactly one each, actually) and neither seems to overwhelm the other. I fear that WP:BIO may miss its mark on this kind of article, dealing with an author publishing before the advent of the mass media, althought it seems undeniable that the person hasn't made a widely recognized contribution to their field. A combination of facts tips me away from delete: that we are only barely over the two-thirds level that is oft-used (although there are an unusually high number of deleters) and that, on the assumption the article is not a work of fiction, the presence of the address as of 1909 (!) is a strong indicator that, somewhere out there, is a source from which The CA Birthday Book has taken its material. (Incidentally, the copyright for the Birthday book says that it is public domain in the US, so that's ok.) -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 22:11, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article seems to be just copied out of "The California Birthday Book" of 1906. No references in the standard Gale databases, Chadwick's Literature Online, no NY Times obit, no relevant google hits as far as I could tell. Not sure if this person is notable enough for an encyclopedia entry and I certainly don't think this single reference is enough to sustain one.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I happen to be a fan of Full Metal Alchemist and I have seen the whole series, so you might as well take my vote on this as the gospel truth. Anyway, Sciezka is a somewhat minor character, and as you can see, spelling depends on the romanization. The only thing notable about her is her perfect memory of many full books in a library that burned down (this is a major plot point).

<dd>Thanks for the info. I would choose "SoundClick" as the article title since that is how the website (and presumably others) refers to use for itself. Contrast <a href="../../../m/p/3/Mp3.com.html" title="Mp3.com">mp3.com</a>, which is primarily known as "mp3.com" and not "mp3", and <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazon.com.html" title="Amazon.com">amazon.com</a>, whose official company name includes the ".com". I wouldn't choose "SoundClick, Inc", as both articles are about the website, only mentioning the company. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_22.html" title="January 22">01-22</a>&#160;20:28<a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">Z</a></small></i></span></dd>

<li><b>Rebuttal</b>: Everything above was posted to skew the voting and make people turn against me and bias their viewpoint of the nomination and the entry. It's a pretty sick tactic. It shows they care little about the actual strength of the entry; which should be the only thing considered. Since the "warnings" have been posted, some people have even said that they've voted <i>only</i> because of the alleged misconduct. Consequently, they and the people who are engaging in this witchhunt should be ashamed of themselves. They've done irreparable damage to their integrity and to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 00:56, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I noticed that you were listed as a Christian Wikipedian. I am, too. I wanted to let you know that in the last 24 hours, someone has nominated 12 Christian biography entries for deletion. Not only does this seem like bad faith and an affront to a lot of hard work, but I'd like you to come and vote on the entries. These nominations seem peculiar because some people are even presidents of universities and well known authors.</dd>

In any case, Wikipedia has all kinds of articles on fictional characters , Internet trends, etc. It would seem hypocritical to keep them and yet delete biographies of peole who couldn't prove their academic credentials valid. <a href="../../../e/d/o/User%7EEdonovan_0e0a.html" title="User:Edonovan">Evan Donovan</a> 17:03, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. This is not a personal feud, and it's also not a vendetta against Christians, as some people would like to portray it. It <b>is</b> a conversation about what makes a person notable, and there <b>is</b> a serious issue about how, in such a highly polarized environment, to distinguish POV pushing and linkspam from honest, good-faith efforts to create encyclopedic articles. Vote-stacking, throwing around accusations of feuds and vendettas, and jibes about people's motives just serve to polarize things more. I think it's obvious that this many-headed hydra of an argument is not going to lead to an overall consensus here and now, but there's no reason to poison the well for future discussions. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 17:57, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. He's notable enough for me. By the way, this sort of POV pushing, especially e-mailing people to "rally to your cause", is unacceptable. The idea here is that people can make rational, non-POV decisions on whether this guy is notable enough or not. Rodii has absolutely the right idea. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka">Grandmasterka</a> 20:40, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If he's writen stuff then he should at least have a little slice of wikipedia? I mean, Wikipedia is huge, everyone can have a share can't they? Everyone thinks that because he isn't in the news, that he shouldn't be included in wikipedia, the so called "sum of all human knowledge". But how do we know he isn't influencial? He effects hundreds with his words..... <b>Further Note</b>: I was brought here, like many others by Wiggins2, or as he wants to be called, "Wiggie". I think we shouldn't be so quick to shoot him down, as I, &amp; probably many others, are grateful for his post to draw our attention to this subject. I wouldn't mind if the other "side" did the same. But we cannot ignore the fact that this is defintely going to open wikipedia into two halves; Those who want to keep. Those who don't. I.E. Christians, &amp; others. However, this should not be about religion. I would be ashamed of the christians on here if they only voted to keep the articles because they were christian orientated. This should strictly be business as usual, even though it does seem strange an editor would nominate so many christian articles. Maybe a hidden agenda? If an article's crap, then it should be deleted. Being an inclusionist, I will probably keep the most mundane article. However, the list of notable people list is like many others, &amp; should not be here. To do so would be obvious bias. I ask everyone to not be drawn in with a strict "You're wrong, I'm right" situation, but be open &amp; find a way to keep peaceful.... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:20, 22 January 2006 (UTC).

<dd>There are two reasons why your comment above is wrong. The first is, I <i>am</i> a Christian. Much as you might have been told that this is a vendetta against articles on Christians, that is the POV of one man - which brings me to my second point: Wiggins2 is a probable sockpuppet of Jason Gastrich (and has been blocked as such). In my experience the number of genuinely notable people whose articles rely on padding like the number of grandchildren is very limited. I checked out the books, they have Amazon sales ranks in the hundreds of thousands or, in some cases millions, none of them are by major imprints. This is just another pastor, just like all the rest, I see nothing special about him at all. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_AfD_78f4.html" title="User:JzG/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 14:41, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I really did want to vote Keep because I like EDI (in a geeky kind of way) and they do look as if they are doing a valuable job, but in the end the tone of their advertorial (which forms a lot of the highest Google hits, of which there are in any case very few) really doesn't make the case. I love companies where you get to talk to a techie, but "we don't have a helpdesk" sounds a lot like "we don't have enough customers to need one".

I think we shouldn't be so quick to shoot him down, as I, &amp; probably many others, are grateful for his post to draw our attention to this subject. I wouldn't mind if the other "side" did the same. But we cannot ignore the fact that this is defintely going to open wikipedia into two halves; Those who want to keep. Those who don't. I.E. Christians, &amp; others. However, this should not be about religion. I would be ashamed of the christians on here if they only voted to keep the articles because they were christian orientated. This should strictly be business as usual, even though it does seem strange an editor would nominate so many christian articles. Maybe a hidden agenda? If an article's crap, then it should be deleted. Being an inclusionist, I will probably keep the most mundane article. However, the list of notable people list is like many others, &amp; should not be here. To do so would be obvious bias. I ask everyone to not be drawn in with a strict "You're wrong, I'm right" situation, but be open &amp; find a way to keep peaceful.... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:26, 22 January 2006 (UTC).

<li>Haha, I would agree with you but I don't think it can be merged anywhere without throwing off an article. Iceland really doesn't matter in terms of Islam.

<li><b>Keep</b>. There's a whole series of "Islam in ..." articles, and this one makes for an interesting complement to that, exactly <i>because</i> it's about a country where Islam is marginal.

Since comparable info for other countries is distributed over that series and not centralized in one article, there also seems to be no obvious place for a merge.

<dd>I need to use my powers for good instead of just silliness:) This article was just a sentence, and an inaccurate one at that, then I decided what the hey. Still how can this be justified as an article in its own right when there are so many more important "Islam in" articles to do? I think it'd make more sense to have a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_in_Iceland_28f1.html" title="Religion in Iceland">Religion in Iceland</a> article and put this in. If you're worried it'd be lost until then, don't be.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article needs a clean up, but I think we can do it without deleting it... <b>Further Note</b>: I was brought here, like many others by Wiggins2, or as he wants to be called, "Wiggie". I think we shouldn't be so quick to shoot him down, as I, &amp; probably many others, are grateful for his post to draw our attention to this subject. I wouldn't mind if the other "side" did the same. But we cannot ignore the fact that this is defintely going to open wikipedia into two halves; Those who want to keep. Those who don't. I.E. Christians, &amp; others. However, this should not be about religion. I would be ashamed of the christians on here if they only voted to keep the articles because they were christian orientated. This should strictly be business as usual, even though it does seem strange an editor would nominate so many christian articles. Maybe a hidden agenda? If an article's crap, then it should be deleted. Being an inclusionist, I will probably keep the most mundane article. However, the list of notable people list is like many others, &amp; should not be here. To do so would be obvious bias. I ask everyone to not be drawn in with a strict "You're wrong, I'm right" situation, but be open &amp; find a way to keep peaceful.... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:07, 22 January 2006 (UTC).

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the user that put this bio up in the first place. Dr. DeYoung is a notable speaker. He is the <a href="http://www.rbc.org/hps/jdeyoung/" class="external text" title="http://www.rbc.org/hps/jdeyoung/" rel="nofollow">cohost</a> on <a href="http://www.rbc.org/dod/home.php" class="external text" title="http://www.rbc.org/dod/home.php" rel="nofollow">Day of Discovery</a>, which is a nation-wide show. He is heard on over 1000 radio stations in North America. He is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970824602/" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970824602/" rel="nofollow">published author</a>, a <a href="http://www.prophecytoday.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.prophecytoday.com/" rel="nofollow">radio talk-show host</a>, a <a href="http://www.rbc.org/hps/jdeyoung/" class="external text" title="http://www.rbc.org/hps/jdeyoung/" rel="nofollow">television cohost</a> , and, yes, an evangelist. I am not a sock-puppet of anyone. My name is Chad Smith - I haven't added a lot of stuff, that's true, but I'm a real person. If you check the links in the article, you'll see that the info is on the up and up. If you think the links have been put up to support a fake article, check the web archive for them. Dr. DeYoung has a large number of listeners, his web site gets tens of thousands of visitors per month. Just because you haven't heard of him, doesn't mean he's not notable. There are plenty of notable people in fields that are outside my interests that deserve to be on Wikipedia. The same is true for each of us. Dr. DeYoung is in the <a href="http://www.pre-trib.org/about-members.php" class="external text" title="http://www.pre-trib.org/about-members.php" rel="nofollow">Pre-Trib Study Group</a> that Tim LaHaye started, as in the coauthor of the Left Behind series. Is <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_LaHaye_a4ed.html" title="Tim LaHaye">Tim LaHaye</a> in the Wikipedia? Yes. Granted, Tim LaHaye has more mainstream success, but Tim LaHaye thinks enough of Dr. DeYoung to include his notes in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0899579248/" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0899579248/" rel="nofollow">Tim LaHaye Prophecy Study Bible</a>, in which Dr. DeYoung's is cited as a contributor, and has an entire article included. His article is on page 973 and is entitled "Israel Today" if you'd like to go to a bookstore and check it out, and the list of contributors in the front shows that this is the same Dr. Jimmy DeYoung of Shofar Communications that I am referring to in this article. It may be true that this article should be cleaned up. It was my first addition of an article, and only the 3rd or 4th one I've worked on. But please don't remove it. I don't even know who this Jason person is. I've gone through it a little bit and tired to clean it up, and make it more acceptable for Wikipedia. I'm sure more work can be done, but I wanted to at least include some of the verification sources to help keep it on the Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChad78_10c6.html" title="User:Chad78">Chad78</a>.</li>

<p>Deletion? Well, I think <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gothard_56b6.html" title="Bill Gothard">Bill Gothard</a> is more the "founder" of IBLP than anything, though you're right about it being his foremost, um, "item of achievement," so to speak. But while the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_in_Basic_Life_Principles_1370.html" title="Institute in Basic Life Principles">Institute in Basic Life Principles</a> is unofficially aka the "Bill Gothard thing," it's something that has reached millions of people (over 2.5 million have attended IBLP's various <a href="http://iblp.org/iblp/about/whatwedo/" class="external text" title="http://iblp.org/iblp/about/whatwedo/" rel="nofollow">Seminars</a> alone) and is still an important thing to many on a daily basis. The Institute is relatively huge, all things considered. But even if the main thing about Gothard is IBLP and vice versa, does that by itself warrant deletion (yea, newbie here)? True that both articles do overlap significantly though, particularly in the many areas that stress the "highly controversial" aspects of Bill Gothard and IBLP.</p>
<p>On another topic, maybe both articles should just be left alive solely because of how much work various Wikipedians have put into them already?

<li>I have no problem with that. I can see that I have got this the wrong way round, it is indeed the organisation which is the sideline.

<li><b>Strong Keep, anti-Merge</b>, Since Gothard has caroused with Boris Yeltsin (wouldn't include this in the article as it is original research, but I saw him shake hands with Yeltsin on stage at the '92 ATIA conference in Knoxville when ATIA assumed responsibility for some public schools in Moscow), has personally led numerous seminars with &gt;15k attendees, and has been instrumental in the publishing of numerous books, periodicals, and homeschool curricula. As someone who considers himself a "victim" of Gothard's legalism, I do have a POV on this (which I would be remiss in omitting). Nonetheless, I think Gothard's notability is virtually unquestionable. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">Dick Clark</a> 15:34, 20 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would also add that the IBLP largely emerged to take advantage of the popularity generated by Gothard's "chalk talks" (where he speaks as he is drawing a landscape of some sort, and then, as a visual reinforcement of his conclusion to the talk, changes the lighting to reveal some sort of Christian imagery). IBLP's "Basic" seminars in later years usually featured a video of Gothard speaking if he was unavailable (which was more frequently the case as the Basic seminars in became more popular)<a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">Dick Clark</a> 19:39, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep, anti-Merge</b>. Gothard is a very recognizable figure within Christian fundamentalist circles, and his influence is quite broad and controversial.

<p>A bible teacher. And he wrote some books, published by a missionary press, one or two of which break the half million in Amazon's sales rank, but not by much it seems. In this article we find out that he turned to God after a business deal went tits-up, he held un-named "prominent positions" with some big firms and got a PhD from an unaccredited university (bet you can't guess <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_Baptist_University_19ac.html" title="Louisiana Baptist University">which one</a>). So now he combines a background in cryptanalysis with 30 years of Biblical teaching. Which would be really handy if the Bible weren't printed in clear... OK, he might be notable. It's possible that those "prominent positions" are indeed prominent. In which case some citations and actual details would not go amiss.

<li>There's more than one person nominating them, and actually the bias is against the use of wikipedia as a way of boosting the profile of Southern "fundamentalists" (who are <i>not</i> "conservative Christians", that would be the Catholics). You'll note that I have given a fairly extensive rationale above, I did take the trouble to go out and try to verify the significance of this person (and the others). It's a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wikipedia%7EWalled_garden_a64f.html" title="Wikipedia:Walled garden">walled garden</a>: these people are "notable" by reference to others (people and institutions) who are "notable" by reference back to them. They all seem to come with a full set of minor books published by fundamentalist Christian presses, studio photographs, and a resume which includes degrees from (and teaching in) unaccredited universities. It looks to me very much as if the 'pedia is being used to promote something.

<dd>One of your objections is the low Amazon sales rank of Missler's books. Surely this method of determining notability only applies to recent books, since books written in, say, 1994, long before Amazon stated selling books, would only experience back-catalog sales on Amazon, introducing a bias into the test. <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndomion_ea7e.html" title="User:Endomion">Ruby</a> 00:35, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I noticed that you were listed as a Christian Wikipedian. I am, too. I wanted to let you know that in the last 24 hours, someone has nominated 12 Christian biography entries for deletion. Not only does this seem like bad faith and an affront to a lot of hard work, but I'd like you to come and vote on the entries. These nominations seem peculiar because some people are even presidents of universities and well known authors.</dd>

Some of these articles already existed, some were created by Gastrich or known or suspected sockpuppets of Gastrich (see the RfC above). A.J.A. went through them all and nominated those which, in his view, were not notable per WP criteria. I checked Gastrich's contribution history and found a couple more, including this one. If you read some of the comments above,. and the nomination, you will note that I tried to verify the claims of notability (e.g. "prominent" positions) but did not find any reliable sources for them. I also checked the Amazon entries and sales ranks for his books, and found them to be way off the radar. Another editor has tracked them through to their publisher and found that they are self-published, which means that as far as WP is concerned they don't count (unless they prove to have unique authority, like <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Gunther_9e2d.html" title="Robert Gunther">Robert Gunther</a>'s self-published history of early science in Oxford). Gastrich called in the meatpuppets. We also have on here the usual smattering of inclusionists (nothing wrong with that) and tactical deletionists (remove-all-Godcruft), which more or less balance out in most cases. Does that answer your question?

<dd>Yes, this does answer my question. If I didn't have inclusionist leanings, I would probably have voted to delete most of these.

<li><b>Rebuttal</b>: Everything above was posted to skew the voting and make people turn against me and bias their viewpoint of the nomination and the entry. It's a pretty sick tactic. It shows they care little about the actual strength of the entry; which should be the only thing considered. Since the "warnings" have been posted, some people have even said that they've voted <i>only</i> because of the alleged misconduct. Consequently, they and the people who are engaging in this witchhunt should be ashamed of themselves. They've done irreparable damage to their integrity and to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 01:06, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If he's writen stuff then he should at least have a little slice of wikipedia? I mean, Wikipedia is huge, everyone can have a share can't they? Everyone thinks that because he isn't in the news, that he shouldn't be included in wikipedia, the so called "sum of all human knowledge". But how do we know he isn't influencial? He effects hundreds with his words..... <b>Further Note</b>: I was brought here, like many others by Wiggins2, or as he wants to be called, "Wiggie". I think we shouldn't be so quick to shoot him down, as I, &amp; probably many others, are grateful for his post to draw our attention to this subject. I wouldn't mind if the other "side" did the same. But we cannot ignore the fact that this is defintely going to open wikipedia into two halves; Those who want to keep. Those who don't. I.E. Christians, &amp; others. However, this should not be about religion. I would be ashamed of the christians on here if they only voted to keep the articles because they were christian orientated. This should strictly be business as usual, even though it does seem strange an editor would nominate so many christian articles. Maybe a hidden agenda? If an article's crap, then it should be deleted. Being an inclusionist, I will probably keep the most mundane article. However, the list of notable people list is like many others, &amp; should not be here. To do so would be obvious bias. I ask everyone to not be drawn in with a strict "You're wrong, I'm right" situation, but be open &amp; find a way to keep peaceful.... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:16, 22 January 2006 (UTC).

<li><b>Comment</b> I think there is room for an examination of these social issues. I can imagine an article that talked about public perception of injustice, popular movements to correct that percieved injustice (Free Angela!, for those of us who of a certain age), and the reaction to those movements. Okay, <i>Fry Mumia</i> isn't the title for that article. I'm not qualified to write such an article anyway; But let's leave open the possibility that this content, under another name, could be the stub of a good article. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 18:33, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Company with Eur30m turnover, wholly owned subsidiaries in several European countries, produces CRM software and is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.

<li><b>Comment</b> The Forbes 500 is an annual listing of the top 500 AMERICAN companies produced by Forbes Magazine. I have no idea if this particular company is American or not, but why are we basing notability on an American list in the first place? Your average Venezualan company (it seems to me) are likely to fail simply because they dont appear on this list?

<li>I said "<b>such as</b> Forbes 500". I did my research; I know it is a Norwegian company and I know Forbes is American.

<li>Actually, the WP:CORP criteria are quite low. <i>Any</i> kind of independent published works will do, as long as they are more than simple directory listings or incidental mentions.

<li>I suggest that if our guidelines exclude a company listed on the Norwegian Stock Exchange with an appreciable known turnover, they're probably rather too restrictive. I agree that there's little in the way of independent literature about this company, but that is not to say that it is negligible. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:45, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Only editors who haven't actually read our guidelines in the first place would think that our guidelines contain any such exclusions.

My back of the envelope calculation is with only 500 million people in the world workforce there would be 2.7 million potential companies this size.

<p>Bangalore-based Accounting software company that is one of two or three giants, and probably the leader of those, in its home market. Numbers among its customers half a dozen illustrious names including two auto companies, the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Reserve_Bank_of_India_096c.html" title="Reserve Bank of India">Reserve Bank of India</a>, and the Indian software giant <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infosys.html" title="Infosys">Infosys</a>. Fairly well known in the UK market, also sells into the Middle East and Far East.</p>
<p>I undeleted this a couple of days ago after what I regarded as an inadequate AfD: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tally_%28accounting%29_bfd7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tally (accounting)">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Tally_(accounting)</a>. The reason to delete was that it looked like an ad and the company had less than 500 google hits. Well that's silly but the article did need overhauling, which I've done.</p>
<p>I'm relisting this because there seems to be some concern about my unusual action in resurrecting a deleted article.</p>

<p>I have grave doubts about the notability of this person, or if he even exists(hoax?). Presuming he was 12 at the audition, then that would be at least 1977 +12 = 1989 when the show happened, not 1988. IMDB shows a 1991 production by the ABC in Australia, which on the credit list does not give this person.

<li>My reasons would be slightly different. The article as written is a nonsensical bunch of largely rumored statements, but that's an argument for improvement not deletion. However this doesn't merit the effort to improve it for several reasons. For starters virtually all persecution by Jews, and here's where I part company with many here as I think there probably was some, occurred in ancient times that are hard to verify. We don't deal with ancient religious persecutions because of that and because no one had an idea of religious freedom then. I know some prefer to believe that in pre-Christian times everyone was tolerance and sweetness, but in reality most empires or kingdoms punished those who rejected the official or civic religion. I don't see any reason to think the Jewish kingdoms of ancient times were any worse, or also enough better, to merit any special attention on this. Also I don't entirely approve of any of these "persecution by" articles as there a recipe to say "Aren't XYZ terrible!" and heap on. Lastly it really is non-notable and an opener to a hate-fest as mentioned.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 14:22, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ancient Persia was tolerant and allowed people to worship whatever they wanted. They were too tolerant, if you ask me. Rome was, for the most part, also tolerant, but they also required that you sacrifised to the Emperor. It doesn't matter if sources from ancient times cannot be verified as well as other sources. They are sources and Wiki allows those sources to be used. If those sources would not qualify, then we would have very few articles about the ancient world. But, as usual, when it comes to criticizing Jews, it is not allowed; what is allowed is to say how Jews were persecuted. Yeah, okay, I got it. It's quite obvious that you guys are organizing yourself on Wiki. I've noticed this on RfCs and I've noticed this here. You message fellow Jews to support your side. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 06:12, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'll give you Persia, mostly. However <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shapur_II_of_Persia_3e1c.html" title="Shapur II of Persia">Shapur II of Persia</a> and a few other Sassanids persecuted religious minorities. I won't give you Romans because this is one of those "polytheists are wonderful" mythos. By their own admission Romans desecrated other faiths on conquest, drove people to genocide, and punished religions that could not reconcile or syncretize with the Roman pantheon.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>What about treatment of non-Jews and Jewish heretics under traditional Jewish law, for instance? What about treatment today of those brought up as Orthodox Jews who then cease their observation of Jewish law? Has there been any systematic analysis of this? The <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shulchan_Aruch_cbbe.html" title="Shulchan Aruch">Shulchan Aruch</a> states that if a close relative dies who was a heretic, then rather than observing the normal week of mourning, one should wear white clothes and celebrate the end of an enemy of God. Doesn't this deserve mention somewhere (along with the fact that this prescription is rarely observed, and the question of what exactly a "heretic" is)? This is a perfectly reasonable topic to write about, an interesting subset of Jewish history. The current content is probably lousy, but the topic is fine. Work it out, don't just delete it. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 18:53, 20 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't oppose any and all articles concerning periods or movements within Judaism that are more militant/persecuting. However what you're talking about is largely fights within Jewish culture.(Who is Jewish, how do you treat "heretics", etc) What concerns other things I think can be dealt with in other ways. Perhaps something on the Jewish kingdoms or on debates among Jewish people. This is too open to abuse I feel. Added to that ancient persecutions are too difficult to prove or even understand in our day.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<li>I think the "Persecution by" articles are probably the more contentious ones. "Persecution of" doesn't necessarily lead to blaming any religion, but the "persecution by" leads far more easily to agenda-driving. I know of some people who dislike all the Abrahamic faiths and would be happy to read about all of them persecuting people to "prove" they are so awful.

<li>The problem is determining where to draw the line between persecution by religious people (which is what the name of the article suggests), which is singularly unencyclopedic, and persecution by governments which is done in concert with or as a result of religious authorities urging them to do so in an official capacity. Even in Biblical times, there were no such persecutions by Jews or Jewish-run governments, nor are there even today. The only point in keeping such an article, in fact, would be to say "This phenomenon doesn't exist" or something similar thereto... <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 17:03, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep and merge</b> with Historical treatment of non-Jews by Jews (currently undergoing AFD). To copy my statement from there: While all Jews are obviously different, this is a facet of Judaism that's absolutely substantial enough to write about by itself. Things it could note: Biblical commands to wipe out Amalekites, Canaanites, etc.; any findings on how those of other religions were treated under the Maccabean Kingdom and later; how apostates and non-Jews have historically been treated and are treated today (e.g., see if we can find news stories about tolerance toward and/or ostracism of those who "went off the path", and instructions from halachic authorities such as the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> on how to deal with such heretics); non-Jews' status in Israel; and non-Jews' status under traditional, Conservative, Reform, and other variants of Jewish law. There's a great deal to discuss here, every bit encyclopedic, and it shouldn't be thrown away just because the current content is incomplete.
<p>For those who've noticed the remarkable prevalence of Jews here, I would like to note that <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">User:IZAK</a> e-mailed me to point out this page, which of course doesn't show up on his edit history. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 18:41, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Simetrical needs to apologize very quickly here and now for his highly offensive comment that "...For those who've noticed the remarkable prevalence of Jews here..." which is totally disgusting and out of line. What is he saying, that Jews should "shut up"&#160;? This just reinforces the need to delete articles of this nature that are poisonous magnets that attract the wrong kind of misinformed and twisted debate and responses. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 08:35, 22 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To copy my response from the other vote: I'm certainly not apologizing for commenting on there being a remarkable prevalence of Jews here, because there <i>is</i>. How on Earth is that offensive? Stop trying to suggest that anyone who disagrees with you is an anti-Semite—you've lost an RFAr on that already for good reason.
<p>I was pointing out that you were electioneering, nothing more. You deliberately attempted to skew the proportion of Jews to non-Jews here to well over normal levels, thereby making the vote unrepresentative, and you know it. Don't get upset where you're called out. Not that such electioneering is necessarily prohibited on Wikipedia, but it could be taken into account by the closing admin if the vote were closer than it is. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 06:17, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I didn't find it offensive exactly, although it did make me uncomfortable. I don't like the implication that it's mostly or largely Jewish people voting delete. It seems a bit patronizing or something. Many of us who voted delete are Gentiles. In my case I've known very few Jewish people in life. However a few things make delete sensible. For starters we don't do "Persecution by" articles for other religions that generally lacked a political apparatus to persecute and represent less than 1% of the world's people. There is no Persecution by Sikhs article and there's almost certainly not going to be either. We also don't do ancient persecution by articles either. We could do an article on "Religious persecution in ancient times" and include the Jewish kingdoms, but that's a different issue. As it stands it seems like unfairly singling Jewish people out as any persecution they did is just not as noteworthy as that of Muslims or Christians.(Or Buddhists or Confucians for that matter)--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<ul>
<li>I didn't mean to imply that this was a reason for calling off the vote or anything. I just find it appropriate, whenever someone contacts me to vote on something, to note that that person contacted me. Clearly non-Jews as well as Jews seem to feel that this article should be deleted.

<li>Simetrical: There is process and method and then there is meaning and intent. While there may be disagreement about what is the best process and method on Wikipedia, there is no disagreement about the meaning and intent of the phrase you used "...For those who've noticed the remarkable prevalence of Jews here..." which you now compound (for the worse) by saying "...You deliberately attempted to skew the proportion of Jews to non-Jews here to well over normal levels..." (implying that Wikipedia works with some sort of racial or religious "quota system", which it does not). Most impartial and knowledgeable people would say your comments are truly unfortunate and VERY nasty, to say the least. I have not and did not use the words "anti-Semite" here and I have not accused you of being one (so quit playing "victim" please). I merely brought your attention to the fact that you continue to make tasteless and disgusting slurs, considered insulting by many people -- not just Jews -- that would be deemed beneath contempt and not to be uttered in polite company, which you should apologize for, and not, as you continue to do, reinforce and self-righteously "justify". Furthermore, you make it sound that I am running for some sort of office by using the word "electioneering" which is all rather strange. Oh, and I am not getting upset, do you think I should be? <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 07:27, 24 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia does not have any kind of "quota system". However, AFDs are theoretically supposed to derive their authority from community consensus, and therefore they should as much as possible represent a cross-section of the community. Jews are, I would expect (although I could be wrong), a lot more likely to vote delete here than other groups, and therefore you skewed the demographics of the vote considerably by mass-informing Jews of the debate. This may not have made a difference, of course, but I still find it distasteful, particularly when you did it untraceably.
<p>You never used the word "anti-Semite". You just called my statement "disgusting", "out of line", "highly offensive", "misinformed", and "twisted", and suggested that I was implying that all Jews should "shut up". Now, might you have reacted the same way if I had remarked on a preponderance of Shinto in an AFD for a hypothetical Persecution of non-Shinto by Shinto article? Perhaps. Based on your past actions, I'm inclined to think the contrary.</p>
<p>The term <i>electioneering</i> is generally used in actual elections, but can be used to refer to other votes as well. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 00:29, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

If there is a strongly held conviction that every religious group should have an article titled "Persecution of non-&lt;religious group&gt; by &lt;religious group&gt;", then we should prioritize it by the size of the religious group, in which Buddhists, Hindus, Taoists, Confusian adherents, etc., are covered before we get around to the Jews. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 19:09, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>First off, I didn't realize people had to take a number before submitting an article. In response to TShilo12, if there is valid information on any topic, shouldn't there at least be a stub about it. There are plenty of news articles supporting claims of Jewish intolerance be it from non-secular news sources, non-Jewish religious news sources or even Heeb Magazine and groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace. Obviously both of the "persecution by Jews" articles are filled with non-sourced, sometimes outright, bigoted statements, but that shouldn't condemn a topic as valueless, just it's current content. And just so you know, I wouldn't support any article simply because someone might have this or that viewpoint and is using Wikipedia as a soapbox, but if the topic has merit by virtue of undeniable observables then it deserves mention. And as to its encyclopedic credibility, would it not be true that if a topic can conceivably be the source of a respectable college thesis, then it deserves to be in an encyclopedia? <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrika_fdff.html" title="User:Grika">Grika</a> 21:47, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm open to discussion here, but my instinct would be to refactor any well-cited material that is not elsewhere, and <b>delete</b> this, along with other articles like <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_persecution_by_Muslims_d2ab.html" title="Historical persecution by Muslims">Historical persecution by Muslims</a>, Historical persecution by Atheists, and <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_persecution_by_Christians_a939.html" title="Historical persecution by Christians">Historical persecution by Christians</a>. All of these seem to me to rely on muddled categories: they pick out a broad religious affiliation, and then seek out persecutors who happen to be of that affiliation. And "persecution" is such a loaded word all around, especially when applied (as it is here) to a private citizen spitting at someone. I could imagine a useful article on human rights of non-Jews in Israel (which seems the real thrust of this), but not one focused primarily on violations of those rights. If violations are prevalent, that would come out in such an article; if not, so would that. More drastically, on a related article, even in a contemporary context, any coverage of "Muslims" ranges from Indonesia to Saudi Arabia. It's hard for me to imagine that any meaningful pattern of persecution ranges over such divergent societies. All worthwhile material here should be regrouped in ways that don't lend themselves to one-sided articles, whether this is organized by time-period, or on some other principle. <b>I don't usually monitor AFD these days</b> (although I'll watchlist this page), but if someone wants to nominate any of these related articles for deletion, you may feel free to contact me via my talk page, and I will cast essentially the same vote on any of them. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:24, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> under new name (Historical treatment of non-Jews by Jews). While all Jews are obviously different, this is a facet of Judaism that's absolutely substantial enough to write about by itself. Things it could note: Biblical commands to wipe out Amalekites, Canaanites, etc.; any findings on how those of other religions were treated under the Maccabean Kingdom and later; how apostates and non-Jews have historically been treated and are treated today (e.g., see if we can find news stories about tolerance toward and/or ostracism of those who "went off the path", and instructions from halachic authorities such as the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> on how to deal with such heretics); non-Jews' status in Israel; and non-Jews' status under traditional, Conservative, Reform, and other variants of Jewish law. There's a great deal to discuss here, every bit encyclopedic, and it shouldn't be thrown away just because the current content is incomplete.
<p>For those who've noticed the remarkable prevalence of Jews here, I would like to note that <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">User:IZAK</a> e-mailed me to point out this page, which of course doesn't show up on his edit history. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 18:41, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>(Put before IZAK's earlier comment to make the indentation less confusing:) The contents were a subset of the topic covered by the new title, since persecution of non-Jews by Jews is inherently a subset of the historical treatment of non-Jews by Jews. Articles should never present only one side of a story, and therefore I moved the article to a name that didn't inherently restrict the article to one side of a story. And since articles are routinely edited during AFDs, and regularly are kept due to their improvement over the course of the AFD, I see no problem with moving pages either. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 06:15, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have reversed Simetrical's highly manipulative move there, which he should <i>not</i> have done as long as this vote is underway. Furthermore, Simetrical needs to apologize very quickly here and now for his highly offensive comment that "...For those who've noticed the remarkable prevalence of Jews here..." which is totally disgusting and out of line. What is he saying, that Jews should "shut up"&#160;? This just reinforces the need to delete articles of this nature that are poisonous magnets that attract the wrong kind of misinformed and twisted debate and responses. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 08:29, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Again, I would like to know why moving a page under AFD should be verboten any more than editing it. And I'm certainly not apologizing for commenting on there being a remarkable prevalence of Jews here, because there <i>is</i>. How on Earth is that offensive? Stop trying to suggest that anyone who disagrees with you is an anti-Semite—you've lost an RFAr on that already for good reason.
<p>I was pointing out that you were electioneering, nothing more. You deliberately attempted to skew the proportion of Jews to non-Jews here to well over normal levels, thereby making the vote unrepresentative, and you know it. Don't get upset where you're called out. Not that such electioneering is necessarily prohibited on Wikipedia, but it could be taken into account by the closing admin if the vote were closer than it is. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 06:15, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Simetrical: There is process and method and then there is meaning and intent. While there may be disagreement about what is the best process and method on Wikipedia, there is no disagreement about the meaning and intent of the phrase you used "...For those who've noticed the remarkable prevalence of Jews here..." which you now compound (for the worse) by saying "...You deliberately attempted to skew the proportion of Jews to non-Jews here to well over normal levels..." (implying that Wikipedia works with some sort of racial or religious "quota system", which it does not). Most impartial and knowledgeable people would say your comments are truly unfortunate and VERY nasty, to say the least. I have not and did not use the words "anti-Semite" here and I have not accused you of being one (so quit playing "victim" please). I merely brought your attention to the fact that you continue to make tasteless and disgusting slurs, considered insulting by many people -- not just Jews -- that would be deemed beneath contempt and not to be uttered in polite company, which you should apologize for, and not, as you continue to do, reinforce and self-righteously "justify". Furthermore, you make it sound that I am running for some sort of office by using the word "electioneering" which is all rather strange. Oh, and I am not getting upset, do you think I should be? <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 07:34, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Keep</b> Just because it isn't interesting to you doesn't mean it doesn't matter to the people that speak it. It seems like a useful article, has an example of the language and everything. IJzeren Jan seems a bit of a hypocrite to me, seeing he has his own constructed language and he fought so bitterly over that site not being deleted. It's a language some people obviously speak, if this one goes then many others need to be cleaned out, including IJzeren Jan's language, where the outside link attached is <i>his</i> website!

<dd>Getting personal, Menner8? Well then, let me explain a few things:
<ol>
<li>Indeed, I dó have a constructed language. Several even. What's the difference? I'm very interested in conlangs and I do care for them. If you don't believe me, just look at the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Portal%7EConstructed_languages_dc7f.html" title="Portal:Constructed languages">Portal:Constructed languages</a> that I've co-created.</li>
<li>I didn't start the article about Wenedyk myself. It was started by someone else. What I did do was making a few edits later on. Besides, I have never claimed my language is notable, but others apparently do. And honestly, I don't care much if the article is there or not; it is not supposed to be learned by anybody anyway.</li>
<li>I didn't fight bitterly over that article in particular. At the time, there was a massive attack against a whole series of conlangs, mine included, and the reason for these attacks was pretty moot. So I stood up for all of them. If the vote had been about Wenedyk only, I would have abstained from voting.</li>
<li>The outside link points to my website. So what? At least, there is something on that website!</li>
<li>I know that Google hits are not the only measure for significance, but for fairly recent phenomena like young conlangs it is about the only source we have. The problem with V. is simply that there's nothing that would even confirm that the language exists at all. No grammar, no dictionary, no info about its creator, nothing! If there's a book about it, then please mention the title and the ISBN number. It the press has been writing about it, ditto. But the way it looks now, the whole thing might very well be a hoax. My point is: there's nothing to substantiate the article.</li>
<li>Saying that there are several people who speak it is easy. So, where are these people? Who are they? Can you prove it?</li>
</ol>

<p>Keep. I think the language is not only a beautiful sounding language, it also is a well-constructed language with simplified grammar. I am glad to hear that it has some speakers already and hope to read more words in Vemiesiire when the dictionary goes on-line. From Wikipedia user, Jeanette Neher</p>
<ul>
<li>Here I am, author of the article. I am here, I suppose, to defend what I wrote and explain a simple yet beautiful concept. It doesn't matter as much to you as it does to other people. I want the article to be included because I think it has information interesting to a specific audience. This is a real language, and all information I included is drawn right from its dictionary, comprised of thousands of words. I don't feel the need to verify its authenticity or provide you with names of speakers willing to write e-mails flexing their skills (although I easily could, if you would like). I don't feel the need because I don't think this discussion is even really about Vemiesiire, and I think a more general stance on conlags should be defined for Wikipedia, so we can have order and reason and not just personal vendettas and unnecessary hurt feelings.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the meanwhile, I stand by its authenticity and will always delight to share my specific knowledge with the world, and hope others feel the same determination. <b>Keep.</b> --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErika00177_5abb.html" title="User:Erika00177">Erika00177</a> 21:46, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A discussion regarding policy regarding conlangs has been, and in a way still is, going on. See <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONLANG_91ba.html" title="WP:CONLANG">WP:CONLANG</a>. Look, this is not about constructed languages in general, not even about yours. And this has <i>nothing</i> to do with any personal vendettas. To be frank, I even like your language, and I would certainly like to hear the soundbytes. It's about the question whether or not an article here in WP is warranted. And the arguments I used (lack of verifiability, original research, vanity, no sign of notability) would make one suspect that it isn't for now. You saying that it's all true doesn't change those facts. I agree with you this information is interesting to a specific audience, but that's really not enough for inclusion! Like I told you on your user page, there are several more specialised places for that. I even took the liberty to transwiki your article to the Conlang Wiki (<a href="http://conlang.wikicities.com/wiki/Vemiesiire" class="external text" title="http://conlang.wikicities.com/wiki/Vemiesiire" rel="nofollow">here</a> it is; feel free to do with it as you please). —<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>In mij legge alle fogultjes een ij</i></sub></font></a> 22:09, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Conditional Weak Delete</b> The author does raise a point that conlangs should not be deleted a priori, but the fact remains that conlangs must be NOTABLE to be included on WP. I could make up a very poor conlang in 10 minutes, but that wouldn't make it article-worthy. Alternately, I could make a very good one over several years, but if no one spoke it and it was generally irrelevant, it still wouldn't be a WP article. Author/article must show that this conlang is significant in some way (are there institutes that teach this language? are there provably a large number of people who speak the language? etc.) If this is done, I would be strongly in favor of keeping this article. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrazyCaley_d294.html" title="User:KrazyCaley">KrazyCaley</a> 23:51, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Nonsense. The letters are far too long to place in the Clinton bio. Keep. Just looked at the bio of the person who recommended this article for deletion and recommend everyone considering this AfD do the same. No one, from the right or the left, should accept or promote censorship here. That type of "editing" has no place in Wikipedia. Shame on you if that is your motivation. --DaveThomas 07:40, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"The substantive issues belong in <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>." I said. You're right, the letters don't belong in <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>. A discussion of the matter which is illustrated by the letters belong in the article. Wikipedia is not a repository of source documents. As for the documents themselves, I again state that the material belongs on Wikisource if anywhere, but I am not an expert on how that works. This is a matter of following our own internal rules on what goes where. Censorship has blip-all to do with it, and I'd ask you to use more care before casting shame upon others in the future. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomlillis_dfd4.html" title="User:Tomlillis">Tom Lillis</a> 10:00, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). Wisewaif pointed out a fairly high ranking among the Yahoo! podcast list, although 75 minutes had fallen to 61st place when I checked the link out. I am concerned with sockpuppeteering and/or meatpuppeteering here, but ultimately some of the "keep" voters have presented reasonable arguments for this podcast's notability. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 12:14, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> per wisewaif, but with a caveat. There is no Arbitron or Alexa for podcasts so far, and it would be rather difficult to build one. If Yahoo Podcasts isn't one of the big fish in the pond, asserting that something is notable for appearing on Yahoo's list doesn't necessarily mean anything. That said, it is Yahoo, and on the scale of big fish overall they're a basking shark, so I'm willing to give this list the benefit of the doubt.

<li><b>Keep</b> "If there is even confusion about the potential notability of something, it's not notable." that makes no sense, a complete logical fallacy. how many people outside the u.s. have heard of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harper_Lee_54ae.html" title="Harper Lee">Harper Lee</a>? she wrote one novel in her entire career, and released it at the perfect time. point being, many (who never read the book in high school) would question the potential notability. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamer.redeemer_80f7.html" title="User:Dreamer.redeemer">Dreamer.redeemer</a> (<a href="../../../d/r/e/User_talk%7EDreamer.redeemer_2b9b.html" title="User talk:Dreamer.redeemer">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dreamer.redeemer_8145.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dreamer.redeemer">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Definitely notable. Determining the notability of podcasts is hard though, even harder than notability for musical artists. Gaining nationwide (or rather: global) notability isn't really an important thing for a podcast that focusses on music that is more or less underground. I see 75 Minutes as more than just a radioshow: it has a sense of community that reaches out to underground musical scenes in all parts of the world. The show is notable not so much for the wide variety of listeners, but mainly for the wide scope of scenes and genres it covers. Rather than marking this for deletion, an overall discussion (as suggested above) on the notability of podcasts is in order. To make a comparison with musical notability again: my stance would be that articles are okay as long as they are objective. Ie: "This band consists of four members" is okay. "This band is awesome!!1lol" is not. PoofBird 18:29, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Seems like a reasonable explanation of what the site in question is all about; "notoriety" is awfully subjective, don't you think? Maniaclives 14:59, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I just wanted to point out that this podcast has released 35 shows (25 weekly + 10 bi-weekly) and it has very high production values. Furthermore, the program is 100% not-for-profit, so how could the article in question be an advertisement? Have any of the delete voters actually listened to the show before knee-jerk voting against it? It is a top-notch podcast and there is no reason it shouldn't be represented on wikipedia.

<li>"How could the article in question be an advertisement?" — it doesn't have to be for-profit to be an advertisement; it's an effort to gain listeners, and thus, an advertisement. --<a href="../../../h/o/s/User%7EHosterweis_526c.html" title="User:Hosterweis">Hosterweis</a> 23:46, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Alexa isn't too useful for podcasts -- podcasts use different distribution mechanisms from webpages, so a different metric has to be used. I don't think that metric exists yet, so some more ad hoc intermediate metric needs to be created. In the meantime, I would think Yahoo Top 100 is as good a system as there is at the moment. Like I said above, I think a centralized discussion on the issue is in order. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 23:52, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hi, I'm the (main) author of the page so far. A member of the team was notified that they had a page on Wikipedia and decided to add the "members" part of it. It seems they treated it more like an online journal, rather than an encyclopedia, but I did my best to clean it up and "wikify" it. Any advice on more to do to keep it would be appreciated, but for now I will continue to try to fix it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAMac2002_bdad.html" title="User:AMac2002">AMac2002</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAMac2002_9671.html" title="User talk:AMac2002">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AMac2002_5d2d.html" title="Special:Contributions/AMac2002">contribs</a>) 00:05, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>delete</b> hate to do it, but wikipedia is not the place for this. you have as yet no widespread recognition even locally, as indicated by google at any rate.

<li>Firstly, I respect all your decisions, but still you can understand how I want to keep this up. Secondly, I was judging validity by basis of the "List of improvisation theatre companies" note , as we meet all of those requirements. At the very least, I request you not take us off THAT page (leaving Scriptless In Seattle with a red hyperlink), but I still feel the page <i>is</i> warranted.

<li><b>Comment</b> -- Self-publishing usually isn't worth anything in the overall context of the industry. Very few reviewers will touch it, music shops won't stock it except maybe under "local interest". It's supremely difficult to get recognition outside the industry, and usually that's something a music group has to go through in order to achieve notability. It can be done -- ask DJ Dangermouse or the friends of the late GG Allin -- but it's damn difficult and even more rare. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 05:03, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Performing at Carnegie Hall is impressive, but lots of people perform there as <i>members</i> of an orchestra or band, and surely Wikipedia needn't have an individual article for every one of them. The article doesn't assert that this isn't the case for Hsu; on the contrary, it implies that he was there as a member of the NYC Opera Orchestral program. If he performed there <i>solo</i>, then yeah, that would be another story.

<li>"unexplained" is a good word and applies to both sides. I revoke my unwise term "snobbery". It was rather rubberstamping without looking into the history of contributions of the editor.

<li>While Gazeebow Unit fame and popularity is limited to a small geographic area, that does not mean that it is insignificant. Their fans in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada do not think that, and neither does Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) professor Philip Hiscock. On November 19, 2005, Hiscock presented a paper at a MUN Folklore Society conference titled "<i>Gazeebow Unit: Local Language And Vernacularity In A St. John’s Rap Group</i>". The conference focused on the issue of Newfoundland Folklore in the 21st century. Hiscock "explains their success by highlighting parallels of cultural relevance between Gazeebow Unit and more traditional forms of folk music", a quote taken from an article concerning the band in Volume 26 of The Muse, the student paper at Memorial. As they are an example of modern folklore in Newfoundland, I vote that their Wikipedia entry stay where it is. Hopefully, the article would evolve to include more concerning the reasoning behind their success and popularity and not just act as a biography of the band. So my vote, is <b>keep it</b>. ---Angelique Davis 08:24, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's about atheists who did persecute non-atheists.

Various Christian denominations were isolationalist, apolitical, or opposed to religious persecution in all forms.

<dd>Insofar as atheism is a statement of faith on a subject where evidentiary support is impossible, I can't agree that Atheism constitututes a "lack of belief" - on the contrary, many atheists that I have met have been more devoted to their religious beliefs (viz., "there is no God") than some Christians I have met have been in theirs (viz., "there is a God"). What you're describing is not atheism, but [[agnoticism]. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon_Dodd_96c3.html" title="User:Simon Dodd">Simon Dodd</a> 23:47, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with the original nominator's statement that these persecution by articles are unencyclopedic. The "atheism doesn't relate" here thing has some merit, but not as much as it's made out. Hoxha declared his state an atheist-state in a way that is different than other Communists and somewhat noteworthy. Other Communists, including Stalin, were occasionally willing to use religions to service some other agenda or pit churches against each other. Hoxha, and the Cultural Revolution, were unusual in the way they went after religion for atheistic aims. The <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_Revolution_5b68.html" title="Cultural Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a> article is currently large, but doesn't deal that well with the anti-religion issue. If you prefer "Religious persecution by Communists" though I could maybe see that.

<dd>The point is that atheism isn't a unifying belief system and it's not logical to lump together things done by atheists and link that to their atheism. It's comparable to, say, Historical persecution by people with blue eyes: having blue eyes is not a way people group together, because it's not a common belief. <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secularism.html" title="Secularism">Secularism</a> is an ideology which is often confused with atheism, and Historical persecution by secular ideologies might be possible. However, I can't think of a secular ideology which persecuted religion and wasn't also Communist. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 14:46, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can't move it to "Religious persecution by Communists" if it gets deleted. In fact I can't do that as long as it's on delete. And I'm aware atheists isn't a unifying belief system. However the article is not called "Historical persecution by Atheism" and deals with the fact these are philosophies with atheism as a component. The naming was sloppy, but so is the naming of all these. It can be easily argued that pretty much all <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persecution_of_atheists.html" title="Persecution of atheists">Persecution of atheists</a> occurs because of specific political-religion mergers in different nations.

<li><b>keep</b>. The article isn't very good as it is, but it's a legitimate topic. I don't think it can be objected to because it should be "communists". There's no logical connection betwen belief in communual economics and disbelief in God. The point is that <i>Marxism</i> was, as <i>part</i> of its whole philosophy, atheistic. It was the fact that atheism was the "official religion" of these states that was significant. The reality is that what needs to be discussed is the connection between the rise of "progressive" secularism/scepticism and the emergence of persecutory pracitces from some anti-religious factions. So the title is a problem, and maybe "secularists" would be better, since it would be desirable to include the persecutions conducted by the officially Deist regime of Revolutionary France. However any title might be disputed ("...group X weren't secularists/agnostics/atheists/unbelievers/sceptics/freethinkers..."), and that's not a good reason for disallowing a topic. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 21:58, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

If this page was re-written there would be very little content left, and it would be a nightmare to maintain.

<p>This is FAQ territory, and not is suitable for Wikipedia. This page is a car wreck, and attracts a lot of confused anonymous users to add information which isn't formatted in a way that is appropriate on Wikipedia. Put simply, we don't need this much 12 oz.

<dd>I think that would be the correct action to take in most cases, but sane upkeep of this page is impossible. Suggestions of large edits are met with resistance (see discussion page), and the show fan-base doesn't intersect much with the set of experienced Wikipedians. If this page was re-written there would be very little content left, and it would be a nightmare to maintain. I should also point out that all of this content originally was part of the main article which was later split into episode/character articles when it became unwieldy - merging is just going to bring us back to square one. I came to the main article after the split and made large edits in an attempt to "save" it - I don't think the same will work for the episode/character articles. <a href="../../../w/m/a/User%7EWMarsh_2c5a.html" title="User:WMarsh">WMarsh</a> 12:28, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The material is a mess, but it has every right of inclusion as, lets say, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Trek_episodes_b4c9.html" title="List of Star Trek episodes">List of Star Trek episodes</a>. Some material could go back to the main <a href="../../../1/2/_/12_oz._Mouse_e8e0.html" title="12 oz. Mouse">12 oz. Mouse</a> article (so a merge to Adult Swim is unnecessary), but it is fixable and should be <b>kept</b>. --Jeffrey O. Gustafson - <i><a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffrey_O._Gustafson_Shazaam_7ee3.html" title="User:Jeffrey O.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> and clean up to conform to standards. Maybe merge with <a href="../../../1/2/_/12_oz._Mouse_e8e0.html" title="12 oz. Mouse">12 oz. Mouse</a> if there's little content afterwards, although this is a renewed show for which the episodes will probably eventually require their own page, regardless of amount of content. IMO it seems a little ludicrous to say "we don't need this much _____ information on Wikipedia." Not to mention discouraging to the users who provided all this information in the first place. If upkeep is impossible, wouldn't it be better to just lock the page after it is cleaned up, or have someone watching to reformat or revert edits, rather than taking down all the information on the show? Please, let's not take down perfectly valid information due to a formatting dispute. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMac4drew_13fb.html" title="User:Mac4drew">Mac4drew</a></li>

<dd>this article should be deleted, since the subject is already covered (and better so) in the article "<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alawite.html" title="Alawite">alawite</a>". also, the page name is considered pejorative by alawis. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArre_fee4.html" title="User:Arre">Arre</a> 18:04, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are correct, I have seperated the alawis and nosairi needlessly. It looks like the nosairi have become much more insisten upon their islamness. Most descriptions I have read about the nosairi have been from older sources, and this has made it seem as if the two are entirely different sects. So, yes, this entry should be deleted.<a href="../../../n/y/g/User%7ENygdan_a250.html" title="User:Nygdan">Nygdan</a>1-20-2006</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin.html" title="Aladin">Aladin</a> article was nominated for <i><b><a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion</a></b></i> on 01/01/06 and <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_11.html" title="January 11">January 11</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. The result of the discussions were <b>keep</b> and <b>No consensus</b>, respectively. An archived record of these discussions can be found <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aladin_5963.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aladin">here</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aladin_%282nd_nomination%29_55d1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aladin (2nd nomination)">here</a>.</p>
<p>The first "keep" vote was based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aladin_%28magician%29&amp;oldid=33491529" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aladin_%28magician%29&amp;oldid=33491529" rel="nofollow">this version</a> of the article, which turned out to be full of nonverifiable facts (a wikipedically correct way to say it was full of lies).</p>
<p>After the artcle was stripped down to what is verifiable, the second "no consensus" vote was the result of some people thinking it would be smart not to delete the article, but make it into a redirect to <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladdin.html" title="Aladdin">Aladdin</a>. Since I am insisting on a <b>real</b> deletion of the article , after a small revert war and an exchange of insults (I am sorry I got myself dragged into it) I moved <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin.html" title="Aladin">aladin</a> to <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin_%28magician%29.html" title="Aladin (magician)">aladin (magician)</a> and now initiating a new vote.</p>

How many persons? What projects? What did he intersesting do as Vice-Chair? You intentionally dodging the question of his <b>notability</b>.

<li>After 3 AfDs and endless talk page discussions I am aware of your opinion. Please maintain your opinion (which to use your own words above, "<i>matters nothing</i>"). However, your refusal to accept any published sources, such as the Times article, is a violation of policy ("<i>Verifiability, not truth</i>"). Many experienced editors have pointed out that your statements regarding primary sources and continued willfull distortion of the meaning of original research are further violations. As you do not understand policy here regarding verification, sources or original research- and seem bent on creating your own- we have nothing to discuss. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 09:55, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>"Times" article is aladin's word of mouth. It is not a critical essay of a profesional magician. Two questions to you. (1) What exactly is written in Times article? Why I have an impresion that <b>nobody</b> read it? (2) Times article spells his name as "Aladdin" (capital 'a', etc. ) I find it suspicious that at his website aladin convenienly clipped out the name from the quotation. Are we speaking about the same person? What the heck is this alkemi? Does it exist anywhere but the brain of ladin? <b>That</b> is <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>.

</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep,</b>During the first deletion I seemed fairly sure of his notability but for the second one I was less sure. However, I have thought about it logically and I present to you the evidence:
<ul>
<li><b>Fact-</b> There was a 4-page supplement in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a> regarding aladin. People outside the UK will claim this is journalistic and from an unreliable source. However, The Times takes steps to ensure that the information contained in their newspapers is correct and they very rarely (if ever) fail for hoaxes.</li>
<li><b>Fact-</b> This is the most certain of the facts. Aladin was vice chair for <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Livingstone_67ff.html" title="Ken Livingstone">Ken Livingstone</a>’s Cultural Strategy in the mayoral assembly. He is described in the press released as <i>“a magician and live artist”</i> <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=604" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=604" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>. Several of the users who are against aladin have described this as unreliable. However, vigerous checks are made by the Mayor’s office. They have access to previous work information and other databases. They have to check them vigerously as if they are found to be fruedalant the bad publicity would be tremendous. They also have check all officials due to the threat of terroism.</li>
<li><b>Fact-</b> Aladin’s daughter appeared on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Channel_f606.html" title="National Geographic Channel">National Geographic Channel</a>. The summary of the documentry includes</li>
<li>“Aladin is a London-based magician of international acclaim, who was brought to that city as a child”<a href="http://nationalgeographic.com.au/front_new/watch/default.asp?mode=program&amp;tdatetime=12%2F23%2F2004+6%3A30%3A00+AM" class="external autonumber" title="http://nationalgeographic.com.au/front_new/watch/default.asp?mode=program&amp;tdatetime=12%2F23%2F2004+6%3A30%3A00+AM" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>. Although the documentry concentrates on his daughter, it also features aladin himself. Some might say that the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Channel_f606.html" title="National Geographic Channel">National Geographic Channel</a> is unreliable. Let me assure you this, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Channel_f606.html" title="National Geographic Channel">National Geographic Channel</a> is a worldwide channel and also checks the content it provides.</li>
<li>Thus, the above three sources are extremely reliable and checks will have been made for the conent that derives for them as any bad publicity received could ruin their reputation. All three assures it’s customers that the conent it provides is accurate. I have no reason to doubt this. If you have doubts e-mail them and find out.</li>
<li><b>Fact-</b> Aladin is also featured in the <a href="http://www.bookofcool.com/html/Profile_Casino_and_Cards.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.bookofcool.com/html/Profile_Casino_and_Cards.asp" rel="nofollow">“Book of Cool”</a> demonstrating how to pull off card tricks. This is an actual book and can be verified and bought. Aladin is in it. No question about it. Furthermore, Aladin was interview for the Family Tech Show in regards to this book. <a href="http://www.familytechshow.com/archives/000146.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.familytechshow.com/archives/000146.html" rel="nofollow">[46]</a></li>
<li>Thus, my vote is a Strong Keep as I have done my research. I have discounted all information that I see as unreliable and I have seen a magician notable enough for his inclusion in wikipedia. The only reason why I can see that the notability of aladin is still debated is due to the original article that completely over hyped him. aladin may not be a Darren Brown but he is certainly a magician with a colourful culture who has a cult status, especially in Bangledesh and India.</li>

<li><b>re:Fact</b>: in 1998 Times (which was not <b>The</b> Times, but its saturday entertaniment supplement <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Saturday_Times_Magazine_4fb4.html" title="The Saturday Times Magazine">the Saturday Times Magazine</a>, with less rigorous jurnalism, see aladin's own website for details) the person "Aladdin" is described, not "aladin"; you have yet to prove this is the same person. And I don't see his fame increased since 1998. (and I see it quite suspicious that aladin conveniently clipped out the name from the quotation shown at his website.)</li>
<li><b>re:Fact</b>: There were hundreds of thousands of people sitting in city hall offices around the globe. What exactly notable he did in this position?</li>
<li><b>re:Fact</b>: this is part of a series "Running For Freedom" about various immigrants. So here Roxanne his daugter is notable not he</li>
<li><b>re:Fact</b>: what is the notability of the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Cool_295a.html" title="Book of Cool">Book of Cool</a> itself? Any public library has hundreds of hokus-pokus books.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>1</b> The Saturday Times Magazine is <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a>' supplement as you said but it's still written and belongs to The Times and is checked in exactly the same way. If the Saturday Times Magazine has false info then it rubs off on the newspaper, which creates bad publicity, thus the same checks have to be made.</li>
<li><b>2</b> He played an important role in <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Livingstone_67ff.html" title="Ken Livingstone">Ken Livingstone</a>'s campaign for London mayor, that's what makes him different. Plus, he is described as a notable magician in the press release. Every claim they make gets scutanised especially by those running against Ken Lingstone for mayor. Thus, they can't afford to make mistakes.</li>
<li><b>3</b> The very fact that the National Geographic Channel describes him as a notable magician is important as they have to research their claims and subjects. Yes as I said, checks are made by the above three.</li>
<li><b>4</b> It's a book that features notable people in their fields. For example, the pool section is by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thorsten_Hohmann_3fa9.html" title="Thorsten Hohmann">Thorsten Hohmann</a>European Straight Pool champion and German 9-ball champion and the Rugby section is by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlos_Spencer_8baa.html" title="Carlos Spencer">Carlos Spencer</a>, New Zealand's 4th test points top scorer. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 21:19, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd like to raise a full-blown sockpuppet alarm here: Grandwazir has a editing pattern that is very similar to the already proven sockpuppets "Tiksustoo, Autumnleaf, Robsmommy, Grroin, Aloodum, and Aboutoxfordstudent": Few edits, and while the range of articles is diverse, it correlates very closely to those other UIDs. Additionaly, the first deletion vote has been filled with sockpuppets, so there is quite a high chance that will just try again here. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> 21:09, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Although I will admit that I have only been contributing in a regular fashion fairly recently I don't think you could call me a sockpuppet.

<li>Actually, the first vote got a "keep" vote because people assumed that all those false references where true. And also because Aladin voted at least 4 times. Those references are now pretty much gone.

<li>Though the very first version of the article did have unfounded claims, I believe the magician <i>is</i> notable.

The problem is verification, since not all of the sources are on Google, which makes it difficult to refute claims of fraud.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. It's a stub, but seems to be a stub about a notable magician. The references look like enough to assert notability to me. Original Research would be if the wikipedia doing the editing himself called up this guy personally and asked him questions, which he then published only on wikipedia. Now, if that same wikipedian performed this interview, published that interview in, say, The Times, or National Geographic, and then cited that as a source, it would NOT constitute as Original Research. If the external articles in question weren't written by wikipedians at all, then that's even another step removed.
<p>If this Aladin guy were to write an autobiography, you know, about himself, consisting only of information he knows about his own life, and publishes that autobiography, and a wikipedian then goes and references that autobiography, that is also <i>not Original Research</i>. I know that's not the case here, but the person advocating the deletion of this article seems to be of the opinion that just because these articles being referenced quote the man directly, use information that came from the man himself, that this is a case of Original Research. This is not the case. That's simply not what Original Research is! <a href="../../../f/i/e/User%7EFieari_a4ce.html" title="User:Fieari">Fieari</a> 04:09, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>weak conditional keep</b> WP:V version of this article reads "Aladin is a magician. From 2000 to 2004, aladin served on the Mayor of London's Cultural Strategy Group for London." That is what my keep vote is designed to keep. Any additional information added about the hoax firm "alkhemi" or the individuals birth location, or the contentes of any puff-piece single-sourced article (most of which appear to be totally innacurate) would cause me to vote "delete" to an article that is commercial spam and damaging the encyclopedia. This keep is also a vote only to keep "aladin (magician)" "aladin" will be a redirect to a disambig page. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 15:46, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>This was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lauren_Brown_e901.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lauren Brown">previously nominated</a>, and closed as keep, though I think it deserves revisiting. Most of the keep votes last time seem to be centered on him being in the Nebraska Music Hall of Fame. What wasn't made clear to everyone is that the Nebraska Music Hall of Fame is little more than a website; it has no physical presence, and cannot in any way be compared to halls of fame along the lines of the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame or the Baseball Hall of Fame (all of whose inductees would certainly qualify for an article). The real kicker is that I can only find one relevent google when I searched for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22lauren+Brown%22+%22lawrence+welk%22+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22lauren+Brown%22+%22lawrence+welk%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">"lauren Brown" "lawrence welk" -wikipedia</a> (the first two hits are the only ones that seem to be him, and they're both from the same site, the Nebraska Music Hall of Fame). <i>"Lauren brown" trombone</i> got me 234 hits, but I didn't see any other ones that seemed to be him. Perhaps a redirect would work for this guy, but I'm not sure where to.

<li><b>Comment</b> (1) I agree it might be important where you live. Much like the Woodbury Days festival and travelling circus where I live. The problem is, outside of your community, it is not important. If it is not important outside of your community, it does not belong on wikipedia. I'm glad you took the time to write about an event that I wouldn't have otherwise known about, but I think that information is best suited to a personal blog or regional forum instead of Wikipedia.

<li><b>I'm the programmer</b>* Hello people, it seems I am a bit late here. I agree that I created the boastMachine wiki page (about a year ago). But honestly I had never read the Wikipedia Terms. My bad. But the article was touched up by many a users. All I did was "create" the page. I never created the page with the intention of getting traffic or hits. I know boastMachine is doing ok. If you people dont like the page, please get it deleted. I have no objection.

<li><b>Dont think so</b> - I myself am a boastmachine user and i know the author personally. I dont think its an advertisement for boastMachine powers over 40K blogs.

<li>VfD listings should not come from Newpages. Its unfair, as many good articles today had really bad first versions.

<li>I actually get flack for being on the conservative side of giving needy articles a chance: If it's a valid topic, even a single sentence, as long as it is a complete, coherent sentence that states the subject and why it's notable, to me it should be kept--cleanup or attention, at most. However, others disagree, and some such articles get speedy deleted every day. That said, invalid topics will always be invalid topics. Also:
<ol>
<li>When I'm doing "newpages" patrol, since I load 500 at a time and start at the bottom, they're already a day or two old, and by the time I reach the top of the list they're 4 or 5 days old</li>
<li>The vast majority of speedy delete candidates are brand new articles, let alone VfD. If a user finds the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clayton_Moore_ae5f.html" title="Clayton Moore">Clayton Moore</a> red-link, clicks Edit this page, clicks 'bold text' on the edit tool bar and clicks Save, you're saying we should wait a week or two to see if they 'expand their contribution'?!?</li>
<li>And if we don't catch it from the newpages or Recent Changes list, what are the odds of someone finding it down the road? <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 20:02, 8 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b> There are over 500 google hits for "rude mechanicals" AND "washington dc". It looks like most of those hits refer to this group.

Only about half of the previously mentioned Google hits actually refer to this specific group. They did earn a mention in the Washington Post, though, so they're still borderline notable in my book.

<li><b>Delete</b> last time I saw a nomination like this was for <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_Baptist_University_19ac.html" title="Louisiana Baptist University">Louisiana Baptist University</a>. I voted keep on the basis that while it was not accredited it was useful to have in the encylopedia for the reasons Just ziz Guy and Ruby mentioned above. Unfortunately, the LBU page became a vehicle for POV editing trying to show the university in a very favourable light despite verifiable evidence. It led to many spin off articles of many minor ministers who have a degree from LBU. It also led to a huge acrimonious RfC. In short, these types of pages seem to be more about vanity and less about being informative. For these reasons I do not think an encylopedia is the place to be writing articles on non notable institutions. This encylopedia should stick to writing about verifiable and notable topics. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 18:41, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Delete. "Ringmail" is a Victorian-era misconception based on bad research of artwork and effigies. There are no textual references nor surviving examples of "ringmail". <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethwoodworth_be8d.html" title="User:Sethwoodworth">Sethwoodworth</a> 22:49, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>QUICK KEEP</b> WELL, the Broigne is mentioned in a 1980 book by a highly respected French scholar. that gives us a quite citable source, and proves the armor to have historical existence. I don't know anything about victorian era misconceptions, but on the French side, the bets are hedged, and I guess that makes the whole point of this AfD moot</li>

<p>This is an authentic variety of ancient armour, being a variation on <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scale_armour.html" title="Scale armour">Scale armour</a>. The only wrong bit is the lack of reference (I would help but all my quotable ones are French) and let's be clear, the Knights of William the Conqueror, as seen on the <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayeux_Tapestry_87db.html" title="Bayeux Tapestry">Bayeux Tapestry</a> did not wear chainmail <i>haubergeons</i>, but indeed ring and scale <i>brognes</i>, as did their forebears in Merovingian and Carolingian times. --<a href="../../../s/v/a/User%7ESvartalf_4e9b.html" title="User:Svartalf">Svartalf</a> 00:14, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> That may well be correct but it seems to have become a common term (if only in D&amp;D circles).
