<li><b>Comment</b>. When I was younger, I used to have an encyclopedia of literary characters... perhaps Wikipedia should spin off a separate wiki for collections of fictitious characters and fictitious worlds (of which there are plenty here) - and restrict the regular Wikipedia to fictional characters and worlds that are <i>notable</i> to a significant population... i.e. that come up as pop culture references or the like. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">BD2412</a> 23:16, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Like "Wikicruft", or something. Might work. Anyways, I gotta say weak <b>keep</b>.

<li>I am changing my vote to <b>Keep</b>, based upon the reasoning that GRider has been putting at least 10 SW articles of good quality up for deletion. To merge this with the Villians article would clutter it, as Jgm said previously.

<li><b>Keep</b>The article is fairly long and seems accurate. The person who wrote it must have gathered a lot of information, presumably from the video game he/she mentions at the beginning of the article. I would hate to see this article go, and maybe, as a user above mentions, there should be a Wikipedia for fictional things. Perhaps something like 'Wikific' or 'Wikifiction'.</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>. Well, it's certainly a big enough article, but it that's probably becauseneeds trimming down and cleanup. We don't have a seperate article for <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomi_Sunrider_ea83.html" title="Nomi Sunrider">Nomi Sunrider</a>, and she's got 3,640 Google hits. Of course, age might be a factor here; ten years of nerd debates might drive that up. If the character doesn't appear outside comics, than they're not notable. Anyone got thorough knowledge of this topic?

<p>Discussions about minor candidates like this have come up before (in fact, there was recently a Wikipedia forum discussion on the subject). The general consensus seems to be that (i) there is room on Wikipedia for some information about such figures, but (ii) they don't deserve individual bio pages. The compromise solution which most seem to accept is the creation of list pages, containing short biographies of candidates (or councillors, or whatever) who aren't quite notable enough to make the cut on their own.</p>
<p>(For those curious, the "Green Party candidates" page was started during the Chernushenko discussion about two weeks ago. It now has six entries, and is growing.) <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 23:51, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. ComputerLand was very important in the history of the commoditization of the personal computer. I'm surprised the article is so utterly stubful.

<li>First of all, this can hardly be the only "Southwest Boulevard" in the world. Furthermore, the article does not establish notability. Being "the most significant street in West Tulsa" does us no good if it doesn't give any indication of why. If it's just the main thoroughfare then who cares? If there's actually something notable about it, like there is with Broadway or Fleet Street (not that it has to be as significant as those), then mention what it is and let us vote based on that. Every city/town/village in the world has a most significant street (which can be a POV statement in itself), but if that's all that can be said about them then articles on them are worthless. <b>Delete</b>. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:29, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<p>Look, this article is just fancruft plain and simple. It is overly large and the topic of Google on Wikipedia is overly divided and longwinded. Take a look at the <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo%21.html" title="Yahoo!">Yahoo</a> article, and notice that Yahoo is a) twice as large as google b) older than google c) has a lot more services than Google. If there weren't so many zealots around here worshipping Google we wouldn't have this problem. And this is where <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groupthink.html" title="Groupthink">groupthink</a> kicks in; what do you do when everyone in the vote is biased towards worshipping the same thing? How about some objectivity around here. It's obvious the article is just crap and possibly violating Google's rights by putting <b>30</b> of their corporate logos on a single page. --<a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlterego_1aa3.html" title="User:Alterego">Alterego</a> 16:59, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my understanding, I wouldn't consider this "fancruft", even if it were too detailed. But I do not believe that the comparison to Yahoo is relevant—if one feels that Yahoo has more services and is more notable, one is certainly free to expand that article, but I don't interpret such arguments to mean that the information on Google should be <i>reduced</i>. You are right in that most of the information in the article could probably be found by following your link, but then again all the information in Wikipedia should be able to be found elsewhere. Our job is to collect it and present it in an easily-understood format, from an outsider's view. For instance, the page you cite does not actually contain any information on the services; and even when I tried following the links on that page I still did not reach pages that were informative about the nature of the service. Furthermore, I would prefer reading about something on Wikipedia, where for instance Gmail's potential privacy concerns may be covered in a way a company's self-description wouldn't. As for what to do if everyone else is biased except you—you consider that <i>perhaps</i> you are the one who is biased. Perhaps not ("If there's nothing wrong with me, there must be something wrong with the universe"), but I don't think groupthink as I understand it really applies here, at least not until the last few votes. Certainly facing 5 or 6 keeps and no deletes might give someone pause, but it trend would already be clear (unlike in real-time discussions where opinions are shaped concurrently). In any case, it's good to have a difference of opinions to keep ourselves in check. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 22:53, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC) By the way, that quote was not meant to be an insult (and it turned out that there <i>was</i> something wrong with the universe) — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 23:06, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I said either keep it or merge it. I have no particular preference as long as the content is preserved. Anyway, you're the one who has to justify deletion. Your justification is that it's not notable. Well, it's a song by a very famous and successful band. By my personal definition, that's on the borderline of notability for an individual article but unquestionably notable enough for inclusion somewhere. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:54, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just because the band maybe notable does not mean that the song is. Another way of looking at it, is that the VfD is for the song not the band. By your definition any "B-side" track (which is essentially what this song is) would be deemed notable - sorry but I won't buy into that argument. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesBurns_5f2a.html" title="User:JamesBurns">JamesBurns</a> 08:24, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't understand your argument, I don't think. Are you saying you don't think this info is notable enough to be worth including <i>anywhere</i> on WP? I mean, initially you suggested a merge. And a merge would be fine with me. But so would a keep, since I expect a reasonable amount could be written about this song and I'm sure a large number of people are familiar with it. I have no preference. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 08:34, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)

This page <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/alvin-and-the-chipmunks" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answers.com/topic/alvin-and-the-chipmunks" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> says that Theodore Keep (chief engineer) was one of the three creators of <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_and_the_Chipmunks_850a.html" title="Alvin and the Chipmunks">Alvin and the Chipmunks</a> which were named for the three creators. They won <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy.html" title="Grammy">Grammy</a> awards in the awards' first two years (1959 and 1960 for 1958 and 1959 work), both years for "Best Engineered Record - Non-Classical". The first year's "The Chipmunk Song" also won Grammys for Best Album for Children and Best Comedy Performance. A bit of Googling (including "Grammy" with Ted or Theodore Keep) answered the notability question easily for this one. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 03:05, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Um, no, it doesn't say that. It says they were created by <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Bagdasarian_51c3.html" title="Ross Bagdasarian">Ross Bagdasarian</a>, and one of them was named for Theodore Keep. Also, note that the site you linked to is a wikipedia mirror, so you'd be better off just citing the <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_and_the_Chipmunks_850a.html" title="Alvin and the Chipmunks">Alvin and the Chipmunks</a> page, which isn't the best source for writing wikipedia articles. This guy was the engineer, which is not exactly a terribly notable profession. Can you name one famous sound engineer? I don't think we even have an article on that profession, specifically.

<li>Anyway, with the new rewrite I'm changing my vote to <b>keep</b>, not because he was an executive at Liberty Records, or because Theodore the Chipmunk was named for him, but because he evidently contributed several innovations to sound recording. However, there is a slightly ambiguous statement that is important. The article states that he "provided the synchronization process that allowed Ross Bagdasarian to combine his speed-doubled voice technique...", now did he just provide it, or did he invent it? If he hit the button on the effects component that made the sound, therefore "providing" the effect, that's hardly terribly notable. If he invented the process then that's different. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:10, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><strike><b>Keep</b>. Canada = notability</strike> . <b>Delete</b>. Speculation, and even if it were not, its encyclopedicness is highly suspect.

<ul>
<li>A better analogy would be an article during the Clinton impeachment debate tracking the announced voting intentions of Senators or an article on voting intentions of British MPs on the foxhunting issue (which is BIG news in the UK). Tobacco subsidies are not a national issue dominating debate in the US, the same sex marriage issue is a national issue in Canada (and indeed has attracted significant attention in the US) and is dominating the front page. I think the move to delete this is yet another example of the Americentrism of various US based wikipedians. If it's not to do with the US then it's deletable.AndyL 18:59, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I object to Andy's attempt to paint me as Americacentric on the basis of this nomination. As I indicated, the reason why this should be deleted is because it is speculative, it has nothing to do with the lack of notability of the subject, because I DO NOT believe that the subject is not notable. Note that I didn't say to delete <a href="../../../s/a/m/Same-sex_marriage_in_Canada_2f08.html" title="Same-sex marriage in Canada">Same-sex marriage in Canada</a>. THIS article, as it stands, is nothing more than opinion, because the votes have not been cast. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 20:36, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OK then, where is this phantom article on the 105th US Congress and the Clinton Impeachment? Is there one? If not, then that analogy sucks too. Looks like this article is another example of Canadian centrism of various Canada based wikipedians, who have also been writing articles on everyone who holds a local public office in the Toronto area (where are the ones for New York City?) among other things. And why isn't this information in the article on <a href="../../../s/a/m/Same-sex_marriage_in_Canada_2f08.html" title="Same-sex marriage in Canada">same-sex marriage in Canada</a>? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 19:23, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Even though I live in Toronto, I didn't particularly support having articles on individual Toronto city councillors (except ones who are notable for other reasons), but the fact is that the ones that were nominated for deletion legitimately survived the votes. And it wasn't because they were Canadian; it was because there is some support, like it or not, for the notion that city councillors do merit articles. The idea that Canadian-centrism is something that needs to be fought against is utterly absurd; in reality, Canadian subjects on VfD are regularly forced to meet a <i>higher</i> standard of notability than equivalent articles from the United States. If you believe that city councillors don't generally deserve encyclopedia articles, that's one thing (and one I'd actually agree with you on), but let's get the issue straight: nobody's expecting special treatment for Canadian topics; we Canadians expect our topics to be given <i>equal</i> consideration. And there <i>are</i> American cities for whom people have written articles on councillors, even if New York isn't one of them. I don't agree with it, but they do seem to survive VfD often enough. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 03:02, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I'm not suggesting that fiction should be removed from Wikipedia. I am only pointing out that because there is room on Wikipedia for buckets of articles on fictional characters and events that people are interested in, there should also be room for an article about a hugely important and controversial and <b>real</b> issue in Canada that a lot of people are interested in. The issue will soon be resolved and this page will be quickly and easily converted to a record of the vote. As noted, the article focuses on the verifiable, publicly-stated positions of the MPs. Speculation has been discouraged and reverted, as watchers of this page well know. And in response to RickK's stunning logic ("Apples. Oranges."), no, it isn't. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevintoronto_ec05.html" title="User:Kevintoronto">Kevintoronto</a> 18:02, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The point is that this article has been prepared using public statements of MPs, so it <i>is</i> verifiable, and <b>not</b> speculation. Where speculation is used, it should be removed, just as with any other article. One or two bits of stray specualtion in an otherwise useful and frequently viewed article should not be grounds for deletion, but rather for editing.</li>
<li>And by the way, there are <b>178</b> articles in the Category "Star Trek characters". Apparently there is room for them, why is there no room for this article? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevintoronto_ec05.html" title="User:Kevintoronto">Kevintoronto</a> 17:54, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>And there are 60 articles and 17 subcategories in the Star Wars category. Just one of those seventeen sub-categories, "Star Wars characters" has 38 articles, plus an additional 78 articles in 6 sub-categories. And this is about something that is fictional! Canada, and its debate over same-sex marriage, is real. How can you be so upset about something that you call "speculative", when there is so much room taken up by fiction? Do we need more space for another sci-fi character who was on screen for 8 seconds in a movie made in 1975? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevintoronto_ec05.html" title="User:Kevintoronto">Kevintoronto</a> 16:16, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I have to note that when <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a> passed a bill within the past couple of weeks to bring provincial laws which made reference to marriage into accordance with the court decisions, there was some controversy <i>specifically</i> around the fact that it <i>wasn't</i> a recorded vote. People <i>do</i> seem to want to know how each individual politician votes on this. I'm not sure I agree that it needs to be a separate page from <a href="../../../s/a/m/Same-sex_marriage_in_Canada_2f08.html" title="Same-sex marriage in Canada">Same-sex marriage in Canada</a>, but it's not original research or speculation, either. It's quite clearly based as much as possible on actual public record, the relatively few assumptions in the article are perfectly solid ones (I'm gay and Canadian, so trust me, I <i>know</i> what's a reasonable assumption on this topic, and there isn't a single bit of speculation in here that isn't supportable.) For that matter, final reading of the bill is only a few weeks away, so the article will be <i>entirely</i> documented fact in short order. <b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b> into the main SSM article. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:17, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have found this article very useful in getting updates on the position of MPs on the vote, and it really helps to have all the MPs positions all on one page. I find it very informative. It also helps to have a table to add up all the current votes of in favour and against. Having each MPs position on their own page would make adding up the totals very difficut and cumbersome. Also, articles on current events are allowed on Wikipedia, which is what this is. Current event articles can often be based on a certain amount of specualation. In fact, I would even argue that even the most encyclopedic articles may have a small amount of speccualtion in them. A little bit of specualtion should not discount and invalidate an entire article that is very informative and useful. Also note that indeed it is not complete specualtion, and is largely based on MPs acutal statements and positions. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrenj_96a0.html" title="User:Brenj">Brenj</a> 21:43, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, but cleanup</b>. The article, at its heart, is a record of MPs' stances on same-sex marriage and specfically Bill C-38, which <i>has</i> been drafted and <i>does</i> exist, which distinguishes this legislation from a hypothetical bill about tobacco lawsuits. Any information based on published reports of MPs' stances is <i>not</i> speculation. The comments and prognostications based on an MP's constituency, however, are ill-founded and the MPs in question should be listed as unknown in the absence of any verifiable statements.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Very informative article. The page's format is very well done. If you really want to use the word "speculation," then consider it speculation based on reliable sources.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Obviously a lot of work went into this article, and it is very informative/interesting. If the MPs' opinions are verifiable through press articles and other published reports, then it is not speculation.

Either delete, or transwiki to the Arabic wikipedia, or transwiki to wiktionary. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 07:50, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC) Just to make it clear, my primary vote on this one is <b>delete</b> since the English Wiktionary should in general be reserved for English words, and foreign words should have a very good reason for being there, as for example "quid pro quo". Transwiki to the Arabic version would require a translation to Arabic. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 11:45, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>No!</i> Wiktionary's mandate is clear, and is right at the bottom of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Main_Page">Wiktionary:Main Page</a>. It is to include <i>all words of all languages</i>. The English Wiktionary will happily accept Arabic words, as long as the definitions are written in English. Being the English Wiktionary means that <i>the articles are written in English</i> and <b>not</b> that only the English language is covered. The other requirement is that the article title be the word written in the actual script of the language concerned. So the Wiktionary entry for this word would not be a romanization, as <i>this</i> article's title is. Figuring out the correct title is too much of a burden on the already overtaxed Transwiki system, which is not necessary dealt with by people fluent in transliteration. <b>Delete</b> and let <a href="../../../j/e/l/User%7EJelfar99_a494.html" title="User:Jelfar99">Jelfar99</a>, who obviously <i>is</i> fluent, write a dictionary definition in Wiktionary xemself, both for this word and for Zag.

<dd>Alright, sorry, guess I should have read the Wiktionary policy better. Still I do not think that this particular word needs to be there, and yes I agree that moving this to Wiktionary would be a burden on the interwiki system.

<p>No potential to become encyclopedic. Ā is not an independently collated letter like <a href="../../../%C3%A5/_/_/%C3%85.html" title="Å">Å</a>, it's simply an ordinary A with a diacritic.

<dd>To follow up: <a href="../../../%C3%A5/_/_/%C3%85.html" title="Å">Å</a> is interesting because it's not a mere diacritic (the ring cannot be applied to any other letter), the pronounciation (long O) is not obvious, it's the symbol of the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angstrom.html" title="Angstrom">angstrom</a> and the Swedish/Finnish alphabets consider it a unique letter.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Current contents besides the book's table of contents comprise a valid stub. The tidbit about appearing in the background of a scene in <i>The Matrix</i> isn't particularly important (I'm not sure whether it's Matrix fans that keep adding trivia to articles on modern philosophy to convince people of the film's intellectual worthiness, or philosophy enthusiasts adding it to philosophy articles to tie the subjects in with a popular culture reference point, or both, or what), but it is true and the whole thing is verifiable.

<p>This is what has happened to this article so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>This page was initially created as vandalism; most likely an attack.</li>

<li>During the debate <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERemes_f03e.html" title="User:Remes">User:Remes</a> made a commendable rewrite of the article, but apart of him, only one person, yours truly, commented on it (I changed my vote from delete to weak delete).</li>

<li>I have now submitted this for deletion again for a new debate.</li>

<p>My vote is still <b>delete</b>.

I'm not voting in this VfD, although I'm not going to be sad if it get deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have just rewritten this article as a stub about the real R.E. Lee DeVille. I have absolutely no knowledge of mathematics, so I can't say whether he's notable, although I doubt it, since essentially he's a postdoc at NYU. Someone who knows more about math could look at it and comment here about whether he's worth keeping in. Also, my stub is really inadequate, because I can't really understand his CV or his research interest statement. Again, someone who knows more about math could do much better than I did. Anyway, I'm going to withhold a vote at all now, because while this is no longer the attack or nonsense that it was before, I'm still not sure whether he's sufficiently notable or not. <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERemes_f03e.html" title="User:Remes">Remes</a> 22:58, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Still <b>delete</b> but weakened, Remes has made a valiant attempt at saving this page, and the page is no longer an attack (or perhaps a self-deprecating vanity?). I do not think that Deville passes the <i>average college professor</i> bar (I believe that has been the standard on whether to keep or delete such articles) for notability however, being an associate research scientist would suggest that he does not.

<dd>Thank you for countering your own POV bias by bringing in this article since it clearly shows that the first entry was about "Roman" and not "Israeli" subject. See [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_Human_Atrocities&amp;diff=10266955&amp;oldid=10266740" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_Human_Atrocities&amp;diff=10266955&amp;oldid=10266740" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>]. This shows that your allegations are wrong, it is just that you are paranoid. As for the entry about Goldstein, this is a known fact and the Wiki article itself refers to him as "Jewish-American", "Zionist", and "Kahanist". I fail to see how these are a POV since he is all of these.<a href="../../../a/2E/k/User%7EA.Khalil_a8d8.html" title="User:A.Khalil">A.Khalil</a> 13:51, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Extremely <b>Non-Notable</b> The article was created by an Anon, 141.219.44.182, a member of the Portland Surrealist Group and friend of Brandon Freels as a means for <b>web-promotion</b>. The article is also a means of advertising this unknown, "author" of two chapbooks! The kind that sell for under $5.00. There is around 900 plus google hits for this Brandon Freels, who shares the same name as a Gamer, who is probably the one getting the share of google hits. Another Surrealismcruft Stealth Ad and Vanity Page written for a friend! Plus, I cannot find any <b>credible</b> and legitimate reference source from any notable sources, such as literary critics and literary reviews (no backslapping praises from bogus independent unknowns, either please!) that can tell us anything solid. A marginal and certainly to be considered as spam. Notice that this is also a member of the Portland Surrealist Group, where an anon yesterday went and removed the VfD tag from that article, (check that pages history).<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 17:31, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Once again you make assertions (141.219.44.182 is a member of the Portland Surrealist Group) without providing any basis for them, and thus these statements are entitled to be given the weight they deserve, which is to be utterly ignored. I would say that we should ignore everything here until you provide some support. Furthermore, putting "author" in quotes shows you don't know what quotation marks are for. He's the author of them, no matter how worthless they are. And why do you care how much books sell for? <b>Keep</b> until you bring up some actual, marginally-supported argument. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

<dd>Noted. Dan, you just stated, <b>"He's the author of them, no matter how worthless they are."</b> You did just state that fact, and after looking at the obvious, with your own admission above, "worthless", all the more reason to delete! Are we going to give articles to everyone that all of a sudden is a self-described author? Dan, I want to work with you on this, but after what you just stated above, well, it is kind of downhill from there, you know.<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 18:17, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Any person with a brain would be able to correctly interpret this statement. It's not saying they are worthless, not saying they are valuable, not making any kind of statement on their quality. And what on earth do you mean by "self-described author"? "Author" isn't some kind of honorific; it just means that someone has written something, of whatever quality from horrible to wonderful. Your seemingly deliberate misinterpretation of my statement shows that the last thing you are interested in doing is working with me. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

<li><b>Comment</b> (no vote from me on this one): I find 375 hits for "Brandon Freels" without the word "Wikipedia". I note that poems by Brandon Freels have been published in <a href="../../../e/x/q/Exquisite_Corpse_6e2a.html" title="Exquisite Corpse">Exquisite Corpse</a>, a literary magazine of some note. I'll leave it to other Wikipedians to decide if this constitutes adiquate notability. I urge our Surrealist (or "Surrealism influenced") friends not to remove vfd notices from articles if those were placed according to proper Wikipedia VFD procedures. Continued removals of such will be considered vandalism and dealt with accordingly. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 18:32, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Granted, Infrogmation, anyone here on Wikipedia can write up something, make up a resume of website submitted poetry, state they are a writer and then submit to Exquisite Corpse, but are they notable? Infrogmation, <b>you too can submit to Exquisite Corpse</b>, as can I. The facts presented to the Wikipedia Community are clear, <b>Brandon Freels is a new writer, a self-identified (or self-labeled), "surrealist" and he wrote two chapbooks that sell for under $5 dollars</b>. His chapbooks did get picked as, "Powell's staff picks", Powells is big bookseller store (kind of like a Barnes and Nobles) in Portland, Oregon., and wouldn't you know it, (talk about convenience!) Brandon Freels is from Portland, Oregon! I wonder if he works at Powells bookstore where his chapbooks are labeled as, "Powells staff picks".

<li><b>Delete</b>, I think. Your vendetta tone makes it hard to tease out the issues, ClassicJupiter2--it doesn't really do your argument any favors. In general, authors published in non-vanity presses are notable (or at least, that seems to be the precedent. I'm not sure it's true). However, this seems to be highly local. Is there any evidence these books are sold and read outside the Portland area? Just as a band with only local appeal is not notable, I think I have to come down on that side here. But I'd change my vote if it were demonstrated otherwise. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> 19:58, 2005 Mar 9 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why do people keep describing it as <i>vanity</i> when there's never even been a suggestion that Freels is the author of all or a significant part of this article?

<dd>On what basis? There is a general problem in Wikipedia, which one would expect to have <i>some</i> sort of objectivity, in which unsupported <i>feelings</i> that certain articles are "vanity" are the basis for possible deletion. In my opinion we should confine ourselves to the non-notability argument unless and until we have some basis for thinking this is vanity. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

<dd>Whether an article is true vanity or merely non-notable barely matters, and to some degree the two are almost interchangable when talking about extremely obscure subjects. If a Kindergardener was going to write an article about how he's the all-time hopscotch champ at recess, would it really matter if he wrote the article himself or got his brother or best friend to do it? Either way, it would still be, in a sense, vanity. If an article is about a hoplessly obscure subject, the term "vanity" can be used, even without a signed confession from the article writer. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 03:08, Mar 12, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>What you're really promoting is a dilution of the integrity of Wikipedia. Absent any reasonable basis to believe or suspect that the subject of an article, or, more loosely, a friend, relative or associate wrote it, we shouldn't call it vanity, whether it "barely matters" or not. Your saying that an article about a hopelessly obscure subject can be called "vanity" is an endorsement of playing fast and loose, even an endorsement of dishonesty by recklessness. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

<dd>Well, fast and loose is how the game gets played here. This is VfD, not Dragnet... nobody here has time to do hours of research and detective work such as tracing IPs and the like to "prove" vanity. If it looks like vanity, smells like vanity, and the subject is thouroughly not-notable, chances are that, yep, it's vanity, no signed confession required. If we're wrong once in ten thousand times, so be it... it doesn't damage the integrity of WP any more than the supposed vanity article would have if kept. It's true that "vanity" can sometimes mean <i>"the article subject has admitted that they themselves wrote the article"</i>, but far more often it's actually shorthand for <i>"the article subject is so hopelessly obscure that I believe that only the subject themselves (or possibly family or friends) could have written it"</i>. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:44, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The intent of putting the Living Bill of Rights, the Living U.S. Constitution, and the Living Declaration of Independence up is to create pages where the open editing process of wiki can be applied to these documents in a way that is both original to the Wikipedia and allows the original documents to maintain their integrity on the Wikipedia.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> on one hand, the <b>Alexa score of 320,513</b> is respectable (if unspectacular). On the other hand, it seems brand new: 2 different blogs claim it opened on March 7th.

<li>Thank you so much Andrew for raising the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa_Internet_43d9.html" title="Alexa Internet">Alexa</a> webpage ranking comment.

<li>A fair question, though I don't think there's really any one answer. It depends on the site. I'm pretty sure Alexa mostly tracks links and visits, so certain types of sites can have higher Alexa ranks than others of equal notability. In general, though, I think that if a site manages to get itself into the top 300,000 in <i>two days</i> then there's clearly some momentum going. As my vote states, though, I think we should give it a little time to see if it can keep it up. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 21:24, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reconsider?</b> Have now (finally) managed to find the original vfd pages and read some of the ongoing discussions regarding problems with sock puppets etc. First, I am not a sock puppet. Second, I do not have any ties to the movement or its creator. Third, the Wikipedia guidelines suggest strongly that when clear consensus can not be reached, admins should always err on the side of inclusion rather than exclusion. Fourth, as the movement has several thousand members, most of whom are probably more intersted in Universism than in the Wikipedia, it is fair to assume that many votes from unregistered users are legitimate. I have no stake in the outcome of this discussion, but worry that administrative egos may be blinding some admins to common sense. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllanrevich_79af.html" title="User:Allanrevich">allan</a></li>

<li><b>Reply</b>: Thank you for your follow-up, R. fiend. Two questions: At the close of this discussion, should this article redirect to the Wookiepedia?

<ul>
<li>Personally I'm against a redirect to Wookiepedia, as it would be much the same as keeping it in wikipedia. I was also unaware wikipedia allowed for external redirects, but as I am not involved in any of the wikimedia projects outside of this one I admit I know little about how they interact with wikipedia. I believe when we transwiki a word to wiktionary it is no longer an active link from wikipedia, and I see no reason why this should be different. I have no objection to articles on more significant aspects of Star Wars being included here (and my bar for inclusion may be lower than many would imagine) but this doesn't cut it for me. Those people interested in the Nubian Design Collective know it's a Star Wars thing and would know its better to check Wookie- and Wiki- (once word of its existence reached the Star Wars online community, and I certainly expect it will). Those who don't know its a Star Wars thing would most likely expect to find some sort of <a href="../../../n/u/b/Nubian.html" title="Nubian">Nubian</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/Design.html" title="Design">design</a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collective.html" title="Collective">collective</a>. Wookiepedia seems like it will be a great place for Star Wars fans (and I am, in a way, one) to write an in-depth article on the two stormtroopers who were having a personal discussion while Obi-Wan was deactivating the tractor beam, without having to defend it at a VfD every 3 months. As for the second part of the question, well, there are no real hard and fast numbers. I wrote about the google test on its discussion page, though I'm not sure any more than 2 people read it, and I think I should have addressed fiction with a large online following. Maybe I'll go back an add a section. Anyway, I would say anything Star Wars related will be disproportionately over-represented on the web. Though even if that were not true, I know of no example in which 7 hits passes the google test. Perhaps if those hits were strikingly significant, but I think it's been established here that they were not. None of them even said what the collective was. The best one could say is that the test is not relevent in this case, though I'm not convinced that would be true. So how many hits passes? Can't say, but it's more than 4 unique ones. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:15, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

There, info can be given to it by someone who can knows something. And wiki is supposed the ultimate source of information on any given subject within the Star Wars universe.

<li>It didn't just slip by; it had quite a thorough discussion, preserved at Talk:List of songs with brackets in their titles. there were the usual überinclusionists and some real votes from people who genuinely enjoy quirky lists. And there's always sympathy (from me too!) for <i>anything</i> that's a) the product of systematic, thorough hard work and b) can't be easily found elsewhere. I think there may be a de facto consensus that lists of songs get a special dispensation; look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_songs_7fe6.html" title="Category:Lists of songs">Category:Lists_of_songs</a>.
