<li><b>Keep</b>. All of these articles could be improved and modified to include citations. The fact that they have been put up for deletion with no honest attempt made to ask for references is troubling. What can be done when vandals take over the library and become the librarians? I have moved these articles to another wiki that respects human knowledge and the search for new knowledge. I will also copy them into Wikiversity as soon as it opens. Request to Wikipedia's deletionists: the next time you get bored and start throwing out articles that are important for the Wikimedia Foundation's mission, please think about donating them to Wikiversity. --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 00:39, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'll ignore your intimation that bringing these to AfD is a form of vandalism... I think it's <i>common sense</i> that what exactly constitutes a "problem" is completely subjective. The article is based on a POV/OR violation from the getgo. It's not just that these articles are atrociously written (which they are) and not just that they're filled with questions which violate <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> because some editor is basically the one asking the questions in the article, like <b>"Can we someday perform a brain transplant?"</b>. I could riff on these articles all night long and think of hundreds more questions like <b>"Can we someday regenerate severed limbs?"</b> and <b>"Can we someday spontaneously generate a third bionic eye that is capable of sending and receiving text messages?"</b> This parlor game of free-association regarding such "unsolved problems" in question form has no parameters and thus no end. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 20:37, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The current articles are xxxxxx and it is far from clear clear (and even impossible to define) what belongs there. If it means "everything what is currently explored" then the list must be thousands of times as long and any selection would be NPOV. What means "unsolved"? We cannot know anything in all its facettes and every detail - does that make everything "unsolved"?. That you can formulate an "unsolved" problem is only possible if you know so many details of it that you can no longer call it "unsolved". I have the strong feeling that these can never become real articles. <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECacycle_6f2f.html" title="User:Cacycle">Cacycle</a> 02:37, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>How is a list of vague questions like <b>"What are the chemical origins of life?"</b> considered "essential for proper understanding"?? And you do realize, don't you, that questions like <b>"How can one design and make an effective catalyst for any desired reaction?"</b> is so vague and open-ended, one might as well make the whole article a lot shorter and simply ask <b>"When can mankind solve all unsolved problems?"</b>, which would be no more or less edifying. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 20:37, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>We now have 13 unsolved problems in chemistry, 7 of which with their own article with (importantly) relevant citations. The intro clearly states that the list should not include how-to problems. I understand that the concept of unsolved problems is poorly defined but I guess that whenever more than one theory tries to explain the same phenomenon you have an unsolved problem. I think the only issue is with Medicine, at first glance limited to howto's but not addressing the fundamental issues. <a href="../../../v/8/r/User%7EV8rik_a2ae.html" title="User:V8rik">V8rik</a> 16:10, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I disagree. His being troubled by your zeal to delete is entirely relevant, seeing as you were the nominator of these articles, and is certainly not a personal attack - it's his opinion. A personal attack would be "you delete perfectly good stuff". He's saying "you delete things a bit more that I would". Furthermore, I find your noting of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> to be very interesting - although it may or may not be so, it appears to be to be an intimidation tactic. -<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterested2_48ca.html" title="User:Interested2">Interested2</a> 02:17, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm glad it's so obviously "rediculous" [sic] to you. Maybe you can explain why you think "problem" is NOT a subjective (that means "matter of opinion") term? What constitutes a "problem"? Seriously. And since these articles are filled with open-ended free-association loaded questions, (some are almost as bad as the old Groucho Marx loaded question "Do you still beat your wife?") how can you deny that unsourced questions that wonder if mankind will ever achieve certain things are anything but speculation, and therefore POV/OR? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 21:13, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, because there are verifiable, citable sources at to what is or isn't an unsolved problem in a field. If <b>a specific</b> question is unverified, then it can be excised, but the overall article is fine, and <i>This article needs some editing</i> is not a criterion for deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:23, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There are unsolved problems in every field that when solved, will advance knowledge in that field to a new level. Division by zero comes to mind as an example. Lists of those questions are attractive to the intellectually curious. The articles might do well to add "previously unsolved questions" and note how those solutions advanced human knowledge. --<a href="../../../e/z/r/User%7EEzratrumpet_88de.html" title="User:Ezratrumpet">Ezratrumpet</a> 09:37, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I really think that user <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> should stop arguing that the chemistry unsolved problems are unreferenced. At least the articles <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_water_reaction.html" title="On water reaction">On water reaction</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/z/Enzyme.html#Kinetics" title="Enzyme">Enzyme#Kinetics</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homochirality.html" title="Homochirality">homochirality</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/y/Asymmetric_induction.html" title="Asymmetric induction">Asymmetric induction</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bond_rotation_barrier.html" title="Bond rotation barrier">Bond_rotation_barrier</a> to which the unsolved problems refer have discussion and ample references. I am not prepared to invest more time in the article as long as this business continues although I have new articles and unsolved problems in preparation (<a href="../../../s/u/p/Superatom.html" title="Superatom">Superatoms</a> and tunneling effects in the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinetic_isotope_effect.html" title="Kinetic isotope effect">Kinetic isotope effect</a>) Also I object to the bundling of different articles , why mathematics is not listed and chemistry is I do not know and the poor quality of the medicine article is not my concern . Also the deletion discussion should end after 5 days and we are now living in day 6. Why not have an improve tag and move on? I am considering making <a href="../../../u/n/s/Unsolved_problems_in_chemistry.html" title="Unsolved problems in chemistry">Unsolved problems in chemistry</a> a <a href="../../../c/h/e/Wikipedia%7EChemistry_Collaboration_of_the_Month_e6eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Chemistry Collaboration of the Month">Wikipedia:Chemistry Collaboration of the Month</a> if that helps <a href="../../../v/8/r/User%7EV8rik_a2ae.html" title="User:V8rik">V8rik</a> 22:09, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
