<dd>I cleaned up the article a bit because it's looking like a "no consensus" <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus.html" title="Consensus">consensus</a> is going to be the last word... but the page itself could still use some help. Most AfDs I have initiated which have been kept have been because someone bothered to clean them up, but in this case, no one who has voted keep has made any attempt to add references or otherwise improve the list. Thus, I'm still leaning towards delete on this one, simply because while the article itself is possibly worthy of being kept due to the newsworthy nature of rappers being shot, the article itself is totally unmaintained and in need of references. Perhaps it could be left on a temporary basis pending expansion? <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalad_Days_cbd9.html" title="User:Salad Days">Salad Days</a> 02:34, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. It's an orphaned, uncategorized page- no surprise that it's "unmaintained." Anyway, I -de-prodded the article because I know that this is information some people are interested in, and no category directly covers the same subject. Questions over one entry aren't enough to throw it out entirely. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice"><span style="color:indigo; border:thin solid cyan; background:aliceblue">Groggy Dice</span></a> <span style="border:thin solid gold;"><a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGroggy_Dice_aa9f.html" title="User talk:Groggy Dice">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Groggy_Dice_610a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Groggy Dice">C</a></span> 04:05, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Unimpassioned Keep</b> or <b>Recreate as Category</b> - Sad as it is, were this for any other type of musical performer this list would be pointless trivia and overcategorization. As it is, getting shot is an important and status-building event in many circles of the rap community. It is useful information to many, as is it interesting to those same people. -- <a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">Y|yukichigai</a> 06:47, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think this is a potentially encyclopedic topic that is actually somewhat likely to be looked up. The problem is, the current content is almost non-existent and there are no sources. I wouldn't be opposed to what is currently there being deleted, without prejudice of recreation with reliable sources. However, If someone wants to salvage this before the run of this AfD I would likely support keeping the article, provided that it lists more information than a category could provide. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 06:58, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is maintainable, encyclopedic, verifiable, etc etc. as well as being a list that many users might actually use (which so many of them can not claim to be.)

<li><b>Delete</b> Although I'm open to a List of musicians who have been shot and then arranging it by genre.

<li><b>Delete</b> even given the name change and expanding it to musicians, is it really that useful? What about stabbings, poisonings, "pushed down the stairs", general maiming injuries? And what of other entertainers and notable people apart from musicians? You may just as well have a list of notable gunshot victims over the ages (which I think may be a real category).

<dd>There are areas where a list is useful or even better than a category. My print encyclopedia from <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> has an article called "naval terms", but it's basically just a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_naval_terms.html" title="List of naval terms">List of naval terms</a>. (It's far far more extensive than the Wikipedia list I linked to, it goes on for pages) It's not an article discussing naval terminology and what it means in history, it's just an annoted list that explains varied terms. Likewise areas that need more explanation than a category can provide are good in list form. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_with_epilepsy.html" title="List of people with epilepsy">List of people with epilepsy</a> or many other things in <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_lists_c1de.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured lists">Wikipedia:Featured lists</a>.

<dd>It is arguable that musicians, and particularly though not exclusively rappers, who have been victims (or perpetrators) of violence are notable as part of a social phenomenon that undoubtedly influences their music.
