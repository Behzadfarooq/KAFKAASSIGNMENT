<p>Defense: I have maintained an extremely effective social protest weekly newsletter for THREE YEARS with a subscriber base of over 100,000 people internationally. I am well-known for taking creative and serious positions on controversial social issues. This is in no way a VANITY article, by your definition - as thousands of subscribers will attest, (if perhaps you would like me to have them email you directly in my next newsletter with support.) I suggest you give serious consideration to what is intended by my entry - looking at the implications - and the ways that it can be expanded as the Church of Shaddapology is granted status as a registered religion in the upcoming months. ~~Joe Dolce, Nov 4, 2005.</p>

<li><b>STRONGEST POSSIBLE DELETION</b>. - The FINAL Deletion. The MOTHER of All Deletions. " - Ok Folks, I bow to the consenus regarding deletion of Shaddapopogy and The Church of Shaddapology as unsuitable for Wikipedia. Delete away and I trust you get a warm feeling from it. (Although I do recall that Walt Disney had a 'cabinet' of ten advisors and would only go ahead on one of his ideas if NINE of them thought it was bad. I don't think Walt wouldn't have done too well on Wikipedia either. I noticed Shaddapology got one KEEP and even though it was unsigned, thank you O anonymous one! - if it was good enough for Mickey Mouse, it's good enough for me.) Some comments: ' Carnildo - 'anyone can make a parody religion?? Really?? Let those amongst you who have made a parody religion cast the first stone. Biting the newcomer. Go to the back of the Wikipedia class. The deepest comment of course was Ben Aveling's 'agrodolce' (sweet and sour) encouragement, ' I liked your song - but your pages aren't of the same high INTELLECTUAL quality. ' Think about that one. I will admit that 'Shaddap You Face' had more footnotes. Point taken. Say, if anyone is interested on the true meaning of BITING, look at how 'Shaddap You Face' has been trashed (and praised) by every type of critic on this planet over the past 25 years, read the Review Section of my website - I have put them all there to remind me (and all of us) to be humble.</li>

<p>Finally, I think this whole 'vanity' issue on Wikipedia is defective, disempowering and destructive thinking, folks, sorry. In Australia, it is known as 'pulling your head in,' and 'the tall poppy syndrome' - one is not supposed to dress loudly or stand out too much. To Think too loudly. To think outside the box. Otherwise they get the chop. God forbid, you don't get a Google Hit. So one is not supposed to blow one's own trumpet? Would someone please tell that to Muhammed Ali (I am the GREATEST!), Jesus Christ ( I am the SON OF GOD). Salvadore Dali (' Before Dali, nothing!) PT Barnum (The Greatest Show on Earth) and pretty much every pioneering inventor and artist who has ever lived. . . The REVERSE is actually true about trumpet blowing. As Louis Armstrong once quipped, 'Who else is supposed to blow it?' I believe that the best one to write about one's own work - is always oneself. <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Dolce_84a4.html" title="Joe Dolce">Joe Dolce</a>, Nov 5, 2005 Melbourne.</p>
<p>Joe,</p>
<p>You're blowing your trumpet in a library.</p>
<p>My suggestion, and I'll help with this if anyone else thinks it's a good idea, is for the page <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Dolce_84a4.html" title="Joe Dolce">Joe Dolce</a> (the page about Joe Dolce that we all own) to be trimmed down and kept, and most of the lists of achievements and the stuff on the shadapology pages and so on to be moved to <a href="../../../d/o/l/User%7EDolcej_ac5a.html" title="User:Dolcej">user:dolcej</a> (the page about Joe Dolce that (I gather) Joe Dolce owns).</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Well, as this all will be deleted soon anyway, I thought it wouldn't hurt to reveal the secret Cosmology of Shaddapogy which is now available, for a limited time only, on the Shaddapology page, for those who wish to continue your ascent on the Elevator of the Sacred Putana.
