<p>Making a page about a certain country's/people's contribution to humanity (arts/sciences/history) is one thing. That's acceptable and is precedented. However, now we're pushing the boundaries. The <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transistor.html" title="Transistor">transistor</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motion_picture.html" title="Motion picture">motion picture</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculus.html" title="Calculus">Calculus</a> are now asserted as "Scottish inventions." Sure, a Scottish innovator probably was very revolutionary in the creation of motion picture, but because of that motion picture is a <i>SCOTTISH invention</i>? Give me a break. The dozens of other countrymen to contribute wouldn't be pleased. If anything, a lot of reliable information on this page should be kept and moved to <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Scotland_a221.html" title="Culture of Scotland">Culture of Scotland</a> (and <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_England_eaa4.html" title="Culture of England">Culture of England</a>) under a Discoveries/Innovations section (much like in <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_the_United_Kingdom_4b58.html" title="Culture of the United Kingdom">Culture of the United Kingdom</a>). But purporting some pretty outrageous claims and somehow attributing an invention to a single nation.. especially when many other men contributed to its creation... is inching upon nationalistic or ethnic pride. Furthermore, we can't say that just because "discoveries" are often miscategorized as "inventions" we should list them as such (note the material on <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_inventions.html" title="English inventions">English inventions</a>). Something should also be done about the categories <a href="../../../e/n/g/Category%7EEnglish_inventions_d8a8.html" title="Category:English inventions">Category:English inventions</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Category%7EScottish_inventions_b74f.html" title="Category:Scottish inventions">Category:Scottish inventions</a>. There are English and Scottish inventors and innovators and undoubtedly a lot of these inventions will be attached to their name. Nonetheless it's a different story to call them [Enter Nationality Here] inventions. We wouldn't do it for any other categorization. The <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turing_Machine_06ff.html" title="Turing Machine">Turing Machine</a> is a <i>Gay Invention</i>?</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the proposers' arguments sound more like reasons to rename and re-focus the articles, rather than to delete them. This is a very well covered area: there are absolutely tons of websites and books listing Scottish inventors and inventions. All of the entries ought to be referenced, and I am sure they could be, but it does take a lot of time. I know less about how well English inventors/inventions are dealt with in good sources, but I would be extremely surprised if there was not a wealth of source material. Of course if a claim is false it ought to be qqualified/explained; or removed altogether; but if the false claim is well-sourced then that in itself is a notable phenomenon. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 17:06, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's not simply that the claims are wrong. It's the attribution that an invention is somehow tied to a nationality or affliation enough to call it a BLANK invention. There's no such thing as "Scottish inventions," "Mormon inventions," or "Gay inventions," and we shouldn't attribute the entire invention to just one association. Especially most of the ones listed on this page - telephone, motion picture, etc.. Furthermore, the argument supports deletion because a separate page is unprecedented and unnecessary as any claims for discovery or innovation by a nation is put in that nation's/people's Culture page or the page for the people themselves <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Germany_562d.html" title="Culture of Germany">Culture of Germany</a>/<a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_the_United_Kingdom_4b58.html" title="Culture of the United Kingdom">Culture of the United Kingdom</a>. <a href="../../../2E/2E/2E/User%7E...And_Beyond%21_c96c.html" title="User:...And Beyond!">...And Beyond!</a> 17:15, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is by no means a prerequisite for my keep vote - but how about a rename to "History of science in Scotland" or "Landmarks of technology in Scotland" or some such combination?

<dd>What's wrong with that....what I mentioned above. A category of Scottish inventors or a section in Scottish culture mentioning some innovators in Scotland is a different story from what this article is doing. We can easily say "one of the inventors of TV technology was Scottish." but this would be completely different from saying or implying "Television is a Scottish invention." Furthermore, we can't pin discoveries as the same as inventions. "Noble gases" is an invention? <a href="../../../2E/2E/2E/User%7E...And_Beyond%21_c96c.html" title="User:...And Beyond!">...And Beyond!</a> 18:12, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In addition, a great deal of the current entries are patent (if you'll pardon the pun) nonsense. A scot "invented" cornflour, which had been created and used several thousand years before the scots even had <b>corn</b> (Did they "invent" rice, too)? They "invented" popular use of a decmial separator, traced back to arabic culture and in use since 850?

I don't intend to do <b>all</b> the work of going back and checking to see which of the linked articles actually contain valid sources, copying those sources into the article, but I'll spot-check a few of them in due course. The work of providing sources of course is the responsibility of the people who want to retain items in the article.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - horribly broad, both in what counts as 'Scottish' and what counts as an 'invention'. Includes foodstuffs, 'popularising' something, the work of various engineers, discoveries, 'pioneering work', etc. It's pure jingo, in other words. There's a good article or series of articles to be written about this subject. This isn't it.--<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a> 18:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> in fact substantial additions could be made - as well as a few deletions I think I agree with Nydas above, except that I would work with this article. One further point I would like to make is there is a current trend to deny innovation on largely picky grounds - TV is a good example Baird did in fact invent an early TV system which was produced and was used, fair enough it was a development of other work - which this does reduce the significance of his achievement. However by that arguement no-one invented anything.--Eek10bears 19:51, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - the expansive criteria used to decide whether an invention is 'Scottish' (by a Scot or by non-Scots in Scotland) mean that Baird's television is also an English invention, as are Lister's antiseptics. Either have a list of Scottish inventors or a list of things invented <i>in</i> Scotland - having both in the same article is a recipe for mayhem.--<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a> 07:04, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> as trivial, unverifiable (for many inventions) and an edit war magnet. Who invented things and what nationality (or ethnicity or religion) they should be counted as is very frequently disputed. For example, sometimes multiple people claim that they each invented something. Some inventions are so old or their history is so poorly documented, that it is unclear who invented it, yet some people claim that their ancestor or countryman invented it anyway. Also, many things are invented (especially many of the important modern inventions) as a result of multiple people's work, who may be from different countries, have different ethnicities or religions. Finally, it is unclear what nationality, ethnicity or religion someone should be counted as. For example, a person with a German mother and an Italian father may have been born in France, grew up in England and created his invention in the U.S., which he moved to at 18 years old and stayed the rest of his 90-year life. Which country or countries should he be counted under? As each group (Ukranians, Muslims from India, Chinese Americans, German-Irish, Latter Day Saints) gets its own list, the problem grows exponentially. Creating, maintaining, edit warring, dispute resolution, blockings and bannings resulting from the articles takes time and manpower away from far more important articles. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 19:28, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
