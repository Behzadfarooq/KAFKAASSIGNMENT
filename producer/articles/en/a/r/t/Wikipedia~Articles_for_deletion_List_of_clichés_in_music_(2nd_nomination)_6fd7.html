<li>As an exercise in testing the preceding claims that this is original research and impossible to construct in a verifiable manner, I've attacked the list of clichés in music#Lyrics section with the merciless sword of verifiability, and discovered that it <i>is</i> possible to construct a list of verifiable lyrical clichés. All of the items now in the list have citations to people identifying the clichés in question. The cited sources are not simply song reviewers saying "song X contains cliché Y", as <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> suggests above, but are people specifically identifying a lyrical cliché in its own right, independent of any specific songs.
<p>Given that it is evidently possible to construct that section in a verifiable manner, without performing any primary research (e.g. reading and analysing song lyrics directly), it seems likely that it is possible to do the same for the other sections. (If it isn't, then we can simply erase them.) The problems with this article don't require an administrator to hit a delete button. They require ordinary editors to exercise the same merciless sword of verifiability across the rest of the article that I've exercised over one section, and to insist upon sources for any future additions, to stop editors from adding their own personal notions of clichés to the article. Administrators aren't required for that. Even editors without accounts can do that. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:50, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Uncle G, although I despise listcruft there does appear to be at least some verifiable basis for this list. Needless to say it should be edited mercilessly to remove the uncited parts. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 15:54, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b>, (swayed from a swift and firm <i>kill with fire</i> by UncleG), although the article is conceivably fully sourcable, the subject is simply too huge to make a meaningful list. Each genre and period of music has its own cliches. What would be a cliche in a madrigal might be seen as an innovation in a rap song. Ok, I admit that I added the 16th century thing a while ago, because I ran into it in a source. I think a more specific list might make sense and be encyclopedic, but the scope of this list is simply too huge. It applies to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_chant.html" title="Gregorian chant">Gregorian chant</a>, rap, 14th century madrigals, 16th century madrigals, 13th century Chinese folk music, gamelan music, trance music, minimalist music, etc. Just check out <a href="../../../m/u/s/Category%7EMusic_genres_bfbc.html" title="Category:Music genres">Category:Music genres</a>, which is far from complete. I just think this list's purported scope is far too broad to be at all meaningful, apart from it's current issues with "truth" and actually being verified. This page has already been through AfD, I already wrote on the talk page that another AfD was sure to follow. Almost no editors followed that with actually fixing the article. I think this has been given it's chance, and should now be deleted. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 23:26, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, unless it can be completely stripped of original research and unsourced claims. What genres are being referred to could also do with more clarification - an article titled "List of clichés in music" is an incredibly large scope, but clearly things like "baby" refer specifically to modern pop music. Also there is a POV issue - cliche does not just mean it is common, but implies overused. So what, long songs shouldn't be last anymore? Many things listed here are characteristics of various genres, which should be mentioned on the relevant article, but are not cliches. And I do love being told how "Long songs with few lyrics" often contain few lyrics and long instrumentals, wow, thanks for that. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 01:44, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Very legitimate topic. I have a BS in Songwriting. Pop music is full of cliches, from artist behavior to marketing concepts to rhymes in lyrics. The exposure of cliches serves as a driver for originality, but also shows the value in using cliches. The article just needs to be reworked, elaborated and substantiated.JerryFlattum 02:10, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have a BM in Music Performance. Music is full of cliches, but music is also part of the history of every human culture which has ever existed.
