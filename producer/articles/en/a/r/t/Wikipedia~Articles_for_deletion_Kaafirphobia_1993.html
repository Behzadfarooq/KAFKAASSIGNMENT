<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. There are a load of votes from anonymous users and entirely new users, some whose first edit is to this very VFD debate. Although such votes are not automatically discounted, I suspect that this is an attack of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppetry</a>, thererfore in this case these votes have been discounted without mercy.

<dd>Also, I'd like to point out that this article was made in opposition to Islamophobia, which is also a neologism. There is a huge difference between the two, however. Islamophobia has been defined by a number of respected authors (both pro and anti-Muslim) such as Said, Safi, Esposito, Ye'or, Robert Spencer, and Ibn Warraq.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> [Author:TCross, 09:19, 5 August 2005 (UTC)] This word is obviously NewSpeak (George Orwell, "1984"). The purpose of Newspeak according to Orwell: Compress a thought down to a few syllables so that the mind glosses over and accepts the embedded concept without careful consideration. In this case, the inventor of the word is attempting to implant the idea in the public mind that some Muslims hate non-Muslims, and that hatred is a kind of hatred similar to Islamophobia. Certainly the author of the article may state that idea anywhere and everywhere he likes as often and as loud as he wishes. But the Western world has known about Muslims for a thousand years, and we should ask two questions 1) How have we got along until today without a word like this? 2) Now that we are making war on the Muslims, why do we suddenly discover a need for this word? Here is my answer to these questions: In this entry is the authors define the word as a form of racism that is not between races.</li>
<li><b>Keep (Vote made by Anon ip)</b>. It seems to me that this is a useful word to define the concept of hatred which is clearly visible in the behaviours of extremists within the islamic faith. The existence of this page here does not imply that all Muslims hate non-muslims, but the existence of this word is useful when needing to refer to those who do hate non-muslims and it is good to be clear that this is about a sub-section of the faith, not all members of the faith. Muslim organisations in the UK condemn the actions of those who we could now say are "suffering from Kaafirphobia". Does the definition state that all muslims hate non-muslims? I do not think so. If we are clear about the definition I see no reason for deletion. 86.133.173.24 06:44, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Might I be right in coining a neologism for "hatred of non-Christians by Christians"? Because if this article is kept, that is EXACTLY what I'll do. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_5794.html" title="User:Revolución">Revolución</a> 17:18, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Revolución, yes please go ahead and create your own neologism for "hatred of non-Christians by Christians" because we already have neologisms like <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianophobia.html" title="Christianophobia">Christianophobia</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a>, and Kaafirphobia in Wikipedia. You have my support. Here in Malaysia, Kaafirphobia is a word commonly used in colloquial speech as all non-Muslims, irrespective of religion are commonly lumped together as one category, <a href="../../../k/a/a/Kaafir.html" title="Kaafir">Kaafirs</a> by Muslims. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam%40mysite.com.my_9863.html" title="User:Sam@mysite.com.my">Sam@mysite.com.my</a> 08:23, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep (Vote made by anon IP)</b>. (Its a useful word that is the reverse of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> and is used in regular speech here in Malaysia, where there are two categories of people, first is the Muslims, and second is the non-Muslims who are treated as inferiors, irrespective of their religion) 219.95.180.120 18:45, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep (User has less than 50 edits)</b>. I support its inclusion in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> as this word has prior use, which can be proven through a search at <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> and also on various other blogs, such as <a href="http://www.minishorts.net/?p=373#comments" class="external text" title="http://www.minishorts.net/?p=373#comments" rel="nofollow">Minishorts</a> . Also, it accurately describes hatred of non-Muslims by radical Islamists who are usually condemned by moderate Muslims. Rajanr imposter 07:13, 8 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please, various blogs? you stated just one and even that, the word kaafirphobia came up in the comment section.<a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarth_4e50.html" title="User:Earth">__earth</a> 12:50, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I cannot speak for Rajanr [since renamed "Rajanr imposter"] but are not entries in Wikipedia based on common use? Even the terms such as <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianophobia.html" title="Christianophobia">Christianophobia</a> were developed by common use. So, I do not see anything wrong with the poster who said the word kaafirphobia came up in the comment section of a blog for this is how a word gets created. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam%40mysite.com.my_9863.html" title="User:Sam@mysite.com.my">Sam@mysite.com.my</a> 02:53, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../k/a/f/Kafir.html" title="Kafir">Kafir</a> and make a subsection of Kaafirphobia there. The term has no widespread use and a google search gives merely 3 results - 2 from a blog and 1 from wikipedia itself <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarth_4e50.html" title="User:Earth">__earth</a> 12:47, August 8, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let me add that your claim that a google search gives only 3 results is inaccurate for you searched Google Web only and not Google Groups, which gives an additional 1 result. And if we take this third web site, minishorts.net it also has the word kaafirphobia in it except it is not displayed in Google Web or Google Groups. So, I believe this article should be retained as there are 4 known usages but there are surely other usages on local Malaysian e-communities not connected to the Internet. This term was invented by a Malaysian sociologist, Dr Colin Chee. What is your opinion, Earth? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam%40mysite.com.my_9863.html" title="User:Sam@mysite.com.my">Sam@mysite.com.my</a> 16:12, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (I vote to keep this neologism as a search on Google, both Groups and Web render 4 results, and a search on minishorts.net render 3 results. I am sure there are other web sites that use this term, which was originated from Malaysian sociologist, Dr Colin Chee. There is justification for this neologism as Wikipedia has allowed <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianophobia.html" title="Christianophobia">Christianophobia</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a>. Christianophobia itself is not used frequently at all yet it is in the Wikipedia data base. So, Kaafirphobia has the right to be in the data base too as it is mainly intended to be used by sociologists for hatred against non-Muslims by radical Islamist groups like Al-Qaeda that justifies Kaafir inferiority and Muslim supremacy, which is a form of racism.) <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanianCheong_4486.html" title="User:DanianCheong">DanianCheong</a> 17:18, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> as per earth's suggestion. Not notable enough to merit its own article, but is a term in use in limited circles, and so deserves a mention in <a href="../../../k/a/a/Kaafir.html" title="Kaafir">kaafir</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 09:50, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - A search on various web sites gives 12 results, i.e. Google(5), minishorts.net(3) and rajanr.com(4) so it is quite notable to merit its own article. I understand the purpose of Wikipedia is for already used terms and not original research. Since Kaafirphobia has been used already, it merits mention in <a href="../../../k/a/a/Kaafir.html" title="Kaafir">kaafir</a> as well as having its own article kaafirphobia. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam%40mysite.com.my_9863.html" title="User:Sam@mysite.com.my">Sam@mysite.com.my</a> 04:16, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
