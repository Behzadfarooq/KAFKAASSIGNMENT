<p>'<i><b>Save'</b></i> The article shows what the senior team at NLL fail to look at... the students view! As well as informing individuals about what is happening in a school that was very good in Mr Woods time, the previous head. Fair enough discipline may have gone down during that time but from what I see its become worse and all Gerry seems interested in doing is window dressing - just trying to make it look good.... was this one of the reasons for giving all year 7's a tablet laptop? Come to this school we will give you a tablet! Not only has Gerry done all that is outlined in the article but he has also reduced the library to practically nothing, something that used to be a good source of information for students now stands as a couple of book shelves, tucked away in a room becuase where it used to be are now computers. Anyone in their right mind knows not all information on the Internet can be trusted and books are a valuable source of information and at least through using books students have to find the information instead of just going to the first website they find and clicking print! - NLL Mafia <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.25.194.69 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.25.194.69_eb7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.25.194.69">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<p>As an ex-employee of the Cornwallis School. I took voluntary redundancy recently. I know there is a lot wrong with the Management style of NNL. I am in now way surprised that pupils are getting so disgruntled with their education that they are resorting to this form of expression. I think the media needs to investigate the problems and listen NOT just to the Management's views&#160;! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.92.96.229 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.92.96.229_5a04.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.92.96.229">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>As a student at that so-called school, i believe that the article is 100 percent fact. And this view is held by most of the older students in the school. I wish I'd written it first. Problem is, noone takes notice of students, just the staff, and they're paid to agree with Gerry. This article should be kept because it is the only way that anyone will ever listen to our opinions. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.174.241.66 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.174.241.66_b4e6.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.174.241.66">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - As is, fails NPOV, NN, and is an attack page. If the authors really feel that this matter is suitable for an encyclopedia, they should write an article citing more than one newspaper article about the matter.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> As a parent I totally agree with what the article states. Perhaps this isn't the right place for the students to publisise their views but as Dr Gerry's answer to parents who express concern over what he is doing is 'if you don't like it remove your child', what hope have students got of being heard, execpt through mediums like this. After all it is creating a lot of interest not least by the person concerned! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.25.193.119 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.25.193.119_0f34.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.25.193.119">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> This may seem very repetitive as again I am another ex-student, during the my years at the school which was from infact yr7 - 13 only having just left, i feel this article is complete truth, throughout yr 7 - 11 under Mr Wood the school was the one to join the one that everyone wanted to go to, I even remember when tryin to join the school people gettin turned away! Now through the years i have noticed discipline waivering a bit but i put that down to certain students joining the school whom would be better off doing some sort of Tarmacing or Roofing job! The school came under Gerry's control when i joined yr 12 and has been goin downhill since then like many have said before he is tryin to make it look good while inside it is collapsing! From previous experience it is not only the students who moan and groan about it the school the staff are taking it hard too, although not publically displaying this, it is not hard to tell! I feel that the school is spending too much on posters, signs, logos and brand new tablets and forgettin about the realy things, like classrooms and chairs! Now this is not a dig at any teachers as they try their very best day in day out and they do a good job, some of them have been there all my school life, they dnt need some new bloke coming and ruining it! (What is he a doctor of anyway?) Like trying to bring in the idea of calling teachers by their first names?!? yeh great dicipline there sir! - I have also noticed in previious comments people saying this should not be included it is only an attack, well i apologise but it does need ot be said and it seems that this is the only way or gettin this out! The students who made this article are gettin punished for it by Dr Gerry, is that fair? Everyone has a right to an opinion and plus what is he so worried bout a few students making a little article about the school? hmm he has something to hide!!! My suggestion is dnt send your child here, there are plenty of good schools in maidstone, that are gettin better and your child will gain much from, and yes the media need to get behind this and show the school for what its really for! I dnt say just bring back the Stag i say bring back Mr Wood but i dnt think that will be possible!
