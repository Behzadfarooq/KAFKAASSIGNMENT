<p>Although the article is clearly not crystalballing, it is well sourced and does not claim to state what will happen during the eighth gen, i believe that there has not been enough improvement since the last time it was deleted, which can be found <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_History_of_video_game_consoles_%28eighth_generation%29_2_cdf4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/History of video game consoles (eighth generation) 2">here</a>. <a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 19:29, 26 March 2007 (UTC)PLEASE DO NOT ACCUSE THIS ARTICLE OF CONTAINING PURE SPECULATION WITHOUT GIVING AT LEAST ONE EXAMPLE. As the person who wrote the article i would like to make the request that should the page be deleted it is protected from recreation so that no one else will take me work and create the article again.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> For all my reasons on the previous nomination. Also, every delete point on the 2nd nomination is still valid - the article hasn't changed at all. The name is still inappropriate (History is something which has passed, whereas we wont see this generation until some several years). Far too many things can change in what we currently have many years until we can at least expect concrete information as to whether these consoles are going to be developed, and who by. Maybe in a year or so time, we can review what information there is, and if decided there is enough solid concrete information, then under a name other than referring to it as it's history. Given this is the 3rd nomination, I would advise protection of the page until at least a year or until we have a suitable quantity of verifyable information that will mean it can't be classified as pure speculative. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 19:48, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> i said we should keep the last one and so it would be wrong of me to change my mind simply because i wasn't the one who created the article. The information in this is well sourced and it isn't crystal balling as it makes no claims as to what will happen. the article only says what the current plans are for the eighth generation, not what will happen. it is a fact that Shigeru Miyamoto mentioned at E3 2006 that the successor to the Wii would include high-definition capabilities and almost every other piece of information in this article is like it. it only says what the companies or representatives of the companies have said they are doing with the eighth gen. the article is not claiming that the wii 2 will be HD capable, the article is saying that Miyamoto said that it will. This is obviously an important enough artical to be included, it is not crystal balling and it isn't too early by wikipedia standards all of these; <a href="../../../2/0/1/2018_Winter_Olympics_bd0d.html" title="2018 Winter Olympics">2018 Winter Olympics</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/2/2024_Summer_Olympics_68c5.html" title="2024 Summer Olympics">2024 Summer Olympics</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/6/2066.html" title="2066">2066</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalypse.html" title="Apocalypse">Apocalypse</a>, <a href="../../../y/e/a/Year_10%2C000_problem.html" title="Year 10,000 problem">Year 10,000 problem</a>, <a href="../../../y/e/a/Year_2038_problem.html" title="Year 2038 problem">Year 2038 problem</a>, will happen close to the end of the eighth generation are a long time after it is over. <a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 20:40, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>speculation? where? i don't see any. could you please be more specific as to what your referring to?<a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 20:51, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>
<ul>
<li>There is also speculation that Apple may re-enter the console market with a successor to the Apple Pippin, however they have not yet made any statement concerning these speculations.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>That entire sentence in itself ADMITS that speculation is very much present</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The successor to Nintendo's Wii is commonly called "Wii 2" and "Super Wii."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Sounds as if we are simply speculating what the name will be - pure guesswork</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The successor to Microsoft's Xbox 360 is commonly called "Xbox 3" or "Xbox 720."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Same as above - sounds as if we are simply speculating what the name will be - pure guesswork again</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Nevertheless, no information or theories have yet surfaced concerning what Sony will do with the PS4</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, any information posted is either speculation by gamers or SONY themselves speculating what they will do with the console? It is too early for anyone (including console developers) to even consider publishing official concrete information.</dd>

<dd>I'm not the one speculating on the pippin 2, i have sources who are doing that and there is evidence to support the claim. in concern to the names i give, your just looking for excuses to accuse the article of containing "pure speculation" anyone who was unbiased would admit that the article is saying they are commonly referred to by those names and that i'm not claiming any of them will actually have one of those names. However, i will stick something in so that people like you won't get confused. as for the PS4, the fact that it will exist has nothing to do with what it will be able to do. There is no information in the PS4 section about the PS4's abilities, the section is only about when it will be released using what Sony execs have said. none of your examples hold any water. <a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 18:08, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I haven't once claimed it is pure speculation; I merely pointed out some things which are to an extent speculating what will/will not happen. With this kind of article, no matter how many "sources" or "references" you have, chances are they wont be correct when the time comes. Just because a website thinks something, you are saying that is good enough to include it to backup points in an encyclopedia? If this was being professionally written, do you really think an article like this would base heavily and reliantly upon sources which likely wont even be correct when the time draws closer? Sources mean practically "nothing" with this article. As I said in the previous nomination, not even console makers know what will happen, so how can anyone/anywhere else?</dd>
<dd>Also, why are you voting to keep, yet YOU were the nominator this 3rd time around? It seems you obviously think it doesn't deserve wikipedia space as well, does it not? You either think it should be here, or you think it shouldn't; clearly, you don't seem to know which side of your bread your butter is on. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 18:34, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But don't you see, the article isn't trying to say what will happen if five years. The article is about what the companies have said will happen and what other people think will happen. Its not about what the eighth gen will be, its about what the current, present tense, plans are for the generation and what is happening right now that concerns the eighth generation. if i filled the article with speculation as to what the systems of the eighth gen would be like than it would be crystal balling and even i wouldn't want the article to remain. I would like to apologize if you were offended by anything i said. I was tired but i'm a little better now. the reason i nominated the article wasn't because i thought it should be deleted but because i thought it needed to be put before my fellow wikipedians. It had already been deleted twice before and i didn't think that any one person had the right to recreate it with the consent of those who had it deleted before. <a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 16:51, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Regardless of what the companies are saying now, not even themselves can guarantee it will be correct. Sure, they release info of their own plans, which can quite easily change as time goes by, and hence any information entered into Wikipedia could then need to be changed closer towards the time (which I guess will still be a few years yet). Information which isn't correct now will be no use to anyone when we're at this generation, and no use to anyone reading who wants to find out about it (as there is no real concrete information available, by anyone). I also stated in the previous nomination in December about the name (History of..); again, confusing readers who aren't very well knowledged in this field. The fact is, an encyclopedia is meant to inform and provide meaningful information to it's readers, particularly wikipedia, which wont be the case with this article until at least another few years. Given it's prior 2 deletions and current support for deletion pretty much supports any claim that it is very much too early. It was too early 3 months ago, and that still stands today. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 17:21, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm starting to get impatient with you. THE ARTICLE ISN'T ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THE EIGHTH GENERATION!!!!! it is about what is happening with the eighth generation. happening, as in right now. the article should be named "History of" because thats what it is, it is the history of what has been suggested or announced or speculated about the eighth generation. the fact that we don't "know" what will happen is irrelevant because thats not what the article is about, it is about what has happened and what is happening in concern to the eighth gen. <a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 19:05, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Calm down! I was simply saying I don't think it is suitable for Wikipedia.. "yet". This is a debate, not an arguement, and I am merely debating my opinions (alas I am also not the only one to share these opionions). I understand what you're saying with regards to my comments on the History naming, but for something that hasn't even begun yet, it really can only be regarded as its history when it does. Wikipedia has a very specific purpose, and the content it provides need to ensure that is complies with this purpose. This information may be very useful on your average fan site, but you're forgetting we're talking about an encyclopedia. Information in an encyclopedia isn't published knowing that it could easily change many several amount of times before it is even likely a solid piece of information will standup. Yes, there are many articles related to documenting "current events", but this is not even yet close to becoming classified as such. I understand your fustration to an extent, and my apologies if I have been a factor of that, but try and keep it peaceful! <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 19:43, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>did you know that many WWII books actually start with WWI and sometimes before? The authors of the books want there readers to not only understand what happened during the war but why it started, what lead up to what was Europe like right before it began. the story of your life doesn't start with your birth, it starts when your conceived, if not before. the same holds true with the eighth generation. i would say that its history actually started about six months ago if not a year ago since that is probably when people who will be working on these systems started to think about them.</dd>
<dd>i'm not forgetting that we are talking about an encyclopedia. but i think your forgetting about one of the things that makes wikipedia so special, that it can be changed. if someday something in the article ceases to be note worthy it can be removed.</dd>
<dd>and i'm not frustrated, i'm a little annoyed that i can't seem to make any headway with you, but i'm not frustrated. i was the one who instigated this, remember?&#160;:)<a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 02:41, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strongest Keep</b> The article is well sourced and there is no doubt that there will be an eight generation. So long as sourced articles keep referring to the next generation, the article is valid. The same applies to to the Olympic and Superbowl articles, even if these events were canceled there would still be an article on why the events were canceled. Remember notability isn't subjective, if articles in the popular press are speculating, it is now sourced information. The same goes for the next presidential election. Crystalballing by Wikipedia editors is not acceptable, but the same by Business Week and other publications is. If I guess who the next Superbowl halftime act will be it is crystalballing, but if Rolling Stone does it, its sourced and acceptable. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 05:55, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> There's nothing about any of these consoles mentioned anywhere. Speculation doesn't belong on Wikipedia. This article is being called "History" but the 7th Generation of gaming has just started. Consider <b>salting</b> until 2010 or so.

<li><b>Keep</b> Normaly i am opposed to articles like this, but this one seems to be well sourced, with only a few speculative claims (which i plan on removing in a minute).

<li><b>Comment</b> i just thought you all might find this interesting. When the article for the seventh gen was created all it contained was, "the 256-bit era is said to be including the playstation 3, xbox 2 and the next nintendo system dubbed nintendo 5 by gamers." if that got to remain why shouldn't mine?<a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 17:09, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Firstly, it isn't "your" article; any article in Wikipedia is under the <a href="../../../g/p/l/GPL_a75a.html" title="GPL">GPL</a> and isn't owned by any particular individual. Secondly, with regards to the 7th generation article, I don't think Wikipedia was a big then as it is now, and I doubt many people were around like now to hold debates like this on a topic of this nature. I think comparing to articles made quite some time ago and questioning the way Wikipedia operated then isn't the best method of supporting what is happening now. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 17:27, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - This article needs some <i>serious</i> cleanup if it is to remain. While I'm not automatically opposed to an article on such a topic this early, the factual information is not attributable to the sources well enough (despite the fact that the sources are plentifully cited); original research suffuses the entire article, padding and stitching these largely disparate and isolated factoids together.</li>
<li>For instance: the article itself states, "At this time no official word has been released concerning these speculations and even if Apple does create a Pippin 2 it may not be for the Eighth Generation." This seems to be unattributable speculation, couched in weasel words. Has there been any directly attributable statement that this Apple console will continue in the Pippin line? (I would think that Apple would try and distance itself from the Pippin brand, and any negative associations with the original Pippin.) Has there been any directly attributable statement that it could be part of the same new generation as the presumed 720, PS4, and Wii successor? If not, it doesn't belong at all, and its mere mention in the "eighth generation" article is in itself original research, implying something that is not explicitly supported by the sources.</li>
<li>While statements have been made about potential new consoles, almost nothing notable has been referenced about an "eighth generation" directly (which relates somewhat my disagreement with the naming conventions for the game console history articles in general, which isn't appropriate for discussion here), nor about how or if these new consoles relate to one another in <i>any</i> generation. A Wikipedia article need to be an <i>encyclopedic</i> resource, and not merely a collection of forward-looking statements on <i>individual devices</i> accompanied with original inferences of a supposed next round in the great "console wars". This is why this situation should be considered distinct from that of articles on upcoming Olympic and Superbowl events. I am leaning toward a recommendation to delete, but am open to be convinced otherwise. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 21:19, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>i won't say there is no OR, but i doubt there are any articles with none and i would like to mention that i didn't think the article was ready so i didn't create the page, someone copied it from my user page without my permission. since it was just an article on my userpage i wasn't being too careful to avoid original research. also, i've never considered statements of omission to be OR. i guess i can see how admitting that there is no proof the pippin 2 will be an eighth gen console is OR, but i think your pushing it a little. i don't see what you mean by "weasel words" but feel free to rewrite it if you think you can do better. in reference to my calling the console the "pippin 2," when there is no way to tell what a consoles successor will be called the simplest thing to do is stick a 2 on the predecessor's name. when the article for the wii was first created it was called the gamecube2. same idea, the article isn't say it will be called the pippin 2, its just something to refer to it as until Apple gives us something better to call it. i stuck it in with the eighth gen because there is nowhere better to put it. if you don't think it belongs in the article we can transfer it to the talk page and debate it there. if you think there is anything good in this article than please vote to keep it and them simply improve it. isn't that why your on wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 03:03, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> as crystallballing. Clearly one can't have a "history" of something that hasn't happened yet; nor can one create an article based solely on speculation of future products not even announced. A discussion of "eighth generation" consoles will <i>someday</i> be encyclopaedic -- when reliable sources about actual products are available. Right now, all the linked articles are based on guesses, rumours and a smidge of <a href="../../../f/e/a/Fear%2C_uncertainty_and_doubt.html" title="Fear, uncertainty and doubt">FUD</a>.--<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 09:07, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
