<li><b>Keep</b>. Why not have such a list. It's amusing. And the link-citations, when you click them, lead to interesting stories. This list originated as part of the <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pieing.html" title="Pieing">Pieing</a> article and was put here. It works in tandem with that article. I don't believe Roofus articulated why removing this list is recommended. He said "there's no reason at all." Can he elaborate? <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGriot_3b50.html" title="User:Griot">Griot</a> 05:29, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Incredibly trivial, but extremely well cited and maintained, far more so than most lists that teeter on the listcruft edge. I'd say this is a good example of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">Ignore all rules</a>. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 16:50, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I see that that is not going to happen now, as my last two attempts at voting delete have been interrupted by keep votes. However I will still lay out my arguement that it is not encyclopedic. It could be the best article in the world, and I'd want it deleted. And speaking of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">Ignore all Rules</a>, I'm struggling for not only a person to back me up, but a policy as well! I do not understand how a list on 'people who have been pied' is ever going to be useful, to be perfectly honest. I also do not see why it should be on Wikipedia. Remember, humourous as it may be, Wikipedia is not made for humour. However, I concede that this article is well done, so I wouldn't worry too much if it were to stay. <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECream147_36cd.html" title="User:Cream147">Cream147</a> <sub><a href="../../../c/r/e/User_talk%7ECream147_daf9.html" title="User talk:Cream147">Shout at me for doing wrong</a></sub> 16:56, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm also not emotionally attached either way, and I can certainly see your point, but it seems to me that while there's no overwhelming argument to keep this article, there's also (oddly enough) no real guideline for deleting it. It's not a neoligism, it's not original research, it's not unverified and because someone seems to have done a great deal of work, it doesn't even fall into those vague concepts behind the term "listcruft" (e.g. unmanageable, POV, etc). The closest valid guideline to delete that I can think of is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> but even then I can see at least a vague argument that as a split off of <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pieing.html" title="Pieing">pieing</a> it's not necessarily "indiscriminate".</dd>

<dd>As I say, I'm not emotionally attached to it and wouldn't cry if a deletion vote were to happen, but my opinion is -- lacking any strong valid argument to delete, it should be kept (with perhaps a passive and kindly-meant prod to this article's editors to focus their admirable editing energies to some other articles that need work). -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 17:17, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> but delete any uncited examples (like the dubious one for the White House plumber (???). I agree that this should also be reformatted into the chart that was started. "Pieing" or whatever the term is, has become a notable form of protest expression with enough media coverage to warrant a list of examples. The intro could be expanded a bit to set criteria so the list is restricted to politicians or notable personalities who have been pied in public, otherwise we could start seeing names added of actors who have received pies in the face in the movies. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 17:55, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as trivial. The above arguments that it is <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">WP:USEFUL</a> and <a href="../../../i/t/s/WP%7EITSFUNNY_be87.html" title="WP:ITSFUNNY">WP:ITSFUNNY</a> do not establish that the list is in any way encyclopedic. A <i>heavily</i> modified and pared-down list of only the more significant 'victims' could be <b>merged</b> back in to the parent article but this list itself should not remain and is nothing more than a trivia repository. The above keep votes have even conceded the fact that the article is trivial in nature. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 18:21, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> though obviously restrict to new-making incidents, and the list itself needs some cleanup to make it consistent. Still, the fact is, being pied has made news in several cases, so the subject itself is not a problem. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:38, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Pieing has been a reasonably high-profile form of political protest, and the victims are generally quite notable. Apologies to Newyorkbrad, and personally I think pieing is inappropriately violent not to mention juvenile, but the list is reasonable for wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 00:31, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Claiming it is <a href="../../../u/n/e/WP%7EUNENCYCLOPEDIC_2682.html" title="WP:UNENCYCLOPEDIC">WP:UNENCYCLOPEDIC</a> is not a strong argument. -<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpuriousQ_693d.html" title="User:SpuriousQ">SpuriousQ</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESpuriousQ_b285.html" title="User talk:SpuriousQ">talk</a>) 00:54, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This article is an extension of <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pieing.html" title="Pieing">pieing</a>. Also, pieing (and incidents of pieing) apparently seems to receive quite a bit of coverage. I am unconvinced by arguments to delete, which so far have been WP:NOTUSEFUL (including the nom's reasoning), "no need reason to publicize and thereby encourage this type of assault" (I doubt people do things <i>just</i> so they can end up being mentioned on WP; it's much easier to just create a hoax article), and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>. The last one is rooted in a guideline, but even a cursory examination of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> shows this list does not qualify any of the 8 categories of articles that are listed there as inappropriate. On a different note, it may be appropriate to merge the info to <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pieing.html" title="Pieing">Pieing</a> (not too long an article) so that the content is better organized. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:55, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as a subarticle of <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pieing.html" title="Pieing">pieing</a>, which makes for notable news events.
