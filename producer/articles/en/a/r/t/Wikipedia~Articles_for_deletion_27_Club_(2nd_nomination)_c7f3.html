<li><b>KEEP</b> very intriguing and good idea, funny list, well done - actually it is rather a candidate for "featured articles". Kurt.</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> it - as a fan of music I've always been strangely intrigued by the fact that so many of my favorite musicians died at 27. The fact that many other groups of people share this intrigue is reason enough to keep it. Obviously, not everyone will care, or find this article interesting, but that is not a reason to delete it.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as it is a popular concept. page bottom lists it as a "curse" and for the MTV generations it has just as much historical significance as <a href="../../../t/e/c/Tecumseh%27s_Curse_4433.html" title="Tecumseh's Curse">Tecumseh's Curse</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_Curse_1b45.html" title="Kennedy Curse">Kennedy Curse</a>, Rebel Without a Cause Curse and the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_Curse_4ce0.html" title="Superman Curse">Superman Curse</a>. If 27 Club is deleted, then the aforementioned should be deleted as well.</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> -- 27 Club is a well-known phenomenon in American pop culture. The fact that the 'Big 4' 27 club members weren't just famous ... they were huuuuge; at the peak of their success. And now each is a rock icon. Heck, Wikipedia has an article about the myth of eating <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_Rocks_e956.html" title="Pop Rocks">Pop Rocks</a> while drinking soda pop as well as articles on <a href="../../../c/o/p/Coprophilia.html" title="Coprophilia">Coprophilia</a> (sexual arousal through feces) and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal_bleaching.html" title="Anal bleaching">Anal bleaching</a>. <i>KEEP THE 27 CLUB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</i></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as it's a pointless list of musicians who died at age 27.

<li>Actually I think a list of musicians who died young (whatever that is) would be quite interesting. We have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_deaths_through_alcohol.html" title="List of deaths through alcohol">List of deaths through alcohol</a>, why not List of musicians who died young?

<li><b>Keep</b> As noted above, it's a popular concept. I had heard it discussed several times before stumbling upon the wikipedia page. —thames 03:55, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's a rather fascinating phenomenon, in my opinion, I've always been aware of the strange fact that these artists all died at 27 before wikipedia came along. It's nice to have an entry for it for those who aren't already aware.</li>
<li><b>Keep or Merge</b> It's not pointless. I believe one of Wiki's goals is to become the most comprehensive encyclopedia around. Thus, we should all want it to contain as much information as possible, no matter how insignificant it might be to <i>some</i>. A small amount of google hits shouldn't be reason for deletion. Wikipedia would be that much more popular having something that isn't found on a major search engine. Most importantly, it does have a following within the music community, and anyone looking for it won't go to <a href="../../../2/7/_/27_%28number%29.html" title="27 (number)">27 (number)</a> as their first thought. So, per Herostratus' comment, at the very least give it it's own section on <a href="../../../2/7/_/27_%28number%29.html" title="27 (number)">27 (number)</a> with a redirect. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilhelm_Screamer_17e0.html" title="User:Wilhelm Screamer">Wilhelm Screamer</a> 15:37, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A merge into 27 (number), seems a bit odd as this article isn't really about the number 27. it is after all not math but music and most music fans wouldn't look at 27. The information in the article is certainly interesting trivia, the above mentioned articles do indicate a certain degree of use. Perhaps the term itself is somewhat obscure, so I propose recreating this article at Musicians who died at age 27 with redirects from 27 Club, Forever 27, etc. Then mention those as names for the "phenomenon" in the new article. So, I guess that constitutes a <b>keep</b> and <b>rename</b> vote. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool3_2ec0.html" title="User:Cool3">Cool3</a> 00:56, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It is a concept of the fact that 3 (Kurt Cobain not included) of the most popular musical icons died in a timeframe so close together and at the same age.

<li><b>Comment on Comment</b> -- Wikipedia may not be a "majority rule" or "democracy." But Wikipedia is most definitely a microcosm of pure socialism much like an Amish community (not to be confused with Communism, Fascism or totalitarianism). People contribute their thoughts and ideas for public consumption, but just because someone may not care for the ideas of another that does not warrant the article as meaningless. For example, right now you probably have about 55% of the people that 'don't care for' George W. Bush, but does that mean his article on Wikipedia should be deleted? Should articles about God and Jesus be deleted because someone is an atheist, or Muslim, or Hindu? Wikipedia is a marketplace of ideas, but this article deletion policy is just a mere step away from censorship and book burning. Every article with a purpose -- no matter how ridiculous (<a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape_Escape_3_7379.html" title="Ape Escape 3">Ape Escape 3</a> anyone?) -- deserves to be part of that free market exchange. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 206.208.110.32 (<a href="../../../2/0/6/User_talk%7E206.208.110.32.html" title="User talk:206.208.110.32">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_206.208.110.32_e778.html" title="Special:Contributions/206.208.110.32">contribs</a>) 13:31, 23 March 2006 (UTC).</small>
