<li>do not delete. I think that Ms. Port should remain in wikipedia, when I first heard virgin radio, I wanted to look up some information on the radio personalities that was not produced by the station itself. I think her role as radio sidekick warrants an individual entry.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> annabel port is a celebrity for many people in London and has been for some time now she is a great radio presenter and should at least be acknowledged for this somewhere, this profile is not doing harm, it is not offensive, it is just a biography of a radio presenter.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - I agree with most comments made here, the point is not that she is not a notable person, as it was stated before if Big Brother contestants are notable for living in a TV house for a few weeks, Annabel Port whom many people listen to and love on a daily basis and have for many years now, certainly deserves an entry. But I do agree the article can do with a facelift and tidy up. I get the feeling that The people who appreciate her somewhat original style have tried to create an entry that reflects that style and is unfortunately not adapted to what WP articles usually look like. She deserves a proper entry, so please WP people keep the entry and please fans don't mess up the page of someone you like, see what it leads to&#160;!</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> As an individual, she is not notable, and there do not appear to be any sources to verify any of the claims made. This article is the first Google hit for her, which is usually a bad sign. The second is the WP article on the show she cohosts. There's a few mentions here and there, but none of it really adheres. There's plenty of radio cohosts who don't rate articles, and she's just another one. Also, as there's clearly some humor intended in the article (which doesn't belong there), my final statement would be "I don't care if her boyfriend checks this page six times a day with Roxette on repeat, she's still not notable!" <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 00:34, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>REASONS THAT DELETION OF <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annabel_Port_5a34.html" title="Annabel Port">Annabel Port</a> IS INAPPROPRIATE</p>
<p>1. Notability: Annabel Port broadcasts to a nightly audience of over a million people in the UK (source: <a href="../../../r/a/j/RAJAR_0aae.html" title="RAJAR">RAJAR</a> the UK's radio audience research organisation) as well as many more online, with <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Radio_d24e.html" title="Virgin Radio">Virgin Radio</a> being the world's most listened-to radio station (source: <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbitron.html" title="Arbitron">Arbitron</a>). That's an audience bigger than most non-syndicated US personalities, and even some syndicated ones. As part of the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_And_Geoff_91c5.html" title="Pete And Geoff">Pete And Geoff</a> show team, she has received multiple radio awards and nominations, including for the prestigious UK <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony_Radio_Academy_Awards_4445.html" title="Sony Radio Academy Awards">Sony Radio Academy Awards</a>.</p>
<p>2. Other Media Coverage: She has been featured in large-circulation national UK publications such as the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mirror_c617.html" title="Daily Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a> and the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Times_2a4f.html" title="Radio Times">Radio Times</a>, and appeared as a guest on both terrestrial and digital TV channels in the UK.</p>
<p>3. Cultural significance: In addition to this, as mentioned in her entry, she co-wrote a song with <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>. As one of only a handful of people to boast a composer credit alongside one of the greatest music and cultural icons of the 20th Century, thIs alone should warrant her a permanent entry.</p>
<p>ON VANDALISM: As far as people adding silly jokes to the entry goes, this is an unfortunate and unwanted of entries about pop-culture figures, major or minor. The boyfriend comment was clearly something mentioned on the radio, and jumped-on by a listener who edited here. There are hours upon hours of verifiable source downloadable in the form of podcast/archive audio, although this is, admittedly, an arduous task.</p>
<p>The problem here, surely, is not the validity of <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annabel_Port_5a34.html" title="Annabel Port">Annabel Port</a>'s entry, but a need for greater vigilance policing this page for vandalism and flippant additions. 82.69.47.207 10:43, 28 January 2007 (UTC)Lespez</p>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - Annabel Port is an integral part of a national radio show. How about we delete Chris Moyles? 88.106.170.67 13:41, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - Wikipedia is international and ground up in its concept. Annabel Port commands an audience both in the UK (on national independent radio) and internationally via the Internet. The radio station in question has recently featured the UK Prime Minister live on air (not as a specifically invited guest - he called in himself), so Mr Blair is not of the opinion it is insignificant. Vandalism (the boyfriend comment) and lack of sources are specifically listed as not good enough reasons to delete. The Geoff Show is innovative light entertainment radio and is significantly different from any other radio show I have heard. Annabel is an integral part of the Geoff Show (as she was of the Pete and Geoff Breakfast Show). I have personally not heard of all of the subjects of Wikipedia articles - surely this is the point? An Encycopedia is a place where a person can look up information that he or she does not already know. Panperoxide 19:19, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Annabel Port is an essential member of a prime time radio broadcast that goes out worldwide, although she is not the main host, she provides much of the content and among the shows listenership she is very well known and loved. I see that many of the contestents in Big Brother have an entry, Chantelle, Jade Goody etc, even though they haven't achieved anything in life. Annabel has forged a successful career in radio over the past 5 years and could be considered one of the top 200 most powerful people in radio in the uk. I guess the question that i would ask the Wikipedia administrators is "Do you consider radio to be an unimportant genre of entertainment not worthy of comment or discussion now we have other forms, television, internet etc?" If Karl Pilkington can have an entry, then Annabel should also have one.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.146.176.235 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.146.176.235_6c24.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.146.176.235">contribs</a>) 20:01, January 27, 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>DO NOT DELETE&#160;: Annabel has kept the nation amused for years, she is a truly worthy person and has saved many a person from suicidal thoughts. she is VERY well known in Surrey, her biggest fan base. As a student i have just been asked to do some homework researching radio stars, i have choosen her, it is very useful to have information about this celebrity here. thank you. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 88.109.251.72 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_88.109.251.72_29fd.html" title="Special:Contributions/88.109.251.72">contribs</a>) 16:43, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Just another radio presenter, no different from any other. Please, people, let's at least have a hint as to why we should regard this kind of stuff as notable. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 13:23, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Over the last year I have become a fan of the Geoff Show and in Particular Annabelle. I think she is a integral part of the show. The show is worldwide. If you are to delete Annabelle port then you must delete all other Radio DJ's that you have listed on this site.</li>
</ul>
<p>DO NOT DELETE: Annabelle Port is a well known radio presenter and a lot of other Virgin Radio presenters are on Wiki Template:Rvsrvs</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>: Annabelle is indeed a celebrity, and a well known presenter for virgin radio, There are lesser celebrities on wikki!</li>
</ul>
<p>Worth noting that an effort to save this article has just gone out on air&#160;:)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Sock puppets and rentamobs aside (why is the concept of the word 'keep' always beyond them?) she's co-presenter on the morning radio show on a nationwide station with a listening audience (i.e. number actually listening, not number in the area broadcast) of over 2 million <a href="http://www.mediauk.com/radio/rajar/1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mediauk.com/radio/rajar/1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and on more than one occasion a nominee for the Sony Radio Awards. How many ears listening to you in the morning are needed to make someone notable? <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 22:29, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't know that even 10 Billion ears listening makes someone notable. Aside from that, there is also the issue of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, which, imo, don't exist to support <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for this article. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValrith_e155.html" title="User:Valrith">Valrith</a> 22:38, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If 10 billion ears listening are still not notable I suggest we just nominate <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> for deletion. And frankly if 2 million people are listening to you everyday then that is more notable than a huge number of people in wikipedia articles. As for reliable sources - I've given you RAJAR, which proves the station exists and is notable, and the stations own website has a biography for the woman. What are you waiting for, a book? <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 23:10, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Do Not Delete: Annabel Port is very well known in the UK, and many other countries as well. If you put an article about pete bennett on Wikipedia, surely you should keep this article. It only needs a bit of tidying up and it will be fine. BackInBlack89</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This page seems pretty overwhelmingly in favour of keeping the article, with most of the pro-deletion brigade being our cousins from across the pond who seem to know very little about British radio and its presenters (just as I know very little about American radio). Just needs a cleanup, nothing more. 88.81.132.38 20:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
