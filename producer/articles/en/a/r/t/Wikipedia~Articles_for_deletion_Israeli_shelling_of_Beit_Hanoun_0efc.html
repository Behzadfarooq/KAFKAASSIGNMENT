<p>This article should be deleted because: (1) it is a POV fork of <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beit_Hanoun_November_2006_incident_5c8a.html" title="Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident">Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident</a> created by a known POV and edit warrior named Striver in an attempt to shoehorn material that violates WP:NPOV into the article it forks, (2) the images used by the page are all copyright violations. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 16:06, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Israeli_shelling_of_Beit_Hanoun_0efc.html" title="Edit section: Since a number of people are trying to confuse this issue!">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Since a number of people are trying to confuse this issue!</b></span></h4>
<p>The facts in the case are:<br />
<b>#1</b> - The original article, <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beit_Hanoun_November_2006_incident_5c8a.html" title="Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident">Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident</a>, was created at 13:06. NINE HOURS LATER, Striver comes along and creates a fork. There is zero possible chance he didn't know the original article existed, yet instead of editing on the original article, he created a fork. It strains the bounds of credulity to try to presume he was not creating an illegal POV fork as defined in wikipedia's policies.</p>
<p><b>#2</b> - I nominated this based on that principle.</p>
<p><b>#3 - The idea that the content of a highly POV forked article should be merged into the original article directly contradicts our NPOV policies.</b></p>
<p>Now, to the other items at hand: In reading the responses and checking the userpages of the editors in question, it appears that Striver, Bhaisaab, Nielswik, Puddleman, Truthspreader, Palestine48 (counting those I've identified so far) are all either (a) members of a POV-pushing group on Wikipedia that calls themselves "The Muslim Guild" or else have strong POV biases in the Palestine conflict that they are trying to push. I do not consider it an unreasonable assumption that they are even going so far as to try to "stuff" this AFD by calling in friends to vote for them, seeing as only Striver and Nielswik have any connection to the page in question. This is behavior that Wikipedia very much frowns upon and I again believe it strains the bounds of credulity to try to assume there is good faith involved when editors like this are saying things like "<i>showing the atrocities committed by the Israeli government</i>" is their goal for the article in question. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a soapbox and obvious propaganda, which is all that the POV fork up for deletion is, ought to be excised as quickly as possible. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 15:36, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, a note to Striver: your demand for an apology is <b>denied</b>. AGF does not require that I ignore the resounding evidence in front of my eyes. A 9-hour gap between the creation of the article, when the article was edited heavily, and when the article was being edited by <b>other members of your guild</b> like Nielswik, it seems to me almost impossible that you somehow did not know of its existence. I am stating, for the record: I believe that as per AGF, your behavior strains the bounds so far that I can not assume you are operating in good faith. If you can convince me otherwise, fine, but the creation of a POV fork so late after the other article was created, and the pushing of obvious propaganda statements as well as copyright violation images, and the concurrent statements by your own guildmates indicating that the whole purpose of your POV fork is to be as negative to the Israeli side of the issue as possible, shows me that it was a bad-faith creation. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 15:44, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>as per below that title (esp. the word 'incident') is a revolting euphemism for the slaughter of innocent civilians. it is highly POV &amp; everyone supporting it knows very well that people would take issue with it. <i>this</i> article was created afterwards with a purely descriptive title in an attempt to redress that mistake per per 'npov' &amp; naming conventions. obviously the other article should be merged on these grounds. then 'debate' about content can proceed (it's not relevant here). furthermore the nomminator's biases and prejudices are amply demonstrated in his/her refusal to acknowledge this problem and in the above hypocrisy about other users spreading "propaganda". clearly these are all reasons for terminating this process &amp; allowing a purely procedural merge to go ahead.&#160;<span style="background-color: #000000">&#160;<font color="white"><b>⇒</b></font> <a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball"><font color="white">bsnowball</font></a>&#160;</span> 16:44, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yawn. Don't insult my intelligence. If you have a problem with the title of an article, you hold a discussion on the title of the article on the article's page. You don't go off and create a Propaganda POV Fork, which is a violation of both <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. You just proved that you are interested in this purely to introduce bias by the wording of your own statements. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a Soapbox. You are admitting that your goal in trying to get this disgusting piece of POV propaganda merged is because you are trying to create an article that has emotional context. You are in bad faith trying to create an article that violates NPOV standards. <b>Shame on you.</b> <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 16:51, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Despite your blatant show of bad faith Burqas,, I'll note I have edited only once on the normal article, and never edited on the POV fork your buddy created, except to nominate it for deletion according to Wikipedia's policies.

<li><b>Keep, merge and improve</b>Both of these articles are very similar, and Israeli Shelling of Beit Hanoun is a better title, factual and NPOV. It's dissapointing to see the vicious diatribes and personal attacks on here, I hoped that on Wikipedia even if people were opposed politically they could treat each other civilly. Isn't it better to let people you disagree with 'condemn' themseleves with their words rather than attacking them? <a href="../../../p/u/d/User%7EPuddleman_1944.html" title="User:Puddleman">Puddleman</a> 06:29, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I have just completed some major cleanup of the article (including references), and I have to say that unless someone points the NPOV violations out to me I can't see any - all the references (with the possible exception of the Gush Shalom article which I suspect is likely not to qualify under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>), seem to be from reputable sources, and no statements made in the article are taken out of context. This article is now better sourced and contains a good degree more information than <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beit_Hanoun_November_2006_incident_5c8a.html" title="Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident">Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident</a>, all of it verifiable. The only question that remains in my mind is whether it is encyclopaedic (at the moment it seems to be more of a news article, but it has become an increasing trend on Wikipedia for events in the news to develop rapidly). I'd like to see some other unbiased editors opinions on this (I am neither pro-Israeli, pro-Palestinian, or anti-American), since it appears to be almost exclusively users with strong views on this conflict editing here. <a href="../../../q/m/u/User%7EQmunkE_1841.html" title="User:QmunkE">QmunkE</a> 21:30, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In my mind furthering the split by improving the newer article is counterproductive. This is editing that can be better spent on the main article.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 22:16, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It doesn't change the creation of it as a POV fork. If you have information that you think belongs, it could be added to the real article.
