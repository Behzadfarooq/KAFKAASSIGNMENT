<p>This article is very slight, and violates NPOV in its content. The bias of this article suggests that the majority of animal rights activists support activism through criminal acts.

<p>It does have factual content. While I have to agree that it was amusing that is not a good criterion for deleting it. It is a factual article detailing facts about a religion. just because it is not a very mainstrwam religion does not give you grounds to discriminate against it. You are trying to make excuses to delete content that you disagree with.

<li><b>Keep</b> The only problem with this article is the fact that it does not note that the scandal is also called "Libbygate," "Rovegate," and "Plamegate" by some commentators. Combined, these names get huge numbers of hits. (It makes sense to write the -gate article on this scandal in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheneygate.html" title="Cheneygate">Cheneygate</a> because Cheney is the most notable.) It's safe to say that -gate whatever is becoming the common name for this stroy. <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJMaxwell_e603.html" title="User:JMaxwell">JMaxwell</a> 22:41, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>This seems unfair</b> I was told stories as a child about these toads, and how they would lie in wait for the unwary Eastern Europian (although Croatia wasn't specified). My grandfather, whose family was Polish, told tales of how they would come raiding in the winter.

<p>Article is about a secret society devoted to resurrecting Satan as a mortal. No details are given regarding this process. Or indeed any verifiable facts at all. Also, unless I've misunderstood something a central figure appears to travel back in time at one point from 1871 to 1771. This article has been speedied twice as nonsense, which seems a little harsh as it is not patent nonsense. Additionally the page creator has indicated unhappiness with the application of the nonsense speedy tag. So I've brought it here for fuller consideration. My opinion is that it is confused and confusing, unverifiable and unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 17:34, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Non-notable writer with no works listed. Google only brings up hits for unrelated people. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 22:36, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>So what? (Unsigned vote by User:216.249.54.113.)
<ul>
<li>So Wikipedia has rules; a person has to be notable to have an article on here. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 22:40, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So what you're saying is that just because Google doesn't post it, the author can't be posted? Google doesn't bring up every author, you know. Especially not in Northern Ontario. Encyclopediae are supposed to cover as much knowledge as possible. If you really want, I'll send you a copy of the book. It's entitled "The Rest Has Yet to Be Written", published by "PublishAmerica". Just look up Bernardi in the North Bay phone book; there are only two families with that last name. Hint: Don't start in alphabetical order. Sheesh.

<li>He published his book with <a href="../../../p/u/b/PublishAmerica_23f8.html" title="PublishAmerica">PublishAmerica</a>, the known <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_press.html" title="Vanity press">vanity publisher</a>? Now if he had managed to get a regular publisher interested in his work or if he could present sales figures we could discuss if this should be kept, but since he couldn't this screams vanity. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 23:41, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>No, what I'm saying is that to be on Wikipedia, a writer has to (a) make a bestseller list, (b) win a major literary award, (c) be generally accepted as an important influence on the development of a national literature or a genre, or (d) meet some other criterion which proves that they're <b>notable</b>. Just existing isn't enough; being able to mail me a copy of the book isn't enough. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:18, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, PublishAmerica is a known vanity/POD publisher, saddly of the somewhat notorious kind (the type depicted in "Foucault's Pendulum").

<dd>I know that it says not to modify this page, however I'm not sure where the "appropriate discussion page" is. I think this was <b>far too speedy of a deletion</b>, and especially because the votes were essentially 2-1, when I of course would have also voted to keep it, that would have made it 2-2. <b>"Looks like advertising" is not nearly as strong an arguement as the hits on google (400+)</b>. This was deleted because "Demosphere.net" is simply not as big a site as say, Indymedia.org. But where do we draw that line? There are many many regional Indymedia.org sites which are barely active and yet Indymedia has a strong article presence on wikipedia.org.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Given that this project had garnered press on both wikinews and indymedia.org, I think it's fair to say that Demosphere deserves an article on wikipedia as well. As far as the categorization mark-up, I had no knowledge as to the effects of including the "|" separator beyond the stylisitc effect which I've seen on other pages.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> the article. I am an author and editor at eleven myself having an experience of roundabout 30 years in editing and publishing with various distinguished international publishing houses. But I never worked with a publisher which offered such a good professional support and service to their authors and editors like eleven. Therefore I think that information about eleven should be made available to a broad public via Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>. For some reason, nominating schools for deletion is one of the most controvbersial things you can do on Wikipedia. Nonetheless, this article has serious deficienies, first and foremost the article doesn't say <i>where</i> the school is located, although a Google check indicates that it is in <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_Creek%2C_Michigan_17ce.html" title="Battle Creek, Michigan">Battle Creek, Michigan</a>. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:33, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as unverified. I just see some directory listings of the school, and don't see adequate info for an article. The one in Battle Creek seems to be the one mentioned (as said above), but it's not made clear in the article. In any event, the school closed in 2002, so there seems little point or potential in an article. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 10:12, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is no way of telling which Family Altar Christian School the author had in mind, since no sources were provided in the original article before it was rewritten. But the fact that the Battle Creek Community Foundation recently set aside $13,800 for the one in Battle Creek, Michigan <a href="http://www.bccfoundation.org/Grants%20in%20Review.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bccfoundation.org/Grants%20in%20Review.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> leads me to believe this one is still alive and well, so I will vote accordingly.</li>
<li>That's the DEFINITION of original research.

<ul>
<li>You miss my point, completely. What evidence is there that the school is closed? I just provided an external link which demonstrates that a great deal of money was granted to this school during the 2004-2005 school year. There is an obvious discrepancy here if someone else believes the school closed in 2002. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 22:53, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If there's no independently verifiable information, it's time to just put this one to rest. What are you going to do when you do call them? How is that at all a verifiable source?<br />
This is another problem with school articles in general. You're forced to rely on contacting the subject to get most of the information. How is someone, person or entity, ever a reliable source when their own interests are involved? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 23:12, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No one is forced to do anything to get information.

<li>he told you go read the information on the link regarding <b>verifiability</b> and yet you still haven't done so.

<li>Well, I'm somebody who "routinely nominates and/or votes to delete unverifiable articles". As mentioned above, the original version of this article stated the old school was closed, and kids went to the new <a href="http://calhounchristian.org/" class="external text" title="http://calhounchristian.org/" rel="nofollow">Calhoun Christian School</a>. It seems the existence of the new one proves the non-existance of the old one. Also, I don't have to prove this doesn't exist, the article must prove it does exist. This is a matter of policy per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Also, its seems odd to justify keeping an article on the grounds the original version was entirely wrong regarding the school's status. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 00:43, 28 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Could be that the original version is this that or something else. It really doesn't matter if the original version of the article said "this is a sex school for crackheads on the dark side of Uranus". My vote, as clearly stated, is about keeping the re-write. It verifiably exists as referenced by the links added to the article and is verifiably a school. Two sources to verify it are provided along with it's address and phone number. Anyone who wishes to verify it can phone it. Phone a school to see if it is real is not "original research". Also, see my comments about re: the sourcing by the Battle Creek Enquirer, which as per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is more than sufficient to meet the criteria of verifiability.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 01:22, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The Game Revolution gamepost is a forum for many people and it discusses many important topics. Not only does it keep up to date on everything videogame, but it has made strong friendships and even brought lovers together. The site is very important in the lives of many, and this page will give a history to ease the burden of retelling the story over and over. It will become more insightful as the history is written and will be very useful to hundreds of people. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.62.15.170 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.62.15.170_4a4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.62.15.170">contribs</a>) UTC 16:00, 30 October 2005.</small></p>

<li>I understand where you're coming from, and please understand that this is not a slight on your community. If you want to document the history of your community, that's entirely understandable and even commendable. Go for it. However, Wikipedia is not the place to do it; it's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_free_host_or_webspace_provider" title="WP:NOT">not a free webhost provider</a>. Generally speaking, "useful to hundreds of people" is not really enough to warrant inclusion to Wikipedia, unless it's a particularly obscure, yet notable topic. Gamepost, in the end, simply yet another web forum, and while I don't mean to belittle its significance to you, I must say that as far as the rest of the world is concerned, it's simply not big and influential enough to merit mention, any more than my personal blog or the various online forums I've been known to hang out at are; just because they're important to me, that doesn't mean that the rest of the world cares. That may sound cold, but please understand that I'm not trying to offend. We're building an encyclopedia, not a place where relatively small communities can showcase themselves. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 02:46, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>What about other forums that get mention such as Neowin? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Don Gero (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Don_Gero_b45b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Don Gero">contribs</a>) UTC 03:08, 31 October 2005.</small>
<ul>
<li>Please sign your comments. You can do that by typing out four tildes, like this: ~~~~. That'll leave your username (or IP address) and the time when you left the comment -- that way everyone knows who said what. And to answer your actual question, I'm not actually all that familiar with Neowin, but judging by its article, it is a far more notable forum than Gamepost is. Honestly, it should be fairly obvious why this is the case, but since you ask, I'm going to quote a couple of relevant bits from the article: <i>"Powered by Invision Power Board forum software, Neowin has an active technology forum consisting of 118,979 registered users (October 26, 2005) and more than 5 million posts."</i> That's a lot of users right there. Compared to Gamepost's 10,000+ users, that's a whole different order of magnitude. Size does matter. One of their articles has also been the <i>"most viewed story on Slashdot ever"</i> -- not a <i>huge</i> claim to fame, but that's not easily pulled off, either. Apparently, theirs is a fairly influential webforum, and a very, very significant number of people go there for their Windows-related news. (Note that as 118,979 is just the number of <i>registered</i> users, it's likely that far more people actively follow it.) Gamepost, on the other hand, is not readily distinguishable from numerous other game forums. Also, please note that Neowin's <i>forums</i> do not have an article of their own. In fact, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game-Revolution_0fbd.html" title="Game-Revolution">Game-Revolution</a> already has an article on Wikipedia, and that's not going anywhere (though it could certainly use some work). The current consensus to merge the articles means that the (relevant and notable) information on the current Gamepost article is preserved and moved to Game-Revolution, so it's not like Gamepost is getting treated any different from Neowin. (Of course, if the forums themselves <i>are</i> somehow notable enough to deserve an article all their own, please tell us why this is so; if you can do that, I'm sure that we're more than willing to revise our votes. It's not an uncommon thing to happen during the AfD process, though I should probably point out that generally we favor hard facts over emotional pleas.) Hope this helps. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 03:53, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Foolish me for not thinking of pasting the Babelfish link, that is after all precisely what I did with it... I tagged it AfD not speedy because it may be that some linguistic nuance for the native speaker makes it notable, but Shreshth91 points out that the correct process would be to tag for translation and then let the translator tag it for speedy if valid.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Nothing in this article right now would make me vote keep. The best assertion of notability ("<i>It dates back over 30 years and has had significant social impact, particularly on the west coast...</i>") appears on this AfD and not in the article. If that statement is indeed <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and the article is updated to include contentions of notability, I would say keep.. but right now I just see a bus line and two hostels - that apparently provide lackluster service - with the greatest claim to notability being that they run a line to Burning Man.

<dd>We are having serious issues adding anything to the article at all, as the POV discussion is rather heated. I will admit that finding <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information has been difficult, at best, but I think this is a problem with a word of mouth and pre-internet history. Their greatest claim to notabilty is the fame their bus line attained pre-burning man and pre-hostels. In particular, they ran a hop-on hop-off line up and down the west coast, which has since been discontinued. I'll see if I can find some verifiable sources reflecting my <i>30 years of impact</i> statement today. <b>∴</b> <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHere_05b1.html" title="User:Here">here</a>…<a href="../../../h/e/r/User_talk%7EHere_e90f.html" title="User talk:Here">♠</a> 18:09, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That would be helpful and would probably go a long way towards making sure this doesn't get AfD'd again if indeed the information is verifiable. If the information is word of mouth, then yes you will have a problem sourcing it, but if there is pre-internet media about it (books, newspapers, magazines, etc.) a biliographic mention would establish verifibility... see <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampire_Watermelon_5e66.html" title="Vampire Watermelon">Vampire Watermelon</a> for example. Seems completely ridiculous, but it is supported by text in an anthropological book (incidentally, someone scanned the pages and posted them on the web as proof because this article went through a couple of AfDs). Just a suggestion because even if this survives AfD my guess is it will get nominated again at some point if no greater claim of notibility is made, or if the notability claims are not sourced.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:53, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. No obvious examples of this being a current usage, and I have to say the first paragraph made my head spin. I can see where the author is going, the study of imaginary objects which assume a life outside the fiction in which they appear is sometimes quite interesting (especially the Hith-Hiker's Guide, which Adams did get going as h2g2.com) but I'm not sure this is the right place for it, and as currently written it certainly counts as original research. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> 20:12, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Commment</b> I believe you are misinterpreting what Wikipedia means by <i>original research</i>. If an expert writes a book which becomes a well regarded publication on its topic, then that author comes here and contributes on the same subject, that does not count as <i>original research</i> even though it is the original article. Conversely, if Joe Schmo writes a crack-pot theory that generates no stir beyond just a few Google hits with it, then Jeff Blow comes here and adds it to Wikipedia, it is still <i>original research</i> even though it is not added by the original author. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 21:55, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Existing topics such as 'false document' are insufficient assesments of the subjects referred to as 'imaginary antecedents.'

<dd>Have you looked at the actual Google results, though? They have little to do with the topic of the article.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Huh. I had no idea that first-order logic was considered 'research.' All this time I thought I've just been doing math, I could have been publishing it! Let me ask, would hand-drawing a new sketch of a familiar concept be considered 'original research' too? <a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOneismany_293f.html" title="User talk:Oneismany">oneismany</a> 10:28, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps I have misused the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> policy. In my limited time here, it has become fairly clear that this encompasses topics beyond research: neologisms and attempts to coin phrases, for example. What you have done is taken two words that could be combined to mean any number of things and given them a <i>very</i> specific literary definition. This is simply not appropriate for an encyclopedia.</dd>
<dd>Here's a thought experiment. Little Johnny Schoolboy writes a book report on one of these books you cite, like <i><a href="../../../l/o/t/LotR_74dd.html" title="LotR">LotR</a></i>. In this, he refers to the <i>Red Book</i> as an "imaginary antecedent" without further explanation, assuming that his very knowledgeable teacher will understand the term. The teacher grabs her red marker and circles the term, putting a few big question marks next to it, because—while she certainly knows both words—she has never seen them used this way. Johnny gets his paper back and complains, saying he read it in an encyclopedia, and all the teacher can say is, "I'm glad you put so much effort into your paper, but nobody uses this term. Nobody will understand it when you use it unless you explain it further, so why use it?"</dd>
<dd>It seems to me that you're trying to invent a new phrase, like <i>dangling participle</i>, and this is not the place to coin a term. —<span class="horsepunchkid"><a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorsePunchKid_a248.html" title="User:HorsePunchKid"><span style="font-family: monospace; font-variant: small-caps;">HorsePunchKid</span></a>→<a href="../../../h/o/r/User_talk%7EHorsePunchKid_fa6d.html" title="User talk:HorsePunchKid"><span style="color: #070;">龜</span></a></span> 19:53, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Okay, I see your point about that and I don't think this specific phrase needs to be the title of this entry. There is no 'imaginary x' topic however, and the subject matter discussed in this entry is not specific to that phrase. The entry is in the process of being broadened to incorporate more perspectives and cross-references. Sorry for the neologism; this entry is under construction, so please be patient and don't delete it while it is in progress. Of course any assistance in grounding the subject in existing terminology would be appreciated.</dd>

<dd>If frogs, for example, were listed separately as fish and as reptiles, would it be 'original research' to list them as amphibians?

<dd><b>Weak delete</b>. I still think it's non notable and that most web comics authors are not that well known. Per <a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEst_Xplosif_557d.html" title="User:Est Xplosif">est</a>, I think that the category might be need deletion too, as there's clearly a difference between <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_M._Schulz_c4b1.html" title="Charles M. Schulz">Charles_M._Schulz</a> and them... not that their work is of low quality, it isn't. It's not just that notable. Anyway, the cleanup makes it look like a <i>serious</i> article and not a personal page, thus the change to <b>weak delete</b>.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. By that logic, we should delete most of the articles about the American Presidents from the 19th Century, since the majority of them aren't notable, compared to Bush, Clinton, Reagan and JFK. Then we should just go and delete all the articles about British PMs, since only a few of them are notable. Of course these Webcomic authors aren't as famous as Schulz, but name three non-webcomic authors who are? These guys may not be known far and wide in the real world, but they are on the internet, and thats a culture in itself.--<a href="../../../k/r/o/User%7EKross_94e2.html" title="User:Kross">Kross</a> | <a href="../../../k/r/o/User_talk%7EKross_2ea2.html" title="User talk:Kross">Talk</a> 19:36, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> As the creator of this page on a group that I have acquainted myself with, I seriously doubt Jhazingha-Khaliph would care. As far as some sock puppet rage, it isn't even worried about. But before closing, J-K is a group that continues to grow, and I've heard nothing on this earth that sounds like their music. Not only that but they work regular jobs just like everybody else and the members aren't looking for acceptance in such a warped industry. That's why I categorized them outsider artists. But Jhazingha-Khaliph will tell you they don't care one way or the other because they never worried about impressing anybody. So I guess even Jhazingha-Khaliph says "DELETE." Marvin Glass</li>

<b>don't delete this, for 3 reasons:</b></p>
<p>1) bithrey is a well known celebrity in jersey. this is not merely a 'local' station - jersey has its own government, bank notes and therefore is entitled to consider itself a little more than just a locality</p>
<p>2) bithrey has connections with internationally well known celebrities such as chris moyles</p>
<p>3) surely all this discussion about jon bithrey suggests that he IS notable enough for inclusion.</p>
<p>in addition, as far as i know this entry is not the work of bithrey, therefore it is not 'vanity'</p>
<p><b>I wrote this article and realise it needed rewriting so I did so.</b> Am now slightly surprised that there is still such a push to delete it from some quarters.

<li>In hindsight, my comment does seem to be a <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">logical fallacy</a>. The fact that there is a category for something doesn't necessarily mean that it should have an article. Otherwise, everything on AfD could be assigned to a category and kept. Please, allow me to explain my vote now logically: <i>I think we should keep the article because British radio hosts are apparently considered notable people since more than 175 of them already have Wikipedia articles.</i> --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETantalumTelluride_d79e.html" title="User:TantalumTelluride">TantalumTelluride</a> 19:34, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> I do not live in Jersey but do live in the United Kingdom. I personally don't listen to Jon Bithrey as I do not receive BBC Radio Jersey. However, having read the entry about him I think that he is clearly notable enough to be on Wikipedia. Surely anyone who lived on Jersey or wanted to know more about the island would find their visit to this site enriched by being able to look at local radio stations on the island and then be able to be linked directly to one of the key personalities who reports news on the most important local radio station? Is this kind of things not exactly what Wikipedia is about, or am I missing the point? I just don't understand the requests that this be removed. --82.35.78.232 11:17, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are contradictory sources, but the actual name of this person seems to be <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julio_Mario_Santo_Domingo_60be.html" title="Julio Mario Santo Domingo">Julio Mario Santo Domingo</a>. References: Several main Colombian journals use "Julio Mario Santo Domingo" <a href="http://www.eltiempo.com/econ/2005-07-20/ARTICULO-PRINTER_FRIENDLY-_PRINTER_FRIENDLY-2152906.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eltiempo.com/econ/2005-07-20/ARTICULO-PRINTER_FRIENDLY-_PRINTER_FRIENDLY-2152906.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, <a href="http://www.elespectador.com/historico/2005-09-18/contenido_MI-5349.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elespectador.com/historico/2005-09-18/contenido_MI-5349.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> and there's a Mario Santo Domingo foundation <a href="http://www.fundacionmariosantodomingo.org.co/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fundacionmariosantodomingo.org.co/" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> (clearly in his honor).</p>
<p>Besides, the "Julio Mario Santodomingo" article contains information out of date, doubtful or irrelevant.</p>
<p>Doubtful: Santo Domingo was born in Barranquilla. (This serious reference <a href="http://www.elpais.es/articulo/20050904elpnegemp_6/Tes/elpnegemp/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elpais.es/articulo/20050904elpnegemp_6/Tes/elpnegemp/" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> says, according to my translation, that Santo Domingo "was born in Panamá, but originated in Barranquilla", info which I included in <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julio_Mario_Santo_Domingo_60be.html" title="Julio Mario Santo Domingo">Julio Mario Santo Domingo</a>).</p>
<p>Out of date: Santo Domingo owns Bavaria. (Bavaria was fusioned with (absorbed by) SABMiller). See <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grupo_Empresarial_Bavaria" class="external autonumber" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grupo_Empresarial_Bavaria" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>.</p>
<p>Out of date: Santo Domingo owns Avianca (Germán Efromovich is the new main stock holder of Avianca <a href="http://spanish1.peopledaily.com.cn/31617/3054601.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://spanish1.peopledaily.com.cn/31617/3054601.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>.)</p>
<p>Possibly out of date: Santo Domingo lives in Paris, (apparently he spends most of his time in New York now, but I would have to double check this. See for instance: <a href="http://www.javeriana.edu.co/Facultades/comunicacion_lenguaje/directo_bogota/edicion3/libros.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.javeriana.edu.co/Facultades/comunicacion_lenguaje/directo_bogota/edicion3/libros.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> (2004) or <a href="http://www.colombia.com/entrevistas/autonoticias/DetalleNoticia327.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.colombia.com/entrevistas/autonoticias/DetalleNoticia327.asp" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> (2004)).</p>
<p>Irrelevant: Carrefour bought his house. (While Carrefour bought Santo Domingo's family's house in Barranquilla, <a href="http://www.proexport.com.co/VbeContent/library/documents/DocNewsNo2884DocumentNo2700.DOC" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.proexport.com.co/VbeContent/library/documents/DocNewsNo2884DocumentNo2700.DOC" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, the anecdote is irrelevant, and I couldn't verify it).</p>

<li><b>No overlap</b> -- Civilian intelligence officials have retained the couple of dozen detainees who have the most intelligence value. <b>They are not held at Guantanamo Bay</b>. So there is no overlap between the List of Guantanamo Bay detainees, and a list of those with an intelligence value so great they are not held by the military, are not held in Guantanamo Bay.</li>
<li><b>Dick Cheney made the distinction.</b> On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_20.html" title="October 20">October 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, VPOTUS Dick Cheney tried to get John McCain to change his proposal to restrict American interrogators to only those interrogation techniques authorized the official Army interrogation manual. Cheney wanted McCain's proposal to only apply to those detainees in military custody, and not to the smaller group of detainees with real intelligence value, who were in the custody of civilian intelligence agencies. I contend that circumstances of arrest, detention, interrogations of the detainees in civilian custody, and the allegations against them, merits inclusion in the wikipedia. And I contend that an article devoted to those held in Guantanamo Bay is an innapropriate place for that inclusion. None of these guys is held in Guantanamo Bay. I wasn't completely happy with the name I picked when I started this article. And the confusion expressed suggests the article should have a different name. But it certainly merits inclusion. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 17:57, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Delete</s> Undecided for now</b> my main problem with this article is the question "what makes a detainee <i>high value</i>?"

<li>As above. The List of Guantanamo Bay detainees -- all of whom are in military custody -- does not cover detainees who are not held in Guantanamo Bay, and who are held by civilian intelligence agencies.</li>
<li>As above, the wikipedia needs this article, but it needs a different title.</li>
<li>Rumsfeld, and other senior officials, have claimed that the interrogations at Guantanamo Bay have produced <b>"invaluable intelligence"</b>. There is a long tradition in war-fighting to use disinformation. I think it was Winston Churchill who said that, in wartime, <b>"the truth must be guarded by a bodyguard of lies"</b>. I think accepting the "invaluable intelligence", and "worst of the worst" claims, at face value, is POV. I think balanced, neutral coverage of the detainee issues requires having articles also present verifiable information that allows readers to test the Bush administrations claims. If the Guantanamo Bay facility really included the worst of the worst it would contain Abu Zubaydah, al-Libi, and Khaled Sheikh Mohammed.</li>
<li>The USA has, in custody, some guys who are believed to be senior members of al Qaeda, guys who had foreknowledge of, or helped plan, the attacks of 9-11. And the USA has, in custody, some guys who are believed to have been the directors of terrorist training camps. These are the guys who are really "the worst of the worst", the ones with real "intelligence value". US civilian intelligence agencies have held on to them. They are not held in Guantanamo Bay. And the Bush administration is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/24/AR2005102402051.html" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/24/AR2005102402051.html" rel="nofollow">fighting very strongly to continue to hold them in secret interrogatin centres</a> and to continue to interrogate them using more extreme interrogation techniques. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 17:57, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - In response to the comments you left on my talk page, Geo Swan: My other problem with this article is how inherently American the POV is. Even if you removed the subjective term <i>high value</i>, a List of detainees, does not mean only those detainees held by the US, as this article implies. And honestly, I don't think that is the kind of article you are trying to create here. All articles should try very hard to attain a neutral point of view (NPOV). Not only does the title of this article fail to do so, it fails to do so on two accounts. The rest of this article follows the suit of the title and maintains a very non neutral point of view. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalo_c828.html" title="User:Malo">Malo</a> 19:28, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It was a poor choice of title. My mistake. How would you feel about Terror suspects held by US inteligence agencies or detainees held by US intelligence agencies in the "global war on terror". It would be more convenient to use something like Terror suspects held by the CIA. But we don't know that they are held by the CIA. Afghanistan is one of the world's most prolific opium growing areas. So the DEA may be working there. There is a slim possibility that the CIA delegated the detention of some suspects to the DEA or other more junior agencies.</li>
<li>I can't tell if you think that the article, as it stands, is too sympathetic to the detainees, or too sympathetic to the stands taken by the Bush administration. Would you care to clarify that for me?</li>
<li>Do you have any concrete suggestions, beyond a change of title, as to what the article needs to seem NPOV to you? I made some changes to take your comments into account. In particular I changed many of the uses of the term "high value detainees" to "suspects held by US Civilian Intelligence agencies".</li>
<li>You made a guess at the "kind of article am I trying to create here". Well, you don't have to guess. I will tell you. I believe that a NPOV requires more than merely echoing the positions of the Bush administration. I believe that the presentation of pertinent, verifiable information, that does not use inflammatory language, is not POV. Did I use noninflammatory language? I thought so. But if you disagree, I'd appreciate you pointing me to specific passages where my efforts fell short.</li>
<li>A limited number of wikipedia contributors seem to have the view that merely trying to write about certain topics is biased, and POV. I disagree. Some topics may be harder to address in an NPOV way. But I am willing to make the effort. And I am going to count on others who can assume good will, to help me out with that.</li>

<li>I'm not sure I can provide a better title for this article, I've been racking my brain about it. And I think that you are correct about NPOV and how other users deem them to be POV based upon the topic. (myself potentially included). So I applaude you for attempting to do something that I wouldn't personally feel comfortable with. One problem I have with this is in the first line <i>United States intelligence agencies are widely believed to maintain covert interrogation centres</i> Widely believed is not really verified. It's mighty close, and in all likelihood it's true, however proving it becomes difficult when a government that likes to keep its secrets is involved. Hence the rest of this article is built upon a widely believed statement (or not so much for conspiracy theorists). And I suppose there are other articles that do this, even more from further back in history, however this is a developing topic and real information isn't exactly plentiful and verifible just yet. I suggest you mention somewhere in here the term <a href="../../../u/n/l/Unlawful_combatant.html" title="Unlawful combatant">Unlawful combatant</a> and how it relates to the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Convention_def6.html" title="Geneva Convention">Geneva Convention</a>, and the status of these detainees. Perhaps this article could be shortened and added as section upon another article such as <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Terrorism_c7b1.html" title="War on Terrorism">War on Terrorism</a>. Or perhaps it needs to be expanded. I think the problem you face still is that most people see this as a work created by someone who has strong or bias views one way or the other. And that consequently this article is being used to push someone's agenda of either absolute truth or half-truths. Which comes back to why I don't feel comfortable on these sort of things. However I am willing to change my vote, I just haven't decided fully what is best for this article. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalo_c828.html" title="User:Malo">Malo</a> 22:27, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As above, the detainees who are not in military custody, are not detained in Cuba, who were retained by civilian intelligence agencies, because they were senior al Qaeda who had real knowledge of participation in the planning of the attacks on 9-11 merit separate coverage from the detainees who are in military custody. The possibility exists that the interrogation techniques used on those in the List of Guantanamo Bay detainees will be scaled back to just those authorized in the Army's field manual on interrogation, while those in civilian custody remain interrogated by more extreme techniques, like "waterboarding" and mock executions. That alone, IMO, merits a separate article. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 17:57, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment re Definitions of <i>High Value Detainee</i></b> The argument is that the U.S. govt particularly mistreats those detainees that it defines as high value. The problem with the <b>list</b> is that the U.S govt has never disclosed the names. A U Mich site defines the phrase -- <i>High Value Detainee A detainee who, due to his or her senior position in the military, security, scientific/technical, or government structures of Saddam Husayn's [sic] Regime, may have knowledge or insights of relevance to ISG's mission.</i> [www.lib.umich.edu/govdocs/pdf/duelfer3_e.pdf 1]. If this is the correct definition, then many of the names on the list are incorrect. However, we have no way of confirming this until the US Govt releases the names. Eventually that will happen, but at this stage, any list we put up would be based on speculation. An OpEd piece could properly speculate on the identities, but is it encyclopedic? <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaquin_Murietta_3d07.html" title="User:Joaquin Murietta">Joaquin Murietta</a> 07:09, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I made a poor choice of names when I started the article. I already said this, several times. The article needs to be renamed. My current favourite alternative name is Terror suspects in CIA custody.</li>

<li>In answer to your question: As I understand wiki policy, the authors of wikipedia articles are not supposed to include their own speculation in the contributions they make. But quoting articles, and op-eds, that speculate, is completely legit, as long as they are properly cited, so the reader can tell the cited material is a speculation.</li>

He is said to have been the first senior al Qaeda to have been the subject of more extreme interrogation techniques. Under interrogation he made admissions that were regarded as extremely important. The news from his interrogation were regarded as so important that a cabinet level decision was made to sacrifice the keeping his information under wraps. Al-Libi was mentioned, by name, in the famous speech Powell gave to the UN, where he cited evidence that bolstered the case that there was a tie between al Qaeda and Saddam's regime, and that Saddam did have a dangerous arsenal of WMD.</li>

<dd>After the invasion, and after the American failure to find any WMD al-Libi was re-interviewed about the WMD. He acknowledged that the admissions he made were untrue.</dd>

<li>You seem to be implying here, and elsewhere, that the wikipedia cannot report any speculation on facts or arguments that could be interpreted as reflecting poorly on US policies. You have consistently called that kind of material POV, or "obviously POV". That is far to high a standard. The standard you suggest here, that the wikipedia cannot report on the status of these detainees until you recognize that an official US government source has acknowledged the the nature and location of their detention and interrogation is too high. There are secrets, from World War 2, that remain classified over sixty years later. But no one would argue that the wikipedia shouldn't report speculation about those secrets. I am old enough to remember a time before the British wartime decryption efforts had lead to the worlds first digital computers. If the wikipedia had been around then, surely you would agree that reporting the knowledgeable speculation of experts, and former insiders, was completely legitimate?</li>
<li>I am old enough to remember the unfolding of the US Watergate scandal, during the Nixon Presidency. By the standard you seem to be suggesting, the wikipedia would not have been able to report on Woodward and Bernstein stories -- because they were reporting material that relected poorly on a sitting President that had not been confirmed by an official US government official. By this standard you would have restricted the wikipedia from reporting on expert's speculation as to the identity of the source Woodward and Bernstein identified as "deep throat". No, the wikipedia is not the place for crusading investigative journalists. But reporting on the speculation of investigative journalists, in a balanced way, is completely within what the wikipedia is.</li>

<li>Do you remember the course of the US invasion of Iraq. Progress was relatively quick. It took about a month from when the first elements crossed the border, to the final occupation of the government complex in downtown Baghdad. During that month the Iraqi Minister of Information kept giving these ridiculous press conferences, where he reported that the Iraqi forces were winning, were on the brink of chewing up the invaders, and expelling them. He was a laughing stock. Saddam restricted him from reporting or confirming anything that reflected poorly on Saddam's regime. If you succeeded, and were able to suppress reports all facts or expert's speculation, that could be interpreted as reflecting poorly on the USA, from inclusion in the wikipedia, you would turn it into the same kind of laughing stock as Saddam's Ministry of Information.</li>
<li>The proper role of the wikipedia is not to serve as a US hagiography. The wikipedia is not a US project. It is an international project. Even if I were an American I would argue against the suppression of verifiable information just because it could be seen as reflecting poorly on US policies. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 14:52, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Retain</b> It would be hypocritical to delete this page when other major members of other online communities such as <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeroy_Jenkins_c207.html" title="Leeroy Jenkins">Leeroy Jenkins</a> of World of Warcraft have entries to their names. I dislike the notion of commericiality as a tiebreaker for encyclopaedic worthiness(if a printed novel had less readers than this, how would that fare?), especially on a donation-based site such as this. Disagree with comment about reviews; It does not attempt to link reviews with popularity, but the reviews <i>have</i> elevated it within a <i>very</i> large online community. The article is not written by the authors of the fiction. Moreover, it is a humorous novel based on the authors above all else, and is no more a Mary Sue(i.e. Hollow characters) than a Marx Brothers film. Finally, criticising the literature as a Mary Sue does not affect the legitimacy of the article ~Inkstersco 10:37 Oct 27</li>

The article was created by a new user named Mattoj, whose username bears a striking semblance to the name of the company. No claim or evidence of notability is cited in the article.

<li>OK, on this brand-new article, completely unrelated to the one I suggested for deletion, I vote <b>keep</b>. But it should surely be re-titled Pencil Box (TV show) or some such. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 14:50, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No need for extra qualifiers. We already have capitalization to deal with that. Both <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pencil_box.html" title="Pencil box">pencil box</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pencil_Box_358c.html" title="Pencil Box">Pencil Box</a> are interlinked so people who can't use properly capitalization can still find what they're looking for. Titles should be as easy as possible. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 20:00, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree titles should be as easy as possible, but think you're being a bit subtle here. In an encyclopaedia where "<a href="../../../i/n/n/Innosense.html" title="Innosense">Innosense</a>" is accepted as a misspelling so frequent that needs to be a redirect to <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innocence.html" title="Innocence">Innocence</a>, as it was the other day, it's a bit unrealistic to expect people to be so scrupulous about their capitalisation. Most of the time such searches are not case-sensitive, and Wikipedia's fussiness in that department still catches me out sometimes. After all why should the first initial letter of a term like <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pencil_box.html" title="Pencil box">Pencil box</a> be capitalised, and if so why not the second too? <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 23:34, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Something has gone adrift here. We now seem to be discussing whether to delete an article (about a TV programme) that was never suggested for deletion, while the one that was suggested for deletion (about the thing you keep pencils in) has in effect been quietly speedy-kept as a redirect to <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pencil_case.html" title="Pencil case">Pencil case</a>, itself just as much a classic dicdef as <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pencil_box.html" title="Pencil box">Pencil box</a> was before it was rewritten on a different subject. Incidentally "pencil box" is not the same as "pencil case", since the latter is often (usually?) made of a soft material, which the former cannot be. Let's call the whole thing off! <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 23:34, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There has been no speedy keeping. Neither <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pencil_case.html" title="Pencil case">pencil case</a> nor <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pencil_box.html" title="Pencil box">pencil box</a> were nominated for deletion here in the first place (although the former was nominated and kept back in May). All that has happened is that <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pencil_Box_358c.html" title="Pencil Box">Pencil Box</a> has been rewritten to actually be about what the incoming hyperlinks implied that it was intended to be about, thanks to <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> pointing it out above. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:10, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I posted the article and I'm new to editing Wikipedia so I apologize if it was not put in the correct format, I intended for it to be edited by someone else later. I thought that since it is an international company and one of if not the only "Gamestore" that does franchises its inclusion on this website would not be inappropriate. I am biased since I own one of the stores but I'd love to hear a neutral opinion on this.--Lbrad2001 22:44, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

The <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> criteria are satisfied. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:10, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I disagree. Even if that were true, the company could only be said to have met one of those criteria - "The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple published works". If it were the subject of those two minor Wall Street Journal articles, I would say that Pop-a-Lock had met the letter, but not the spirit, of the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> criteria - which are only intended as "rough guidelines". However, Pop-A-Lock isn't really the subject of those articles at all. The articles are both about franchises <i>generally</i>; Pop-a-Lock just happens to be prominently mentioned. This article has in no way established sufficient notability for inclusion in Wikipedia. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadBaron_f496.html" title="User:TheMadBaron">TheMadBaron</a> 16:28, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The article does not appear to be an advertisement. For example, it states that a background check of the company's franchisees revealed that one was guilty of "<a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_theft_auto.html" title="Grand theft auto">grand theft auto</a>." I am uncertain on the notability of the company, though. <b>Neutral</b> --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETantalumTelluride_d79e.html" title="User:TantalumTelluride">TantalumTelluride</a> 22:06, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. What criteria for deletion does this satisfy? It's verifiable. Independent and reputable references are cited. It's not an advert - in fact, it's a textbook example of NPOV, reporting facts without making value judgements, sourcing all claims, and identifying the one case where the source has a conflict of interest. It's bitty and needs cleaning up, but that is not a criterion for deletion. The company is not of world-shattering notability, but does satisfy the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">guidelines</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> paper.

<li>Yes, Welcome to Wikipedia. TT is correct of course about people looking for the color Red, but in a larger sense it is absolutley possible for multiple names to go to one place.

<p>After editing the page and realizing one of the Scott Petersons listed did not have the last name Peterson, I've come to the conclusion that this page isn't necessary. At this point, the only Scott Peterson listed other than the convict is a staff writer for the Christian Science Monitor, who does not have a Wiki page. This man isn't exactly a well-known journalist...I did a quick search for random staff writers for the New York Times (which has many more readers than the Monitor) and came up empty handed.</p>
<p>I'm sure very few people look up Scott Peterson in hopes of reading about the journalist; and even if they do, he doesn't have a page. I believe this page was created just so people could add the "(convicted murderer)" tag on the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Peterson_18fa.html" title="Scott Peterson">Scott Peterson</a> page. Either way, I don't think this is needed. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarco_Passarani_4a21.html" title="User:Marco Passarani">Marco Passarani</a> 22:29, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Well, now that Uncle G has made an article for the writer (and the writer seems notable), the page needs to be kept. Suggest to closer that other deletion votes be voided after significant change. I agree with Kjkolb that Uncle G's tone was odd, since only his actions redeemed the page, and voters before that change deserved no reprimand. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 18:09, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just to add more information; I graduated high school in 1994, so this has been around for at least 14+ years. Maybe this is original research, but we've always suspected that this was a sport featured in some hypothetical magazine for gym teachers. It wouldn't surprise me one bit if the author of this article went to the school where this sport originated.

<ul>
<li>I'd guess that this is the case simply because it hasn't been agreed to apply to bands, just people; it was specifically designed to make it easier to get rid of the numerous vanity bios that pop up every day -- there are much more of those than articles for non-notable bands. The definition has (wisely, I think) been kept fairly narrow. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 22:38, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A whole 35 people, huh? Goodness, Wikipedia had better watch its back. Especially when it gets so much traffic as to have no Alexa rank at all. One computer just isn't encyclopedic and <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a> an indiscrimate collection of information. - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:12, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> A site with no Alexa ranking means absolutely nothing. While there's question as to the value of the content here, I'd hate to think you would delete this article because of lack of Alexa rank. Alexa gathers information from people who have the Alexa toolbar installed. This toolbar only does two things: Provide data to Alexa, and perform second-rate searches. It's an information gathering software, which gets similar programs to be labelled as spyware. I would take it as a credit if no one who visited a site I owned was foolish enough to have that thing installed. Just my two cents. - 70.31.155.217 02:57, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whether or not the Alexa toolbar is spyware is irrelevant. What does matter is that is a random sample of users and thus can be used as a basis for statistical analysis. It is also not the only criterion used when we consider articles about web sites (see <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>).

<li><b>Undecided</b> You know that they’re probably right and it shouldn’t be there, violation or not. Wikipedia is not a repository of all human knowledge, just of things that concern a large number of people.

Is it just because this site has a larger readership that they should be allowed inclusion? If I made a wiki page for MY comics, would that be allowed to stay? How many readers/users is the right amount? Or what about this article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podtacular" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podtacular" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podtacular</a>&#160;?

<li><b>Delete</b>. As the owner of The GoldFish Network, I can tell you all that this page was clearly created as a joke by someone who uses my server. It's gotten way out of hand. As per guidelines, there's no reason for this to be on Wikipedia. You're right, it's not a web directory, and the network isn't that much different from other hosting services. However, I agree with those that are against Alexa being a guideline. If most major anti-spyware vendors will remove Alexa upon detection, I would tend to think this makes the results produced by Alexa a little biased. Biased towards those who aren't tech-savvy enough to know what it is to start with, and not even smart enough to run some kind of anti-spyware check. Regardless, <b>delete</b> this. If y'all feel so strongly that it's not "encyclopedic enough", then get rid of it. - Arobar 03:22, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> Why not, there is tons of things on this site that have little relevance to anyone but stay on ... this server is relavnt to its hostees and the hundreds of people who browse their sites. That has to be more people then an article about say "The Burial Topography and effect on social memory in bronze age wales" would recieve. I.</li>

<p>A woobie is a blanket. The term is most frequently used to refer to a child's blanket as a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transference.html" title="Transference">transference</a> object.

I will leave a message for the nominator to see if s/he will agree to a protected redirect. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 23:10, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a> says not to redirect during the discussion. However, in practice, some people redirect right away to reduce the load on AfD and others think that it should wait until the nomination has run its full course. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 03:01, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b>: I'm voting to redirect it (instead of deleting it). How do you close it early (on consensus)?<a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7ESceptre_44d8.html" title="User:Sceptre">Sceptre</a> 08:39, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I don't know how much this counts for, but unfortunately the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html#Non-Administrators_closing_discussions" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">Wikipedia guidelines</a> state very clearly that "<i>Non-administrators should not close discussions in which they have been involved</i>", among other things. I don't think it'd be a big problem if you <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html#Non-Administrators_closing_discussions" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">closed it out</a>, but there are probably some admins around who are sticklers for the Rules. —<span class="horsepunchkid"><a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorsePunchKid_a248.html" title="User:HorsePunchKid"><span style="font-family: monospace; font-variant: small-caps;">HorsePunchKid</span></a>→<a href="../../../h/o/r/User_talk%7EHorsePunchKid_fa6d.html" title="User talk:HorsePunchKid"><span style="color: #070;">龜</span></a></span> 18:23, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It appears to say that they can close near-unaminous AfD discussions apart from "delete" as well, and I can count 5 redirects + 2 votes for reverting to the redirect, and one asking for a redirect (8) against 1 for delete, so it appears to be a supermajority for redirection. I'll close the discussion, but I'll accept admin intervention (It's the first time for me with AfD) <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7ESceptre_44d8.html" title="User:Sceptre">Sceptre</a> 11:10, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
