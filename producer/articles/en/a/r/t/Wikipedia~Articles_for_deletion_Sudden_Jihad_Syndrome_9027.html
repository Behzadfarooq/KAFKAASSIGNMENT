<p>This is an obscure coinage that hardly warrants its own article. Moreover, the article's author has created a long list of people suffering from this "Syndrome," most of whom have not been linked to the term in any reliable source--in short, it smacks of original research. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 06:25, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Only the single article uses the term, and only in passing (more as a bit of flavor than truly as a strong indicator of the acceptance of the term). Even the Globe article which does use the term mentions only 3 of the people found in the list. Especially when labeling people with such things as this purported syndrome, the <b>sources have to come <i>first</i></b>. More importantly, no name should appear in any list without a specific reference using the term. I've removed the list items that have no sources whatsoever, but without verification of the use of this term, none of the other items should stay either. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 07:19, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless proof is furnished that this is more than just a term coined by Pipes (the Globe article is a good start, but as Jonel points out, none of the other references use it). Additionally, even then we'll need to be careful in ascribing motives to people - Talovic's article as currently written contains a fair level of doubt about any religious motivation in his actions, for example. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 07:30, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Well referenced. As the Boston Globe writes, <i>"After all, Haq is not the first example of what scholar Daniel Pipes has called ``Sudden Jihad Syndrome," in which a seemingly nonviolent Muslim erupts in a murderous rampage."</i> I find the article very pertinent. As long as it remains strictly sourced I see no legitimate grounds for deleting it. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 15:45, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well sourced??? Of the five external links, four don't mention "Sudden Jihad Syndrome" at all, while the other merely references Pipes' coining of the term. Indeed, two of the killings in the references make no reference whatsoever to political association. If this is well sourced, I could write a similar article about left-handed killers and call it "Sudden Sinister Syndrome", and it'd be just as worthy. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR">EliminatorJR</a> 16:07, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Would you even find one source indicating a propensity for left handed people to erupt in violence? I think not. But militant Islam does seem to have this tendency.

<li><b>Comment</b> But that is not what this AfD is about - it is about the phrase "Sudden Jihad Syndrome". It is *that* which needs to be sourced.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree that this is an example of prejudice, but it's not original research for Wikipedia to report that prejudice exists in the world. Pipes's foray into bigotry seems to have attracted something of a following (not surprising, given the current Islamophobic mood) and so is notable. The article must be NPOV, however. As others have noted, the <i>Globe</i> citation isn't to a <i>Globe</i> article that uses the term, as if a journalist found it a helpful way to describe the world. Instead, it's a column by the right-winger <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Jacoby_c465.html" title="Jeff Jacoby">Jeff Jacoby</a>, who merely cited Pipes. This should be corrected. The article should also be balanced by the inclusion of criticism, but I can't find much, although there's a good savaging by a blogger: "When airhead heiress Lizzie Grubman drove her SUV into a crowd in 2001, injuring almost twice as many people as Taheria-azar, then attempted to flee the scene while showing no concern for her victims, nobody started blathering about 'Sudden Rich White Asshole Syndrome'." (from <a href="http://www.leanleft.com/archives/2006/03/15/5313/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.leanleft.com/archives/2006/03/15/5313/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> - he even linked to our <a href="../../../l/i/z/Lizzie_Grubman_527a.html" title="Lizzie Grubman">Lizzie Grubman</a> article) The problem seems to be that most sensible commentators consider Pipes's silliness to be self-evident and not worth remarking upon. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 09:11, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't quite follow the reasoning here. I would've thought that if the wider community (or "most sensible commentators") haven't touched Pipes' term, that would be a reason <i>against</i> giving it its own article - perhaps a reason for adding it into Pipes' own article, in the manner in which other turns of phrase peculiar to certain commentators are to be found in their articles. If Pipes is the only person who uses the term to any serious extent, and if the best we can do outside of his work is to find an article which links back to him and him alone, then we're dealing with someone inventing a term which has little or no currency, aren't we? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 09:30, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Sensible commentators haven't touched it, but there are 60,000+ hits from the likes of <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Green_Footballs_498d.html" title="Little Green Footballs">Little Green Footballs</a> and other sloughs of irrationality. Generally, a blog doesn't meet the standards of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> as a source for a fact -- but a fact about blogs, such as that many blogs use a term, can be considered when we try to adjudicate notabiliity. In addition, there are at least a couple uses that are neither Pipes himself nor right-wing blogs, e.g. <a href="http://www.investors.com/editorial/editorialcontent.asp?secid=1501&amp;status=article&amp;id=256521423294106" class="external text" title="http://www.investors.com/editorial/editorialcontent.asp?secid=1501&amp;status=article&amp;id=256521423294106" rel="nofollow">Investor's Business Daily</a>. My bottom line is that the term is out there enough that someone might see it, be unsure whether it's a real "Syndrome" or just some Islamophobe's rhetorical device, and come to Wikipedia seeking enlightenment. This article presents uses by Pipes and others and now includes a criticism that I added. It will therefore enlighten that hypothetical reader more than would a redirect to <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Pipes_f5d3.html" title="Daniel Pipes">Daniel Pipes</a>; the latter article couldn't readily accommodate all this detail. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 20:39, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The term is a phrase which if I recall correctly was coined by <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Pipes_f5d3.html" title="Daniel Pipes">Daniel Pipes</a> to refer to the phenomenon of sudden violent acts by formely perceived to be mild mannerd Muslim individuals such as <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammed_Reza_Taheri-azar_c453.html" title="Mohammed Reza Taheri-azar">Mohammed Reza Taheri-azar</a> and more recently <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sulejman_Talovi%C4%87_2083.html" title="Sulejman Talović">Sulejman Talović</a>. The phrase has nothing to do with racism or prejudice but simply describes a noticeable social phonemena which has every indication of being religiously motivated. As an encyclopedia we ought to provide an article to cover this important topic.Daniel Pipes describes Sudden Jihad Syndrome <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/article/3450" class="external text" title="http://www.danielpipes.org/article/3450" rel="nofollow">here</a>.--<a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">CltFn</a> 05:51, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There will be some that insist that the word is not notable and others who say it is, but looking beyond this we ought to ask ourselves, that if a readers comes accross the term in the internet, which they inevitably will if they read any anti-jihad blogs and which to find out what it means by searching Wikipedia, they ought to find an article that explains what it means.

<dd>You're going to hate me for saying this, but yes and no. Yes, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and thus should contain lots of useful information for anyone who wants to look. However, no it should not contain <i>everything</i> in the world. Where <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">our standards</a> are concerned, it just doesn't seem to measure up. Don't worry, though, since it's equal opportunity discrimination - a term used by the political Left requires just as much sourcing and notability to be kept. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 21:51, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The article in which Pipes uses the term for the first time is not an independent source (and, if the numbers are true, ... very depressing as to the state of mind of the United States public). The term is is, however, addressed more non-trivially in a few other sources. However, I think this does deserve a mention in the biographical article.
