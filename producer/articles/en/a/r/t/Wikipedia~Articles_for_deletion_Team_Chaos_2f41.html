<dd><b>Merge will not work</b> because the resulting article would then be self-contradictory and would be utterly confusing. Let me give you an example: the Total Chaos article talks about using the undo button and capturing creatures but those features don't even exist in Chaos: Wizard War I. Every game produced by Team Chaos has its own unique features, flaws, quirks, monsters, spells, method of customisation and so on. Merging just won't work because the subjects of the articles are different. GreatGianaSister 06:45, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> the article needs work, and that's for sure. But don't delete it, it's too much to Merge, and seems to big to condense well after reading swiftly through it. I'm wanting to see some more <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> though, and some footnotes would be nice. <a href="../../../k/o/p/User%7EKopf1988_0e1d.html" title="User:Kopf1988">Kopf1988</a> 03:57, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Every article on wikipedia needs improvement, including this one. So improve it! I find it totally hilarious that Marasmusine has lost his temper and proposed to delete the article when Team Chaos just released a major new game at Christmastime, is mentioned on various Amiga news sites in the last 90 days and Team Chaos is in this month's issue of Amiga Future Magazine which currently seems to be winning the "Best Amiga Magazine" poll on Amiga.org. Smooth move Marasmusine. GreatGianaSister 06:45, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>My proposal is a merge, not a delete; since you wouldn't allow the merge proposal tag to stay up for even a day (along with other maintaince tags and even this CfD tag), that's why I've brought it to Articles for Discussion.</dd>
<dd>Let me make my proposal again; the entirity of the Team Chaos page talks about the <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Chaos_2f18.html" title="Total Chaos">Total Chaos</a> series of games (and provides no references for Team Chaos themselves). Why not merge that information into the Total Chaos article? It's not uncommon to have a single page represent a series of games; <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/Sangokushi.html" title="Sangokushi">Sangokushi</a></i> for example. The Team Chaos article shows that the games have the same basic gameplay, but with each iteration improving on the graphics and features, so should be resonably easy to set up (especially if the 'Rules of the game' section is trimmed down.) <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarasmusine_675c.html" title="User:Marasmusine">Marasmusine</a> 07:40, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Naturally, if there is a magazine article on Team Chaos then that needs to be linked on the page (despite all my 'smooth moves', I'm not psychic.) <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarasmusine_675c.html" title="User:Marasmusine">Marasmusine</a> 07:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> This should never have been listed for delection. User is holding a grudge. Merge is inappropriate and would produce mass incongruity. SuperfrogJumps 09:08, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> and redirect per nom. There is no real need for this article when the parent article not only exists but would be significantly improved by the inclusion of content from this one. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 10:46, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Because the nominator is confused. Next subject: The merge idea is stupid because Chaos: Return of the Wizards has different rules than Total Chaos which also has different rules from Chaos: WWII which also has different rules from the next game they make. StoneGiant 12:00, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well when the bulk of the article is a table that says 'The entire Total Chaos series', with each successive game having 'significant new features' over the last, and there's a paragraph that even outlines the common gameplay it's pretty easy to see how I might have got 'confused' over thinking that the Total Chaos series was a series of similar computer games. I'll also note that all the independent references only refer to <i>Total Chaos: Battle at the Frontier of Time</i>; There's nothing about any of the other games (Unless that Retro Gamer review is one of the other Total Chaos games), or about Team Chaos themselves. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarasmusine_675c.html" title="User:Marasmusine">Marasmusine</a> 14:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - A redirect with a couple of merged facts is probably warranted though. All of the secondary material available is about Total Chaos, there's not much about Team Chaos itself.

<dd>I don't have any problem with the archived interview. I've arranged the external links into subject (and removed the dead link to the 'home page' and the google search results link.) There's plenty of reference there suitable for the <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Chaos_2f18.html" title="Total Chaos">Total Chaos</a> page, but still not much to justify a seperate Team Chaos article. I'm not sure about the notability of the references.</dd>
<dd>I've also raised an issue on <a href="../../../t/o/t/Talk%7ETotal_Chaos_b4d9.html" title="Talk:Total Chaos">Talk:Total Chaos</a>; if that page not ment to represent the whole series of games (and not just one game) why does the infobox show release dates from 1986 to the present (and the opening sentence confirms this)? THankyou for any clarification. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarasmusine_675c.html" title="User:Marasmusine">Marasmusine</a> 08:04, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Chaos_2f18.html" title="Total Chaos">Total Chaos</a> article is meant to be about the Total Chaos series of games <b>only</b>. It is <b>not</b> meant to be about Chaos: Wizard War II (which I noticed you deleted the link out of the article) nor is it meant to be about Chaos: Return of the Wizards. The problem is that if we cram in those extra games then it sounds simple and easy doesn't it? But then ... you come to realize that the whole article then needs to be rewritten with lots of IF-THEN statements or other form of comments mucking up the article such as "This paragraph does not apply to Chaos: Wizard War II" or "blahblahblah except in Chaos: Wizard War II in which case yadayadayada". I sure as hell am not going to try to go through and fix all that, if it is even possible. StoneGiant 12:03, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, that's right, I'm have an interest in the original <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos_%28video_game%29.html" title="Chaos (video game)">Chaos</a></i> and wrote a remake of it. I also have an interest in Total Chaos as a result (although you deny the games have anything to do with each other "false statements he sneaked into the article" were your words when I added the <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos_%28video_game%29.html" title="Chaos (video game)">Chaos</a></i> references.)</dd>
<dd>I think anyone looking at my all my edits to that article will see that I've had an interest in editing the article for clarity, neutrality and adherance to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarasmusine_675c.html" title="User:Marasmusine">Marasmusine</a> 15:47, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, the continuous hostility I've had since I first put up the merge proposal <i>is</i> beginning to wear me out a bit. I'd just ask you to read <a href="../../../e/t/i/Wikipedia%7EEtiquette_76f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Etiquette">Wikipedia:Etiquette</a>, thanks. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarasmusine_675c.html" title="User:Marasmusine">Marasmusine</a> 16:39, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Marasmusine is a Wikiterrorist. He is also what is referred to as a "BS Artist". I predict he will never stop trying to talk his way out of his vandalism. I change my vote to:</li>
<li><b>Keep, protect article from deletion for 1 year, disable User:Marasmusine account permanently</b> and court-martial him for conduct unbecoming a Wikipedia author. If Wikipedia has any professional standards at all it will make an example out of Marasmusine's sneaky vandalism. GreatGianaSister 02:14, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The above is very hard to sort out with the warring going on, I'll have a go. If I haven't summarised someone's contribution, it's because I believe the person's original comment spoke for itself.</dd>

<ul>
<li>Marasmusine - Merge or Delete - per WP:ATT (no independent references) and possibly WP:N. Seems to have originally favoured a merge per <a href="../../../t/o/t/Talk%7ETotal_Chaos_b4d9.html#Merge_with_Team_Chaos" title="Talk:Total Chaos">this discussion</a>, but the merge tag was removed several times (correct me if I'm wrong), so it was brought here.</li>
<li>Superfrog - Keep</li>
<li>GreatGianaSister - Keep - "Every article on wikipedia needs improvement, including this one. So improve it!" Argues against merge as every game Team Chaos produces is different and the resulting article may be contradictory.</li>
<li>jossi - Merge/redir</li>
<li>Kopf1988 - Weak Keep</li>
<li>Orderinchaos78 - Merge/redir</li>
<li>Tellyaddict - Delete</li>
<li>Wickethewok - Delete</li>
<li>Realkyhick - Delete</li>
<li>EliminatorJR - Delete</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Based on the above the consensus appears to be delete on the grounds of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attributability</a> (which replaces <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>), two key Wikipedia policies. Several of the points and discussion areas above defending the article's continued existence seem to concern areas which wander into original research, cannot be verified by any means against independent secondary sources, or <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">what Wikipedia is not</a>. Interviews with the creator or link lists don't actually satisfy the requirements. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 10:37, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
