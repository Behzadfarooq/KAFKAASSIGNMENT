<li>Reading the first debate, I'm leaning towards delete. The concerns were not addressed. Some had an <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> stance, some wanted to keep the article because "WP:WEB is not policy, so it has no relevance".

<li><b>Keep</b> Firstly, WP:Web is not policy. It is inadmissible to delete something because of guidelines. What policy does it fail to meet? Secondly, this is not a vote; it is a debate.

<li>It's still an official guideline that carries weight in these discussions. If there was no such guideline a lot of confusion would exist whether a website is notable or not. This guideline makes it possible to say "XXX is not notable", and applies in this case.

<li>Given that the article was kept after the last AfD, and there is no policy reason whatsoever to delete it, the onus is on the proposers to find a valid reason for deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Those recommending to keep are correct in stating <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is not a <i>policy</i>. However, it is still a <i>guideline</i>, which does carry more weight in an AfD discussion than a generalized statement calling for its ignoring. To quote <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, the main notability guideline: <i>It is generally accepted among editors and is considered a standard that all users should follow.</i> Likewise, <i>One notability criterion shared by nearly all of the subject-specific notability guidelines, as well as Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not, is the criterion that a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself.</i> Look at other AfDs: a majority of the decision to keep and delete is based on such notability guidelines; while not policy, they provide an accepted barometer for whether a site is reasonably covered in third-party sources to be included herein. Any reasonable administrator will ignore, rightfully so, recommendations which simply state <i><a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is not policy, so it doesn't matter</i>, as they come off as <i>well, the guideline doesn't work for us, so let's give ourselves a free pass here</i>. Rather than simply stating that obvious truth, those recommending to keep are advised to find <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> indicating if and how the notability guidelines are met. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 16:59, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The arguments were laid out at length last time and there was a clear decision to keep. Obviously the closing admin thought that whatever the status of WP:WEB, the arguments amounted to a case to keep. Nothing has changed since then. Incidentally, I hope that Michaelas10 will withdraw his claim that WP:WEB is policy.--<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHoldenhurst_0f7e.html" title="User:Holdenhurst">Holdenhurst</a> 23:00, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please read the above explanation by <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a>. Even if <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is not a policy (a guideline but still), it is often used to show notability or non-notability on Wikipedia's deletion process, and saying that this article should be kept because it isn't a policy is not a valid arguement. Instead, try to find something to help you prove that this website might pass one of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>'s criteria, but until then there is no reason for this to be kept. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 23:08, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keepish Comment.</b> I don't have a passionate interest in this in any direction. But it seems to me that two things have happened: one is that, the first time this article was nominated for deletion, the final decision was to keep the article in Wikipedia; the other, which <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxwoman_c5ae.html" title="User:Taxwoman">Taxwoman</a> has pointed out, is that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> has been specifically demoted from policy to a guideline. I don't track the Wipipedia website; but it seems to me that such a website, in the half year or so that has passed since this article first survived a deletion nomination, would have <i>grown</i>, not shrunk, in whatever worthiness it had to be mentioned in its own Wikipedia article. I'm too busy right now to keep on following this discussion in detail; but I offer these points for consideration. Also, maybe Wikipedia should have a double-jeopardy policy or guideline about AfD. — <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreslethe_e6c4.html" title="User:Preslethe">President Lethe</a> 02:43, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes well the closing admin might have done a mistake last time when this was kept, therefore it was nominated again.

<li><b><s>Keep</s></b> did we not have this same argument six months ago and the result was a keep? The wipipedia is a serious attempt at a BDSM wiki, content sourced from it is now being used in wikipedia articles it and is linked to by many more, is now in the ALexa top 100,000 websites.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Many articles are listed, relisted, and listed again at AfD; most of these are good-faith attempts to benefit the project, and this appears to be one of those cases. To say that <i>it was kept once already, so it should be kept again</i> is circular logic: if indeed the article should be kept this time as well, there should be valid arguments to that point, rather than the simple fact that it did survive a previous attempt for <i>x</i> reason. Establishing a consensus, and reaffirming that consensus, hardly constitutes double jeopardy; the quality of the article can change over time, facts about the subject of the article can change over time, and so on, and comparing the article then to the article now may ultimately be comparing apples and oranges, rather than (to continue the example) "trying the same article twice". Regardless, bear in mind that double jeopardy or anything to that effect is not a policy, nor is it a guideline. Notability, however, is a guideline, and regardless of the outcome of the first AfD and/or the reason the original administrator closed it as a keep, the article should be able to (but as far as I can see, does not) stand on its own merits... and I will repeat myself: those recommending to keep are advised to find <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> indicating if and how the notability guidelines are met. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 18:55, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> One of the test for notability is that the contenst should be republished. The wipipedia is republished in its entirity on Informed Consent. Informed Consent (according to Alexa) is the UKs largest (non porn) BDSM website. Informed Consent is a non trivial website dealing with issues relevent to the subject of BDSM. Within the world of alternative sexuality Informed Consent is as serious as it gets (BTW this is kinky sex we are talking about, the wipipedia is never going to be repubished in Nature!). <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 21:33, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>You provided the same arguement in the last debate. Again, it is not an <i>online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster</i> nor it is very popular (its Alexa rank is 14,686). Besides, the most of the content there is taken from Wikipedia, rather than Wipipedia. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 21:45, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What is wrong with that. In my opinion IC is a notable site, for a webbsite to be in the top 15,000 worldwide would give it the same reach as a regional newapaper's website. That is a popular site by any definition. Again, this is a specialist field, many specialist scientific sites would not get into the top 250,000 that does not make them not notable. You have also not given any specific reasons why you think it is not notable nor have you offered examples of what you would consider notable sites in the field of BDSM. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 22:35, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am still not sure why you consider that IC is not an online magazine, it published articles and listings, it provides a non trivial forum (yes, there are also trivial posts as well!) for discussion of the subject matter of BDSM. This meets my definition of a magazine. I am not sure what do you mean by <i>labeled as official</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> There are two issues. One is the notability of the site. This was established in the last AfD, and nobody has provided any evidence that it has become less notable since. The other is the overall good of Wikipedia. Even if a case could be made for deleting the article, this would damage Wipipedia, and therefore Wikipedia which increasingly is getting content from Wipipedia rather than vice versa. And if the zealous application of the letter of the law would damage Wikipedia, then it is our duty to apply <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> and keep the article.--<a href="../../../o/s/i/User%7EOsidge_c9f6.html" title="User:Osidge">Osidge</a> 21:55, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

We don't keep it articles because deleting them might damage their subject, and the fact that Wikipedia takes content from Wipipedia is ridiculous and has nothing to do with this AfD. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 22:07, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I disagree, notability was established, hence the keep result. No arguments were given as to why IC (the basis for passing the test) was not notable apart from unsupported assertions that it was not. The people making the assertions appeared to have little knowledge of the BDSM scene (correct me if I am wrong)and therefore are not best placed to give an informed opinion on the subject. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalzacLFS_7be7.html" title="User:BalzacLFS">BalzacLFS</a> 11:46, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I can't help but feel that we are going around in circles with this argument. I maintain that the site is notable for reasons already stated and you maintain that for reasons already stated it is not&#160;:-). The problem I feel is due in a large part to the subject matter, BDSM is never going to have sources of sufficient gravitas to satisfy the purists. This is because it is a sexual activity that many people feel is wrong and whose practices would fall foul of every health and safety code going. Personally I think that many of the current articles about BDSM should not be on the Wikipedia as the website is used by minors (but this is a separate argument). Within the BDSM community the Wipipedia is published on two of the largest UK BDSM websites and has supplied content for the Wikipedia. The article on the Wipipedia is not very good but I am sure it will be improved. In the end someone will have to make a call as to if the article is adding value to the Wikipedia or not. P.S.

It is, apparently, referenced by several sites devoted to the same subject matter, albeit one with a minority following. Although with the number of politiicans and public figures who keep getting exposed as having related interests, perhaps the minority is larger than many think. Anyway, there deserves to be an article on this wiki. As for whether this article is good enough to keep, that's another thing altogehter.
