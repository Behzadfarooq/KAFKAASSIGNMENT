<p>Gundruk is dry, fermented leaves and vegetables, used mostly to prepare an acerbic, brownish soup. This traditional method of preserving vegetables is widely followed in the Himalayan region, though Gundruk, it appears, is typically a Gorkha indigenous food, found mostly in Nepal, Sikkim, Darjeeling in West Bengal, and other Gorkha-dominant areas. The fermentation process itself depends on bacteria, particularly Lactobacillus and Pediococcus found naturally, which produce lactic acid and acetic acid from the raw vegetable matter. Leaves or radish pieces are withered and fermented in vats for some times. When fermented fullly, they are taken out and dried. The dried leaves produce Gundruk while the dried, fermented radish pieces comprise Sinki. These can be stored indefinitely. When cooking, they are first soaked in water, then sauteed with onions, garlic and tomatoes before water is added to produce a watery soup. The soup is believed to have medicinal value. Possibly the fibre and acid contents help bowel movement.</p>

<p>A combination of an interactive marketing tool with a TV-commercial. The viewer of the TV-commercial is stimulated (for instance via a tag-on to that commercial) to get more engaged in the storyline of the commercial by playing an online game. The online game offers the player the possibility to change the path of the storyline and find an alternative final to the commercial. The gamecommercial is not a TV-commercial, nor an online game, but the combination of the two. The word was used for the first time in 2006 in The Netherlands by interactive marketing agency Tribal DDB Amsterdam, that titled the product they created for insurance company Centraal Beheer Achmea "gamecommercial". <a href="http://www.molblog.nl/crossmedia/2813" class="external free" title="http://www.molblog.nl/crossmedia/2813" rel="nofollow">http://www.molblog.nl/crossmedia/2813</a></p>

<p>Isara is a charity organization located in Nong Khai, Thailand. It was started in 2002 by an American, Patrick Kirk Gillock, who hoped to make a difference in the lives of the less fortunate. In late 2005, after friends and family had given all the donations they could give, Kirk decided to rethink the "charity model" and decided to switch to a "business model" to help fund future charity projects.</p>
<p>Kirk used his background in web design to create the first non-profit website portal, <a href="http://www.isara.com" class="external free" title="http://www.isara.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.isara.com</a> . Much like other websites, money is generated from advertising. The more visits Isara receives the more funds for its various charity projects. But, what makes Isara different, is that nobody is getting rich from this idea. 100% of all funds generated go to fund the charity projects. Isara.com is similar to other web portals, it has a search engine, shopping (but guilt-free), and a forum that will make you smile with each visit. It is a website where your visits and clicks can make a difference.</p>
<p>Originally focusing on the less fortunate in Thailand, Isara (which means "freedom" in Thai) quickly grew and has now expanded into Nepal and Vietnam. Isara charity projects focus mainly on education and health issues. They have helped build schools, provide motorcycle helmets to nearly one thousand students, and school supplies to orphans in Thailand, Vietnam, and Nepal. Their main goal is to expand into Africa.</p>

<p>A combination of an interactive marketing tool with a TV-commercial. The viewer of the TV-commercial is stimulated (for instance via a tag-on to that commercial) to get more engaged in the storyline of the commercial by playing an online game. The online game offers the player the possibility to change the path of the storyline and find an alternative final to the commercial. The gamecommercial is not a TV-commercial, nor an online game, but the combination of the two. The word was used for the first time in 2006 in The Netherlands by interactive marketing agency Tribal DDB Amsterdam, that titled the product they created for insurance company Centraal Beheer Achmea "gamecommercial".</p>

<p>The MetroCircus Also known as a "Nemitz Ring-City", is an improvement on the O’Neill space city concept first developed by Gerard K. O’Neill. The MetroCircus design offers incremental growth and development of space city systems, allowing a learning curve towards building full-fledged O’Neill space cities.</p>
<p>A MetroCircus is a moving train on a circular track. It has no front or back, it’s a seamless circle, or a circular track full of cars. The train may use wheels on the track or be a mag-lev system. The MetroCircus is inside a 1 kilometer diameter circular trench or tunnel in an asteroid, moon, or small planet. A train track is placed on the outer wall of the trench or tunnel. The MetroCircus runs on the track, producing simulated gravity by centripetal force.</p>
<p>One main advantage of this design is that the moving structure does not include the radiation shielding mass. This enables far less massive structures and enables the early development of large-scale habitable structures with simulated gravity in space.</p>
<p>The construction method can vary, from multiple cars to a welded construction for a completely solid circle. The hull could be up to several inches thick and made of nickel-iron, or even solid Platinum Group Metals. One kilometer in diameter is large enough to reduce or eliminate debilitating coriolis effects. A one-kilometer MetroCircus would run at about 150 kph to simulate 0.40 gravity.</p>
<p>To get on and off the moving city, another track runs alongside. A ‘commuter bus’ accellerates to match speed with the city, then workers and materials are transferred.</p>

<p><b>Claire Tonti-Filippini</b></p>
<p><b>Born:</b> 5/6/1967</p>
<p><b>Marital Status</b> Single, no kids, one fish named oscar</p>
<p><b>Occupation</b> Varied, has included Wig Maker, Bank Teller, Lunch Lady, Tennis Coach, Dog Trainer, Salesperson (for Gibsware and Gibsware related products), Nightclub Security and Socialite</p>
<p>Ms Tonti-Filippini was born to a wealthy couple by the names of Don Tonti-Filippini and Mavis Thompson. Despite being born without the ability to walk sideways Claire began her early years as a happy go lucky child under the care of her loving mom and dad. Often teased for not being able to walk sideways and called the "reverse crab" by her classmates Claire still managed to earn her first $15,000 by the age of 15 through collecting hair from hairdressers and making wigs for the homeless. She came under much critism from her peers at the age of 20 for apparently exploiting the homeless and decided this was a good a time as any to start a new venture and enter a new period in her life.</p>
<p>Discovering that she had a knack for counting (this came about through counting the individual hairs required for making a wig) Claire decided to try her hand at bank telling. Working at Boston Savers she began her new position the same week she moved out of her parents home. She quickly progressed up the ranks and took on the position of bank manager by the age of 24. Her underhanded way of taunting and manipulating the people around her made her branch become extremely successful and she was offered a promotion and the title of regional manager. However she was never to take on this position as she was kicked by two of the teller working under her on the same day four hours apart and recieved a skull fracture 9 inches long. Claire could have avoided these hits if she had have mastered the ability to walk sideways.</p>
<p>Disheartened by the events at her workplace she again decided to change her occupation. She went through a number of jobs in a number of years (mentioned above) but was unable to find something that counld sufficiently encorporate her love of counting and not require any sideways walking. Claire "the reverse crab" Tonti-Filippini began to lose hope until a fatefull day some ten years ago. Little did she know that she had abilities she was not aware of. And so it was, that she earned her first million in 4 months using her new found talents and is today regarded as the greatest professional in her field.</p>

<p>The Isaac Lee Patterson Memorial Bridge, completed in 1932, spans the Rogue River, about a half-mile from the ocean, connecting Gold Beach with Wedderburn. When completed, the 1,932 foot span was the longest bridge between San Francisco and the Columbia River. A beautiful example of Conde McCullough's design style, the concrete span of several graceful arches was recently refurbished and re-lighted. The Bridge was named after Isaac Lee Patterson, governor of Oregon from 1926 to 1929.</p>

<p><b>The Yard Dogs Road Show</b> is a thirteen-member travelling cabaret that features a unique blend of performances, including vaudeville, burlesque, stage magic, sideshow oddities, and beatnik "hobo poetry." Performances include musical interludes, song and dance numbers, and background music from the Yard Dogs cartoon gypsy band, <i>The Golden Wings of Glory</i>. Originally from San Francisco, the Yard Dogs made their first full-fledged national tour in the Spring of 2005, playing 25 shows in 35 days with seven sold-out performances.</p>

<p>The Yard Dogs began in 1998 as a three-piece traveling jug band formed by Yard Dogs founder Eddy Joe Cotton. The jug band started out playing in the road houses and dance halls of the west coast. During this time, band members partook in modern day acid tests with the likes of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. For the next year, the band toured up and down the west coast in a 1967 Ford Galaxy 500. It was on a cold night in 1999 that the band stopped to roll out their sleeping bags off of Interstate 5 at a place called Dog Creek Road that the band found its new name and new calling. Thus the Yard Dogs Road Show was born.</p>
<p><br />
One by one, the band attracted its colorful cast of performers. The band now sports such members as Tobias the Mystic Man (sword-swallower and magician), Guitar Boy (a spandex-sporting "guitar hero"), Hellvis (a musclebound fire-eater), and the Black and Blue Burlesque dancing girls. Founder Eddy Joe Cotton has also performed with <i>They Might be Giants</i> and has been featured on <i>NPR</i>, <i>West Coast Live</i>, and <i>To the Best of Our Knowledge</i>. He is also the author of <i>Hobo - A Young Man’s Thoughts On Trains And Tramping In America,</i> which made it to the Denver Post best seller list.</p>
<p><br />
The Yard Dogs Road Show has performed at venues such as the Knitting Factory in Hollywood and NYC, the Bluebird Theater in Denver, Colorado and the Orpheum Theater in Flagstaff, Arizona. They have collaborated with Teatro Zinzanni, Red Bull, Lucas Films, and New Belgium Brewery, and they participate in annual Native American cultural exchange fesitivals with the Quechan and Mohave tribes.</p>

<p>Lord Woodhouselee, also known as Alexander Tyler, was a Scottish Historian and Professor. He is known to have stated a quote as follows: "A democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the worlds greatest civilizations from the beginning of history, has been about 200 years. During those 200 years, these nations always progressed through the following sequence:</p>
<p>From Bondage to spiritual faith; From spiritual faith to great courage; From courage to liberty; From liberty to abundance; From abundance to complacency; From complacency to apathy; From apathy to dependence; From dependence back into bondage."</p>
<p>This quote has been circulating around the internet after the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election.</p>
<p>Woodhouselee, or Tyler, is known to have written several books in the late 18th Century and early 19th Century.</p>
<p>He is also the father or Patrick Fraser Tyler.</p>

<p>Even before Lissette opened her eyes to this world, she was surrounded by music. Lissette's parents, Olga and Tony (a very popular singing duo from Cuba in the 50's) were touring through Central and South America carrying Lissette everywhere before and after birth. Exposed to the colorful music of Los Andes and the contagious rythms of the Caribbean, she grew up in dressing rooms and television studios and had her very own first hit record in Cuba at the age of five.</p>
<p>To avoid Cuban communist indoctrination in schools, her parents sent Lissette and her sister Olga to the US with a program called Peter Pan, in which Cuban children were placed in differents schools, orphanages and foster homes hoping to be someday reunited with their parents. She experienced a hard life in exile at an early age and accompanied by an old guitar, one of her few possesions, she wrote her first songs.</p>
<p>The sisters reunited in Miami with their family after 3 years and moved to Puerto Rico where her parents were offered to have their own TV show. Lissette started singing at her parent's show and soon she also was offered a contract at Telemundo, Channel 2 to do her own show. Soon after came a recording contract with a local label and a star was born.</p>
<p>Lissette created the "Lissette look," and fashion trends like her hats and boots were worn by the women, as her music was sung by the young and the old and her marriage as a teenager to singing idol Chucho Avellanet was televised paralyzing the country for a day.</p>
<p>Television was always a very important vehicle for Lissette. She conducted her own show through the Telemundo Network, and was awarded prestigious acknowledgements." The Lissette Special" with Michele Legrand (produced by Channel 4 in Miami and "Lissette and Friends" with Melissa Manchester and Liz Torres, (Channel 10,) each winning several Emmy Awards.</p>
<p>Carnegie Hall, Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center, Trop World in Atlantic City, El Centro de Bellas Artes, in San Juan, The James L. Knight and The Jackie Gleason theatres in Miami, Madison Square Garden, NY, the Miami Arena, have been some of the stages where the "showwoman" has received standing ovations from her loyal fans. She also had the leading role in a soap opera called Solamente Tu, and acted in 3 movies. In the classic film Winter Kills with Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins, Lissette sang and wrote the song for her scene.</p>
<p>Lissette has over twenty five albums with countless hits like: Eclipse Total Del Amor, Poema 20, Copacabana, Eva, Mal Sueño, Como Decirte, Apaga la Luz, Fuego, Lo Voy A Dividir, among others, Lissette consistently appeared in the Latin American music charts over the years.</p>
<p>Lissette's most recent work is "Lissette En Vivo," (Lissette Live! ) recorded during her concerts at the Center of Performing Arts in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This double CD album contains the excitement and magic that she projects in every performance.</p>
<p>Her multi-talent, was often imitated by many evolving artists and respected by the music industry throughout her career.</p>

<p>Planed Plant (Children's Planet) and Planed Plant Bach (Small Children's Planet) are both variants of children's television programs CBBC and CBeebies on the BBC. Both programs are shown on the Welsh television channel S4C, founded in 1982, and boast a wide range of programs for Welsh Children.</p>
<p>Originally called "Slot Meithrin" during the early 1990's, both Planed Plant and Planed Plant Bach have broadcast a wide array of popular Welsh television programs such as "Sam Tan" (the origins of "Fireman Sam"), Caffi Sali Mali (based on the popular welsh children's books written by Mary Vaughan Jones) and Rala Rwdins (based on Angharad Thomas' much loved series of books) whilst also showing translations of popular English programs such as "Mona y Fampir" (MONA THE VAMPIRE), Y Tweenies (THE TWEENIES) and Smot (SPOT THE DOG). It has also been the starting block of many popular Welsh presenters' careers such as Rhodri Owen (presenter on the CBBC program "Short Change"), Sarra Elgan (presenter on "The Saturday Show) and Heledd Cynwal (who now presents main stream Welsh television program "Wedi 7").</p>

<p>Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) is a reliable multicast transport protocol. Reliable means in this case that the receiver of a multicast stream can detect if all packets involved in this stream were actually received and which packets were not received. This means PGM cannot guarantee delivery. Instead best-effort delivery and loss-detection are implemented. PGM is an IEEE experimental protocol. As that it is no standard yet.</p>

<p><b>June 3, 1986</b> The Greater Fort Lauderdale Film Festival was founded to introduce independent cinema to a South Florida audience base of more than four-and-a-half million people.</p>
<p>1987 - Festival was named one of seven original Vital Cultural Institutions of the State of Florida by the legislature, the Governor and the Florida Arts Council.</p>

<p>1991 - Festival changes name to Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival. Launches Lifetime Achievement Awards. Honored Peter Bogdanovich, Mark Rydell, Donald O'Connor, Vincent Price, Van Johnson, Jerry Lewis and Burt Reynolds. Presenters included Charles Durning, and Patrick O'Neal. Guests included Claude Atkins, Alan Rickman, and Samuel Z. Arkoff. Entre Nous the support committee for the Film Festival is formed. In February, Fest hosts first reception at LA's American Film Market and its first Cannes Party at The American Pavilion in May. Both parties become annual events.</p>
<p>1992 - Fest presents a special retrospective for honoree Audrey Hepburn, other guests included Jennifer Beals, Alexandre Rockwell, Les Blank and Matthew Harrison. 1992 also marked our first year of screening IMAX film. Other guests that year included Elliot Gould and Edward James Olmos.</p>
<p>1993 - Fest's student film competition went national. Students from Yale, USC, North Carolina, NYU, UCLA, Florida State Univ. and Columbia won awards. An Art On Film documentary series was added to the program list as was an Academy Award Documentary series. Guests included Ashley Judd, Elisabeth Shue and Roger Corman who received the Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>
<p>1994 - Festival exceeded the cash receipts of the '92 and '93 festivals combined. More than 35,000 people attended the event which proved to be a major coup as Tropical Storm Gordon roared in and remained through the first five days of the festival. Regardless, Fest produced more sell-outs than anytime in its short nine year history and presented six U.S. premieres and one world premiere. Special guests included Treat Williams, Shane Black (Lethal Weapon) and Martin Donovan.</p>
<p>1995 - Fest launched the first ever Film Festival in the Sky with Carnival Air Lines (every Lauderdale bound flight included a Festival film).

<p>The 1980 film "Sällskapsresan," which translates from Swedish to "The Conducted Tour," is the first in a series directed by Lasse Åberg. The plot follows a hapless Swede, Stig-Helmer Olsson (Lasse Åberg), and his new Norwegian friend Ole Bramserud (Jon Skolmen), as they vacation in the Canary Islands. They comically struggle with the different culture, interact with the other tourists, and both ultimately find love. Other characters they meet include the newlyweds Mr. and Mrs. Storch; the psychologist Dr. Levander, who tricks Stig-Helmer into smuggling money for him; and the alcoholic duo Berra and Robban, who spend the whole film searching for a legendary place where one can buy 80% proof rum hidden in a wine bottle.</p>
<p>The film series is among the most well-known in Sweden; it pokes fun at Swedish stereotypes while ultimately vindicating them. It is considered a quintessential Swedish classic. Although they were very successful in Sweden, none of the movies were never distributed internationally.</p>

<p>Electric City is a comic strip currently running in "La Brea Living" magazine. The comic strip offers a satirical, sometimes humorous, view on the superhero genre. The heroes are collectively known as the Peacekeepers, residing in the fictional city of Electric City. Thus far, the comic strip has focused more attention on the personal lives of the characters and has yet to create much conflict between the handful of villains that have been introduced. Characters introduced so far include: Snow Bunny, Hula, Electronica, Ice Queen, Keahi, Verve, Psiren, Glass, Icarus, Silverback, Keroptera &amp; Gremln.</p>
<p>The comic strip began its run in May 2005.</p>

<p>Colonel Karuna Amman is the nom de guerre of Vinayagamoorthi Muralitharan (born 1966), the leader of a Sri Lankan government alligned breakaway faction of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) . In March 2004, Karuna organized a split from the main LTTE after saying Tamils of eastern Sri Lanka were being discriminated against by Tamils from the north(mainly due to the caste factor). His group has become a major player in Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict.</p>
<p>Karuna was born in Kiran, a village in the Batticaloa district in eastern Sri Lanka. He joined the LTTE in 1983 and became a top commander in the district he represented. He was once even a bodyguard to Velupillai Prabhakaran, the LTTE chief. In the late 1990s, he helped in the capture of the Elephant Pass army camp in northern Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>In March 2004, Karuna broke away from the mainstream LTTE after he alleged they were ignoring the interests of the eastern Tamil people.He is supposedly fighting on behalf of Eastern Tamils. Most people in the east belong to the Mukkuva community. The Tigers reacted by launching attacks against Karuna's forces, and heavy clashes ensued. His forces were evicted from the district he was in control. He eventually established camps for his followers in areas under Sri Lankan army control.</p>
<p>By 2005, Karuna's force was the main focal point of the LTTE's anger toward the government, as they charged that it was being used by the Sri Lankan military to wage a covert war against them. Many abductions and murders of Tamil civilians were attributed to his group working directly under the guidance of Sri Lankan army officers.The main reason to karuna yo leave the organization was that peabahakaran does not allow a seconed line leadership prompting in his organization.This fact can be justified by the assasination of Mahendrarajah one time deputy leader of the organization,by prabahakaran.colonel karuna was breave enough to understand this truth and the negligence of carders of easturn province by the tamil leadership mainly due to the caste factor.Now he has recended terorist activities and assured to the norwagien peace monitors that eastern tamils are prepared for a negotiated political settlement.</p>

<p>Stringent is a 5 member Christian metal band from Crawfordsville, Indiana. A line from their website best describes them: "Stringent reaches out to those who are outcast and rejected. They reach the lost that the world seems to forget about. Being a Christian is a serious thing, and Stringent proves it both on, and off the stage."</p>
<p>Formed in 2001, Stringent struggled to get on it's feet playing wherever they could set up a mic and an amp. The more they played, the more their sound developed into something more concete. The size of the audiences parralleled the development of their sound. As their fanbase grew, Stringent decided to cut a live self-titled EP so they could get their sound to more worshippers in early 2003. Stringent recorded their debut studio album (In My Remains) in late 2003. Stringent mostly played in Indiana, with a few shows in the Chicago area. They have played with several established bands like Victory Records' Dead To Fall, Blood Runs Cold, Anah Aevia, and With Resistance to name a few.</p>
<p>The lineup has changed several times. The original members of Stringent are Josh Rickard on bass, Levi Denman on guitar, Dave Davenport on drums, and last but not least the screamer Luke Denman on vocals. In 2002, Stringent added Brendan Gleason on backup vocals and Jacob "Bake" Henry on bass; with a new bassist, Josh Rickard gave up his bass for the rythm guitar. In 2003, Josh Rickard made another change to lead guitar and now Matt Newlin is on the rhythm guitar and Kurt Todd is making lots of noise on drums.</p>
<p>In early 2004, Stingent fell to the fate of most "garage bands" and went their seperate ways.</p>

<p>Westboro beach is a beach in the City of Ottawa. It is located by the city's Westboro neighbourhood, beside the Ottawa River parkway and the NCC bikepath. It is easily accesible by bike or footpath. there is no public transit that stops at the beach, so you must get there on your own. The beach cannot usually be accesed by car, however exceptions are made to a club's kayak-towing van, which enters via Lanark Avenue. The beach is large and sandy, and contains a small canteen and eating area on the east side of the beach. The beach will be closed after more than 5mm of rainfall, or when tests indicate more than 200 E-coli bacteria per 100 ml of water. Because of these regulations, the beach is often closed throughout the summer(which does not mean people do not swim there, it just means that no lifeguard supervises the beach). Fishing or motorized boating is not allowed on the beach, but this seems to be regularly ignored. Also, extending from either side of the beach is rocky shoreline where people light fires, do drugs, and drink lots of beer(the evidence is on the ground).Many local kayakers also use the facilities however, holding races, testing boats, or occasionally kayaking downriver from Brittania Beach(subject to the same environmental regulations as wWestboro Beach).</p>
