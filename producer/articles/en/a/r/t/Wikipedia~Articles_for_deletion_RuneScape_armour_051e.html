<p>This is part of a guide on how to play <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a>. The game's article is encyclopaedic. The community is debatably encyclopedic.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> We have very carefully gone through this article and deleted any references as to how to make armours and advice on which armours to use when. Admitedly, this is a struggle, as people do want to put that stuff back in, but I check it regularly (usually at least once a day) and remove the game guide stuff. The article is on its way to being a concise listing and description of the armours available in <i>RuneScape</i> and a brief discussion of what they do. It is no more game guide-ish than the main article, and it is much too long to incorporate back into the main article. Moving it to WikiBooks would be better than deleting it, but I vote strongly for keeping it where it is. <a href="../../../x/e/l/User%7EXela_Yrag_73eb.html" title="User:Xela Yrag">Xela Yrag</a> 20:40, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - A concise listing and description of the armours available in RuneScape, and a brief discussion of what they do, is exactly what should not be on Wikipedia - Wikipedia is not a game strategy guide. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i><b>/</b>/<b>/</b></i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 10:08, 23 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Answer</b> - I disagree. A game strategy guide would tell a player how to obtain the equipment, how much it costs, how much it is worth, and how and when to use it. This article does not do that (except when it is vandalized). It is an encyclopedic description of the equipment available to players when they play the game. Anyone who would use this information as a game strategy guide simply doesn't understand the concept. <a href="../../../x/e/l/User%7EXela_Yrag_73eb.html" title="User:Xela Yrag">Xela Yrag</a> 16:57, 23 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - but telling you what armour is available, and where you get it from is not game strategy information? Because that is all this article contains. The fact it may not be a complete strategy guide doesn't mean it is not a strategy guide. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i><b>/</b>/<b>/</b></i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 12:19, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Answer</b> - no, I don't believe it is. It is a summary of what is awailable. A game guide would have to tell you how, when, where, or why to use it. In other words, a game guide would give advice. This article does not give advice, no matter how hard the vandals try to make it do so. It does not have strategy, such as "players should wear this armour or that armour when fighting this or that monster". That is game guide information, to me. Many articles about many subjects have lists of what is available. For instance, an article about a record producing company might list the artists, but it is not giving advice just by that listing. This article is as encyclopedic as any article about a game can be. If it is deleted, then every article about every game on Wikipedia should be deleted, from the main articles to the sub-articles. I mean MapleStory, Diablo, World of WarCraft, Final Fantasy, all of them. Because this one is more encyclopedic that almost all the rest. <a href="../../../x/e/l/User%7EXela_Yrag_73eb.html" title="User:Xela Yrag">Xela Yrag</a> 15:11, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article is too long to be merged with the main article. The information cannot be summarised.

<dd><b>Reply</b> - because it forms an important extension to the RuneScape series of articles.

<dd>But why are you going after RuneScape first? This series has 45 articles in total, including the Portal and its subpages. StarCraft has at least 200 (218 by my count). I thought there would be bigger fish to fry. Also, quickly reading <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, whilst I do see a rule against game guides, I don't see anything specifically against mentioning items in videogames. <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_armour_2013.html" title="RuneScape armour">RuneScape armour</a> doesn't seem especially game-guidedy either: for example, whilst Barrows armour, its requirements and the effects of different types is mentioned (which I admit is on the borderline), it doesn't tell me what I need to do to get it. I happen to know that the procedure is quite complex and demanding, and that procedure is certainly not mentioned here. I say someone should give it a good going over and cut anything too gameguidey, but certainly not delete the whole article. In fact, i'll have a go at that myself right now. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainVindaloo_b7ba.html" title="User:CaptainVindaloo">CaptainVindaloo</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainVindaloo_30b8.html" title="User talk:CaptainVindaloo">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CaptainVindaloo_0228.html" title="Special:Contributions/CaptainVindaloo">c</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CaptainVindaloo_40b4.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CaptainVindaloo">e</a></sup> 11:14, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Additional note to admin</b> - I agree, please do take into account the reasons for keeping this article. They are well thought out, reasonably argued, and passionate. There is nothing offensive in this article. It is a summary of the armours available in the game of <i>RuneScape</i>. It does not give advice on how to use those armours to "win" the game. It is encyclopedic. Just because this information is not <i>vital</i> does not mean it should be deleted. Wikipedia needs more information, not less. But I strongly believe that if this article is deleted, all articles on games, whether online, sidewalk, board, or other, should be deleted with it. Let's not discriminate against a poor little article about <i>RuneScape</i> just because someone doesn't like or understand the game, or doesn't care for games in general. This article is as encyclopedic as any of the articles about any of those games.

<li>Sarcastic KEEP - <i>Over time (15 hours of battle time), Barrows armours decay to an unusable state. When recovered from the crypts of the brothers, they are fully functional; the description at this point would read, for example, Ahrim's top 100. They degrade in four stages, from 100 to 75, to 50, to 25, to 0, at which point the description would read, for example, Ahrim's top 0. Barrows items do not lose strength as they degrade; however, at 0, they lose all defence bonuses. Degraded Barrows armours can be repaired by Dunstan in Burthorpe, by Bob in Lumbridge, by the smith at the pest control mini-game, or by the Tindel Merchant in Port Khazard. These repairs are rather expensive. The armours can also be repaired in POHs on a repair bench</i> - this is REALLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND SHOULD NOT BE DELETED YOU SILLYHEADS, wikipedia is a vital source for this kind of information as it is a nencyclopedia and encyclopedias should tell us about how you can get your Barrows armors from Bob in Lumbridge. Who could think that this is not encyclopedia information, itis vital to the safety of the world. You might laugh but one day you will need ytour barrows armour, or you will need to know just that <i>Mystic boots are an integral part of the mystic robes set. They are restricted to members, with the blue boots available for purchase in the Magic Guild and the white and black boots only available as monster drops</i>, and then you will be screwed like a rabbit if you don't have this information. -- <a href="../../../z/a/m/User%7EZamaq_b44b.html" title="User:Zamaq">Zamaq</a> 20:39, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> "itis vital to the safety of the world"? I dont think you get the concept of an encyclopedia. It isnt to save the world, just provide information, which this article does. Although you may not find the information useful, it is useful to many people. Its on a notable subject. If you delete all the articles on stuff you dont <i>need</i> in your life, about 99% of WP wouldnt exist. You are not the only person reading this article. Please note that this user that claims to know so much about WP and how we should use it has <b><a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Zamaq&amp;dbname=enwiki_p" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=Zamaq&amp;dbname=enwiki_p" rel="nofollow">less than 10 edits</a></b>, <b>none</b> of which have been to an actual article. - <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Giant_Puffin_fb2f.html" title="User:The Giant Puffin"><font color="orange"><b>• The Giant Puffin •</b></font></a> 13:02, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just to clarify, I did read the article (some of it, anyway).
