<li><b>Keep</b>. <i>Local sporting organizations are notable. Particularly so ones in major towns like this.</i> Add to that the fact that Ballarat is right at the heart of one of the world's major cricketing centres. The BCA is big enough to have hosted international matches (Ballarat played against the touring England team in 1933 - possibly the most infamous cricket tour of all time). Ballarat has hosted full international matches as recently as the 1990s. We're not talking just some small village sports team here... <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>|<sup><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">hello?</a></sup> <a href="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c8/Grutness.jpg/25px-Grutness.jpg" alt="" width="25" height="10" longdesc="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" /></a> 10:08, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There have been many country towns that have hosted international touring matches, however the overseas sides that play these matches are usually not the first XI and the matches are not regarded as Test standard (England sides that play these matches are often always called MCC rather than England to denote that fact). Ballarat has never hosted a Test match. I'm looking at a map of Victoria and I dont understand your comment that Ballarat is "at the heart of one of the world's major cricketing centres" - if it was Ballarat it would standing in the middle of the MCG or SCG and that is physically impossible. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 10:25, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I never said it was a <i>test</i> - I said a <i>full international match</i>. England vs Sri Lanka, ODI, March 9, 1992, Ballarat CA Ground, Ballarat. It was one of the matches at the 1992 World Cup.

<li><b>Delete</b>, concur with Megan. Also, nearly every minor village has at least one sport organization. That doesn't make them notable. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 11:56, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Since there isn't anything interesting to say about the average sport organization, a brief mention in the article on the village itself would suffice. Think of how different your local hockey club might be from my local hockey club - chances are it isn't. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 13:05, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think the chances are that it <i>is</i>. Different date of foundation, different number of members, different frequency of play, different level of success, different age ranges, different male/female ratio, different facilities, different local rivals, different amount of training, different involvement with other local institutions... <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 18:21, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The question is, why does every minor village have to have an article? Unless there is some historical notability for the village, do we need an article for every one of them? <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 04:57, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ballarat is not a minor village. It is the second-largest city in the state of Victoria - a "village" of 90,000 people. And cricket is the major sport of the area.The equivalent in the UK, for instance, would be a sports club of the stature of, say, Leicester City football club. In the US, the equivalent might be whatever the basketball team in a city like Reno or Provo might be. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>|<sup><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">hello?</a></sup> <a href="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c8/Grutness.jpg/25px-Grutness.jpg" alt="" width="25" height="10" longdesc="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" /></a>
