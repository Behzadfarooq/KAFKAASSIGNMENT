<p>Google search showed only 36 actual ghits, many seeming to refer to the article. Topic is controverial, article is unsourced.

<li><b>Delete</b> The article on <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miriam.html" title="Miriam">Miriam</a> could/should certainly refer to the (apparently just one) reference to her as being turned "white as snow." But the rest of this article just seems like Torah or Bible commentary to me, and as such probably violates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Unless the commentary itself is based on a legitimate scholar, and even then, we don't have individual articles for everything <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maimonides.html" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a> wrote about. (for example.) Also, the title itself seems to imply that the most important part of the story of Miriam is that she got struck with a disease. I think that's inherently POV and I agree, controversial. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 18:29, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Merging into the <a href="../../../z/i/p/Zipporah.html" title="Zipporah">Zipporah</a> article would imply the opposite position, that they were the same person.

<li>The article was originally based on the interpretation by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Elliot_Friedman_7cd1.html" title="Richard Elliot Friedman">Richard Elliot Friedman</a> in his books about the old testament. Specifically "Who wrote the Bible?". That can be cited as a source, but I'm not sure of any papers in this area, though I imagine there are some. The later text added and opionions I don't know about.<a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulianonions_8fe0.html" title="User:Julianonions">Codec</a> 07:26, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Friedman is a reputable source, and generally represents the mainstream in the academic community (indeed some of his books are officially required reading - or at the top of official book lists - for theology courses at several well respected universities). You can also find similar views in well respected commentaries (e.g. Peake's) and encyclopedia's (e.g Jewish). Shirahadasha seems to be on a campaign to delete all <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_criticism.html" title="Historical criticism">historical-critical information</a>. It seems to me that Shirahadasha is more interested in pushing a literalist POV than in encyclopedic content - i.e. that this nomination is in bad faith. The title - <b>Snow White Miriam</b> - is the normal title under which literature discussing this section of the Torah (i.e. the one involving Miriam turning snow white as a result of her comment) is found. Google is hardly an appropriate arbiter of what is or isn't the case - if Shirahadasha would care to look in theology libraries in works where this section of the bible is discussed, you will find the title quite frequently. In addition, I should add that the topic is not viewed as controversial in academic circles; in much the same way as the theory of evolution is not controversial in academic circles (and describing it as such would be utterly inaccurate), but some people (e.g. Shirahadasha) may have an issue with it. --<b>User talk:FDuffy</b> 17:14, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Elliot_Friedman_7cd1.html" title="Richard Elliot Friedman">Richard Elliot Friedman</a>, <i>Who Wrote the Bible?</i>, at page 76, does indeed mention, under the heading "Snow-white Miriam," this narrative as reflecting "the depths of the antagonism between the priests who identified with Moses {either as their founder or ancestor) and those who identified with Aaron." It also notes that the story "is usually left out of the sunday-school curriculum." Much else said in the current Wikipedia article remains unsourced and should be deleted unless verification can be provided. Given these circumstances, would recommend <b>merging</b> the sourced material with <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miriam.html" title="Miriam">Miriam</a>, making "Snow-White Miriam" a subset of that article, and presenting Friedman's view (as such) in a subsection on <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_criticism.html" title="Biblical criticism">Biblical criticism</a> perspectives on the story.

If the editor's own responsibility to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">supply sources</a> were complied with, and content kept consistent with the sources supplied, there would be no need for theories about what other editors' motives for fact-checking might be.

<li><b>Keep</b> - It really needs to be sourced better but this is a biblical episode that has been commented on by a number of people is worth keeping. I'd dispute that there are only 36 entries, a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Miriam+snow+white+bible" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Miriam+snow+white+bible" rel="nofollow">slightly different search</a> got 219,000 entries (admittedly a number of them bible verses - but many of them commentary). <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 07:06, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Comment To give an example using a known non-event, a search on brown+jersey+reagan", gets nearly 3 million Google hits, but "brown jersey reagan" gets no hits. The quotes make all the difference, and leaving them out makes the search irrelevant. No-one denies the biblical verse with "white as snow" exists, the question is whether a merge of this episode of Miriam's life into <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miriam.html" title="Miriam">Miriam</a>, and perhaps a redirect, would be adequate. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 03:23, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
