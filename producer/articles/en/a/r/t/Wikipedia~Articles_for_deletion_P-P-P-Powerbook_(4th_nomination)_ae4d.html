<li><b>Delete</b> as nominator. Three previous AfD discussions have focused on notability. I consider that issue settled, and am only concerned about the previously undiscussed verifiability issue, and the associated problems with original research and NPOV as discussed on the talk page. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 18:00, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> none of the named sites make a point of checking their sources. In particular, Zug is humor site, avowedly uninterested in the underlying truth of a good story. We have no assurance that this was not an elaborate hoax played on the Something Awful crowd, and no NPOV evaluation of its impact, if any. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 22:51, 25 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Register_1954.html" title="The Register">The Register</a> doesn't count? Furthermore, hoax or not, its managed to become an example of scamming in general, and has tended to appear w/o the creator of forray's intervention. Places I haven't even expected to see this story come out of the woodwork years after this thing is done. I could expect different out of something that happened very recently, but its a meme that's managed to stick around after 2 years, which is saying something. Though I'll admit I'm a little biased on this matter. This thing is the example for my own threshold of considering an internet meme to be worth an article, but if the register won't do it, I'm not sure what you expect to see out of something that's not <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_kid_473a.html" title="Star Wars kid">Star Wars kid</a>. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 03:06, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

As things stand, it is impossible to write an NOR and NPOV article on this subject because it is not verifiable.

<li>1) The Register story is trivial - it's categorized under the "Wild Wild Web" section, which is The Register's <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/internet/web/" class="external text" title="http://www.theregister.co.uk/internet/web/" rel="nofollow">section for tabloid-style internet news in brief stories with a large dose of lurid sleaze stories</a>. From the current edition, amongst more mainstream brief news stories, there are reports on a sandwich half-eaten by Britney Spears being sold on Ebay; a "Dead Steve Irwin" being sold on Ebay, and various titallating reports with some sex angle.</li>
<li>2) The Independent story does not refer to the P-P-P-Powerbook incident at all.</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> or <b>merge</b>. Previously, I noted that this was one of SA's top 2 or 3 pranks.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Fourth nomination? Sour grapes.

<li>True, but the issue raised in both of those was notability. I would argue that this is notable because even I'd heard of it before it got its article nominated for deletion, and that only happens with so many of these things that draw out supporters (and sometimes rather fanatical cult-like ones, but that is another issue). I, personally, would like to see this stay, but when you're dealing with a policy like <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, it's pretty clear cut. Unless somebody can demonstrates where this has been given non-trivial coverage in a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, then it doesn't much matter what numbered deltion this is, because it's the one where the nomination focuses on this issue and requires that it be addressed by keep voters. "Sour grapes," whatever truth value it has, fails to address <i>any</i> relevant issue. GassyGuy 03:46, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>To those fretting about verifiability:</i> Fine, rephrase as a description of the content. <i>That's</i> verifiable, even if the veracity of that content isn't. I have trouble believing the <i>entire</i> Something Awful community was fooled by a conspiracy involving a poster in Washington State and a cheap barber/cybercafe owner/scammer on the Edgeware Road in London, so I'm not sure why the SA community is being considered as a single source. Other elements could be confirmed by, say, inquiring to Federal Express regarding the package details, which were published. A fanatic could even track down the scammer -- numerous photos of his shop were published; I'm sure he could be found.

<li><b>Comment</b> Can someone explain how this anecdote is an <i>encyclopedically notable</i> internet meme, without lapsing into a definition of internet phenomenon which is hopelessly broad and without resorting to "People say they like it on their blogs and chat forums" (and yes, trivial news coverage too) arguments? In addition to "Someone did something clever" anecdotes, there are cute animal pictures, inspirational saccharine glurge stories, emails and that people shouldn't have sent (showing how comically obnoxious they are) that get sent all around the internet to thousands of people all the time. Is every single cute kitty picture, glurge story, silly email and "I did something clever today" anecdote encyclopedically notable? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:04, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ah, well, people have already discussed the notability and I don't think that's a productive area for discussion (it's too subjective, and always seems to be reduced to a says-I says-you argument). If we can't find any reliable non-trivial (etc. etc.) sources talking about this phenomenon, however, there's really no disputing whether it should be here or not. If there are satisfactory sources, it harms no-one for it to stay (and I'd vote keep). <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font style="color:#DC2163;">Z</font>iggurat</a> 00:28, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> I don't you can dismiss notability as an issue so easily. There is a large section on notability guidelines on Wikipedia which play a major part in afd discussions, and they certainly don't boil down to simple subjective views as you frame it. Just as the "harmless" argument holds no water either, both these arguments blithely ignores the fact that Wikipedia is first and foremost an <u><b>encyclopedia</b></u> and isn't supposed to be a free-for-all dumping ground for any information out there that has trivial sources (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>). Using Wikipedia as a dumping ground in a thousand ways like this does do grevious cumulative harm - to the project's mission and identity as an authoratitive encyclopedia I can find local newspaper reviews for the little kebab shop or the mom and pop diner around the corner - this doesn't make these establishments encyclopedic. And the news media - even internationally prominent news sources are also full of trivial news stories and non-news content which is far from encyclopedia. Take <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=teddy+bear+trout" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=teddy+bear+trout" rel="nofollow">this story about a "killer" teddy bear</a> for instance - 130 media sources (including FOX News, the Washington Post, USA Today, and others outside the US... this far far more coverage than the powerbook stunt will ever get) have published a story about it as shown by google news. The teddy bear has had more practical impact than the powerbook stunt. It's a apparently funny anecdote we can pass on to each other and we can use it to provide a lesson for the kids. Does this make it suitable for an encyclopedia? No, because its trivial ephemera, just like the Powerbook stunt. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 18:00, 30 September 2006 (UTC)
