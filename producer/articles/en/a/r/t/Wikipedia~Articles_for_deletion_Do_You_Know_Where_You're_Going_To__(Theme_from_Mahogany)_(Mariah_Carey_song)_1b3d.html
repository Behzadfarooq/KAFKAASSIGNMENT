<p>Article about a cover of a <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diana_Ross_60d9.html" title="Diana Ross">Diana Ross</a> song. This song was not a hit in any country, and was not given a full release as a single. The article fails to establish any other notablility, and therefor the neccessity for a seperate article is questionable. Not even the orignal song has enough information availabel on it to honestly have its own article (this article was in fact written <i>first</i>, with only passing mention to the more notable original). The original version had a stub article which I have now merged and redirected to <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahogany_%281975_film%29.html" title="Mahogany (1975 film)">Mahogany (1975 film)</a>, where it reads better <i>(well, at least I am trying to redirect it, although <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegaWikipedia_90c1.html" title="User:OmegaWikipedia">OmegaWikipedia</a> seems intent on reverting the redirection, for unexplained reasons).</i> Suggest a redirect for this article to the album, with summarization of article text. If and when someone wants to write <i>one</i> article about the composition and any notable recorded versions of it, and has enough information and established notablility to do so, it can be done. <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 01:54, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Mariah Carey's version of Do You Know Where You're Going To? (Theme from Mahogany) is far from a promotional recording. It was meant to be a full single, but there's a whole story behind it on why it got cancelled due to conflicts with other artists and with record labels. That's notability right there. If you merge or delete the article, thast information that will get lost. One article per song doesnt' look good. And in a prior attempt to merge songs over another article, most people commented that it did not look good <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegaWikipedia_90c1.html" title="User:OmegaWikipedia">OmegaWikipedia</a> 12:56, 30 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Singles get cancelled all the time. A single getting cancelled because of record-label politics does not establish notability. An article on this recording is overkill, a paragraph on an album article is more than enough. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 21:31, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> that this level of coverage is a strength of Wikipedia.
