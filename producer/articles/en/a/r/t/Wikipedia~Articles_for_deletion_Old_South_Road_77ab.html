<p>Non-notable fictional road. While of course Tolkien's works are notable, I fail to see how this particular road from the stories merits its own article. --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:33, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>, on the general ground that we already have a very comprehensive and well-indexed collection of articles on all but the most trivial elements of Tolkien's works. However, I appreciate that policy may change; if so, I think we can expect a _very_ large number of Tolkien AfDs in the immediate future. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 01:40, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, This is only an opinion and I fail to see a reason for deletion. It is mentioned repeately in The Lord of the Rings trillogy and other Tolkien works. If you feel that the <b>longest road</b> in Tolkien's fictional Middle Earth should be deleted, then why not delete places that are not mentioned or visited in Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, like <a href="../../../e/r/y/Eryn_Vorn_80d4.html" title="Eryn Vorn">Eryn Vorn</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrast.html" title="Andrast">Andrast</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoaddawg_1316.html" title="User:Roaddawg">Roaddawg</a> 01:45, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, Not-notable.

<li><b>Delete</b>, and I will vote delete one at a time if every other bit of trivia from LOTR gets nominated. At best this is worth a sentence or two in an article on the Geography of Middle Earth. "We can't delete this piece of trivia on X, because it will open the floodgates" doesn't hold much sway for me.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 05:38, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you're citing precedent, it doesn't hold: some of those rivers have separate articles.

<li>I think this is a very good idea. I would far prefer these sorts of articles than a broken out series of them - those rivers that have their own articles ought to be merged as well, in my humble opinion. It seems like a good compromise between people who insist on having this info on wikipedia and people who insist that it shouldn't comprise dozens of articles.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 22:48, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b>. Size of the article shows that something can be said about it, and all of this is sourceable in Tolkien's writings.

<li><b>Keep</b> As this is really only one of two roads in middle earth (north-south and east-west), there is nothing really to merge it into. In the general spirit of <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">user:Tevildo</a> above, if this is deleted all Tolkien geographical elements must be as well- this is of the same strand of material. I see no AfDs on other geographical items from Tolkien's work (although I checked only those linking out of this article and the two mentioned above, (Eryn Varn, Andrast, etc.)- why is this one the only item listed? It just seems rather pointless to delete information that people will read, as it has obviously generated some interest as per this debate. Not to mention the fact that notability does not have to be established outside of the book itself based on the mulititude of other trivial articles concerning LOTR.

<dd>

<dd>In my opinion (again), arguments of this type are most troubling because they acknowledge how problematic the article is but still suggest keeping it because altering it in any way would unleash some sort of biblically proportioned wave of subsequent AfDs, or at the very least, merges and redirects. Any one article being nominated is, in and of itself, automatically justification to keep them all, in a rather odd bit of circular logic (please note that I'm accusing you of bad faith in any way). Perhaps the LOTR/Tolkien project people should spend some much-needed and appreciated effort consolidating trivia into a truly well-written series of parent article instead of presiding over an endless spinning out of non-notable bits and pieces.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 03:46, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b> It's not clear to me what the ultimate name should be. As I said, Foster treats <i>North Road</i> as the primary name and says that <i>Old South Road</i> only applies to the stretch of it between Tharbad and Bree. Thus equating it with the Greenway. In any event, merging, renaming, or moving don't require an AfD so that discussion can be differed to project or Talk pages. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 07:44, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I added the previously mentioned third-party references to the page.

<dd>I must say, and I'm sure people will disagree, that mentions in "guides to middle earth" and fan-produced publications do not make the topic any more notable. It is still a sub-trivial article than should be merged into something larger. I think by now I need to just accept that there will always be parallel wikipedias for topics that have large computer-based fan followings and just give up on trying to participate in these topics.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 18:46, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Hobgarth summed it up nicely. Multiple sources, which are unfairly trivialized by the above comment. I know that at least one of those books above has an article of its own. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIrongargoyle_444b.html" title="User:Irongargoyle">Irongargoyle</a> 18:52, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would prefer we not give credence to these sources by asking for more specific citations, they are explicitly meant to be concordances that present entries on <i>everything</i> in Tolkien's work and as such do not seem to me to establish notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> Okay <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is a <b>work of fiction</b>. Therefore, there is <b>not</b> going to be any information on how the <b>Old South Road</b> applies to the contemporary world. The point of the article is to show the massive amount of Tolkien's work (stories, places, people, events) that are all connected by this <b>major</b> road. Each of the sources listed above does just that. I have read all of the entries on this page and it seems to me that there are some people who will never be satisfied no matter the justification. Articles such as this one (and this seems to be much more complete and profound than the works I am referring to) exist throughout Wikipedia and are there to enhance the knowledge of an individual about a specific topic. This is <b>an encyclopedia</b>. Everyone holds different interests, and the point of Wikipedia is to provide a place for everyone to gain more knowledge about a specific topic, fictional or non-fiction. --User:Lossoth 01:33, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> to major article about the roads of Middle-Earth, or delete. I'm a Tolkien fan, but this is fancruft. We don't have to describe everything that is mentioned in LotR or his other writings in detail, there are other venues for this. A generic article may be helpful, but that's all that is needed. This is a solution that can be used for many of the Tolkien articles, by the way: if <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culumalda.html" title="Culumalda">Culumalda</a> does need a mention (which is highly debatable in itself), surely it can be done in a larger article on the trees of Middle-Earth? <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:58, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> LOTR fancruft at its worst. Ok, maybe no worst, but pretty low. We don't need these LOTR forks on every bit of minutiae that LOTR fans can think up. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 21:55, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Well it may not be interesting to everyone, but there is obviously a high percentage of people out there who read these articles. Information is boundless and to put as much as possible on wikipedia is definately the way to go. Remember, WIKIPEDIA IS NOT PAPER! --User:Wofford 23:00, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
