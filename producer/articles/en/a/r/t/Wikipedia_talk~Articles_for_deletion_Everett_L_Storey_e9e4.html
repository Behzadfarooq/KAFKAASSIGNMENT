<li>whatever it is that you all intend to do ... at least allow Dr Everett Lafayette Storey 1914-1988 a mention in your esteemed wikipedia&#160;? You cannot rob him of his invention ( Cellfood ) which is as real as wikipedia itself&#160;! I am from Malaysia and I find your attempts to scramble for deletion of Dr Storey and / or his Cellfood from being mentioned herein as paranoid&#160;!@#$$%^? What gives ... my friends&#160;? There is NO selling here ... just free mention of a person and his deeds ... If you have not as yet heard about him and his inventions, well then ... this wikipedia is as good a source of reference ain't it so&#160;?

<li>by the way, dear Akradecki ...my postings at Proton Savvy AMT was real information as i own and drive one such car how come all that jazz went up in smoke too&#160;? My maiden virgin voyage into wikipedia country seems to have been a mis-adventure of sorts eh ...&#160;? minefields exploding left ... right and center ... shall I call it a day and never attempt to be a novice author herein forbidden territory of wikipedia&#160;? The amount of censorship herein puts the media censorship in my home country to shame really but then, I shall persevere to attempt to make sensible dialogue with you all ... the patrolmen of the wikipedia highways and by-ways if I could send over a hot cuppa coffee in a virtual manner right now ... I would ... really ... drinks on me lads&#160;!

<li>Your comments above might carry more weight if you added to the article some reliable references to show that the guy ever existed, let alone worked on the Manhattan Project.

<li>so when in doubt ... you google here and there what crops up from your googles are inputs from others herein the whole wide web if it ain't therein ... does it mean that this Dr Everett L.

<dl>
<dd>99 th Congress First Session In the House of Representatives A Bill To provide for the relaxing of restrictions on Deuterium, Deuterium Oxide, Deuterons, Deuterium Sulfate and other stable, safe and effective compounds derived from Heavy Water.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sec. 1. (a) Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United Staes of America in Congress Assembled, that this Act be cited as the DEUTERIUM FREEDOM ACT of 1985.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Findings And Purposes</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sec.2.(a) The Congress hereby finding that inadvertently or by sheer oversight, the most creative and health-giving substance in the Universe is not available as a constituent in medicines prescribed for the general public. Science-minded insiders who b uy these substances labeled for non-medical purposes are considered "Frontiersmen of Advanced Medicine", but their low numbers are miniscule compared to the National and World need for Low-Cost Medicines that work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sec.2 (b) The purpose of freeing Deuterium substances is to provide cellular, molecular and nutritional medicine capable of delivering a minimum of 78 elements in full solution to any given cell in the human body within 30 seconds to 3 minutes. The product Cellfood produced by Deutrel Laboratories of Santa Paula, California, is an example of this medical technology. Many other laboratories in all parts of the United States have been developing Deuterium products and systems for more than twenty years. The American Medical Association Medicine Databank shows more than 500 published studies, experiments and medical tests of record.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Deuterium can and does form all other elements and stands at the very core of the Universe. The ashes of Hydrogen constitute water. Heavy Hydrogen combined with water becomes "Heavy Water" ( Deuterium Oxide). It should be equally obvious that such a basic and fundamental substance should not be classified as a mere "medicine", let alone as a "New Medicine".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>more to follow in due time ... be patient my friends from the same Planet called Mother Earth <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Vince Lim (<a href="../../../v/i/n/User_talk%7EVince_Lim_0593.html" title="User talk:Vince Lim">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vince_Lim_b8cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vince Lim">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<li>Nonsense. A Google search for portions of that text turns up exactly one document, which is a Word document located on portoworld.com, which is a site selling Cellfood. If this bill existed, it would exist in many other locations. The web is indeed a "creation of ... humans", but I'm afraid this part of it is indeed entirely <b>your</b> creation. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 02:15, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>..............</p>
<p>here we go again ... so you searched and you found only one reference so the search and "rescue" operation is stood down for now more like search with intention to kill off ... eh&#160;?</p>
<p>who let the dogs out ... woof woof woof&#160;?</p>
<p>if you think I am sarcastic here ... it is because I know I am running on empty ... time is ticking fast away the count-down to extinction of a topic on Dr Everett Lafayatte Storey and his noble inventions or discoveries are but ... fast ticking away ain't it&#160;? tic toc ... tic toc ...</p>
<p>Cellfood as invented by Dr Storey received the prestigious "Advanced Technology Award" by the International Hall Of Fame on 10 th May 1997 Everett wrote in Beyond Belief, published by Feebback Books ( 1982 ) " Cellfood dissociates water into nascent oxygen and hydrogen, and individual body cells are nourished by a steady stream of 78 essential elements maintained in free solution. This is due to the presence of free hydrogen and oxygen, which provides the oxidation and reduction in a chain reaction that eliminates toxins. Tissues are rebuilt, and then good nutrition completes the process. Everett Storey's unique method of extracting and balancing nutrients in what he termed an "electromagnetic equation" will take contemporary scientists years to understand.</p>
<p>The Library of Congress Catalogue Card Number for this book is 82-70619</p>
<p>Dr Storey is also author of " Getting Down To Fundamentals " 1943 and he was patentee in 1966 for fusion trigger mechanism and he perfected deuteron process of soil normalization in 1960 Born in September 6, 1914 ... he was a physical chemist, microbiologist, publisher, author and football coach.</p>
<p>Educated at University of Chicago In the Who's Who in the World ... ( Marquis / Chicago 1978-79 Edition reference page 896 ) Storey, Everett Lafayette ... son of Walter Fletcher and Lois ( Delay ) S. Founder of Deutrel Labs., Santa Paula Cal. in 1965 President of Desert Reclamation Corp., Las Vegas 1957 Exec Secretary of Long Beach Jr. Football League 1949 Executive Director of American Medical Research Society 1959-63 Founder, head coach of Academy of American Football, Santa Paula, Cal. Chairman republicans for Cannon, Nev. 1958 Member Sigma Chi. Club&#160;: Southtown Speakers ( founder Chicago ) 1938</p>
<p>......................</p>
<p>In 1944, Everett Lafayette Storey applied for a patent for his "Water Splitting Mechanism" ( which was used in the development of the Hydrogen bomb and his products, such as Cellfood ) On 24 th May 1944, Storey's invention was assigned Serial Number 537,231 and Final U.S. Patent Number 2,530,317</p>
<p>Once Storey had perfected and tested Cellfood ( called "Deuterosulfazyme"), he applied to the Food and Drug Administration ( F.D.A. ) to register it as a therapeutic preparation. On 25 th January 1978, the F.D.A. assigned it Registration Numbers&#160;: NDC 49355-02 ( NDC = New Drug Code ) and F.D.A 2020872. Storey spent over $2 million dollars on clinical testing. Cellfood proved to have positive results on many varied medical conditions. However, because of this, it could not be given a specific classification. It was however permitted for sale as a nutritional supplement.</p>
<p>.....................</p>
<p>So ... there you all are ... I rest my case for the note-worthy fleeting mention of a name called Dr Everett Lafayette Storey in the wikipedia encyclopedia whew ... judge, jury and executioners ...you now have a decision at hand to make ... have you had your hot cuppa as yet&#160;? Cheers and have a nice day then</p>
<p>Vince Lim Kuala Lumpur Malaysia</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>By the ways ... dear Akradecki ... Cellfood protects you from picking up nuclear fallout, by providing minerals that vibrate near the frequencies of isotopes. If there is no mineral deficiency, then the body will not accept the fallout.</p>
<p>........</p>
<p>for the love of a good story on Storey please p-l-e-a-s-e folks ... do give my latest response in the talk page a read ... before the guillotine slams down on this thread&#160;! Ouch&#160;!@#^%?(</p>
<p>in the still of midnight quiet, the wounded calf cringes on the distant howling yelps of the crying pack of encircling hyenas</p>
<p>E.T. ... phone home ...</p>
<p>in a terminal judgement like this ... a bit of light-hearted dry humour should not make anyone lose sleep ( would it&#160;? )</p>

<dd>"TOY EXPLOSIVE: This invention relates to a toy explosive which realistically simulates various implements of warfare, such as a ship, a bomb, etc." Doesn't sound like a "water splitting mechanism" to me. (Nor a very good toy, really - sodium is rather more dangerous than Storey seemed to think.) <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 07:53, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If zetawoof is right on the smelling trail of hoaxes then what have we here&#160;? a truly mega-hoax indeed&#160;! not since the Da Vince Code will there be another thriller in the rose garden shall we call in CSI eh&#160;?</p>
<p>who let the dogs out ... woof woof woof</p>
<p>toy explosive indeed&#160;??? Dr Everett L. Storey is called the Father of the Hydrogen Bomb and even up till now ... the details from the Manhattan Project are very much top secret and mysterious ...</p>
<p>could there have been "patent-gate" out there&#160;? somebody covering up the loose ends&#160;?</p>
<p>You see, Dr Everett Storey is credited with splitting of the water molecule into nascent oxygen and nascent hydrogen ( singlet atoms ) ... and even in the automobile industry with sky-rocketing fossil fuel prices and a fast depleting world reserves ... the scramble to un-fold the inner secrets of splitting water molecule into oxygen and hydrogen gives sparkling bright futures indeed for man and his automobile days ... unless of course ... the titans of petroleum industry and warlords of oil reserves feel "threatened" on their money-squeezing era&#160;?</p>
<p>There is definitely more than meets the eye when you look under the satin sheets ...</p>
<p>Whatever conclusion judgement you folks decide upon ... well it has been a pleasurable roller-coaster ride anyway</p>
<p>Guess I shall just ride away into the sunset oblivion and look for another web-site to park my findings ...</p>
<p>Well done guys and gals ... you keep a really tight ship at wikipedia ...</p>
<p>Zillion thanks for the alpha tangoes ...</p>
