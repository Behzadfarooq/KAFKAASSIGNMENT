<dd>Yes, World of Warcraft is a single game. It's also the biggest of MMORPGs. Even if most of the words used weren't actually common to MMORPGs in general, I'd have no objection to including those unique to the World of Warcraft culture(or some of the other big-name MMORPGs like Everquest, City of Heroes, etc). As a source though, it represents the work of a major company in the business. That makes it pretty good as a reliable source in my book. Yes, these are new terms used by a relatively new social group, but that doesn't mean there isn't documentation from reliable sources about them. The fact is, you said this list can't be anything other than original research. That's flat-out wrong, I found two sources without even trying hard. Maybe you should revise your comments accordingly? I can understand the concern about this being a collection of words (though given the other glossaries around, I don't feel it's especially objectionable), but your description is a tad overzealous. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 23:11, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Sure, some of the terms in this list should be removed, but there's a big difference between removing terms and deleting the entire list. Several people have pointed out similar glossaries on other subjects. I'm not simply saying "keep this bad article because that bad article exists". What I'm saying is that, the way it is now, glossaries are allowed on Wikipedia. If we want to have a discussion about removing <i>all</i> glossaries from Wikipedia, we can have that discussion.

<p>This is a dictionary definition followed by a paste of a glossary specific to the United States armed forces. The source that we've pasted into the article could perhaps be used as a reference for articles on military terminology or slang, but the paste of this one particular list does not make an encyclopedia article, and it is hard to imagine how it could become one. Further, it is not crystal clear to me that we can be republishing this; while unrelated to copyright, there is apparantly some sort of distribution limitation on the document. This limitation may perhaps be unenforceable, but I'm not sure what we would gain by pressing the matter; I suggest we can just link to this if we need it rather than republishing it. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 00:27, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I am the author of this page. My experience in the world of figure skating speaks for itself and I refer to the user who quoted Google. It is fair to say, that having skated for 10 years, coached for several, published a figure skating magazine for 11 years, appeared on countless TV shows as an expert, my work during the 2002 Winter Olympics, winning an award from the Professional Skaters Association for best figure skating publication, published a book on the sport and was selected by one of the top four networks in the United States for a television show specific to the sport of figure skating, speaks to notability. Whether it is I, or a publicist, or other person that promotes the facts of my experience based on truthful knowledge, the page should stay. This page has been up for months and it is only because of a recent television appearance that certain users want this page removed. Everything in this article is factual and, I believe, keeps within the policies of Wikipedia.

At that level, we'd have everyone who ever did time in prison and then became a "motivational speaker" with an article on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>: ... and this&#160;!vote I found,somehow, slightly sad. We are writing an encyclopedia, but after all, within the vague and general bounds of appropriate coverage, why would we not keep a "great [factual] story" about a "notable" person where one "like[s] the article" when one is "sorry" and (per edit summary) "regretful" about losing it? Notability and our guidelines about it are important, but their purpose is to improve the encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> There are some legitimate questions of notability, but there are a few other sources that have written about him. He's a more-documented-example-than-most of a very notable group of people (Holocaust survivors, that is), and I think it's beneficial to have a specific example like this. I don't agree with <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">User:Anthony.bradbury</a> that all survivors are notable, or <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J. Leivick">User:Daniel J. Leivick</a> that all factual biographical articles should be kept, but Kanitz's experiences are rare enough that I don't think that it sets too much of a dangerous precedent.

<dd>Of the three references given, he is possibly the primary subject of the newspaper article (it isn't online, I haven't read it, so I assume it is about him). The Anne Franke Exhibition book has a page on him, out of a 24 page booklet on the exhibition (and I think it is obvious he did NOT open the exhibition in other locations; the exhibition is customized for each location, and probably in each location they find an appropriate opening speaker).

<li>I do not agree that this is indisputable (and not just because over a dozen people above dispute it.) He was the subject of one profile in a local newspaper, from which the vast majority of this article is constructed. He was also the subject of a short profile as part of a press packet distributed upon the opening of a museum; I am not sure this is a notable source, and in any case that profile itself might be culled from the original article in question. The third source merely confirms that he won a probably non-notable community award. I maintain, then, that his notability is arguable, and that is in fact what this AfD is for.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 20:39, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability is not subjective</a>. Remember that the article may have been in worse shape than it is now when some editors argued for deletion. Or editors may have wrongly concluded that he's non-notable due to insufficient evaluation of the article. He meets the established guidelines and policies for notability - i.e. <b>He is notable</b>. If you disagree, the correct action is to review the relevent guidelines and policies - because he is notable, and this is an established fact of this debate.

<ul>
<li>With all due respect, I just specifically provided my reasoning for why I don't think he meets the criteria. You have just repeated your argument that he is notable and linked for the fifth time to the same policy page. Also, unfortunately, the use of terms like "non-trivial" and "primary subject" mean that there will <i>always</i> be people who dispute whether a given article meets the standard, so despite the policy's insistence that notability is not subjective, in several ways it still is. Appealing to the policy multiple times does not automaically make this guy's notability an "established fact." Also, if notability's non-subjective nature were as cut and dry as you argue, there would be a LOT less activity on the AFD boards.-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 20:49, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>People ignore policy and concensus to argue from the gut all the time. I'm not too concerned. AfD is a discussion, not a vote, and any halfway competent Admin will see that the arguments for delete are inconsistant with the facts. Your arguement even admits he meets WP:BIo in the premise, but then tries to explain it away with arugments that go against the policies (like "notability of sources", which is bunk).

He was <i>just there</i>. And remember that keeping non-notable Holocaust survivors leads to also keeping articles on non-notable D-Day soldiers, Iwo Jima soldiers, civil rights movement footsoldiers, anti-apartheid activists...

<li><b>Comment</b> You happen to be wrong on the merits of the question. Unfortunately that's beside the point.

<ul>
<li>If an anonymous IP contributes meaningfully (i.e., they provide a reasonable explanation of their&#160;!vote), I don't see why the opinion expressed by that IP should be ignored. Obviously, that would be understandable if it was just a "per nom" type of explanation, but anyone should be able to contribute. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 03:51, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It's certainly possible that an argument given by an anon contributor could convince others, and thereby influence the debate. However in my view the closing admin should not count it, as an opinion <i>per se</i>, for the purposes of determining "rough consensus". It's not hard for the same person to contribute multiple times under different IPs, giving different rationales, and moreover someone contributing to an administrative decision should have a fixed point of reference by which to find him/her, and if appropriate compare with his/her history of contributions. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 04:21, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My opinion has always been that IP opinions are valid so long as it's clear that they're not being used to influence the vote. While it's certainly possible that the IP is also someone else who's already commented on this page, it's unlikely that they'd use only one additional "vote". In cases where the vote has clear sockpuppeting or meatpuppeting, such as when a website gets their members to vote one way or another, I think IPs can easily be discounted, but just having an IP does not make one not worthy of having their opinion noted- AFD isn't a vote by any means. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 17:41, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>At the very least I think an IP's opinion is <i>less</i> worthy of note. If you want to make non-controversial improvements to articles, great, log in or don't, no biggie. But if you want to weigh in on an administrative decision, or for that matter any controversial content dispute, you ought to let us know who you are, at least with a fixed pseudonym. "Where you stand depends on where you sit", and people considering your opinion are entitled to some context for it. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 18:19, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Well, {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">Prod</a>}} is for uncontroversial deletions which do not meet criteria for speedy deletion. If someone thinks it shouldn't be deleted, but rather cleaned up or merged, just remove the prod tag. It seems now as if you do not actually have anything to object... so why the prod tag removal? How could deletion of an article on a <i>fictional weapon (mobile suit) from the Mecha design series Ζ-MSV</i> be controversial whatever the case? <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 02:23, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. There are many scores of articles at WP on games, fictional technologies, fictional characters.

<li><b>Keep</b> or merge to the more descriptive <i>desktop fabricator</i>. I don't like <i>desktop manufacturing</i> as a rename because I think that implies mass production as the primary use, whereas a home fabber could be used to make art or a one-off chocolate fantasy castle for a dinner party. Notability: I don't know of an academic article about the potential impact, but economic (home consumer goods) and intellectual property (design share/theft) ramifications come to mind.

In this case, there is very little information, and a seperate article does seem a bit much. Still, no reason not to merge.

<li>As a note none of the users commenting on the talk page are from a "sockpuppet". I don't know why you think that, but I know that there are at least three distinct people commenting on the page. I am one of them, the author another, and another person that is neither him nor I. I hope that before considering to delete this page you visit the homepage and listen to the song "Got Wheat". If you don't have the time to research this issue, I don't know why you would take the time to consider deletion of the page. 64.223.180.118 02:08, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The talk page for the article is turning into a farcicle, could people please read that before expressing judgement. It makes the article come awfully close to db-nonsense<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite"><font color="green">Ryan</font><font color="purple">Postlethwaite</font></a><sup>See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">the mess I've created</a> or <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">let's have banter</a></sup> 02:26, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - 1) I do not appreciate the insinuation that I have been using sockpuppets. I have in fact signed each and every one of the comments coming from me. I see no reason to do otherwise. I believe that there are enough different IPs commenting on that page to show that Mr. Ryan is throwing around false accusations. If you end up deleting the page, I will respect that decision, but I'd like to see this fellow take some heat for throwing in nonconstructive insults and accusations with no evidence to back them up.</li>
</ul>
<p>2) Since we have now established (at least, I have said as much as I possibly can to try to convince you) that the other comments are NOT me, I'd like to point out that I can't control what they say. Whether their arguements are good or bad is irrelevant to me, because I did not make them. If that page has degenerated into farce, it is not good for me either, so why would I be doing it?</p>
<p>3) I realize that you may call me on 'meatpuppeting', but the fact is this: I myself never bothered to create a Wikipedia account until I decided to create this entry. I admit that some the people whose attention I have called to the article probably created accounts just to comment, but I can assure you that they are all regular Wikipedia users. I realize that that may not have any relevance, and also that I have no way to prove it, but I thought I might throw it out there on good faith.</p>
<p>4) My main arguement for the relevance of the page is this: The band does not meet the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines, that much is quite clear. However, as previously stated on the page's discussion, the main purpose of the band is promotion of Celiac Sprue awareness. That purpose comes ahead even of making music. Since that is the case, I would prefer that the entry be judged as a disease awareness tool, rather than as a band. If that is unacceptable, so be it, but please, Mr. Ryan, give me some specific points that we can debate instead of throwing the same sorry links at me when I have already accepted your point and explained why I think the entry is still relevant. I'd like to establish a dialogue here, but all you have done is paste internal links, insult me, and throw around accusations. But as I said, I respect the judgement of Wikipedia in the end. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShathaniel_1081.html" title="User:Shathaniel">Shathaniel</a> 03:26, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>There's already an article on <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coeliac_disease.html" title="Coeliac disease">Coeliac disease</a>. Wikipedia doesn't need an article on this band to call awareness to it. You don't get to decide the criteria under which your aricle is reviewed. It's an article about a band and the band does not merit inclusion in Wikipedia under the appropriate guideline, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:01, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would in turn argue that Wikipedia doesn't "need" a lot of its articles...but if the article is not competely farcical or frivolous, why go to the trouble to delete it? Obviously I can't decide the criteria under which the article is reviewed, but I am allowed to recommend the light in which the article is viewed. If you believe that the entry should be deleted, then I respect that opinion. But please do not talk down to me. I believe that the article does contribute something, whether as a band or otherwise, but as I have repeatedly stated, I will respect the final judgment of the Wikipedia admins.<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShathaniel_1081.html" title="User:Shathaniel">Shathaniel</a> 04:07, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I suspect that this is a tough subject for which to establish notability. It seems that quotations from blogs are not considered credible evidence at WP. However, if someone is <i>"attracting notice"</i> from a significant number of bloggers, then the subject meets the criteria for inclusion: <i>"Notable here means "worthy of being noted" or "attracting notice", not "important" or "famous". It is not synonymous with fame or importance. It is not measured by Wikipedia editors' own subjective judgements. It is not "newsworthiness"</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b> I feel that if more effort went into providing context to the list, rather than just the bare-bones list, it might be salvageable. Unfortunately, it's extremely narrow in its focus, to the point of being excessive detail. This is true especially when comparing it to other major sports' record articles, which don't included individual lists for every record, only a compilation of all record holders. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 03:59, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I know it's incomplete, I'm doing it in my spare time, that's the reason I put "work inprogress". The reason I believe it's important it's because I haven't found anyplace in the web a page who contains this stats, and also helps to contribue to the bios of these players (i believe that the 150 plaayers with the most games in NFL history shoulkd have their bios in Wikipedia). Remember that I'm making the list manually, so I have to search in different sources or by memory which are the players with the most games. If Major League Baseball has it's list, why not the NFL? <a href="../../../g/y/p/User%7EGypaetus_1fde.html" title="User:Gypaetus">Gypaetus</a> 17:22, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

However, given the state of <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_records_%28individual%29_b91d.html" title="NFL records (individual)">NFL records (individual)</a>, it is too extensive a listing for one record.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Actually, I'd like to see tables like this for other NFL records. I don't think this counts as indiscriminate information. Career games played is a major statistic, and I've seen general-interest almanacs with similar (though shorter) lists. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 19:13, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>You</i> think it's unneeded and dumb; I think it's perfectly reasonable.

<li><b>Comment</b> I object to this nomination being an indictment of the author rather than a discussion of the notability of the subject.

<li><s><b>Weak Keep</b></s>. The cleanup exposed some things, such as that he has had a minor, but not trivial, role in a major US film, a fair number of German roles which sound reasonably impressive (I'm not a German acting buff, so open to changing opinion if someone more knowledgeable says that these roles are either very impressive or not impressive at all), and that the Marilyn Monroe expose has had some coverage - that adds up to a keep, weak only because of lack of German acting knowledge.

<li><b>Comment</b> As the nominator in the first afd, I wish someone would have informed of this renomination. Anyway, well done to Guinog for making the effort.

<li><s><b>Weak keep on condition that the Marilyn Monroe section is cut down + further referencing or removal of unsourced claims</b></s> Firstly, thanks again to Guinog and others for their efforts in revamping this article. I still think this article is problematic, but is a borderline keep needing better referencing - based on his TV acting career, and absolutely NOT on the Marilyn Monroe stuff.</li>

<dd>Many of the article's claims have yet to be referenced - his early purportedly "championship winning" skating career is unverified. His stage career is unverified (and we have little idea of what level he was acting at - key player or minor role). The claim that he was the lead in an award-winning short film is unverified -"Susanne Aernecke"+"Josephine" gets 9 google hits of which 2 are somewhat relevant (counting all the multi-language imdb hits as the same), neither of which confirm that the film won any recognition - its not even listed in Aernecke's IMDB profile<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=zS7&amp;q=josephine+%22Susanne+Aernecke%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=zS7&amp;q=josephine+%22Susanne+Aernecke%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. I can't find anything much with an alternate search using the film festival name either<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=otm&amp;q=%22hofer+filmtage%22+josephine&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=otm&amp;q=%22hofer+filmtage%22+josephine&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> (24 hits for festival name + josephine + susanne; perhaps my German isn't good enough but I'm not seeing anything relevant here).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In addition there was some puffery-by-association over his film roles that I've now removed - his role in The Name of the Rose was a minor bit part as I pointed out in the first afd. Just because you've had a bit part in a movie with a Hollywood star (or in a German TV screenplay by a famous writer) doesn't confer encyclopedic notability by association.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Assuming that the database references used are reliable, I think being a non-bit part actor in a major-award winning TV film is arguably sufficient here (though we don't know the extent of his role). Though as far as I can tell by references/searfching, Fremde liebe Fremde won ONE Grimmie not multiple and that was for its lead actress. Other awards went to the cinematographer, director, writer (again, the problematic notability-by-association puffery issue). I'm going to make adjustments accordingly</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, the Marilyn Monroe business is not significant encyclopedically (there is no evidence even that he is an especially important collector, or that this legal case is especially significant, plus Wikipedia is not news report archive), and is at best a cut-down trivia section - otherwise there are undue weight issues which verge upon <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAPBOX_345c.html" title="WP:SOAPBOX">WP:SOAPBOX</a> misuse of Wikipedia <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:00, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Growing up in Germany and holding German citizenship helps a bit with the TV expertise, but I commend you for not trusting me on this. I have no credibility that would be sufficient for a Wikipedia entry, which is why I searched for reviews of his performances. The shows and movies he lists are amply covered on the web, so his roles are certainly verifiable. Do they give him notability? I don't think so, unless I read some review that actually comments on his acting. On the MM scandal, I only glanced them over and watched the KCAL clip, but in what way do those clips differ from interviewing the next-door neighbor of a shooting victim at the scene of a crime in your local 9 o'clock news? ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 18:59, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>(unindent)We are not assessing the article as originally written by the subject. We are assessing an article which is the result of a standard editing process by other editors, including myself, none of which, to my knowledge, had any acquaintanceship with Mark Bellinghaus beforehand, so there is no COI. As far as I know, none of these editors has any personal investment, or any particular interest, in Marilyn Monroe memorabilia (I certainly don't), so the accusation of soapbox is equally misplaced, as is the suggestion of a campaign by a single purpose editor. These are simply <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_herring.html" title="Red herring">red herrings</a>. It is not an argument for deletion to single out the least important roles. These are there to flesh out the picture, and could for that matter be left out with no great detriment. It would be more useful to have proper observations on the more important (and referenced) roles, for example, <i>In 1991 he played actress Meret Becker's brother Kurti, in the multiple award-winning Fremde, liebe Fremde (Foreigner, Dear Foreigner). In 1993, he played Malte Borrell in the TV show SOKO 5113. He played Knut Sonntag in the hit TV show Immer wieder Sonntag, written by Herbert Lichtenfeld.</i> There does not seem to be a refutation of their worth, only that no reviewer noticed them (or at least no reviews are quoted, which is a different matter), but they are referenced, which is the wiki requirement. There is no wiki stipulation that reviews per se are mandatory. Regarding the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> flags {{Template:fact}}, these are specifically for information which "is not doubtful"; I see no reason, from observing the original editor's general behaviour, not to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a> that they are true, unless anyone can point me to evidence that indicates differently. The MM clips and quotes differ from a next door neighbour, because the latter is interviewed as a bystander (i.e. it could be anyone), whereas Bellinghaus is interviewed purposefully because he is considered by those media to have something of particular significance to contribute through his prior learning and knowledge. I consider that I and other editors on this article have followed the guidelines properly and not thrown them anywhere. At the moment there are two reactions to the two parts of the article: 1) the Monroe is the important part 2) the acting is the important part. I suggest that, taken together, they delineate an individual who is not major, but who is of note, i.e. "notable". <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 19:15, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>It's a nice (in both senses of the word) lateral approach, but of course has to remain hypothetical and has not (yet at least) been incorporated into the guidelines. I'm particularly interested in the less mainstream aspects of culture and society, as I find they're a valuable aspect of the whole and think there should be a place for them in wiki, provided a degree of notability is credible. I've speedy-deleted plenty of "non-notable" articles which are commonplace — mostly subject-created — but occasionally one seems worth bothering with, despite its genesis and even its initial state. I have enjoyed and found my knowledge enriched by articles of this nature, some of which might well not have been started without their self-author, but would certainly (as in this case) not had any chance of being kept had independent editors not found them worthwhile. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:37, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment from Mark Bellinghaus</b> For anyone interested, Mark has left me a lengthy argument for keeping this article on my talk page (he mistakenly addresses me as Brad Patrick, the Legal Counsel of the Wikimedia Foundation, presumably because he saw the link I have to a Brad's anti-spam message on my userpage). As the argument is lengthy, I think it best that interested persons should look at it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bwithh#Your_contribution_to_Mark_Bellinghaus_page" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bwithh#Your_contribution_to_Mark_Bellinghaus_page" rel="nofollow">my talk page here</a>, rather me pasting here. If it is preferred that it is pasted here, please go ahead and do so. Note that I have previously emphasized to Mark that 1) this is a community discussion 2) he is welcome to join in 3)it is not my sole decision whether to keep this article or not or whether to cut down the Monroe section in a kept article or not. As Mark's message is intended to persuade people to keep this article based on what he views as the importance of the Monroe controversy, I am bringing it to the attention of the afd discussion group here. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 11:09, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>sidenote</b> Mark has pointed out to me that there are other unreliable blog-based sources in the article (in the Monroe section) - I agree with him on this - such as the "Citizen Media" link - (I did not <i>add</i> these links however, as he thinks). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 11:09, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I added the Citizen Media link, and it doesn't look like a blog by the classic definitions. It claims to be a New Mexico news and education group, has multiple articles on different subjects, and the writing reads like it's written by someone who knows a few things about journalism, and is trying to appear balanced. Anyway, even not counting The Citizen, that leaves the Long Beach Press Telegram, KCAL, and two from the Los Angeles Independent, which would be all right sources for the controversy and subsequent lawsuit, but aren't really about Bellinghaus per se - they don't say much about him, they're really about the exhibit. Trialsanderrors writes the German roles aren't much. So I'll change my opinion to delete on an article about Bellinghaus, and a weak vote for rewriting about the controversy - weak, because I've had enough and am not going to do it if no one else will. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 14:09, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Still Delete</b> "is a major collector of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia"? As evidenced by what? The LA Weekly article which most likely got its information from Bellinghaus directly?

<li>Babu is the primary subject of 2 stories on the BBC and 2 newspaper articles. That constitutes "multiple independent, reliable and verifiable coverage as the primary subject" and thus satisfies Wikipedia's policy for notability.

<dd>WP is not a crystal ball obviously does not apply to AFD (or any talk page for that matter).

<li>While I wouldn't necessarily object to condense/merge, I am leaning toward <b>Delete</b> because I don't think it's wikipedia's place to provide an extensive bibliography/"further reading" list for every topic. Does it seem like an endorsement of these books to list them all as relevant to the articles? Do we know for sure that they all exist?

<li><b>Comment</b>. I accept the endorsement argument above and that this probably isn't an appropriate stand alone article. If we are to merge the content back to the main article, does anyone have an idea for how practically to ascertain which are the most important texts on the subject? <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 21:30, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I do know how to sort them enough to pull out the generic and completely irrelevant ones (it will also be possible to exclude any that also appear in references), also how to prioritise which article they go to (some are more applicable to one than the other). It can be done, as long as the "reading lists" stay under control in future. I take the point about "implied endorsement" but the effect seems even stronger when the list is appended to an article. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 21:52, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

How is a list of books, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_books_by_Martin_Luther_e8f1.html" title="List of books by Martin Luther">List of books by Martin Luther</a>, not encyclopedic?

<li><b>Delete</b> If the parent article somehow managed to cite all of these, then I'd see a reason to keep the list. Wikipedia is WP:NOT a directory. Note that, if moving some of these items into the parent article is considered too bulky, consider using the &lt;small&gt; HTML tag. Limiting a reference section to only the articles actually cited does help to reduce bloat. It would be perfectly OK to cite a single review article (preferably one available online) and tell WP readers that its references would be a good reading list. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 20:49, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This song is only rumored to be a single. Other Incubus non-singles do not have pages, and neither do some of their singles. Furthermore, this article is very short and does not feature any information about the song itself; this information could just as easily go in the <i><a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_Grenades_c5c8.html" title="Light Grenades">Light Grenades</a></i> page.

<li><b>Comment</b> At least I'm making an effort to save the page at all. Instead of paragraph after paragraph on why the article needs to go, why not put that effort into helping save the thing? Considering WV's population, Grafitti's 30K circulation is understandable. The paper is just like any other indie paper in larger cities that cover the music and arts scene. But in this case it covers the entire state. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 03:42, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The Daily Atheneaum, the WVU newspaper is a reliable, verifiable source. But without archives online. The Dominion Post charges just to read <i>anything</i> from their web site. I do not have the time to go scour the microfilm archives at the WVU library. The campus radio station is on the case. Give them a chance to help out. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 03:49, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>DarkAudit, the burden of proof for this is not on me but on those that wish to keep the article. I do no see any value in it nor do I see anything that meets <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> in my google searches. It's not on me, someone voicing an opinion here in AFD, to add anything to the article, and as a wikipedia editor you know this. You also are aware, or should be aware, of the main wikipedia policies and the many guidelines, and hence you should have known that the sources provided are not acceptable per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, which is explained more in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. A reasonable person who is not from that area can not easily find information readily available about this place of business. As you are asking a radio station to help, this indicates to me that even someone interested in this club is having a difficult time finding reliable sources. Now this afd runs for another 4 days. That should be enough time to find a chapter in a book, a national/international newspaper or magazine that has a feature length article primarily about the club, or a national news network that has carried a story primarily about the club (not the owner). Please remember that a place of business could have dozens of articles in local newspapers, but that does not mean it is notable. What makes this club any more notable than any other indi club in the US or even the World? We need sources that pass wikipedia's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>/<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> policy. So far, none provided do. This isn't personal, so please do not feel this is an attack against you, the club, the owner, or the city. I'm not saying that the club isn't important to those that enjoy going to it, nor am I saying it isn't a part of the community's history. What I am saying is nothing about this club makes it notable (there is a local club that has hosted even bigger named acts than this club yet it is not notable either) --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a><sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bschott_2362.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bschott"><font color="green">view my history</font></a>)</sub>/<sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 10:29, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I do not believe that this is sufficient, however, to remedy the situation. <i>I request that the comments of all editors from the previous AfD be considered as part of the record of this AfD.</i> To do otherwise would be profoundly unfair. Notice to the Users is not adequate because: 1)the tight time constraint imposed by the AfD, and 2)The chilling effect on expression which is caused by upsetting the first Consensus. It would amount to blatant "do over."

<li><b>Comment</b> This current re-do AfD is the product of a flawed <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDeletion_Review_0a7e.html" title="WP:Deletion Review">WP:Deletion Review</a>. <a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">The initiator of the DR</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">the sole User responding in the DR</a> misapplied the process and did not seem to understand the nature of "Consensus." The Consensus is a process that requires gaining the acceptance and agreement of the parties participating in a discussion. Although Consensus need not bring on board every participant, it is not a question of "having the better argument." <i>You have to convince others.</i> If you fail to do this your arguments may be "superior" in your own mind but they did not prevail. A process in which a User replaces the views of the participants with her own is not Consensus. It is at best arbitration. At worst it is whim. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlotteWebb_d424.html" title="User:CharlotteWebb">The Admin closing the original AfD</a> was correct in finding a Consensus of "Keep."<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 19:43, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is confusing. It's an article about two different musicians - both apparently non-notable - yet not. Of the records covered, nobody's created them; one label is a label catering mostly to Olympia, WA, the other is a movie from 1985.

<dd>Ahem. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. People can't (and shouldn't) create articles even if it is about the most senseless things. That's why Wikipedia has AFD. With that said, if an when Bernal wins, or if she has a career (becomes notable), then an article can be created. But as of now, the only people that will recognize her are her fans. And solely having fans won't be enough for a Wikipedia article. I suggest creating a fansite, instead. --<b><font color="orange"><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoward_the_Duck_9612.html" title="User:Howard the Duck"><font color="#FFA500">Howard</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howard_the_Duck_47a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck"><font color="#FFA500">the</font></a> <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHoward_the_Duck_380d.html" title="User talk:Howard the Duck"><font color="#FFA500">Duck</font></a></font></b> 10:28, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> This suit does seem a bit too obscure to have its own article (which is why I vote Merge), however, no one looks up stuff in an encyclopedia that they already know. The idea is to find out stuff that you don't already know. Xenon Zaleo 05:51, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and Cleanup</b> per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. In the case of Fictional items, <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> would supercede the cited policies, as it makes no sense otherwise (why have a seperate specific policy for a fictional items if it's outranked by a more general policy?). Also, assertion that the article isn't written in a "real-world perspective" (while this this seems completely subjective and a questionalble assertion to me), even if true, isn't grouds for deletion, as it's a simple matter to re-write information from a different perspective. If there's a problem with having fictional material on Wikipedia, nominator should propose changes to policy instead of trying to backdoor his way through.

<li><b>Delete</b> for any number of reasons. Yes, I feel the same about the lightsaber and deathstar. Feel free to nominate them and I'll vote in support. I feel a certain amount of Gundam information could be appropriate on Wikipedia - but it should focus more on summary information rather than in-depth on every little facet of the fictional world. Real-world information on Gundam would be great, too, as few places provide anything about that. <a href="../../../z/a/k/User%7EZaku_kai_3334.html" title="User:Zaku kai">Zaku kai</a> 16:11, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. "I'm not a fan" is not grounds for deleting fictional subjects, and that's what these Gundam AfDs really ammount to. Oh, and Zaku kai? You wouldn't happen to be a sockpuppet, would you? The fact that your account was apparently created today and your only "contributions" to Wikipedia are voting in a few AfDs (these aren't elections, so "vote" isn't really the right term, but whatever), not to mention your silly assertion that Death Star and Lightsaber should be deleted because they're fictional, make me doubt you're actually a serious contributor. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedxiv_dabe.html" title="User:Redxiv">Redxiv</a> 22:17, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Redxiv: if you'd like to discuss my history as part of the Gundam fan community, or my history of (admittedly minor, previously anonymous) contributions to Wikipedia, feel free to go to my talk page and I'll be happy to enlighten you. IMO this is not the place for that discussion - and please consider that the quality of the message does not depend on the history of the messenger. Everyone starts somewhere. My questioning of the Lightsaber article is serious - regardless of the quality of the information in there (which I do enjoy!) I am not convinced that that kind of information belongs here. So if someone wants to claim that article's existence as somehow being a compelling reason why some other article should also exist, I don't buy it. I recognize that my opinion about fictional articles isn't shared universally - and that's why I'm participating in this dialogue rather than trying to assert my opinion more forcibly. The Z'Gok is a fairly prominent machine in Gundam, for a couple episodes at least, but I don't believe this level of depth of fictional information is worth having in an encyclopedia. MAHQ provides most of this information already, and with somewhat more reliable accountability for the sources of the data. And efforts like the Gundam Wiki are in the process of establishing themselves - and would be quite perfect for this kind of information. <a href="../../../z/a/k/User%7EZaku_kai_3334.html" title="User:Zaku kai">Zaku kai</a> 20:00, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> <i>No. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia.</i> The last time I checked, which was recently, encyclopedia's are also indiscriminate sources of knowledge. Not to mention Wikipedia's own mission statement is to be a collection of information. Simply because you don't know, like, or enjoy the information is not just cause to go deleting it. Which is why merging this information would be so much easier and more true to the spirit and point of Wikipedia's existance. 69.244.126.189 06:56, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> While encyclopedias cover a wide range of topics, it's not correct to say they are indiscriminate. If you submitted your own life story to an encyclopedia, would they publish it? Most likely not. They are not indiscriminate, they have an editorial process which determines what content is appropriate. The same is true here. Wikipedia can not be, and never can be, a collection of all the facts that exist. Technical limitations and manpower limitations prevent that. Therefore, some information must be considered too trivial, too unreliable, or too useless to retain. I believe the appropriate course of action would be to move most of this stuff to Gundam Wiki, and on Wikipedia focus on real-world information about what Gundam is, and its real-world history. And I think we should take a good, long look at <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightsaber.html" title="Lightsaber">Lightsaber</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_82ed.html" title="Death Star">Death Star</a>, too - how much of that information really belongs in an encyclopedia? <a href="../../../z/a/k/User%7EZaku_kai_3334.html" title="User:Zaku kai">Zaku kai</a> 16:57, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>"The GM Cannon II is also heavier armed than its predecessors. It is equipped with two shoulder-mounted beam cannons, un-like the Guncannon, and can carry a 90 mm machine gun as well as a beam saber for close combat. It also includes two 60 mm vulcan guns mounted in the head, but these are usually strictly last-resort weapons. To power this strong weapons the GM Cannon II has a stronger reactor. It is also very heavily armored, featuring Chobham armor based of the same design as the RX-78NT1 Gundam 'Alex'. However, it pays the price for this durability for this with very low speed and mobility. A GM Cannon II on its own has been shown to not be able to fend for itself due to opponents being able to outmanuver it, unless its opponent also lacks speed."</li>

The tone of the article is very sarcastic and appears to have been written and expanded by disgruntled employees -- and in fact, the initial article and most revisions are anonymous edits from a company IP address.

<p>This article is basically a list of the ways in which various editors feel the film differs from the book. Seeing as there are no sources listed whatsoever, everything in the article is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> and inherently <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. This isn't even taking into account the fact that the article is just a series of huge lists, whose points are often redundantly repeated throughout the different sections for no apparent reason. Even if it didn't violate <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> I still would have my doubts about the necessity of having gigantic lists of differences in a separate article when a short summary on the article for the movie itself could easily suffice. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthVader1219_c2ae.html" title="User:DarthVader1219">DarthVader1219</a> 10:31, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

You can't use the movie and book as sources because they do not state within themselves the differences between them. To figure the differences out for yourself is classic <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. As an example of another article where this same scenario came into play, I'd like to point out <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_trilogy_1b2c.html#Reactions_to_changes_in_the_movie_trilogy_from_the_book" title="The Lord of the Rings film trilogy">The Lord of the Rings film trilogy</a>. There are many differences between the book and the movie, some quite as notable as any made between the Eragon book and movie. However, there is no unsourced list of said differences. Instead there is a section detailing the reaction to the changes, which mentions some of the more notable ones in the process. If there are no reliable sources decrying the differences between the two versions of Eragon or even mentioning them than there is no justification for this list's inclusion regardless of how much it could be pared or what article it could be merged into. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthVader1219_c2ae.html" title="User:DarthVader1219">DarthVader1219</a> 21:34, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Per Skudrafan1. S/he's right that there's precedent for keeping and I don't think this is a bad way to go. This particular article could be made more encyclopedic with some actual writing but it's a good and useful reference point even as is. Every individual sports team article gets deluged with news about each individual season anyway so why not split them into individual articles? I'm planning on doing the same when the baseball season starts. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 17:17, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes, that's a better example. Articles that are 95% reference tables and only 5% prose are sure to be brought to AFD. But, at least for baseball team articles, people love to write details about every transaction and how they affected the team, etc., etc., so why not break it into a separate article instead of continually removing it and saying it's too much detail?

<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. A sporting almanac is still an encyclopedia, and I would like to see the nom justify "not notable" in this sense. Focussing on an individual season for each team is no different than focussing on individual episodes of any given television series. So long as the articles have enough prose to provide sufficient context, they basically become historical documents on sports teams seasons. As the season completes, the prose for all teams will become much more significant, and this is something I have attempted to focus on in my articles for the Calgary Flames. see: <a href="../../../c/a/l/Category%7ECalgary_Flames_seasons_e091.html" title="Category:Calgary Flames seasons">Category:Calgary Flames seasons</a>. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 19:06, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Also, as Skudrafan1 correctly pointed out, all 32 National Football League (NFL) teams have an article for their 2006 season. It isn't very fair to nominate a hockey article for deletion if it's similar in concept to the one used for the NHL, especially if the reason is because hockey isn't as popular a sport in America as NFL Football is. <a href="../../../k/s/y/User%7EKsy92003_bc45.html" title="User:Ksy92003">Ksy92003</a> 22:24, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Dudley labrador" (a liver pigmented type of <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labrador_retriever.html" title="Labrador retriever">labrador retriever</a>), or even dudley as a type of pigmented dogs in general, doesn't seem notable by any usual criteria. The <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22dudley+labrador%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22dudley+labrador%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">google test</a> (a search for "Dudley labrador" on google) finds only 48 hits. A recent AFD was held on the grounds of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. There were 4 responses and some web cites were provided to verify existance of the term.</p>
<p>Relist for AFD is on the twin basis that:</p>
<ol>
<li>4 respondents (3 keep, 1 delete, excluding nominator) didn't provide a sufficient basis to determine consensus (<a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> refers), more consensus is probably needed</li>
<li>The real problem with this article and the more relevant reason for AFD listing was not verifiability (the existence of the term can be checked through Google); it's that the "dudley" probably isn't notable enough.</li>
</ol>
<p>A possible opposing view might be that a person coming across the term might want to know what it means and see a photo. But this could be said of many non-notable subjects and can be fixed by disambiguation (dudley (disambiguation) -&gt; labrador retriever). The "dudley" type in and of itself, doesn't seem very noteworthy. The information that does exist is fully covered in <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labrador_retriever.html#Lab_nose_and_skin_pigmentation" title="Labrador retriever">Labrador retriever#Lab nose and skin pigmentation</a>.</p>
<p>(As an aside, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Dog_breeds_ced9.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Dog breeds">WikiProject Dog breeds</a> are developing notability criteria for subtypes and strains; it's questionable whether by any of the proposals to date, this one will be notable either.)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> (but noting that information on pigmentation is kept under <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labrador_retriever.html" title="Labrador retriever">labrador retriever</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/d/Dudley_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Dudley (disambiguation)">dudley (disambiguation)</a> should point directly to <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labrador_retriever.html" title="Labrador retriever">labrador retriever</a>.)

<li>The google test (in this case for "Dudley labrador") is an extremely poor way of testing notability. Other used names appear to include "Retriever Dudley", "Labrador Dudley" and simply "Dudley".</li>
<li>Apparently, the dog breed notability standards are on the way. Speculating that this one might not be included, when the standards are not yet finished is a bit strange and there is no reason to hurry deletion of this article in the mean time.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - many of the hits for the search you suggested aren't for dudley labs. they are for web pages which contain the term "labrador retriever" and the <b>name</b> "dudley", either of a person or a dog.

<dd>True, it's been a long day. What I mean is, the information on pigmentation in labs is relevant to the lab article, and a disambiguation page on the word "dudley" should include a link to <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labrador_retriever.html" title="Labrador retriever">labrador retriever</a>, but the dudley article itself should be deleted. Hence as stated, merging the information (not the entirety of the article). Apologies for lack of clarity, it's been a long day. I've just reworded it for clarification.

<dd>The (correct) comment about relisting applies to repeated attempts to game the deletion system by instant relist, and also where there was a good quality outcome first time that a reasonable person would have accepted as the view of editors. In the present case the relist is on the twin view that appropriate deletion grounds omitted in AFD/1 are more appropriate for a genuine enquiry "should the article be deleted for these more correct reasons", and because 4 responses is not consensus anyway really (as anticipated and approved by <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>).

This article has future potential, which it might realize if it gets third-party printed articles commenting on Schoenfeld's work. Without outside sources, a very one-sided article with a promotional feel may result. No prejudice against re-creation if the author can come back later with a better version. Having the subject write his own article is dubious anyway given WP:COI.

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b>: Again, people not doing ANY research before making ignorant statements about a topic they're unfamiliar with. This is a DOCUMENTED NON-PROFIT Corporation established in the interest of a specific breed of dog, the Olde English Bulldogge. This is how all the breeds that are currently recognized by the large regisrtries (American Kennel Club, United Kennel Club, Canadian Kennel Club, etc...) got started. This organization is currently working very closely with the AKC and UKC to become recognized by said registries. Recognizing legitimate organizations like this is how the public BECOMES educated about rare dog breeds. Don Pelon 05:00, 11 January 2007 (UTC)•</li>

<dd>However, it is not the role of Wikipedia <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">to do that education</a>. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 06:38, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Okay, You can claim Wikipedia to be anything you want. However, as an informational resource the website by default is recognized as an educational tool. By the basic structure of the website and the way it acquires and disseminates infromation it is FAR more of an educational tool than it is a source of entertainment. Simply because one SAYS or WRITEs that the sky is green doesn't mean that it is. The evidence speaks for itself...Pages FULL of unverified data input by a variety of different people that nobody can verify as legitimate experts on the topics that they input into this website. Therefore, as a Public Encyclopedia, Wikipedia is by default an OPEN EDUCATIONAL TOOL. You are right when you say it is not Wikipedia's job to educate which is why I added the information to the website myself. The responsibility of educating is that of the people inputting the information into the website. Again, as a public encyclopedia or educational tool, it is Wikipedia's obligation to acknowledge NEW and ongoing information. Consequently, assisting their researchers to EDUCATE themselves. BTW, I appreciate your reasonable and mature response. The internet far to pampid with keyboard warriors that would NEVER have the confidence to someones face the way they do on internet forums. Don Pelon 17:51, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>So in other words, because this might someday BECOME notable and have verifiable information written, we should just kick back and wait for it to happen? I don't think so. Wikipedia is not an advertising service, and this Kennel Club has not demonstrated any evidence of notability. A cursory search shows a homepage, negligable mentions in lists, and Wikipedia articles and their mirrors. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 15:15, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh brother...Here we go with the pompous, arrogance again...lol. The internet is such a tough guy haven. As for notability go to the <a href="http://www.arba.org" class="external text" title="http://www.arba.org" rel="nofollow">| American Rare Breed Association</a>. This organization has been recognizing the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club for the past 5 years as the breeds <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breed_club.html" title="Breed club">breed club</a>. If we were to hold 70% or better of the information in this website to your criteria of notability(a couple of internet searches...lolol) it would fail miserabley. Again, because you have no knowledge of this organization beyond what you read on the internet or what it represents. I can only assume based off of your childish, snide remarks that your arrogance in using the term "WE" is referring to the general public. Well, nobody is asking "YOU" to wait for anything. The OEBKC is offering information to the general public in the exact same manner that all the other information on this website is offered to the general public. I'm new to this non-sense, so please forgive my ignorance for not knowing all the cute little acronyms everyone uses.Don Pelon 18:14, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Ah huh...Now that's much better, constructive advice instead of rude sarcasm, Thank you. I looked at your suggestions and I will be happy to utilize them in improving on this article. In fact, I apologize for not doing this in the first place when I created the page. I'm new to this format and I was a little short on time when I put the article together. I also wasn't quite sure what format to follow based on my statement above regarding other articles on this website, so I did the best I could with the time I had. Once again, thank you for the change of tune and I look forward to your advice in the future. I will be working to improve this article in the next couple of days.Don Pelon 04:16, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>weak keep</b> Not a major webcomic, but brings up a number of Google hits. Probably doesn't meet the WP:WEB but I'm not sure what's meant by "verifiability" or "original research" in this case. Surely its existence and content is self-verifying? <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerowyn_1be6.html" title="User:Kerowyn">K</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerowyn_1be6.html" title="User:Kerowyn">rowyn</a> <i><sup><a href="../../../k/e/r/User_talk%7EKerowyn_1337.html" title="User talk:Kerowyn">Leave a note</a></sup></i> 08:53, 13 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Google hits are not relevant to determining anythin. By "verifiability" we mean multiple, independent reliable sources (ie something with an editorial process) have published material with Lackadaisy as the subject (so more than just a passing mention). My rule of thumb for "multiple" is at least three sources. If there are no secondary sources, then we would just be examining the subject itself through primary information. This is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 21:13, 13 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, I'll give you verifiability, and I only mentioned Google because it was in the original nomination. I'm still not seeing original research though. The comic itself and materials from the artist regarding the comic are the primary source. The article is based on that, which is not original research. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerowyn_1be6.html" title="User:Kerowyn">K</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerowyn_1be6.html" title="User:Kerowyn">rowyn</a> <i><sup><a href="../../../k/e/r/User_talk%7EKerowyn_1337.html" title="User talk:Kerowyn">Leave a note</a></sup></i> 06:39, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Google searches aren't meant to say "there are no hits"; instead, they're meant to say "I could not find sources on Google", which is pretty significant for a topic which is in the online world. We also can't base articles entirely on the only primary source- essentially we would be taking the author's original research and using it in the article, which is blatantly <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">non-neutral</a>. To correct this, we'd need more sources, and the only way to do that would be to find secondary sources (of which there are none), or to supplement it ourselves or use unpublished sources, which amounts to original research. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 06:50, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm pretty sure the Ziel is notable in its role in 0083, serving as the fleet's vanguard during Operation Stardust, crippling Delaz' flagship, serving as Gato's personal vehicle through which he was able to implement the final course corrections for the decending colony... From a perspective from the narative it serves as the representative of the antagonist during the hero's final battle. And from a wider scope its design looks to be something of a tribute to a certain other mecha franchise who's name escapes me at the moment. When citing sources for the significance of a particular vehicle or technology from fiction, can said work of fiction be cited?--205.211.141.243 14:10, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Why is it necessary to remove any article which is neither vandalism prone, misinformation, or plagiarism? Why on a comprehensive encyclopedia does a well written article about a notable item of technology in a piece of literature need to be removed? what exactly qualifies any article as not notable? there is a wikiproject to make comprehensive guides to anime and manga, it is a recognized cannon topic of Wikipedia. there is no reason to remove this article. Perhaps for some less notable articles and stubs on gundams/mobile suits the merger idea fits, but the lack of a gundampedia means this stuff has to be preserved somewhere at least for the purpose of keeping it available <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Prawnshu (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Prawnshu_74f5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Prawnshu">contribs</a>) 10:36, 17 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> This stuff is already "preserved" rather well at sites like MAHQ. There is also a Gundam Wiki at gundam.wikia.com which has a copy of this article. I would say that the Neue Ziel is more "notable" than many of the Gundam articles currently up for deletion, in that it played a major part in a popular piece of animation (as compared to some of the MS-X stuff, which was never animated and in some cases never kitted, either.) If you ask "why must it be deleted?" I would counter "why must it be kept?" Retaining the article incurs a non-zero cost of various resources, as all articles do. The fact that most of the information in the article is fiction limits its useful benefits, as well as complicates the process of verifying the data. (Let's not forget that Sunrise has the ability to invalidate "factual" data on this machine at any time, and replace it arbitrarily with new data.) There is not a single real-world fact in that article - no mention of Gundam 0083, no mention of Akitaka Mika, not even any references to the real-world publications where the fictional data originated. (Most likely the info in the article was drawn from gaijin-friendly intermediate sources like MAHQ) As "notable" as the machine may be in Gundam's fictional history, I think the notability of the information provided in the article (useless, inconsistent statistics about its weight and thrust, backstory about its manufacture, etc.) is quite minimal. <a href="../../../z/a/k/User%7EZaku_kai_3334.html" title="User:Zaku kai">Zaku kai</a> 20:37, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> to all of above links and points. As I have said before, they haven't actually released anything yet have they? Yes, they may be signed to Island. Yes, that producer may be working with them at the moment – but the point is, they haven't come out with anything tangible yet. All the links you provide are inconclusive or trivial (i.e. brief mentions, e.g. the BBC website mention). Do you have a link to the XFM playlist? As I say, if I could actually find anything that would equate to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> <b>and</b> they had released an album already, it would be a slightly different story.

The band have already gone on one of these reported in many gig listing websites, and plan to go on another major tour of the UK in January/Febuary of this year <a href="http://www.ents24.com/web/artist/91677/Clocks.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ents24.com/web/artist/91677/Clocks.html" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> <a href="http://collect.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=bandprofile.listAllShows&amp;friendid=92591312&amp;n=Clocks" class="external autonumber" title="http://collect.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=bandprofile.listAllShows&amp;friendid=92591312&amp;n=Clocks" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. Would that warrant the article to be kept?--Alexffc 17:01, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would dispute that the tour already undergone is a national one. And, again, Wikipedia not being a crystal ball, articles which attest to its future notability are not acceptable. Besides, all the criterion at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> are extra to the central criterion which it must fulfill first.

I would be minded to call to keep if there were <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> for some of the claims made. Anyone can put their gigs on a website; a review in a publication such as the <a href="../../../n/m/e/NME_8ba4.html" title="NME">NME</a> or a local newspaper (and Birmingham101.com is not a newspaper) would be far more persuasive. Similarly for entry on the Xfm playlist (which may or may not pass muster as <i>rotation</i> on a <i>national</i> station per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> - this is arguably spot plays on a London station.)

I do agree with your points but those things are extremely likely to happen in the near future with a tour coming up, songs being recorded and released, and the record company beginning a marketing campaign for the band which would probably include lots of published reviews and articles.--Alexffc 21:52, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think people are falling into the trap of thinking that all possible information to verify a claim is available online. It isn't. If you were to go and read through the past few issues of the <a href="../../../n/m/e/NME_8ba4.html" title="NME">NME</a> and those around October/November 2006, this debate would be settled immediately. Anyhow, I've found yet another reliable online source which is an interview with John Cornfield, which verifies <b>both</b> the signing to Island and the recording sessions with him <a href="http://www.sydec.be/Applications/InFocus/Articles/ID/f9eccd98-2f3a-44b6-b964-1cbdcf40d4ed/John+Cornfield+-+Sawmills+Recording+Studio/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sydec.be/Applications/InFocus/Articles/ID/f9eccd98-2f3a-44b6-b964-1cbdcf40d4ed/John+Cornfield+-+Sawmills+Recording+Studio/" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> <i>(look to the last paragraph of this interview)</i> (as does the link to his profile on his management's website <a href="http://www.dangerousmanagement.com/index.php?action=prod&amp;id=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dangerousmanagement.com/index.php?action=prod&amp;id=1" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>). <a href="../../../j/d/w/User%7EJdwhite_37ab.html" title="User:Jdwhite">Jdwhite</a> 23:37, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Just to clarify my stance, however, I feel the notability claim is justified from clause (3) of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines for touring and that the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island_Records_88d9.html" title="Island Records">Island Records</a> signing and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cornfield_35e0.html" title="John Cornfield">John Cornfield</a> sessions are supplimentary (although all-the-more reason to take the touring sources as credible and noteworthy). <a href="../../../j/d/w/User%7EJdwhite_37ab.html" title="User:Jdwhite">Jdwhite</a> 03:09, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Jdwhite states that there has been non-trivial coverage in the NME. This is a reliable source, so is the Epsom Guardian. Adding details of these works <i>to the article</i> would be a significant help, as the onus of proof is on the person wishing to insert the information.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I have spent some time collating points from this page and organising the Clocks (band) article, and I have cited references for most.

<li>Are you referring to the USA Today blog where it is mentioned in a list (as obscure)? It isn't a review, unless I'm being incredibly stupid, please correct me.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba_hotep_ee80.html" title="User:Bubba hotep">Bubba</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba_hotep_1f80.html" title="User talk:Bubba hotep">hotep</a> 21:11, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The debate over whether the USAToday.com reference is a review or not (which it isn't) is largely academic since the article must surely qualify for inclusion by virtue of national touring <b>at the very least</b>. In any case, I believe 'Obscure' in context on an American journalist's article shouldn't be taken literally; presumably the entries for <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirty_Pretty_Things_1c22.html" title="Dirty Pretty Things">Dirty Pretty Things</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Coxon_52ea.html" title="Graham Coxon">Graham Coxon</a> are included in his definition of 'obscure', as they are not widely known in the US.

<li>OK, I'm from the UK, first of all. Second of all, you have done some great work to this article, I must admit. Thirdly, I'm still not convinced, but February, when the <i>real</i> tour (alledgedly) starts is not far away by which time the band <i>will</i> be notable beyond a doubt. Fourthly, I am becoming more and more ambivalent towards this article.

<li><b>Delete</b> - <b>(1)</b> All topics must meet a minimum threshold of notability in order for an article on that topic to be included in Wikipedia. Per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, a topic is notable if it has been the subject of at least two, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other to ensures that there exists enough source material to write a verifiable, encyclopedic article about the topic. I searched and could not find even one work. Thus, the article does not meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> requirements. <b>(2)</b> The article itself states that the event has had only eight hundred contestants since 2002. Eight hundred people being interested in a Wikipedia topic is a relatively small number. In addition to the event not drawing media attention, none of the contestants have been prominent enough to draw media attention. The contest event website <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.ludumdare.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ludumdare.com/</a> itself is not operating, and there is no indication as to how the event will continue to be an ongoing happening. No other Wikipedia articles <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_LudumDare_0cd7.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/LudumDare">link to LudumDare.</a> The only Wikipedia article that mentions Ludum Dare is <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamumu_Software_b374.html" title="Hamumu Software">Hamumu Software</a>. With such little interest in the topic, I do not believe that there will be any published works about the topic coming forth in the near future. <b>(3)</b> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_LudumDare_fa79.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/LudumDare">The first AfD</a> (15 May 2006) mentioned a slashdot article. Seven months have passed in which this reference could have been added to the Ludum Dare article but it has not been added. Also, the Wikipedia:Notability issues brought up in the May 15th AfD #1 have not been addressed in the article. Further, Deletion Review (January 3, 2007) mentioned Slashdot and other tech news sites, none of which have been added to the Ludum Dare article as references. Moreover, in the past twelve days of the present AFD#2, none of the concerns listed in this AfD#2 have been addressed through editing the Ludum Dare article. Thus, it appears that there is no interest in bringing this article into compliance with Wikipedia policies, guidelines, etc. and that lack of interest has existed for at least seven months. <b>(4)</b> The article was relisted at AfD to give more time to discuss the article. AfDs may close after five days. This article has been listed at AfD since January 4th - almost twelve days. Thus, this article may have received all the discussion that the Wikipedia community believes it needs. <b>(5)</b> In view of the above, this article should be <b>deleted</b> because it does not comply with Wikipedia policy, there is no foreseeable media interest in this topic, Wikipedians do not have enough interest in this article to address the concerns brought up in the AfD#1, Deletion Review, and AfD#2, and it appears all those interested in discussing the article at AfD have discussed the article. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 02:47, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I was just notified by user Jreferee on my talk page about this discussion, and I think it 1) should be given more time and 2) actually might have a bit of notability. LudumDare to me seems quite well known in the indy gaming scene (not that I really know much about that either) - the reason there was no interest in the article and that there are no links from other articles and that the Slashdot reference could not have been added sooner was that for the past 7 months the article had been deleted (and in the past two weeks I had no idea about the relisting). Up to 800 participants (many joined multiple times of course, but still) means there are many more players of those games. There also are several commercial games (non of WP notability as far as I know) which are spin-offs of initial LD entries. As is mentioned in the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2007_January_2_2936.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 January 2">relisting discussion</a>, e.g. <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_day_roguelike.html" title="Seven day roguelike">Seven day roguelike</a> is a very similar competition, and also has its WP article, but it only runs since 2005 and only had 35 contestants.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, I would like to keep this article around for some time, so I can look for references about notability. I know from some participants that their LD games (or spinoffs thereof) also were featured at other places, might add some info in the next days now that I know about the relisting. There are also websites about most of the competitions (except the ones on ludumdare.com which is down) which I will try to add. (Oh, and the next LD will be held in April according to people in their IRC channel, but has not been announced yet officially (as the site is down..)). I can't say how well known it really is in a global sense or how big/noteworthy the indy game developers scene as a whole is, but I guess for a lot if indy game developers LD indeed is a known term, and among all those similar competitions (pygame, speedhack, 72 hour contest, rpgdx, ...) LD probably is the biggest and most well known. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllefant_55f5.html" title="User:Allefant">Allefant</a> 15:45, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Still, I know the India cabal is one of the strongest on Wikipedia and tons of people will therefore show up to "vote" to keep this without reason (as Bondego did below).

<p>I'm nominating three articles, The Paxton Movie: A Baby Story (Not!...And Other Footage), The Paxton Movie 2: Paxton Returns, and The Paxton Movie 3: The Quest for Pax. All were created, and (other than administrative edits) only edited by, user James Preston, and James Preston is mentioned on the pages as part of the crew for the movies. None of the pages have any real information or sources that would lead me to believe this is anything more than <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">something someone made up one day</a>, and Googling "The Paxton Movie", "James Preston" Paxton, "Lawrence Paxton P", etc., comes up with nothing to indicate that any of these are actual films. I've brought this to AfD in case there's something out there I'm missing that would indicate these pages are worth keeping. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 17:55, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Devil, how familar are you with this subject? Have you read any of the 18 sources listed on this page? If so, how many. How much have you contributed to this article before the deletion? I don't see your name in any of the 500 edits on this page. You state: "much of the factual content on the article is disputed" What factual content is disputed? You don't say. Have you attempted to discuss this content on talk? Please correct me if I am wrong, but I don't see your name anywhere on the talk page either.<br />
As per <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfd_743f.html#Before_nominating_an_AfD" title="WP:Afd">WP:Afd#Before_nominating_an_AfD</a>:<br />
Before nominating a recently created article, please consider that many good articles started their Wikilife in pretty bad shape. Unless it is obviously <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletions_bb1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletions">a hopeless case</a>, consider sharing your reservations with the article creator, mentioning your concerns on the article's discussion page, and/or adding a <a href="../../../c/l/e/Category%7ECleanup_templates_a43d.html" title="Category:Cleanup templates">"cleanup" template</a>, instead of bringing the article to AfD.<br />
Jersey Devil, have you or any of the editors who want to delete this article edited the article before? Have you:<br />
1. consider sharing your reservations with the article creator,<br />
2, mention[ed] your concerns on the article's discussion page, and/or<br />
3. add[ed] a <a href="../../../c/l/e/Category%7ECleanup_templates_a43d.html" title="Category:Cleanup templates">"cleanup" template</a>?<br />
Now these three points are not policy, but it is something that should be considered by every person who wants to delete this article, and by the person deciding this case.<br />

<li><b>Additional comment</b> For some reason people started to accuse one another of being "leftish" or "conservative" here. Just for the record, my edit history is bipartisan and I'm not related to U.S. in any way. I edited the article even before it was nominated. This article has 11 sources:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>First linking for whatever reason (???) to the homepage of The Iranian-American Bar Association.</li>
<li>Second one after sentence "<i>Nemazee was also national finance chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee until late 2006.</i>" cites <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marketplace_%28radio_program%29.html" title="Marketplace (radio program)">Marketplace</a> commentary on democratic financing, but sentence needs rather official source saying that Nemazee was indeed chairman from xxxx until late (?) 2006.</li>
<li>Third source is for Nemazee being <i>"top fundraiser and donor to the Democratic National Committee for the past 10 years."</i> But doesn't state that this title was given to him by activist blog...</li>
<li>Paragraph "<i>During his presidency, Bill Clinton attempted to name Nemazee U.S. Ambassador to Argentina but was rejected by the US Senate after Forbes magazine published in May 1999 an expose of his financial dealings and involvement with the Islamic Republic. According to the New York Times he withdrew.</i>" Doesn't cite source for his rejection but than states that NYT said he witdrew - so what's the true?</li>
<li>Another source (<a href="../../../c/y/b/Cybercast_News_Service_61c8.html" title="Cybercast News Service">Cybercast News Service</a>) really sources what's written in the article but why quote conservative news website?? No other outlet ran this story? What about some major daily?</li>
<li>Anoher sources is for what Nemazee testified - <a href="../../../w/o/r/WorldNetDaily_c1c3.html" title="WorldNetDaily">WorldNetDaily</a> - and again, why source from conservative website?</li>
<li>The same as the one before...</li>
<li>Another two are Chinese People's daily and Iranian farsi.net stating that Clinton's "missive" was ignored. Farsi cites American State dep. spokesman, etc. Again: No other source?</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> per Travb and Khodavand. Article is sourced and sources meet the criteria of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. As Khodavand writes, calling the sources listed as "far-right" or "extremist" is itself POV. We're not talking about white supremacist sources or the John Birch Society or anything like that which would obviously not such criteria. Whether or not anyone agrees with the sources is moot - the fact remains that such allegations against the Democratic Party do exist and go back to the JFK administration (when there were accusations of Democrats being "soft on Communism".) Similar accusations (though in a slightly different vein) have been leveled at the Republican Party, such as the relationship between the Bush dynasty and the Saudi royal family. These are actual allegations - they exist. You cannot ignore them due to your ideological or partisan bent and to delete this material would be stripping Wikipedia readers of valuable information that is difficult to find elsewhere. Khodavand makes a wonderful point in suggesting that all relevant POVs be included in the article. This proves to me that the article was started in a <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> move. Again, deleting or ignoring sources is not the answer. Rather, the answer is to include opposing viewpoints to balance such articles. This is the way it's always been done on Wikipedia, and when adhered to, things always remain neat and copacetic.

<p>This article is unreferenced, and has been so since references were requested seven months ago. I have not been able to find <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable references</a> (following an admittedly cursory look, as I wasn't enjoying going through the material), and seems to be comprised almost exclusively of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. The topic may also be a neologism. Please do not make accusations of cultural bias. Futanari is a <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portmanteau.html" title="Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> neologism based upon the Japanese words for 'double' and 'form'. If we had an article entitled an English cultural phenomenon 'doubleform' about pictures of nude women with penises, were utterly unable to provide any references for any of the claims, and the article's sole link was to www.doubleform.com, this would have been deleted within a week of creation.

Pflugfelder, Monumenta Nipponica Vol. 47, No. 3 (Autumn, 1992), pp. 347-368.</i> On page 359: "Ambiguous bodies surface in the native literature at least as early as the twelfth certury. Yamai no Soshi, an illustrated catalogue of rare afflictions dating from that ero, provides an interesting example. 'Recently there was a man [otoko] who walked the streets of the capital with a drum hung round his neck. He had the face of a male [otoko], but there were things about his form that resembled a female [onna] as well. A certain person was confused [obotsukanagarite] by this. One night when the drummer was asleep, he secretly lifted his robes to have a look. Underneath, he saw both male and female genitals [literally, roots]. This was a hermaphrodite [futanari].'" Futanari seems to have meant "hermaphrodite" then as early as the 12th century. I found more examples for androgyny in Japanese culture as someone pointed out above but I couldn't nail down the word "futanari" to these references. 69.174.66.47 20:15, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

The fact that I don't speak so much as a word of Japanese is conspiring with the reality that there really are topics I've enjoyed sourcing more than this one to make it a challenge for me, too. I'll fully admit that the places I found this discussed aren't ... erm, reliable, so I've got <i>no way</i> to navigate that all-Japanese site to get information (if its the right one...). Back into the fray I go, I suppose. Still no idea where on their site to find detailed material (if that's the production studio and not the distributor, even!), but the series is evidently marketed in English as "Futanari Lesbians" ... 1, 2, and 3 (because porn studios have creative naming conventions).

<li><b>Keep</b> This article is in definite need of cleanup, and maybe even a rewrite, but by no means should it be deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> I can see that it's not well cited, but that's just a cry for people to help advance it, really. It's hard to site anything in this genre, though, as the content is very adult and in a sense animalistic, meaning that it's not normally something to have any structured sentences or thoughts or rationale behind it. I personally believe that the commercialism surrounding the word provided in this discussion is definitely enough to substantiate the fact that it's a legitamate term, as for the content of the article itself, the most plausable way to back them up is with imagery. That being said, you can really see that every word is true just by looking through the pictures yourself. If you have an inability to do that (ex. being grossed out) you do not have the right to call deletion on this article, as you do not have the means to judge it. Wa 12:09, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This list is a complete mess. First of all, the topic is so broad as to be rendered useless, as I shudder to think how many thousands upon thousands of cats have appeared in fiction over hundreds of years. Second of all, the list has no definite criteria, with house cats standing side by side with lions and others with no distinction made between family Felidae and the domestic cat subspecies and including anthropomorphic and robotic variants that would not actually fit into either definition. Third, the list does not even follow its own criteria entirely, with some entires describing the fictional cats themselves and others merely describing works of fiction that include cats.

Also, <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> is a guideline, not a manual of style. That guideline cautions against overbroad list criteria. This list has virtually no criteria or consistent organization pursuant to what little criteria exists. Also, you have convienently failed to provide an explanation for what makes this list "useful and encyclopedic" when it has no coherent criteria and is both an indescriminate collection of information and a list of loosely associated topics in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 21:21, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The scope of this article is enormous, including characters who have associations with anything cat-like. The amount of invalid or inappropriate links boggles my mind. I fail to see how it can be well-maintained when there's a incorrect wikilinks all over the place, like the entry and link for Solange (the cat from 9 Chickweed Lane) which leads to a Frankish saint from 880. It can't be actively maintained with this kind of nonsense, especially when it's been updated less than fifty times in the last <i>month</i>. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 21:42, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - arguing that this article should be kept simply because other similar articles haven't (yet?) been nominated for deletion is complete BS. Today we're talking about "List of fictional cats". Maybe tomorrow we'll talk about "List of fictional ducks".

Either We should allow all fictional lists of animals, or we should delete them all- it wouldn't make sense to only keep some, which nominating these individually opens the door for. These should definitely be in a group nomination, since if some are kept and some are deleted that would be a double standard and there would likely be many DRV's for all the deleted ones. However, I would support deletion of all these categories as a group, as I agree with the reasons for deletion. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 20:01, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Whether or not it meets a styleguide does not go to whether or not this is encyclopedic. To me it is not - it is more of a directory or trivia or indiscriminate collection naming any cat in any book or movie or tv show that ever was. It might be shorter to make a list of books, films, etc. that <i>don't</i> have cats. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 01:15, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There's no reason to delete the article unless you are also deleting every other 'list of fictional X' list on Wikipedia. In addition, for a more substantial argument, take a look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>, namely, 'Information'. A list of fictional cats is a valuable reference for anyone who is drawing on it for cross references ("Cats in literature and film"). Sure, the article could use some cleanup, but it is a valid list by Wikipedia's own guidelines. <a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELithorien_58e1.html" title="User:Lithorien">Lithorien</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> is a <i>style guideline</i>, not an inclusion/deletion policy. Saying something is useful information, or that there are <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">lots of other similar articles</a>, or <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">I like it</a> do not make something encyclopedic.

<li>When the person who started the nomination for deletion uses <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> for justification to delete, then it's fair to use it for justification to keep. If you'd like to throw out that part of the argument, you still have to address the fact that the list does contain useful information. <a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELithorien_58e1.html" title="User:Lithorien">Lithorien</a> 05:26, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is not true. Completely not true. Let's take an example <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Query_Tool_eb30.html" title="Advanced Query Tool">Advanced Query Tool</a>.

<dd>Not that it matters though - even if they were advertising, this is not an excuse for yours (this is a hint to admins to remove that advertising as well). <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuturix_f1b9.html" title="User:Futurix">Futurix</a> 11:52, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So they all advertising or not? If they advertising they all should be deleted, if they not advertising then your assertions about this page are biased because it has no differences from the other pages in this category. I just noticed that the article about viewer you created was added to the list of articles for deletion (hint, it was not me).

<p>Hi, yesterday everning I asked an absolutely neutral man, a very respected person, a university professor (I can give the contact information if it's necessary) to remake the article. Three Wikipedia policies of Verifiability, No Original Research and Neutral Point of View are observed.</p>
<p>In fact, before blaming in an advertisement let's understand the difference between an information article and an advertisement. If a mention about a thing with its short performance attributes is an advertisement, so this article and the main part of Wikipedia articles are advertisements. So, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parmalat.html" title="Parmalat">Parmalat</a> is an advertisement of yoghurts, cheeses, butters, ice creams. <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolshoi_Theatre_1846.html" title="Bolshoi Theatre">Bolshoi Theatre</a> is undoubtedly an advertisement of the theatre. <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nero_Burning_ROM_cf7b.html" title="Nero Burning ROM">Nero Burning ROM</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nero_Digital_01a8.html" title="Nero Digital">Nero Digital</a> are naturally avertisements of the appropriate shareware. Aside from, I guess the author of a product and the author of an article about the product may be the same person. All the more, such an accordance is nondescript.</p>

<dd>You must be kidding me!</dd>
<dd>It is not verifiable anywhere except your own page (<s>Verifiability</s>), it is written by author(s) of the software (<s>No Original Research</s>, <s>NPOV</s>) - the article violates every relevant Wikipedia rule.</dd>
<dd>Articles of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parmalat.html" title="Parmalat">Parmalat</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolshoi_Theatre_1846.html" title="Bolshoi Theatre">Bolshoi Theatre</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nero_Burning_ROM_cf7b.html" title="Nero Burning ROM">Nero Burning ROM</a>, etc - are informational texts written by third-party people, who <b>do not profit</b> from the article: that's the main difference here. In your case we have article about a new (virtually unknown) commercial product, written by authors of the software - do I <i>really</i> need to spell out what's wrong here?</dd>
<dd>And, finally, you clearly know all that - the translation of your message in Russian ("Sasha, don't worry. There are friends around, and <i>everyone wants to eat</i>.") implies that.</dd>

<li>I tagged it for speedy deletion as non-notable. I did so because the sources given in the article are not about this man. This first is mainly about his son, Rahm. The second is not a reliable source and is highly anti-semitic "He has been the Acting Deputy Chief, for North America, of The Mossad, Israeli Intelligence." and the 3rd mentions Benjamin, but the focus is again on his son, Rahm. As such, he fails WP:BIO, "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person".--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas.macmillan_a8c6.html" title="User:Thomas.macmillan">Thomas.macmillan</a> 19:30, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"American congressman Rahm Emanuel, is the son of a terrorist.… Rep. Rahm Emanuel, the Democrat congressman for the 5th District of Illinois in Chicago is the son of an Israeli terrorist. Rahm's father, Benjamin, was a member of the Irgun, the Zionist terrorist organization that coined a new word as they blew up hotels, train stations, and other buildings in Palestine in the 1930s and 40s. …Irgun, the army of his father, is short for Irgun Zvai Leumi, which supposedly means something like "National Military Organization" in Hebrew. As a matter of fact, the Irgun was simply a terrorist Zionist group that operated in Palestine from 1931 to 1948. They killed innocent Palestinians and British soldiers and blew up buildings."</dd>

Mel Etitis also took me to task on my user-talk page for "deleting large swathes of text". As I had posted my objections to the article before the edit removing the blogged material was allowed to stand, that is why it is mentioned. As the previous revision by <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">User:Mel Etitis</a> cited the bloggers belief that Benjamin M. Emanuel “participated in the assasination of Swedish diplomat Folke Bernadotte in 1948” I included the above points. I also included quotes from the blog about 9/11 being done by Irgun (of whom the blog claimed that "After 1948 they became part of the new Israeli government") to show that this source was not only unreliable but also anti-Semitic and a promoter of the generally discounted conspiracy theory that it was the Jews who were behind 9/11. I was astonished that it was being argued continually that these are reliable sources and that quoting them in any manner was acceptable according to wiki-standards. As Mel Etitis was an early contributor to the article that included the blog statements (see page history at 10:33, 7 January 2007 and 10:29, 7 January 2007) I was worried that he would simply revert <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">User:Chick Bowen</a>'s edits away to restore the blogged material and accuse him as he has me on my talk page of having "some personal or political axe to grind with regard to the articles on this family". (See also his accusation above that I'm "protecting a politician against what he sees as negative facts. he shouldn't be allowed to get his way on this.") These comments were made because I removed the same blogged statement that Benjamin M. Emanuel "was a member of the Irgun, a radical Zionist paramilitary organization" on the page <a href="../../../a/r/i/Ari_Emanuel_2954.html" title="Ari Emanuel">Ari Emanuel</a> that he allowed in his edit of that page on 10:35, 7 January 2007 and his edit on 19:47, 9 January 2007 <b>where he himself inserted</b> onto the <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahm_Emanuel_a3f4.html" title="Rahm Emanuel">Rahm Emanuel</a> page the claim that "Benjamin M. Emanuel, was a member of the <a href="../../../i/r/g/Irgun.html" title="Irgun">Irgun</a>, a radical Zionist paramilitary organization".

<b>Del</b> on this exquisite model of WP-Bio <i>style</i>, which nevertheless is technically eligible for <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">speedy-deletion under provision A7, no claim of notability</a>, and appears to address a n-n topic and person.</p>
<dl>
<dd>_ _ (IMO speedy deletion of such a long-standing and thoroughly collaborated-upon article would abuse both the process and the concept of "speedy".)</dd>
<dd>_ _ I will joyfully change my vote to Keep <i>if</i> it can be shown that seriously regarded academic Austen scholarship has kept alive any theory of how the night of the 2nd and morning of the 3rd of December 1802 had an impact in her writings -- perhaps mediated by later thots and discussions of them. But the absence of such information in such a polished bio makes me believe no such scholarship exists, despite its eminently plausibility but for the article's history. (I would add that evidence to its talk page, confident that others will eventually reflect it in the article, as would be necessary in the long run.)</dd>
<dd>_ _ I note that instances of notability are far, far fewer than instances of notability being avoided by at least one factor amounting to a hair's breadth, so that each of many such hair's-breadths are always what <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Road_Not_Taken_0984.html" title="The Road Not Taken">has made all the difference</a> in achieving notability rather than utter non-notablity. And being one of the hair's breadths that <i>didn't</i> prevent someones else's notablity is not in itself notable.</dd>
<dd>_ _ I also would hope that it is obvious that good men, fine manor houses, and English country squires are about <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_American_words_not_widely_used_in_the_United_Kingdom_9354.html#D" title="List of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom">a dime a dozen</a>, and thus non-notable, and i trust that the closer will require those asserting notability based on those elements to meet a high evidentiary standard.<br />

<li>There's certainly a place on Wikipedia for an encyclopedic treatment of cruising as a sociological phenomenon, but a <i>list</i> of cruising spots doesn't really fulfill that. For comparison, the article <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_bathhouse.html" title="Gay bathhouse">gay bathhouse</a> — which is certainly the model for how an article on gay cruising grounds should be structured — talks about the sociological aspects of bathhouse culture, but apart from noting a <i>few</i> specific bathhouses with special political or cultural significance, it does <i>not</i> provide an extensive list of specific individual bathhouses. And since I'm a gay man, my misgivings about this article are <i>not</i> coming from a homophobic or censorious place; it's genuinely coming from "does this really need to be in an <i>encyclopedia</i>?" The top blurb can be legitimately added to other articles and the list of cruising grounds is just unencyclopedic, so <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:34, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article is superfluous in MPOV. The great original <a href="../../../a/t/p/ATP_Masters_Series_be64.html" title="ATP Masters Series">ATP Masters Series</a> article contains all the relevant information on the subject, the detailed score of AMS finals. The semifinals and below results interests only few people, I think, mostly fans, who can find that info on the official pages that can be reached via the links in the main article. Moreover there are no such articles for 2006, 2005 etc and it does not seem that there is a need for them. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScineram_fd70.html" title="User:Scineram">Scineram</a> 20:31, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

The information is not superfluous, it's just expanded, just like what happens all over Wikipedia as more people get involved and current events are more in the picture. What makes you think only fans are interested in that information? The fact that there are no such articles in previous years is no reason to delete these, after all, they can and maybe should be created to prevent the main article to become too big in the future, just like what's done in other sports and other happenings all over Wikipedia. Also the fact that this is still a future event does not mean anything to me, this is happening in March already and there are many articles on events available already which start later than these events. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESportsAddicted_c1a4.html" title="User:SportsAddicted"><b>SportsAddicted</b></a> | <small><a href="../../../s/p/o/User_talk%7ESportsAddicted_7258.html" title="User talk:SportsAddicted"><font color="dimgray">discuss</font></a></small> 21:32, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi.

<p><b>KEEP:</b> This wiki entry covers a web phenomenon which has become popular for many reasons. One notable surge of users followed it being featured as one of the "year's 10 best time-killer websites" by the Times Newspaper (UK) I'm unable to provide proof: I didn't keep the paper. Personally, (If the site were my creation) I'd be pretty chuffed with that, and count it as a notable award.. Featured Questions have also been broadcast on Radio 1. (UK) though I'm unsure if they were correctly attributed&#160;:( I speak for many on the board: Not all are net-savy enough to edit these pages. Thanks for your time.

<dd>Most newspapers keep their archives online. If you could get someone to dig up a link, that would help, but there would need to be more than one to qualify under item one of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. If you can prove that the site's content is re-used by Radio 1, that might qualilfy under item three. If there's anything out there that will help the site pass wp:web, I'm sure one of your members will be able to turn it up pretty quickly. I've found a valid link to the click column, and I'm adding it to external links now; you'll still need more than one non-trivial mention in a book/newspaper/magazine to qualify under item one. It will be up to the participants in the discusion to determine if this or other media references are 'non-trivial.' -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 00:46, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> A "tidyup" has now occurred in a sincere attempt to bring this Wikipedia Entry in-line with earlier comments regarding the "Members" section.

<li><b>Very strong keep</b>. The record label is (or rather, was, sadly) notable, being one of the first feminist / lesbian record labels in the souther states of the U.S.A., and being recognised for this. The label distributed records by numerous notable feminist bands, including <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_Dresch_8cb4.html" title="Team Dresch">Team Dresch</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Tigre_79db.html" title="Le Tigre">Le Tigre</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Butchies_6f84.html" title="The Butchies">The Butchies</a>. It is tricky finding multiple reliable non-affiliated sources over the net for a indie label that went defunct in 2004, but I have done so, I believe:
<ul>
<li>First reliable source - a July 2004 farewell to the label from <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discorder.html" title="Discorder">Discorder</a>, the online magazine of <a href="../../../c/i/t/CITR-FM_aab8.html" title="CITR-FM">CITR-FM</a> (<a href="http://discorder.citr.ca/features/04julyfarewell.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://discorder.citr.ca/features/04julyfarewell.html" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>).</li>
<li>Second reliable source - <a href="http://www.soundunseen.com/2001/films/queerfilmvid.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.soundunseen.com/2001/films/queerfilmvid.html" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>, a flyer and background biog of the label (from an independant source) preceding a show on their video art work at the <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weisman_Art_Museum_0d76.html" title="Weisman Art Museum">Weisman Art Museum</a> in 2001.</li>
<li>Third reliable source - article on the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Weekly_4023.html" title="Independent Weekly">Independent Weekly</a> about the label - <a href="http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A16071" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A16071" rel="nofollow">[57]</a></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Bubba's right. If the band is notable then it should have an article on itself, not an article about the school where it comes from.

<dd>That doesn't make any sense. We don't usually make separate articles for notable high school sports teams and bands. If a school has a notable organization within it, that is reason to have an article about the school itself.

<dd>It makes perfect sense. If a high school would be notable simply and only for the fact that it has a notable band within its premises, then apart from the band there's nothing worthwhile to say about the school and therefore an article about the band would suffice. WP:SCHOOL is not a policy.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 14:46, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think if a school had 5 to 10 different notable organizations, it would be considered notable as a whole. The crux of this matter is two-fold: the notability of the school (contested), and the notability of the marching band (agreed) – therefore you would expect the claim to notability to be the main focus of the article and as such placed in a more prominent position. Just a thought. I'm still out for deliberation. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba_hotep_ee80.html" title="User:Bubba hotep">Bubba</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba_hotep_1f80.html" title="User talk:Bubba hotep">HoTep</a> 14:58, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, it states the history, that its a magnet school, scores a higher average on the SAT and ACT than the rest of the nation, 1 of 5 magnet school in its county, basketball team region champs in the frist year of play, baseball state semifinalist in 1st year of play, marching band 7th in nation first year of competing in the national competition, as well as 4th, 2nd, 3rd every year they competed, and (although not stated, but soon to be), the winterguard was the Scholastic A DCI World Champions in 2004. How can you say that none of that is notable? <a href="../../../p/b/r/User%7EPbroks13_cf72.html" title="User:Pbroks13">Pbroks13</a> 05:05, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The borderline between trivial and notable is at each one's own discretion. For me none of that information is encyclopedic. It's perfectly suited for the school's website which has the duty to provide that information, but not for Wikipedia which is meant to be an encyclopedia, not an indiscriminate collection of information that includes registries of all achievements of high school teams.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 05:16, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm perturbed by the above comment, and particularly perturbed that the person who made it did not feel able to contact me directly. I would encourage him to "assume good faith" here and elsewhere. I have added a note about why I participate in AfD debates to my user-page, which I hope is useful. I have also added a comment to the above user's talk-page. The problem for me is that I feel that for a school to be notable it has to do something more than just exist and teach students. The two places where notability might most plausibly be asserted for this school are: (a) the fact that it's a magnet school, and (b) the supposedly unusual steelwork in the architecture. On (a) I feel that although the policy of magnet schools is notable, the individual schools so designated are not per se notable unless their teaching styles develop unique characteristics that are not general to all magnet schools. On (b) I feel that the reference from the "Steel Joist Institute" simply uses the school as an example of an architectural and construction technique, and does not assert any particular notability for the school building per se. On balance, therefore, I do not feel that notability is sufficiently clearly established. I hope this helps. Please feel free to contact me if you need any further information. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:00, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see a need to blank the new page. The new page gives editors familiar with the subject an opportunity to start creating a decent list out of the mass-merge, while removing unencyclopedic detail from minor units.

<li>There is, in fact, quite a lot of serious documentation and discussion of elephant jokes in books and in journal articles, in particular of the elephant joke craze that began in the United States in 1963. (I've already cited one such article in <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folklore_of_the_United_States_dccb.html#Further_reading" title="Folklore of the United States">Folklore of the United States#Further reading</a>. There are plenty of others.) The problem with this article is that it contains almost none of this discussion, cites no sources, and relies mainly upon original research analyses by Wikipedia editors of the actual jokes themselves. That problem is a matter of cleanup, not deletion, however. Coincidentally, I've just improved <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaggy_dog_story.html" title="Shaggy dog story">shaggy dog story</a>, which was at one point just as bad as <i>this</i> article currently is. I'm rather pressed for time at the moment, but I'll have a go at improving this article too.
<p>To see that, per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, there's scope for more than a stub article here and that fixing this is simply a matter of modifying the article to use what sources provide, see the aforementioned journal article, pages 142 et seq. of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0765806592</a>, pages 59 et seq. of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0395572266</a>, pages 116 et seq. of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0813013968</a>, the whole of chapter 2 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0813117747</a>, pages 23–25 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0252027868</a>, and page 4 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0813918111</a>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: I agree that any Police Officer killed in the line of duty is notable enough to have an article here. I disagree that the names should be listed with the victims of the incident as Police Officers are not "victims". The officers intentionally placed themselves in harms way to protect others. To list them as victims implies that they had no control over their fate, when in fact they chose to put themselves in harms way(thus making them notable). I also disagree that <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob_Chestnut_82c6.html" title="Jacob Chestnut">Jacob Chestnut</a> is barely notable. being the "first" anyone to lie in honor at the capitol is notable, as a matter of fact if you did something earning you the right to lie in honor at the capitol, I'd say your notable enough to have an article here. <a href="../../../e/m/t/User%7EEMT1871_3b56.html" title="User:EMT1871">EMT1871</a> 22:32, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Man, I really wish people would stop acting like suggesting that this guy isn't notable enough for an article is a personal affront to them. Some of y'all need to take a step back and stop taking the nomination so personally.

<li>I find suggesting that a police officer killed in the line of duty is not notable enough to have an article on here personnaly offensive. secondly I'm pretty sure this is a forum for expressing our opinions on the subject so if my opinion is to strong for you, oh well. I happen to feel pretty strongly about this one, as is noted by the fact that I am writting anything here at all, and it happens to be a very personal issue for many people here. I find it personally offensive that the topic is even up for debate. Considering some of the things that pass as "notable" on this website,such as soccer players and minor celebreties, an article about a police officer killed in the line of duty should not even be questioned. As a matter of fact I would think that anyone who is a member of "wikiproject: Law Enforcement" would find this debate offensive.<a href="../../../e/m/t/User%7EEMT1871_3b56.html" title="User:EMT1871">EMT1871</a> 02:18, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I did not say that I found the opinions expressed "offensive." I said that taking this personally is an error.

<p><b>Situation Resolved</b> I have taken care of the problem with this article and followed the direction of most of the editors in merging all of the articles. I created a decent article which can be viewed <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Capitol_shooting_incident_%281998%29_d02a.html" title="U.S. Capitol shooting incident (1998)">HERE</a>. The concensus was heading that direction and instead of letting someone else lead the charge, I took care of it. The information for the articles for the two officers and the shooter have all been merged into one. Let me know if anyone has any other problems with this new article. --<a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaysleeper47_cafe.html" title="User:Daysleeper47">Daysleeper47</a> 14:40, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The only one making things up in their head is apparently you. First, "I did not say that I found the opinions expressed "offensive."...I never said you did say that, I said <b>I</b> found the suggestion that he is not notable enough offensive. Second, "Further, at no time did I suggest in any way that any editor was not free to express an opinion on this or any other nomination." My comment about this being a forum to express opinions was in response to your staement "I really wish people would stop acting like suggesting that this guy isn't notable enough for an article is a personal affront to them. " Your staement clearly shows a frustration at my opinion, the opinion of others, and expresses your feeling that we are too personally involved. I am free to express my opinion no matter if I take it as a "personal afront" or not and, i'll repeat, too bad if you dont like it. Thirdly, If you are going to suggest that a person killed while serving the community and protecting others is not notable enough to have an article here you should expect strong, heartfelt, opinions especially from the law enforcement community, firefighters etc.<a href="../../../e/m/t/User%7EEMT1871_3b56.html" title="User:EMT1871">EMT1871</a> 18:47, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

As I said again too bad if you don't like my opinion I certainly didnt ask you to agree with me. I also stated my opinion intelligently and did not resort to the use of profanity and name calling nor personally disparage you. It would also have been nice if when you typed your previous response you had actually read what I wrote first since you feverishly responded to remarks I did not make. Responding to my remarks and opinions with profanity, name calling and personal attacks again will causes me to report you to the administrators.<a href="../../../e/m/t/User%7EEMT1871_3b56.html" title="User:EMT1871">EMT1871</a> 22:32, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>To be perfectly honest, I have no idea if this guy meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. I was going to {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}, but I don't want to erronously tag an article if it <i>does</i> meet MUSIC. So, envoking the fact that AfD is meant to be a discussion, eat your heart out - I'm leaning towards delete currently because of the lack of souces, and no assertion of notability, however if someone can convince me his labels are notable, and find a source or two, I'm amacable to withdrawing. <b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant">Daniel.Bryant</a> <sup>[&#160;<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDaniel.Bryant_8f7b.html" title="User talk:Daniel.Bryant">T</a>&#160;·&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Daniel.Bryant_a73d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Daniel.Bryant">C</a>&#160;]</sup></b> 22:23, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> There is no notability asserted at all. The article is a copy of the rapper's <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dontcha" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dontcha" rel="nofollow">French WP page</a>, which also asserts no notability except for the fact that some of the people he's worked with are apparently notable enough to have French WP articles of their own (whereas they're all redlinks in the English WP). Google searching of various terms (i.e. Dontcha+"[album title]") does not bring up any reliable sources as far as I can see- but, of course, I can't speak French. Anyway, there's not much to this article; if, after the AfD has ended, someone digs up some sources establishing notability, it would take about 15 seconds to recreate the article. At this moment, it could probably be speedied. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 23:27, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Anyone on a game show might get some blurbs written about them, but unless they win, I don't think they qualify as notable. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 19:14, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've used the book as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> for biographical details of Culley, not for anything that happened in the <i>Big Brother</i> competition. The two <i>Guardian</i> articles are more about Culley than anything else, and certainly would not have been written if he had not done what he did. I fundamentally disagree with Leebo's last sentence; win or lose, <i>if</i> the non-trivial works exist, then the only logical conclusion would be to keep. In this case, there <i>is</i> an argument that sufficient works do not exist. Should the consensus be that the articles do not support a stand-alone article, then I would strongly support a merge. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEludium-q36_1333.html" title="User:Eludium-q36">Eludium-q36</a> 20:29, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In my last sentence I was referring to the situation in which there are not multiple non-trivial written publications supporting notability. Obviously, if the person is notable for something outside of the blurbs written about the show, that notability would apply. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 20:54, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Talbott and Flynn are the only two who appear to have played a game at a higher level than the Conference (I've added to those two articles to clarify this).

<p><b>Reply</b> I would argue the Conference is the lowest league that should have player profiles in its own right as it is a professional league (personally I think 5 full time divisions is too many) , Conference North and South are not so any profiles should only be for players who have dropped down. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam4eva_d312.html" title="User:Ram4eva">Ram4eva</a> 19:31, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So your telling me, hours of work on professional footballers is just going to be deleted off because they are not in the top flight, please! And what do you mean you could write an article about yourself, you have, it's called your user profile, wake up!. All I'm saying is that the lower down teams deserve as much recognition as the Premiership, these players still go out on Saturday afternoon and play football for 90 minutes and if you ask me, a better quality of football than the Premiership sometimes. If there was a profile for every player in the Conference who would that be hurting? No one. it would just educate people.

<dd>No, I'm not saying these players should be deleted because they're not playing in the top flight, don't put words in my mouth. The point is, if Wikipedia is to maintain its standards, there has to be a point whether you're either worthy of a page or not. According to guidelines <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, Conference players are the wrong side of that line, so they should be deleted. The point I was trying to make with "an article about myself" (and by the way, the userpage shouldn't really be an article about oneself!) is that you can't use the justification that people have put time into something as grounds for keeping it. One could create an article on something utterly trivial (like me!) and devote huge amounts of time to it, but that doesn't mean it's worthy of a place on Wikipedia.

<dd>No. If a player plays in League 2 or above they pass notability criteria. That's why I haven't nominated every single player in the Conference. All the players (well, not all, I've made a couple of mistakes) have only played as high as the Conference, and thus do not pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<dd>One thing is that the BBC, Sky Sports websites etc all give as much coverage on the Conference as they do on other leagues; the BBC site has profiles for all Conference National clubs, and Sky Sports provides news for them. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattythewhite_4aa4.html" title="User:Mattythewhite">Mattythewhite</a> 10:46, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Fair point, but I'd argue that the press covers them far less.

<dd>Sorry, but the principle of an encyclopedia is that it requires sources in order to make the information verifiable. If you can provide sources to show that these players played, then please do, but we can't just take the recollection of someone who may or may not have seen them when there is no other evidence- in effect, to do otherwise would be to accept original research, as odd as that might sound. I myself strongly disagree with opening the floodgates to allow semi-professional footballers at conference and conference north/south level, but this is of course open to debate. You may wish to argue with the point at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Football_158d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Football">Wikipedia:WikiProject Football</a>, and establish a new consensus of notability. The state at the moment, however, is that the players (with the exception of the few noted above) fall below the level of notability established by consensus at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, that is, footballers who have played in a <i>fully professional league</i>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 15:52, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah I have to agree, some hard work has been put into these profiles and it shouldn't matter whether they are world class players or semi professionals, people work hard to make these profiles for others benefit, I cannot believe some people have the time to go over wikipedia with a fine toothcombe looking for things they don't like, my advice is get a life pal, there are more important things in life than deleting off profiles of players that you don't like. Anyway Hornet man the way Watford are playing they will soon be in the Conference and we can delete off all their profiles when that happens.</dd>

<li><b>Keep all</b> - particularly those who have played one or more league games, U-21 internationals, or who have represented the English National Game XI. My experience is that Conference clubs/players DO get almost as much write up as their League 2 equivalents - the results are read out on Final Score/5 Live etc, and listed in the same newspapers as the League 2 results. Bookies offer odds on them the same way as League 2 games. Plus, there is a 60-page newspaper each week "The Non-League Paper", of which probably half is dedicated to Conference reports/features/speculation etc. Not to mention local sources. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 17:48, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</dl>
<p>Following several days of discussion on <a href="../../../m/i/s/Talk%7EMisunderstandings_about_evolution_a666.html" title="Talk:Misunderstandings about evolution">Talk:Misunderstandings about evolution</a> (see also <a href="../../../e/v/o/Talk%7EEvolution_Archive_20_74f3.html#Creating_a_new_article_for_Misunderstandings_About_Evolution" title="Talk:Evolution/Archive 20">Talk:Evolution</a>), there seems to be significant support for the idea of deleting this article, and moving whatever useful information it has to other articles, such as the newly-planned article <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objections_to_evolution.html" title="Objections to evolution">Objections to evolution</a> (a more NPOV approach to addressing misunderstanding-based criticisms of evolutionary theory). Although it is indeed important to clear up common misconceptions about evolution, the topic does not merit an entire article (it can be addressed briefly on articles like <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html#Misunderstandings" title="Evolution">Evolution</a>, and in more depth on articles like <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution_as_theory_and_fact.html" title="Evolution as theory and fact">Evolution as theory and fact</a>, <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution_%28term%29.html" title="Evolution (term)">Evolution (term)</a>, and <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entropy_and_life.html" title="Entropy and life">Entropy and life</a>; a middleman article is quite unnecessary and superfluous), and there is no precedent for naming articles about people's views (even clearly counterfactual views) specifically as "Misunderstandings".</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> of such an article seems very dubious; consider that in many cases it touches specifically on creationist <i>arguments</i>, not just on the misunderstandings that underly many of them. It has an entire section for the creation-evolution controversy, thus practically stating outright that the entire controversy is a "misunderstanding". Regardless of whether or not this is true, it is not Wikipedia's place to make such judgment calls; we should simply present the facts, backed up by reputable sources, and allow readers to weigh the arguments largely on their own. Therefore, although it may indeed be accurate to characterize most, or even all, creationist arguments as resting on misunderstandings, that doesn't make it acceptable (or necessary or helpful, for that matter) to bend <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> just to over-emphasize that. We only discredit ourselves in the process.</p>
<p>The topic and title of the article, thus, is at the very least a borderline violation of NPOV, if not a clear-cut case (not to mention grammatically dubious; misunderstandings "about", rather than "of"?). And the informational contents of the article can all much more easily and thoroughly be provided by transferring those contents to other pages, such as the in-development "Objections" page, and the many more specific articles on these topics. Without any good reason to bend or ignore our NPOV standards just for the sake of a largely redundant and unhelpful article, I propose that we either delete this article outright, or, if the edit history is deemed important enough to save, move it to <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objections_to_evolution.html" title="Objections to evolution">Objections to evolution</a>, where it can be rewritten almost from scratch and where we will be able to provide a much more in-depth, thorough, balanced, and informative article on pretty much all of the same topics. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 00:15, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> We should move this material to a new <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objections_to_evolution.html" title="Objections to evolution">Objections to evolution</a> article. It is all good stuff, however (although more editing and cleaning up wouldnt hurt). I wonder if in the meantime, we should just change its name to <b>Objections to evolution</b> so it can continue to garner contributions and ideas while the other sections of the <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objections_to_evolution.html" title="Objections to evolution">Objections to evolution</a> are being worked on?--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 00:25, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Perhaps. Almost all of the article will need to be rewritten if we change its scope so thoroughly, however; we'll still be able to provide most of the contents, but the wordings, presentation, layout, introduction, etc. will need revising. I've posted up a preliminary draft of one possible layout (and a few sections I've worked on, drawing significantly from your excellent work on things like the "Falsifiability" page) at <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_Evolution_14e9.html" title="User:Silence/Evolution">User:Silence/Evolution</a> which anyone can feel free to edit. That page also incorporates most of the important information from <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misunderstandings_about_evolution.html" title="Misunderstandings about evolution">Misunderstandings about evolution</a> already, so it's another candidate for moving to the new name if users decide to delete, rather than move, this page. The main advantage I can see to a move is that it would preserve the Talk and the longer histories; the main disadvantage is that it would give more of an impression of bias to later outside observers, though I don't see that as a major concern. Our main concern should be providing users with a valuable resource for information, not with looking good. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 00:29, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redo and move to the proposed article</b> or <b>Delete</b>. It's an odd coincidence that these "misunderstandings" are basically Creationist arguments. The article should be re-written as "Objections to evolution", or otherwise deleted.

Those of a graduate student trying to learn the material and making a mistake?

I am in the midst of a substantial rewrite of <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution_as_a_theory_and_fact.html" title="Evolution as a theory and fact">Evolution as a theory and fact</a> to address more of the confusion and misunderstandings that these discussions have amply revealed, and still exist in public discourse and the media. It will have many more references and be more carefully written. If you look at the talk page of <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misunderstandings_of_evolution.html" title="Misunderstandings of evolution">Misunderstandings of evolution</a>, you will see that there is a substantial amount of other material that will go in this article once it is renamed, and quite a bit already exists in two other separate sandbox articles. It would be nice if everything could be addressed in one short article or in one short paragraph, but the fact is, this is a huge issue, and it is not going away any time soon.

<li>You misunderstand the meaning of "argument": an argument cannot be a misunderstanding, anymore than a book can be a misunderstanding. An argument, or book, can be <i>based</i> on misunderstandings, or can contain misunderstandings, but neither can themselves be "misunderstandings". You also misunderstand the meaning of "valid": validity is not dependent upon the truth of premises (i.e., it doesn't matter whether the premises are misunderstandings), but on whether the conclusion follows from the premises. It is impossible to "frame" a misunderstanding into an argument; creationists' arguments aren't misunderstandings, they're <i>reliant</i> upon misunderstandings. For example, "Evolution is a theory. Theories are just guesses. Therefore evolution is just a guess." This argument is not a misunderstanding, but it's <i>based</i> on one ("Theories are just guesses"), which makes it, although valid, entirely unsound.</li>

<li>But it is outside the scope of an article on "Misunderstandings" to assess arguments against, criticisms of, or objections to evolution, even though doing so has much more potential to be informative to readers than only addressessing the misunderstandings; in contrast, an "Objections" article to address every single one of the misunderstandings involved in the page, since, as has been noted, the misunderstandings form a key part of the objections (but the objections are not themselves misunderstandings, so we couldn't do the reverse and interject every major creationist argument into the "misunderstandings" page). I couldn't care less whether we end up moving, redirecting, or deleting this article (there is already one explicit vote for just "deleting" so far, and several votes considering that possibility, so it seems worthwhile to continue the discussion rather than speedying anything, since there's no hurry anyway), but I don't see any reason at all to keep it around as-is.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is more informative, and it also means replicating a lot of stuff that is already well laid out elsewhere, like talk.origins. The point initially was to actually avoid doing that.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, it is important to note that just because a premise is factually inaccurate, doesn't make it a "misunderstanding". To conclude from the fact that a creationist argument is faulty that it must be based on a misunderstanding is to assume that we can see into the minds of everyone. Obviously it is fully possible for someone to make an argument that simply deliberately relies on falsehoods. Because there is no reliable method for reading someone's mind to see whether they "understand" something (it can only be inferred from their actions), distinguishing misunderstandings from deliberate falsehoods is impossible, and it's not Wikipedia's duty to stick its neck out to try and discern such things. What matters for our purposes is the various arguments, and the factual errors they may involve, surrounding evolution; an "Objections" article can address all the relevant issues much more effectively and directly than a "Misunderstandings" article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's why we focus on <b>known</b> misunderstandings; magically no mind reading is required. It can also be said we assume good faith for those who put forward the arguments, and that they would not rely on falsehoods. Again, we didn't see an immediate need to address "all the relevant issues" in that initial section; but I feel it did address the relevant issues insofar as misunderstandings go. If you feel the scope needs to be changed; well then the sections focus does need to shift.

<dd>"Its simply a POV one can adopt regarding a subject to maintain a NPOV framing of a debate"? How on earth can adopting a POV help maintain NPOV?! Wikipedia should neither adopt the POV that creationists do not misunderstand evolution (and thus are disingenuous in their objections), nor adopt the POV that creationists are genuine in their objections (and thus misunderstand evolution); it should simply state the fact that they object to evolution, explain their objections, provide verifiable responses where appropriate, and not participate in, or weigh in on, the disagreement itself.</dd>
<dd>Besides, isn't it much more valuable to our readers, and much more <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and concrete, to provide specific examples of these claims rather than shirking from "referencing specific people"?

After all, the confusion has been written into state law or considered for inclusion as part of state law in over 20 states, if I am not mistaken (maybe as many as 40 states). Since there is a strong opinion that the previous status quo was adequate, I think this is worthy of inspection, since that is what spurred Orangemarlin and I to create it in the first place. We asked for a while if anyone was interested in making the sections that existed in <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> actually readable, and no one responded after days of asking.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- as a pedagogical idea, "misunderstandings" and misconceptions are very encyclopedic. I do not buy the argument that such an article cannot be NPOV. It is well-documented that there are many misconceptions and misunderstandings about evolution that surface during the creation-evolution controversy. This is not to take sides: it is to simply point out where those verifiable and documented misunderstandings take place. I think this has the propensity to be an excellent article and think that its surpression is the result of people being too wary of addressing misunderstandings (which are well-documented in the article by the way) head-on. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 05:49, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

There is obviously enough material for an article here, so I cannot for the life of me divine what exactly your rationale is for trying to get this particular article deleted. To me "Objections" looks like a much bigger problem in terms of article naming. While a misunderstanding can be documented as a lapse in rational thought or due to a lack of complete information, "objections" can be levied with impunity and without regard for research. No, "objections to evolution", as I see it, shouldn't be an article while "misunderstandings" seems much more appropriate and NPOV. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 15:47, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A "lapse in rational thought" cannot be documented, nor is it NPOV for Wikipedia to state as fact that a person, organization, or movement is suffering a "lapse in rational thought", even if it's <i>true</i>. To claim that it is suitably NPOV to explicitly state in an article title that certain common beliefs are "lapses in rational thought" is to demonstrate a profound misunderstanding (or "lapse in rational thought"?) of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> itself.</dd>
<dd>And nobody has "complete information", so if lacking complete information is sufficient to make something a "misunderstanding", <i>everyone</i> misunderstands <i>everything</i>. Misunderstandings are defined by being <i>false</i>, not solely by being based on incomplete information; an article called "Falsehoods spread by creationists", "Errors in creationist arguments", or "Irrational objections to evolution" would be POVed, so why is a "Misunderstandings" article which lists common creationist claims so much more acceptable, much less <i>ideal</i>?</dd>
<dd>The reason I haven't bothered to go into specific examples of POV in the article itself in depth (e.g., the presence of a "Social and religious controversies" section in a "Misunderstandings about evolution" article) is because POV problems <i>within</i> the text should be resolved by fixing them, not by deleting or moving the article; it is because the POV problems are with <i>the article title/topic itself</i> that merely changing the text would not resolve the problem. Therefore it is the title/topic, not the specific claims <i>within</i> the article, that are important to discuss, and that is exactly what I've been discussing, and provided a number of valid arguments against, thus far.</dd>
<dd>Your argument against making an "Objections" article ("'objections' can be levied with impunity and without regard for research") is absurd, as it is not Wikipedia's responsibility to censor objections based on how well-researched they are; our standards for including a certain argument on the encyclopedia are notability and commonness, not validity or evidential basis. Indeed, it is the very <i>fact</i> that objections can be levied with impunity and without regard for research that makes having an article on them so important, since that's the only way to neutrally <i>point out</i> how poorly-researched just about all of the objections to evolution really are! -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 17:44, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't see how it's a "creationist stance" to want Wikipedia to cover an article as important as "Objections to evolution", nor how it's creationistic to take the commonsensical view that such an article would have so much overlap with "Misunderstandings about evolution" as to render the latter article superfluous. A "creationist stance" would be to argue for making an article like Problems with evolution or Evolutionist lies, or would argue for deleting "Misunderstandings" because it's false (which it isn't) rather than because it's POVed and too limited in scope. Conflating my arguments with a typical creationist's arguments is clearly both inaccurate and a <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">failure to assume good faith</a>, and serves no purpose except to polarize an important discussion and discourage reasoned, open-minded discourse. Consequently, whether the purpose of this <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_fallacy.html" title="Association fallacy">association fallacy</a> is to vilify me or simply to shame me into changing my mind, it seems rather counterproductive.</li>
<li>I support an article called "Objections to evolution" because such an article will be much more useful for clearing up people's misunderstandings than one called "Misunderstandings about evolution", a much more limited and stunted topic with much more debatable contents. For example, which of the <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/list.html" class="external text" title="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/list.html" rel="nofollow">creationist claims on TalkOrigins</a> are misunderstandings, and which are not? Is everything <i>incorrect</i> a misunderstanding? If so, we can list anything we want on a "misunderstandings" page, including amazingly subjective arguments (i.e., ones that aren't strictly factual and don't directly address the science of evolution, but rather are more philosophical or vague) like "Evolution is immoral", "Were you there?", "Evolution is atheistic", "Evolution is a religion", "Evolution assumes naturalism", "Evolution assumes uniformitarianism", "The Bible contradicts evolution", or "Design requires a designer". Are all of these simple "misunderstandings"?</li>
<li>Where do you draw the line between misunderstandings and non-misunderstandings, when dealing with so many complex claims that so many people believe passionately in? Distinguishing between the two is simply too subjective, and too contentious and counterproductive in the long term, for an article like this to be practical, as long as it's dealing so heavily with common creationist claims.</li>
<li>The reason "Misunderstandings" should be changed to "Objections" is not to appease creationists, but to appease <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#The_neutral_point_of_view" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#The_neutral_point_of_view</a>. There is simply no precedent on Wikipedia for outright saying that a certain common point of view is false, which is what a "misunderstandings" article on such a disputed issue amounts to. Even articles like <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> never once simply come out and say "Racism is false" or "Racism is a misunderstanding", even though racism contradicts science much more directly and thoroughly than even creationism does! Rather, they merely present the different facts and opinions on the issue and let readers come to their own conclusions.</li>
<li>The reason it is inappropriate to list a bunch of widely-used creationist arguments in a "Misunderstandings" page is the same reason it is inappropriate to make a "Creationist lies" page; it might be a fact that many creationists misunderstand many aspects of evolution, and it might be just as much of a fact that many creationists deliberately lie and deceive (though how <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> these facts are may be debatable), but neither of these claims should be part of the <i>article title itself</i>, as this presupposes a specific point or agenda that is being made about common creationist arguments. Even if we make that point perfectly clear in the <i>article text</i>, by providing well-referenced objections to creationist arguments like "Evolution is just a theory", we should not give readers of Wikipedia even the <i>impression</i> that Wikipedia is biased by making the article title itself so loaded in scope.</li>
<li>Whether or not it is a "fact" that these are misunderstandings is immaterial; Wikipedia judges whether or not something is a "fact" based on whether or not it is <i>seriously disputed</i> (from <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>: "By 'fact' we mean 'a piece of information about which there is no serious dispute.'"), not based on how obvious something seems to an article's editors. Thus, although it may be a "fact" that creationist claims are misunderstandings from our view, it is not a "fact" in the Wikipedian sense (except in articles that are specifically and solely scientific, like <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> itself, where experts in the field, not popular opinion or movements like creationism, are relevant), because it's not 100% undisputed. This is the exact reason why it is not stated anywhere in the <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Earth_creationism_db9a.html" title="Young Earth creationism">Young Earth creationism</a> article that "Young Earth creationism is false", or even that "Young Earth creationism misunderstands science". It's because, even if something is <i>true</i>, it should be attributed to a source (rather than claimed by Wikipedia itself) when it is disputed. This is the same reason that an "Objections" article is so much more Wikipedian, and encyclopedic, than a "Misunderstandings" article. As soon as you successfully and lastingly change the lead section of "Young Earth creationism" to state "Young Earth creationism is false" or "Young Earth Creationism is a misunderstanding", I will stop opposing this article. Until then, it is applying a double standard for us to treat this article differently than we treat all others.</li>
<li>The easiest, simplest, and most productive solution to avoiding years of fruitless squabbling over where to draw the line between misunderstandings and non-misunderstandings is simply to sidestep this trivial issue while still presenting all the same information to our readers, by changing the scope of the article to "Objections to evolution". Although there may still be <i>some</i> article disputes over a topic like this over time (that's inevitable for any article related to the creation-evolution dispute), at least these are likely to mostly be concerned with content issues, not with the basic question of what to include, making improving, fleshing out, polishing, and maintaining such an article in the long run much easier and more efficient. It will also provide a much wider range of topics to users, and will <i>indirectly</i> clear up their misunderstandings without resorting to the rather unencyclopedic tactic of listing a bunch of severely lacking and objectionable arguments against evolution as mere "Misunderstandings". -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 17:44, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Oppose</b> - As a non-American I find this conversation bizarre and I wonder why it is included in a world-wide encyclopedia. Should we have pages on "objections to gravity", "objections to the proposal to use fire for cooking and heating"? The problem stems from the failure of parts of the US eduction system and an article on "Misunderstandings about evolution" might help clarify this issue.--<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrahamec_491a.html" title="User:Grahamec">Grahamec</a> 04:13, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>First, although this is a worldwide encyclopedia, since this is such a huge issue in the US, it is also important from a world perspective, since the US includes a large fraction of the Western world, and also forms a large part of the world's economy. The US also has an inordinately large effect on the culture of the rest of the world, so if this does happen in the US, it is a bit premature to expect that similar things might not happen elsewhere. Also, there have been problems with creationism in the UK, in Russia, in Serbia, in Poland, in Italy etc. The Muslim world also struggles with their own brand of creationism, as does the Hindu World. So if we start to add up the people affected or potentially affected by creationism, a conservative estimate is well in excess of one out of three people on earth, and certainly more than one out of three people in the developed Western world. If we concentrate on the AngloSaxon world, the ratio might be even more pronounced. It is partly because of problems with the US education system, but it is far more complicated than that. If you make such a claim, it tells me that you know very little about the US, and it demonstrates an even greater reason to include this sort of material in an encyclopedia, because you clearly do not understand the US, which has a huge influence on the English speaking world, and on Australia in particular. Misunderstandings is just a subset of the Objections. And that is why it is more appropriate to have an Objections article. Also Misunderstandings opens itself to charges of NPOV far more.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 04:25, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As soon as creationists start objecting to gravity in enough detail and with enough verifiable frequency to merit a separate article, feel free to make Objections to gravity. Likewise, I could see a strong case being made for creating an Objections to the Big Bang article, as this is a very common creationist theme and has a lot of different facets, though not nearly as many as the objections to evolution do—and the objections to evolution are much more noteworthy because they have played a central role in a number of recent U.S. court cases that have shaped and reaffirmed the implementation of the <a href="../../../e/s/t/Establishment_Clause_ff25.html" title="Establishment Clause">Establishment Clause</a>. At best, such objections to evolution will be an important historical footnote; at worst, they could foreshadow a future anti-intellectual dark age. In either case, they are noteworthy, verifiable, and relevant enough to merit an article. The fact that an objection or criticism is <i>ridiculous</i> or <i>baseless</i> does not make it non-noteworthy! What Wikipedia policy page says that an article's topic is inappropriate for Wikipedia if it is "bizarre"?</dd>
<dd>You yourself note that this is a "world-wide encyclopedia", which means that topics that are important only in a specific part of the world—including the United States—are worthy of inclusion. They do not need to make international headlines; national ones suffice. As an American, I find creationism's claims bizarre too, and in many cases laughably unsubstantiated. But that doesn't mean that they don't <i>exist</i>, nor that they aren't important enough to be neutrally reported on in a Wikipedia article. If you want us to make up for the U.S. education system's failures, then the correct article for us to work on is <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a>, not <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misunderstandings_about_evolution.html" title="Misunderstandings about evolution">Misunderstandings about evolution</a>; the best way to clear up misunderstandings is to nip them at the bud and try to clearly and thoroughly explain what evolution <i>is</i>, rather than just what it <i>isn't</i>—the best way is not to presume that we can predict every aspect of evolution that will be misunderstood by anyone. If a lot of people misunderstand George Washington, does that mean that we should leap to make a Misunderstandings about George Washington article, or that we should try to further clarify and improve the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> article itself?</dd>
<dd>For the same reason, misunderstandings of evolution should be covered on <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> and, for more depth, in their specific areas (e.g., misunderstandings of natural selection in <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_selection.html" title="Natural selection">Natural selection</a>, misunderstandings of vestigial structures in <a href="../../../v/e/s/Vestigial_structure.html" title="Vestigial structure">Vestigial structure</a>...), not in a generic "Misunderstandings" article. And since clearly the main intention of such an article was to undermine the major creationist objections to evolution, both the stated and the unstated purposes of <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misunderstandings_about_evolution.html" title="Misunderstandings about evolution">Misunderstandings about evolution</a> can be better served by an "Objections" article. Where misunderstandings merit in-depth coverage (i.e., beyond the level at <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html#Misunderstandings" title="Evolution">Evolution#Misunderstandings</a>), they by and large merit it as a result of their common usage in the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">creation-evolution controversy</a>, which means that the ideal place to thoroughly, and neutrally, discuss them is at an article like <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objections_to_evolution.html" title="Objections to evolution">Objections to evolution</a>. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 04:28, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The Objections article is explicitly not about scientific objections, but about objections in general. See <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_Evolution_14e9.html" title="User:Silence/Evolution">User:Silence/Evolution</a> for the draft, which, unlike the "Misunderstandings" page, makes it exceedingly clear that there is no scientific controversy regarding evolution. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 16:45, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, other than the "Evolution is a theory" and "Devolution is possible" sections on the Misunderstandings page, I don't think that <i>any</i> of the topics covered on <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misunderstandings_about_evolution.html" title="Misunderstandings about evolution">Misunderstandings about evolution</a> are very common among laypeople, other than laypeople who are either creationists or perhaps agnostics who have been significantly exposed to creationist literature. There might be a common misconception that "Evolution is unproven/hasn't been observed", but the specific claim that speciation hasn't been observed is a creationist trademark; even more so, the the entropy and information arguments are <i>exclusive creationist arguments</i>. They're creationist claims first, and misconceptions second, because they didn't arise until after creationists tried to think up possible scientific-seeming ways to object to evolution and ended up resorting to thermodynamic laws and information theory. It is disingenuous to present arguments which only creationists use as though they were general-use misunderstandings, i.e., the kind of things that high-school biology students, for example, are remotely likely to get wrong. Although they are <i>based</i> on misunderstandings, the information theory and thermodynamic arguments are quite complex and sophisticated (albeit pseudoscientific) falsehoods. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 17:04, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes. The reason this article is different from the "AIDS misconceptions" article is that the distinction between misunderstandings and objections to evolution is so fluid, and the two topics are so fundamentally interwoven. To try to artifically subdivide the two would be both an unnecessary hardship on editors, as it will require much more work to try and neutrally distinguish misunderstandings fom non-misunderstandings, and a disservice to interested readers, as it will be withholding tons of important and relevant information from them. Misconceptions about AIDS are almost solely a result of lack of education; misconceptions about evolution, in contrast, are a complex mix of natural misunderstandings and a huge number of deliberate distortions and falsehoods resulting from decades of creationist propaganda. Once we strip away all the misunderstandings that <i>aren't</i> used by creationists as objections to evolution, we strip away pretty much everything that would make a "Misunderstandings" article useful to begin with. I say, kill two birds with one stone by presenting the two interrelated topics together, and thus avoiding the problem of having to sort mere misunderstandings from lies, distortions, arguments, and criticisms. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 23:06, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm fine with a page move or redirect. This deletion discussion is a useful way to get broad community input before we decide what to do; it shouldn't be assumed that the only two options are to delete the page and its history, or to keep the article exactly as it is. We should discuss all the options. I'm not in favor of deleting any page histories just because I proposed this AfD; even if it ends up getting "deleted" rather than moved, it makes more sense to turn it into a redirect. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 02:22, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
