<dd><b>Comment:</b> Could an admin have a look at all these votes? I find it highly suspicious that everyone would vote in the same way, contrary to the MO of everyone else on every other VfD item (usually by using "Keep"). Also, most of these people have almost no contributions other than to create a user page and vote on this site. A couple of the accounts appear to be "stealth" accounts in that they were used sporadically to make one or two edits a month, and then suddenly they vote on this account. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 02:37, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC). Never mind, looks like everyone's looking into it already.</dd>
</dl>
<p>BTW A quick snytax analysis of the majority of the following vote <i>against</i> deletion entries shows them to be written by the same person.</p>
<p>-- not reallly. you'll note similarities, but the use of the "vote against" would be a very striaght forward notation to make for as the prior votes carried it.</p>

<dd>It would be fair to say that has already been discussed, and while a large number of votes were cast by first-edit users, they were not the same person.

<li>Most of us are probably fairly new to wikipedia, although I have used it before many times, I only edited very recently. We agree that the article needs a great deal more work, and will have a complete reworking within 4 days. However, having gotten involved in editing now, I will no doubt take a much greater interest in the wikipedia and in correcting articles. Please do not suggest that simply because someone is new they are false. <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpideme_1b9b.html" title="User:Epideme">Epideme</a> 02:43, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>vote <b>against</b> deletion. If we delete this, how about the numerous other minor celebs that have pages here? Like the people from Slashdot or some minor character from a cut-rate 1960's sitcom? Full disclosure: I am the head moderator at UserFriendly and the initial creator of this page.

<li>Vote <b>against</b> deletion. As the creative force behind a highly successful web comic - <a href="http://www.userfriendly.org" class="external text" title="http://www.userfriendly.org" rel="nofollow">UserFriendly</a>, J.D. Frazier would be worthy of inclusion, but his contributions go beyond that of a typical web-toonist. Utilizing humor, he has been a visible and vocal advocate for the open source software movement since the strip's debut in November of 1997. It should also be noted that the strip has been online continuously since that time. In addition, the standards he has set (and consistently maintained) for the electronic community that evolved around the comic strip have allowed it to become a favored source for not only general discussions, but one which also provides significant contributions in terms of collaborative technical support in a positive, non-threatening manner. As the creator of this presence, his inclusion in this wiki is merited. Dire Lobo 01:09, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment - looks like we've got a horde of UF forum-goers making their presence known. I hate to tell you this, guys, but your votes aren't going to count much.

<li>Not all of us are carpetbaggers...look at our contribution history. Past that, there are very valid points here and I haven't seen anything that I would consider a valid point for deletion, even if it were for something I didn't particularly like on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickstart70_e0ea.html" title="User:Kickstart70">Kickstart70</a> 02:04, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Alright, so let's discuss what the reasons are for keeping and deletion. He is the creator of a very popular comic strip that has been running for over 7 years and is syndicated in multiple newspapers. I notice there are no VfDs for the Wikipedia page on the strip itself, so I believe that the creator of the strip should have a page. According to Alexa, the site is ranked 17165 in popularity according to its rankings. Other strips' creators have pages that are not disputed. How about you give us a chance to provide content? <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickstart70_e0ea.html" title="User:Kickstart70">Kickstart70</a> 02:58, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>So improve the article. And <i>please</i> stop people coming over from UF for the sole purpose of voting against deletion, because it doesn't help at all, as you should know if you've been here long enough. <b>Keep and expand</b>. Raven42 03:19, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Article much improved. I think that if we get rid of the VfD then no one is going to keep coming here (FWIW, I -did- make a request for <b>registered</b> users to come voice their opinion here. I didn't think anyone would register specifically for that purpose. However, I don't control their extra-UserFriendly actions, so I can't do a whole lot about what they do here. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickstart70_e0ea.html" title="User:Kickstart70">Kickstart70</a> 03:28, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Well, your request probably worked. However, I would have done a quite search for notability before voting. To tell you the truth, seeing all the flood voting just brought up my suspicions and I voted for an extreme delete before even making a notability check. Please realise that flood voting isn't the only way to make your voice heard. Often, it takes just one vote or comment with a good explanation and the veterans will vote for your side. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 03:44, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Cleanup and keep</b>. Okay, I looked into UF after getting an explanation from <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpideme_1b9b.html" title="User:Epideme">Epideme</a>. UF appears notable enough, with an Alexa rank of 17,165. However, I agree with Raven42, as I explained to Epideme, VfD flood votes out of the blue from new users look highly suspicious. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 03:37, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> I can understand why we don't explicitly say "no new user voting", but I wonder if it might be a good idea to update the {{vfd}} tag to say that new users should probably write on the talk page or make comments instead of actually voting? This kind of flood voting feels like we just got Slashdotted or something. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 03:37, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>sorry to hit the system so hard - "UFies" are a fairly loyal bunch. Apologies if it caused any consternation. It <b>has</b> gotten me more interested in becoming a more regular contributor (if you'll be patient with me while I learn the nuances of the system)! There is a synonym for "Slashdotted" - It's known as "UFied" - and I think you've just experienced it - again, my humble apologies.

<li>That has a lot to do with the standards and expectations of the community (and it's members). Proper grammar and spelling is an expectation (of course as soon as I typed that I noticed an error in my previous "post" - and had to go fix it). I look forward to learning more about the Wiki and its processes. Dire Lobo 04:35, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
