<li><b>Comment</b> This issue has surfaced many times before. When does a brand become notable enough for its own entry as opposed to a redirect to the comapny that makes or sells it? In this case, the article is simply a list of associated brandnames. I can't see how that is notable in-and-of itself? If there was a controversy, a history or some other dissociated aspect of the brand attached to it, then it would be clear. But as it stands, this is essentially empty so why not redirect to <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vistakon.html" title="Vistakon">Vistakon</a> or J&amp;J? <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 10:19, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for this information.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> not only does the article utterly fail to establish notability, the fact that the author removed the AfD notice just screams that this thing needs to go. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> 01:13, 18 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Removed it twice, in fact. And I wouldn't be surprised to see it happen again, as the second time around he replaced the AfD notice with "FUCK YOU DONT DELETE MY SHIT WHILE IM WORKIN ON MAKING IT GOOD." Hey, buddy, if you're reading this -- the AfD notice won't affect your work on it; if you turn it into a good article about a notable band, it will not get deleted, and I (and, I presume, Caesar over there) will be glad to change our votes. If, on the other hand, it's a non-notable band (see <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> for guidelines about that), you're probably wasting your time. In any case, if you keep deleting the AfD notice, you'll only hurt your chances and end up being banned in the process.

Not only are the WP:CORP notability criteria not satisfied, the company is barely even verifiable. Indeed, the article says this outright ("alkhemi [...] is [...] relatively unknown outside it's [sic] network of clients").

<li><b>Keep</b> I believe the work to be very notable; from Copenhagen and Arhus (I am Danish myself) I know of the work to be ‘real’ so I am personally shocked to be in such a discussion. I have decided to follow my instinct and have completely rewritten the page, which will partly meet the objections lodged here but makes clearer why the page should be ‘in’ Wikipedia – others may revert my edits so please click on history! I made some comments in the discussion page previously. '<b>I strongly urge a re-read and invite ‘confreres’ in a constructive spirit for suggestions for WHERE this can now be placed'</b>. In its professional circles alkhemi is considered a pioneer as it prepared the first ever integrated cultural plan for a capital city; also, cultural policy, planning and strategy nowadays is a blossoming field and it should not be only civil servants or technocrats who should know what work/actions are taking place. YOU may not wish to read about the work – but for others it is significant. I was able to have an enlightening and inspiring time reading Wikipedia guidelines. I can see that the subject matter is trapped between two stools (is this the right expression?) and that by the criteria of WP:CORP this article likely slips into the cracks. I recognise that the article could be in another category and maybe merged/moved – to what?

<li>Very good point. I looks like Aladin is not notable neither: His credits are: Rarely performs, had some job for the city of London, is in a book that titled "the book of cool". The article, like Alkhemi, has probably been set up to gain exposure through wikipedia. I would definitely support a delete vote on that one as well. By the way: is there a way to prevent vote-stuffing by a determined individual who just creates a big mass of accounts? Because in those discussions I had, it felt like the author of those two articles is just crazy enough to even do that. Just a feeling. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> 23:30, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, the only way to 'prevent' it is to pay attention to who votes, and what their edit history has been. The Admins apparently do a pretty fair job of it, too. <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEaglizard_0156.html" title="User:Eaglizard">Eaglizard</a> 03:20, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can see that it was best for no page by this title; these discussions are problematic. It is of parochial interest (to Wikipedia enthusiasts) whether ‘alkhemi’ is listed. Of wider concern is the nature of comments, which border on the defamatory or libellous. But I am sure ‘alkhemi’ will persist for longer than the exchanges here! The knowledge of its work may not impinge this, online context but resonates in the ‘real’ world and last year in 2004 I was fortunate, even privileged, to view some of it in Arhus. I join with Thomas in wishing that the page is ‘kept’ while not endorsing some of the views expressed hereDelarouism 12:46, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>On reviewing the various discussions I greatly regret having contributed. This page should be deleted immediately. It’s existence is giving rise to ‘ad hominem’ and uncalled for comments and is serving to give unwarranted importance to those making these. Delarouism 15:58, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree with the spirit of your concerns, but if we deleted every page that gave rise to <i>ad hominem</i> attacks we wouldn't have very many left! Hell, would we have <i>any</i>? lol <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEaglizard_0156.html" title="User:Eaglizard">Eaglizard</a> 19:27, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Just some quick points. It seems there is a need for a new page about cultural strategy or cultural planning and then these additional organisations can be noted: Charles Landry and <a href="http://www.comedia.org.uk/" class="external free" title="http://www.comedia.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.comedia.org.uk/</a> , Mik Flood and Strategies for Art and Space and also Richard Crossland at <a href="http://www.ablconsulting.com" class="external free" title="http://www.ablconsulting.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ablconsulting.com</a> . alkhemi is known very well to all of these and its principal of course ‘inaugurated’ the first ever integrated capital city cultural plan/strategy so it would easily be ‘fitted in’ in this context. Worldwide British experts are the leaders in this field as the arts and culture portfolio has been at cabinet level for a long time in their country. Although akhemi does not have the apparent corporate infrastructure of its colleagues it is unique and highly reputable in the field. Which is why the Nordic governments constantly invite its intervention and why in Denmark we know of it Delarouism 12:32, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, be bold - go ahead and write a small article. Account for all sides, don't dwell on the players or make it sound like an ad, but focus on the concept and why cultural strategy / cultural planning has done a difference to a lot of people. If it's an important subject, it might very well become a good article. If not, the wikipedians will give some small hints&#160;:-) Keep your head up, if you have some information to share that is truly interesting to lots of people, please go ahead and try it out.

<dd>I see... well, feel free to delete everything I've made here.</dd>
<dd>I'm sorry, congratulations for your work but I just can't avoid feeling dissappointed and offended, maybe I'm not an icon of the media, possibly because in my country people don't actually pay attention to these art manifestations (Venezuela), instead of other countries in Europe, where every musician will get their right attention. But my intention was precisely to make my works available to the international public, willing people to listen to me, to know who I am, that was all, I'm not even willing to make money with my music, maybe a little bunch of bucks to buy good software, but not to make a pool full of green, useless paper.</dd>
<dd>So, the more you have the more you will get, the less you have the less you will get. Whenever you want, please take a listen to my music, maybe it isn't the best thing in the world, but just let me know if you like it and reconsider the idea. I understand your point but I guess you know how I feel.</dd>
<dd>Best regards, anyway.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> — This page could become a worthy article. The role of Assyrians in Iraq's future is certainly an encyclopaedic article, and not neccessarily crystal-ball gazing. However, given that almost all other articles about Assyrians have been defaced with POV rantings, this article isn't going to become a shining beacon for Wikipedia anytime soon. If it were to be improved, what is already there would have to be thrown out first anyway.

<li>I don't understand why is it being considered for deletion, or why isn't it notable. Please let me know what can I do to make it notable under your considerations, I believe this is unfair, I was only trying to share my work of art through this excellent source of knowledge such as wikipedia, but there is no major thing to talk about, I believe everything is in the music.

<li>Hello <a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorepriest_a098.html" title="User:Gorepriest">Gorepriest</a>, thanks for commenting. We're not trying to attack you or your music; we're just trying to keep Wikipedia encyclopedic, which means that stuff that isn't well-known doesn't really belong here. Please see <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for our music inclusion guidelines. I quite agree with you that a lot of popular music is terrible, and there's a lot of barely-known, but great, music out there. However, Wikipedia just isn't the place to share your art (unless it's already well known). I'm truly sorry, because you seem like a polite and considerate person. Do keep editing Wikipedia, and please don't take this AfD discussion as a personal attack. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshenai_68df.html" title="User talk:Ashenai">talk</a>) 10:21, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Maybe Wikipedia doesn't see its role as a dictionary or a slang guide, but I assure you, no dictionary I know of on the net has these terms organized this way, and most slang dictionaries I've see are pathetic. For one thing, no one organizes terms by topic. I stumbled across this looking for a way to translate a pun in a piece of literature. By the way, I'm particularly impressed that the list included the Lithuanian word for a penis. Maybe Wikipedia needs to start up another portal on language? ---- brunhilda</p>

<li>It's probably from this joke:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
Donald Rumsfeld is giving the president his daily briefing.
He concludes by saying: “Yesterday, 3 Brazilian soldiers were killed.”
“OH NO!” the President exclaims. “That’s terrible!”
His staff sits stunned at this display of emotion, nervously watching as the President sits, head in his hands.
Finally, the President looks up and asks, “How many is a brazillion?”

<li><b>Keep</b>. Could you please clarify your (Chowells's) criticism? This article is not a manual. It does not explain how to accomplish any given task. Similarly, the article is free of original research or thought, there is not disagreement on most of the criticism of the C# and Java, and even those criticisms which are not accepted universally are at least in the public domain of ideas and not the personal grievances of a particular wiki editor. Although formatted differently the article's content is not different from <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_Java_to_C_Plus_Plus_fdc1.html" title="Comparison of Java to C Plus Plus">Comparison of Java to C Plus Plus</a> or Comparison of generics to templates, and is certainly more encyclopedic in tone and format than <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_operating_systems.html" title="Comparison of operating systems">Comparison of operating systems</a>. <a href="../../../t/b/j/User%7ETbjablin_eba4.html" title="User:Tbjablin">Tbjablin</a> 22:30, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. I don't understand why it's up for AFD again seeing as it's been kept the previous times. Wikipedia has to include the bad with the good and while I disagree with Agamemnon2's statement about "eventual undoing" I think it's articles like this that make Wikipedia worthwhile. I don't recall seeing an article in Britannica devoted to people who don't like it. Just as long as this article retains NPOV, I'm all for it, even if I don't always agree with it. In fact, deleting this article would play into the hands of some of the critics who accuse Wikipedia of censoring any criticism about it. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 16:16, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Um. Are you suggesting that our <i>only</i> real reason for wanting to keep the article as-is is to stave off being criticized by criticizing ourselves first, and that it's only by being (at least to some extent) illogical and irrational, only by treating this article preferentially and being biased enough to deal differently with this article than we would with any other article, that we can possibly argue for this article's existence? That's nonsense, I'd argue the same for any Criticism article about a major subject that has had a large number of significant criticisms. We already <i>have</i> a page called <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriticisms_f20b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criticisms">Wikipedia:Criticisms</a>, which is a page for the purpose of Wikipedia editors to read over, discuss, and try to address relevant critiques of Wikipedia. The purpose of <i>this</i> article, on the other hand, is for our <i>readers</i>. Many people will no doubt be interested and fascinated to see some of the main criticisms of Wikipedia (and the significant responses)—all the more so, yes, because the page happens to be <i>on</i> Wikipedia, but even if it wasn't, the topic's significant enough that we shouldn't attack such a well-written article. We should do the same thing we do with any other article: try to improve it, fix its biases, bring it up to shape. Endless VfDs don't improve the article, they just lead to us spending more time arguing back and forth, back and forth, then actually working on the article itself (which is, in fact, the case with this article, from what I can see). -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:58, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm sick of seeing this thing, frankly. I disagree with this and all other pages titled <b>Criticism of X</b>; I would much rather like to see <b>Evaluations of X</b> or perhaps <b>Critical evaluations of X</b>. Doesn't anybody wonder why we don't have <b>Praise of X</b> or <b>Positive opinions on X</b> articles? Articles like these are ways to exile negative POVs to places where they can do less damage. That has some value, but it's still a poor compromise of our NPOV policy. Opposing viewpoints should be integrated, not separated. These articles attract huge amounts of unverifiable statements and irrelevant fluff as a result of their unquestioning titles.<br />
That said, I suppose this is just an issue of practicality that is not going to resolve any time soon. Until and if I can finally find the strength to rewrite this thing into <b>Evaluations of Wikipedia</b> and hope it's so great that nobody wants to undo it, I'll leave it alone. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 12:58, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>IMHO, "Critics" can be quite positive. Unless you mean "Criticasting", which you are doing now, if you ask me (not that anyone did) <a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazgjunk_312c.html" title="User:Nazgjunk">Nazgjunk</a> - - <small><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">Signing</a> is</small> <sup>for <a href="../../../n/a/z/User_talk%7ENazgjunk_5bd3.html" title="User talk:Nazgjunk">Whimps</a></sup> 16:27, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>With a dictionary in hand, you may be perfectly correct. Looking at the content of these pages, though, it's clear that most editors do not in fact have a dictionary in hand when editing. "Criticism" is a strongly negative term, regardless of what it can mean or ought to mean in a scholarly context. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 17:26, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The distinction doesn't run exactly like that, please stuff the scholarly context back in the <a href="../../../i/v/o/Ivory_tower.html" title="Ivory tower">closet</a>. "Criticism" and "critic" can be quite neutral, and with words like "bible", "literary", "movie", "theatre", or such in front of them, they are. "Literary criticism" is book reviewing, and "biblical criticism" is about analyzing the bible, not about pointing out weaknesses in it. But "Criticism <b>of</b> X" is negative regardless of context. "Criticism of the bible" <i>would</i> mean pointing out perceived weaknesses in the bible. Therefore, assuming nobody would want to coin a horror like "Wikipedian criticism", a neutral article would indeed need to be called something like "Critical evaluations of Wikipedia". <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 23:00, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>AFD is not the place for solving the problem with this article, since doing so doesn't involve <i>deletion</i> at all.
<p><i>See the main discussion at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EContent_forking_cfcc.html#.22Criticism.28s.29_of_....22" title="Wikipedia talk:Content forking">Wikipedia talk:Content_forking#.22Criticism.28s.29_of_....22</a>.</i></p>
<p><a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> is exactly right. "Criticism of X" pages are inherently non-neutral, since they only present one side of a debate, contrary to our policy. They are a short route to perennial and unresolvable neutrality disputes. <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Christianity_2059.html" title="Criticism of Christianity">Criticism of Christianity</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Islam_00d9.html" title="Criticism of Islam">Criticism of Islam</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Mormonism_77f4.html" title="Criticism of Mormonism">Criticism of Mormonism</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_communism.html" title="Criticisms of communism">Criticisms of communism</a>, and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Hinduism_fedc.html" title="Criticism of Hinduism">Criticism of Hinduism</a> <i>all</i> sport neutrality disputes, <i>all</i> because either the scope of the article implies that the only discussion of the subject that exists is negative or the scope of the article inherently advocates the negative point of view. As I wrote at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Arguments_for_the_existence_of_Bigfoot_dce6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Arguments for the existence of Bigfoot">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Arguments for the existence of Bigfoot</a>, the way to resolve this problem is to have a single article that encompasses the <i>entire</i> debate, but this is not a matter for AFD, since <i>deletion</i> is not required in order to achieve this. Just rename or merge the article to a neutral title and expand its scope.</p>

<dd>I agree with that last remark. Which is why I in fact have done this once already. Neither the talk page nor an RFC had any effect, and I strongly suspect nothing short of actually <i>going ahead with the rewrite</i> will. But that's only going to stick if you produce a brilliant article from the start, since otherwise people are going to say you're "acting unilaterally" and "against consensus", which in this case just means you're violating the status quo, and people don't like that. It's pretty hopeless, really. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 17:34, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree that "criticism of..." pages are inherently non-neutral. The way to make them neutral, obviously, is to list all the noteworthy criticisms (citing them all), and then to list noteworthy <i>rebuttals</i> to all of those criticisms where they exist (citing them all), and counter-rebuttals if <i>those</i> are noteworthy, etc. "Criticism of..." articles aren't just a place <i>for</i> criticism, they're a place <i>about</i> criticism—the history of criticism of communism, for example, or Christianity, would belong in those articles, not <i>just</i> the criticism itself. The fact that an article is too POVed currently does not mean that the topic is <i>inherently</i> POVed. In this case, all it means is that it's unusually <i>difficult</i> to get the article NPOV—though far from impossible, since many of the "Criticism of..." articles (including this one) <i>don't</i> have NPOV stickers on them. Separating Criticism into its own article is only a "POV fork" if (1) no criticism is mentioned as well on the article's main page, even where appropriate, and (2) no responses to criticism are allowed on the criticism page. Those two requirements may not be satisfied quite yet for some of the pages, but they certainly can be in the future. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 19:15, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That's a nice idea in theory (and I do not believe in "inherently non-neutral" articles either), but the point-counterpoint style is not a very good instance of NPOV either. I am not convinced that criticism of any topic (as opposed to critical evaluations, which is not quite the same thing) should be separated, when endorsement, encouragement or neutral reactions never get split off. In most cases the criticism of a topic is not interesting <i>in and of itself</i>, but in context of the topic. The present structure encourages articles of the form "<b>Topic</b>. X, Y and Z. Oh, but <b>Criticism of Topic</b>." "<b>Criticism of Topic</b>. X is bogus, Y is bogus, Z is bogus." It should be "<b>Topic</b>. X, but maybe X is bogus. Y, but maybe Y is bogus. Z, but maybe Z is bogus." The individual parts can get separate articles again, but it should be <i>unusual</i> and <i>undesirable</i> for (unqualified) criticism to be a topic in and of itself. It makes things unnecessarily hard and obscures the broad picture. It's an easy way to split up an article, but I'd argue it's a suboptimal one. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 19:42, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A number of the articles caught up in previous edit wars -- especially religious articles -- seemed to settle down after a "Criticism of..." section was created. (Examples: <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat_e41b.html" title="Criticism of Prem Rawat">Criticism of Prem Rawat</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology_controversy.html" title="Scientology controversy">Scientology controversy</a>.) The reasoning here seemed to satisfy both the proponents and opponents of the "critics" of these groups. Those who wanted to place negative information about the groups were generally content that they were able to keep their information and links in the spotlight, with prominent links to their article on the main page; meanwhile, supporters of the groups in question were largely free to add their own information to the main page while letting the critics have their say in the "criticism" article. --<a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModemac_38eb.html" title="User:Modemac">Modemac</a> 13:08, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't dispute that this will help stop edit wars for controversial topics. It is a compromise, a truce of sorts, a way to prevent you from having to face the harsh and complex demands of NPOV. Splitting up an article in an unbiased/pro part and a contra part is <i>not</i> neutral. Our job is <i>not</i> to keep editors con\tent, but to provide an integral story to our readers. Basically, NPOV is hard, tough noogies. Why not <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_George_W._Bush_9d5e.html" title="Criticism of George W. Bush">Criticism of George W. Bush</a>? Sure would cool some edit wars. No. That's <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a>'s modus operandi, not ours. By doing this we give up, saying "maybe NPOV is just impossible/not worth it".</dd>
<dd>And besides—we're talking <i>Wikipedia</i> here, not religion. Do we really think Wikipedia editors will be unable to exercise restraint when faced with criticism of "their" encyclopedia? I value us a little higher than that, really. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 01:32, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Like in religion, some will be able to exercise restraint and others will not. I'll have you know I'm a "religious" person. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 11:11, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And we have plenty of Bush supporters too, I wager. My comment was not directed at particular groups or individuals. I trust my implication that some topics will attract more and more heated conflicts than others is not challenged. Wikipedia is special because it's personal too <i>all</i> of us, and because it is, we should respect NPOV even more than for other topics if we want any hope of looking good. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 15:57, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

The Wikipedia rules for keeping an article about an individual are only that they have been written about in two major publications, if I remember, and in this case this man has been not only in countless news articles around the world for many decades, even this year, almost two decades after his death, he has been talked and picture shown on national and international TV programmes, such as CBS 60 Minutes II. However, I admit that the article needs more work, and just pieced that together to get the article started in earnest.

<li>I rewrote the article, though I will say that in my opinion it is pretty bad form to post such an obviously POV cut and paste job in lieu of writing an NPOV article. I removed all the information about Ben David... this isn't his article... as well as some of the unimportant biographical details about marriages, etc. I'm going to tag this with "disputed facts" as soon as I can find the tags, because some of the information I have not been able to independantly verify yet.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 12:05, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The previous comment about POV error exsisting only if it is permitted by editors is true. However, when you have one person chronically adding this stuff to over 10 diffrent pages, it becomes a bigger problem then just POV on one page. The editor in question has began a campign to add as many articles as he can as well as add DOM to countless pages to POV push and to try to justify DOM. It has gotten to the point of vandalism through adding and editing pages.</li>

<p>The editor in question also has claimed that there are numerous other people that support his version of the Dominion of Melchazidek article and continues to revert the article up to three times a day.

<dd>Gene, the reason that I started this page about Pedley was to make the page less cluttered that you want to merge it to. Why do you try to insult me by claiming that you suspect me of being connected to a reputed crime family or the ecclesiastical government they are newsworthy of founding? I don't think this is the first time you got facts wrong, and here again, not that it is pertinent to deletion, I can not find any evidence to support your statement that "this individual has notoriety solely due to his criminal association with Melchizedek". Although Context Magazine says that Pedley founded Melchizedek in the 1950s, in fact, it appears that he died in the 1980's years before Melchizedek became newsworthy because of the allegations against the banks it licensed in the 1990s. Pedley was in the news years before the media began writing about DOM, and apparently the subject of a book called the "Fountain Pen Conspiracy". Just before Melchizedek hit the news, around 1990, the Sacramento, California U.S. Marshall was quoted by the Sacramento Bee as saying that the Pedley case was politically motivated. This to me is pretty interesting stuff. Are you saying that Pedley's translation of the Melchizedek Bible was Pedley's criminal association to DOM, because that is the only association I can find to DOM other than his son following in his footsteps?<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnski_87b6.html" title="User:Johnski">Johnski</a> 05:56, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow another bs move by Johnski and unsigned at that. This is from the person who tried to convience me that blogs could be used as a creditable source. Speaking of creditablity, you are shooting yourself in the foot in terms of your creditablity by the statements you make. You purposly lie and misrepresent the rules of Wikipedia to push DOM. In fact, here is the true interpretation of the rule you misquoted:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"An AFD decision is either to "keep" or "delete" the article. AFD discussions which fail to reach rough consensus default to "keep". The AFD decision may also include a strong recommendation for an additional action such as a "merger" or "redirect". In many cases, the decision to "keep" or "delete" may be conditional on the community's acceptance of the additional action. These recommendations do represent the community consensus and also should not be overturned lightly. However, these are actions which can be taken by any editor and do not require "admin powers". If they are challenged, the decision should be discussed and decided on the respective article Talk pages. A second AFD discussion is unnecessary."</p>

<dd>Davidpdx, I'm not asking anyone to trust me, only to write balanced, fair and factual articles.

<li>I'll tell you what, I'll do a rewrite when I get a chance today. The more I look at this, I'm on the fence a bit on notability because while <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominion_of_Melchizedek_2038.html" title="Dominion of Melchizedek">Dominion of Melchizedek</a> has slight notability, I'm not so sure that this notability is necessarily confered on the creator. Still, I will rewrite it NPOV (which is sorely lacking right now) and condense it because I don't believe there is much value in hearing about his marriages, etc. The arrests and convictions are all verifiable, though Pedley claims they were cooked up. Even if this article gets deleted, at the end of the day it's still good practice for NPOVing an article.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 11:35, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable artist. I can't verify his notability and he gets 9 Google hits. The article reads like a vanity article. <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETempshill_7c70.html" title="User:Tempshill">Tempshill</a> 20:31, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>When Vincent van Gogh was alive, no one ever heard of him and nobody liked his paintings. Had Verheijen is a professional painter who has to make a living of his works. He is a perfectionist in everything he does. The inclusion is no vanity/advertising but a place the artist deserves due to the high quality of his works. And who are we to judge, a present non-notable artist is maybe a famous one in the near future. Art is art. Willem Tijssen (webmaster and author article)</p>
<ul>
<li>With respect to the author, (and the artist) art is art, and a lot of art doesn't make it to the Encyclopedia. 'Vanity' seems like a harsh word, but it is meant in the context that this article does much more to promote the artist than it does to justify his fame/infame (which is basically what a 'pedia tries to do.) I think van Gogh would have understood. <b>Delete</b>. <font size="-2" style="padding&#160;: 0px 1px 1px 1px; border&#160;: 2px solid #FFFFFF; background: #0000FF&#160;; color: #FFFFFF"><a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshgavin_9ad7.html" title="User:Freshgavin"><font color="#FFFFFF">&#160;freshgavin</font></a><a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreshgavin_46e9.html" title="User talk:Freshgavin"><sup><font color="#FFFFFF">TALK&#160;&#160;</font></sup></a></font> 05:17, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks freshgavin. I studied Van Gogh a bit while developing the Internet site on the life of Jelle Taeke de Boer and I am sure if Vincent could read this he would try to cut of his other ear as well. If appropriate I can delete the painting photos from Had's site to keep it very modest. Willem Tijssen. By the way, how come I can not find any references on you?

<p>I’m a little unsure here. I personally have no problem with notable personas adding themselves to wiki as an entry. But this entry strikes me as pure vanity, would be better suited on his user page. This is an entry added by the person in question, himself (the ip traces to Groningen, Netherlands, which is also where he says he is in his blog). Now google does give hits, but they are all of no substance, all entries in Google are basically by himself. I find no external source confirming or even talking about his “fame”. I must say I do believe this is vanity in its pures form. <a href="../../../t/w/t/User%7ETwthmoses_5da0.html" title="User:Twthmoses">Twthmoses</a> 23:07, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

GNOME developer, GNOME membership, doing a little language, studied at DIKU and Groningen university... ok that narratives it down to, I don’t know, say 100 million people, the likes of you. What have you done? Have you been in the news?, on TV?, are you the man in the GNOME universe? Have you written a book?, build something notable? Invented something? What is you claim to fame that sets you apart from the other 100 million like you? I’m sorry this is not personally, but my initial assessment still stands and any doubt I might have had initially has now vanished but the sheer drive to try to confirm notability displayed here, undoubtful by the person himself, and still nothing of any substance has emerged. <a href="../../../t/w/t/User%7ETwthmoses_5da0.html" title="User:Twthmoses">Twthmoses</a> 15:30, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hmm… another new user, who’s first and only act (so far), is to respond to this thread. Hmm funny. Anyway. Try to understand this. I did not mean that there are 100 million GNOME programmers /Developers, I mean there is easy 100 million that is equal unique in their field of work / interest. It is no problem factoring any person down to uniqueness. I speak Danish, there are not 10 million people in the world that does that. I speak Funen; we are under the 500.000 mark now. I’ve stood at the top of the Great Ziggurat of UR in Iraq. There are probably not even 50 people in the world with these 3 simple criteria combined. Am I unique enough now? Unfortunately it is not uniqueness that counts, it is notability. <a href="../../../t/w/t/User%7ETwthmoses_5da0.html" title="User:Twthmoses">Twthmoses</a> 20:22, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Let me just throw in a few words now this is about me. Me and a friend one day looks on wikipedia and finds people that I know listed like for instance Dave Camp, and my friend asks if he can add me and I say yes. A few days later he actually does so, me knowing as he asks me for specific data. The page is soon marked for deletion and some kind of conspiracy starts. If it doesn't live up to the guidelines, it should not be here, agree. Haeleth put this very well in a non-discriminating way, thanks. When people write to me in the tone you do, it is not so weird that I get shocked and show the conversation to some of my friends, who then happen to reply. No big conspiracy here. Cheers, Kenneth.</li>

<li>Strong Keep - is a great source of discussion and seems a fair mark in the sand</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This list is made up</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> It's been proven that Beatles and Elvis have NOT sold over a billion records, there weren't even a billion of their albums printed. What's Michael Jackson doing way down on the list? He's been known as the biggest selling artist of all-time for a number of years now. This list is so wrong. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreet_walker_7556.html" title="User:Street walker">Street walker</a> 06:14, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>dream on street walker, your views are biast towards michael jackson and have been more than obvious for a while. Michael Jackson has only been known as the number 1 act ever amoung his fans, NOONE ELSE, it has NOT been proven elvis and the beatles didn't sell a billion. There have been over 3,000 Presley titles in print, The Beatles dominated the charts around the world more than any act ever, both had more sales chart ativity than jackson. GET OVER IT.</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Why don't people just try to improve the accuracy, rather than blaming it? This is a collabrative community, isn't it?</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Metallica, 10 billion albums sold? Yeah right. And the Beatles aren't even on the list. I think we should do another one like that with certifiable sources and lock it from edition if it is possible. That should be a good idea.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Entirely fake figures from sources that are not accurate. It has become an article of fanboys of bands. Get rid of it!</li>
<li>Keep - useful, if not entirely accurate</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Full of inflated figures from shockingly dubious sources. Just look at the reference for Deep Purple's ludicrous claim of 100 million sold. This is a band that hasn't even sold 10 million in the USA. There is no way they sold more in countries where they generally charted worse. Just because some press agent makes a claim doesn't mean it's fact.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> it's a useful (though slightly innacutrate)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> it's highly innacutrate.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Just go and delete it It's useless</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> This 'article' is, by far, the worst one on Wikipedia. Frankly, its getting out of hand. The figures are exaggerated and unreliable (there is no worldwide tracking system for sales) the page is vandalised incessantly. Many users take the page as a 'fansite' or forum, and they come here everyday and make false numbers and change the list to suit their artists. Really, what kind of article is this if its so unrealiable, people have to do their own research so that they can check if this article is accurate? At times, I want to revert the vandalism, but the page is so destroyed, I dont know the correct version to revert it to. <a href="../../../j/o/u/User%7EJournalist_823c.html" title="User:Journalist">Journalist</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/u/User_talk%7EJournalist_14df.html" title="User talk:Journalist">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Journalist_65e6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Journalist">contribs</a>)</li>

Just weeks before the release of <i><a href="../../../x/%26/y/X%26Y_ee90.html" title="X&amp;Y">X&amp;Y</a></i>, <a href="../../../e/m/i/EMI_68e5.html" title="EMI">EMI</a> give press releases claiming that the band has <i>now</i> sold 25+ million records.

<li><s><b>Delete</b>, evens sales info from the RIAA is as unreliable as anything, it is not a 100% truth.</s></li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b> - This holds a lot of estimates on artist sales, and the article itself says that the information is suspect. However, this page is still a reliable reference (and is probably the best reference available in the world because the sources are so varied and averaged) People still have a ned to find out whereabouts famous artists are on this list, and there is no other place on the internet where you can find results tabled like this, which regularly get updated. If you're going to delete this, you might as well burn older school atlases "Because they're unreliable", as well as delete a significant amount of wikipedia. Those areas would be places like biblical references (only one reference), theories and death tolls. Wikipedia is a place to pool all the information on the internet, so why not keep it that way? --Mahogany h00r 19:35, August 21, 2005 (GMT+12)</s></li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b> There are no doubt a lot of mistakes on this list. However there will always be mistakes on these kinds of lists. Even recordlabels are often promoting artists by quoting much larger recordsales than the actual numbers to boost sales and make an image. However I think this list is as good as it gets. In adittion to " offical numbers there are also numbers for bootlegrecordings and so on. These kinds of list will never be accurate. However they give an general idea.</s></li>
</ul>
<p><s>I have also noticed that a lot of posters only talks about US sales. This is OK, since it's the only country who has an official statistic. However it does'nt mean that there is'nt a world outside the US with 6 billion people. Just because an artists has sold 2 million in the US, does'nt mean that they haven'nt sold 40 million in the rest of the world.</s></p>
<p><s>It is also noted on the list that: In general there is no official organization that certifies worldwide record sales (such as the RIAA does for U.S. record sales). Thus, there are few if any reliable figures to go into this list. Fans, biographers, and record lables may overestimate sales figures for publicity purposes. Many of bestselling artists from Asia, Africa and Latin America are still not included because of the lack of data. Thus, the list cannot be considered definitive, and should be taken with a large grain of salt.</s></p>

<li><s><b>Keep</b> I mostly agree with the comments below (I am still laughing about the 5 billion sales proposed for Cher). However, I think it would be better to reach a consensus about what kind of estimations may or may not be used. After all there are albums made gold or diamond regularly, which means that some estimations are indeed accurate. I propose to keep the article, indicate each time what kind of source is used, and reach a consensus about which of these sources are reliable (and delete the entries that are clearly not). <a href="../../../n/y/c/User%7ENyco_1034.html" title="User:Nyco">User: Nyco</a></s></li>
<li><s><b>Come off it</b>, there is NO CONSENSUS that is FACT. Just because albums are "certified" for sales, doesn't make it "more reliable". Album certifications rely a lot on what the record label say. Unless someone from the certification company (I.E the RIAA) has PERSONALLY COUNTED every copy of the record, even those statistics should be taken with a pinch of salt and NOT given credit as facts. If the RIAA's figures were so accurate, their certification of sales wouldn't be such a mess, i.e Led Zeppelin suddenly going up from "50 million" to "106 million" since 1990.

<li>No one is suggesting "duplicating RIAA's listings", and in point of fact since the List of Best-selling Music Artists is a <i>worldwide</i> list, that's not even an issue (RIAA only certifies the US). However, the RIAA sales data can be <i>cited</i> as a source, and even though their data "<i>could</i> be challenged", it usually isn't: these are the officially recognized bodies, after all. At some point, you have to stop believing in conspiracy theories and just go with official estimates. Deleting the entire list because you don't believe the RIAA numbers is kinda like saying "let's delete the Wikipedia articles on the U.S. Census, 'cause I <i>know</i> Philadelphia has more people than that!"--<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron">Firsfron</a> 10:49, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

The RIAA flaws are easy to see in their sales fro Led Zeppelin. Since 1980, if we go by RIAA information this band, who havent had much chart action since then have somehow managed to have kept up in the sales leagues over the years with Madonna, Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks and Britney Spears, the top selling acts of their time, to keep moving back ahead of them on the all-time sellers list. I also find it funny how after Garth Brooks leaped ahead of Led Zeppelin with a after huge #1 album in 1997, Led Zeppelin suddenly sold enough records to go back up the list ahead of him. What is being suggested is we just take a "say so" figure from the "offical sources" like the RIAA just because they said so. How is that doing what this list is MEANT to do? It's not! Is that what Wikipedia is about? Not listing facts? Unless their is some magical place in America where Led Zeppelin records are selling non stop and billboard are unaware of it, then this proves that the RIAAs figures are just as much fiction as Harry Potter.</sup></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm sorry that I first stumbled across this article while the "vote for deletion" tag was removed; in retrospect it appears that I wasted my time trying to fix formatting &amp; sorting errors. Unlike several other voters, the fact that the list is based on estimates doesn't bother me. But in just a few days of observation it's become apparent that this article has become a soapbox for those wishing to promote their favorite artists, and that it can never be protected from vandalism. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngineer_Bob_5528.html" title="User:Engineer Bob">Engineer Bob</a> 07:43, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

The intro states <i>This is a non-definitive list of best selling recording artists, embracing worldwide singles and album sales. The factual accuracy of this article is disputed as there is no worldwide list of music sales.</i> So, what are we debating here? As far as I can determine there is <b>no neutral body that compiles this information</b>. Right off the bat, this article fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. How can you verify any claim that is made in this article if there is no repository if this information to compare claims against? I could edit this article and add <a href="../../../w/e/e/Ween.html" title="Ween">Ween</a> to the list with 300 million worldwide record sales. The only way you could factually dispute would be to comb the internet for their sales in each country, add them all together, and post your results, thus violating <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Beyond that, all "hard number" information will likely be culled from fan sites (either artist run or 3rd party) and thus has inherent POV problems. In my opinion, there is absolutely no encyclopedic value in an article that is not based on factual information. On a side note, did the original AfD ever conclude? If so, would it be possible to archive the previous AfD so we are not looking at a ton of votes on a finished AfD?--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:26, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment (no vote)</b>. It seems to me that we must weigh precision of search terms against amount of time necessary for the user to achieve such precision. This is precisely why we have both categories and lists, and why in my mind it's good to have both oftentimes -- if they both work well. Users can choose how they want to find the information. However, if a list or a category is ill-named or ill-organized, it's probably not going to be of much use. If both a list and a category are ill-named or ill-organized, well then, we have quite the large problem on our hands! --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler">Jacquelyn Marie</a> 19:40, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> There is plenty of precedent for having both categories and lists for things. Plus, this article has been rearranged since it was first submitted to AfD, and now makes several distinctions that the categories do not.

<p>This is an 89KB list of slang terms, making it not merely a violation of Section 1.2.3 of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, "Wikipedia articles are not a usage guide or a slang and idiom guide", but one of sickeningly gargantuan proportions. The first three paragraphs, the introduction, is the only segment that begins to approach meeting the definition of an encyclopedia article; the remainder, whether it's useful or not (which is irrelevant), is just a list of terms. A list of terms does not belong on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. It is informative, descriptive by comparisons/groupings, and it is extensive (which indeed has its strong and weak points). Further, there is a competing section of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, namely 1.5.2, which allows for "structured lists to assist with the organisation of articles". Since many of the terms on the page indeed have their own articles, it is useful for encyclopedic purposes to group and compare them, and this indeed assists with the organization of articles. Also, just because it is long is not an excuse to delete an article, but rather should be an impetus to break it up into separate articles. There's no denying that neologisms and cruft have crept into this article, but that fact demands that more contributors participate in handling verification of such terms. Last, I have to protest this "nomination bombardment", where a consensus wasn't arrived at the first time, so the argument losers try again. This also happened with <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_parts_slang.html" title="Body parts slang">Body parts slang</a>, and its deletion resulted in a very informative article being wiped off with a slight majority that could not have been reasonably construed as a consensus. — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><span style="color:green"><b>Stevie is the man!</b></span></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 22:36, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> why is no reason given for re-nomination? It was voted on like 2 weeks ago with a quite high ratio of keeps. Anyway like it or not there are lots of lists of jargon/slang/technical terms on Wikipedia, for example <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_baseball_jargon.html" title="List of baseball jargon">List of baseball jargon</a>. As long as they're well organized and useful, I don't see the problem. It's just when the subject is sex or something controversial that people start to look for excuses to delete such lists. Until consensus is to delete all slang/jargon/terms lists changes, I can't see deleting just certain ones for subjective personal reasons, under the thin excuse of arguably breaking <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 23:39, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> When it says "Wikipedia articles are not a usage guide or a slang and idiom guide", I think it means that we shouldn't devote an entire article to each and every one of these slang terms. And rightly so. I think having them all quarantined on one page will suffice. I also think that after weeding out a lot of the obviously obscure (and bogus) slang terms, the page should be capped and not strive to become a neverending all-inclusive list of every ridiculous dirty phrase ever conceived. - <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">Wikipediatrix</a> 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

Given the number of people who would agree with the statement "'List of' considered harmful," real nomination bombardment would be stuffing an AFD day with every "List of" article on the site - and that <b>would</b> be harmful, IMHO. Further, the circular logic of using one policy violation to support another at best puts precedent over policy, an idea I think would seriously degrade Wikipedia over time. After all, there's precedent for <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a> pages too, and we <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">AFD</a> them, even though at any given time there are plenty of others continuing to exist. That said, I have to agree in part with <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman">Stevie is the man!</a> when he claims that Body Parts may not have had proper consensus; if he feels that strongly about it, I would direct him to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_Undeletion_349e.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for Undeletion">Deletion Review</a>. Similarly, I am disappointed that this nomination was made so soon, as this diminishes the odds that it will ever be removed - we can't simply renominate every three weeks until we "win," and apparant out-of-process nominations will garner more Keep votes, as exemplified by <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a>. Nevertheless, in the end, this article has <i>numerous</i> problems that speak in favor of, at worst, deletion and, at best, <b>Merge</b> as appropriate (the text of the intro and significant, verified terms to <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_slang.html" title="Sexual slang">Sexual slang</a> per <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a>, the remaining <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> terms to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:WikiSaurus" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:WikiSaurus">WikiSaurus</a>), and I suppose that is constructively my vote here, even if it means my <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Deletionist_Wikipedians" class="extiw" title="meta:Association_of_Deletionist_Wikipedians">Disciplined Deletionist</a> credentials are revoked. I wish I could spend more time policing the article; OTOH, I would also like to keep my job, and spending time on that particular page is not likely to help me there. FWIW, I think a move to <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_slang.html" title="Sexual slang">Sexual slang</a> should, at a minimum, keep the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologisms.html" title="Neologisms">neologisms</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Neologisms:unstable" class="extiw" title="wikt:Neologisms:unstable">protologisms</a> to a comparative minimum. One thing I'm sure of: if we decide again to keep this article, we need many more people looking at it to ensure that it <i>does not suck;</i> to do otherwise will serve only to undermine the credibility of the project as a whole, and of <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia policy</a> in general. Keeping it under the present title creates the appearance of condoning, if not <i>encouraging,</i> the addition of, well, anything that makes a schoolboy snicker. Finally, I would also point out that, aside from the fact that this particular subject field has more than its fair share of attraction to vandals, my nomination and comments have never had anything to do with its contents <i>per se,</i> because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors</a>, nor should it be. --<a href="../../../k/g/f/User%7EKgf0_e092.html" title="User:Kgf0">Kgf0</a> 23:07, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

There is also a very uncertain merger below, but we can't add the material to List of Places since that is just internal links (WP:NOT springs to mind, since it covers internal link'farms' too). So I'm left with deciding to call this a <i>merge</i> without a target in mind, and will simply add a {merge} tag to the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> This poem is certainly notable. As to being POV, it is a selection of quotes from a single man. I guess then, (tongue in cheek) that would make it his point of view. But seriously, this is an article describing a work of political humor derived from actual quotes of a politician. The fact that a small percentage were only used by "plenty of newspaper articles" and a large scale commercially released book, with I will note no rebuttal from anyone claiming misquotation, makes it a much more accurate piece than most political commentary. And again, let me reiterate that the poem is just that, a creative work, not a reporting. It's prevalence and noteriety as a political humor piece would make it notable enough for inclusion even if it wasn't composed entirely of actual quotes, IMHO. The quest to suppress this seems to me to be imposing POV on the encyclopedia as the article makes no value judgements on Bush, his presidency, or the motives behind the poem, it merely records the existence of a creative work.<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a> 19:09, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Non notable. However- in fairness some of the above comments are wrong as in "amateur youth team", my inside info tells me it's actually a semi-pro mens team (although the majority of the team is between 18 and 20 with the exception of one who is 26) that has been invited to a tournement in Amsterdam. Also won numerous mens league titles etc etc. However, not greatly notable although received some media coverage, thus delete. englishrose 9:59, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was actually talking about the Survivor thing. Sorry for being unclear. I don't think being on Survivor is enough for notability either. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 11:48, 18 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, thanks for clarifying. Can I ask which variant of notability you're using. Here's some different ones I've seen used around here (usually not explicitly stated). Does one of these fit you, or do you have a different approach:
<ol>
<li>Notability means somebody is *worthy* of notice. You don't think she's worthy. Wikipedia shouldn't follow others, but decide for itself who is worthy and who is not. Since being a "survivor" doesn't require talent or substantial contribution to humanity, she's not worthy. By this logic, an unnoticed person worthy of notice is a better article than anybody unworthy, regardless how much attention has been paid.</li>
<li>Notability means other respected authorities in the area have noticed her. She has been found notable by others, but they are not "respectable authorities", and don't count.</li>
<li>Notability means she has been widely found to be worthy of notice, by many sources, and those sources include reliable sources of information which could make a verifiable article. Wikipedia must be a follower, and not a leader. By this, I think she qualifies. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 20:06, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm sure she's a nice person but she fails to meet my understanding of the recommended <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. Reality shows, in my opinion, <i>are</i> mere game shows and contestants are <i>not</i> automatically notable. Being one of the cast is a long way from being the "lead actor" of a TV show. The fact that she was a news reporter is also unpersuasive. Reporters are an important profession but no more deserving of an encyclopedia entry than any other profession. We would not, for example, argue that she would deserve an encyclopedia article if she had been a doctor for a few years. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 13:33, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as much as I dislike the show its contestants do indeed have notability especially when the contestant in question is the Runner up in the competition.

<p>I'm from Massachusetts and I play this game all the time, even out of the car/ by myself. It's actually quite fun and addicting. It's totally safe and immature, but appropriate, just like most car games. I play with the rule that if driving with girls, they are hands off unless they do it first, then it's fair game. I'm so glad somebody finally wrote about this, I hope it goes a long way. ---Transit.letum <b>Keep.</b> Down here in Texas, at least in my city, this game is fairly popular, and i introduce new people to the game all the time. It's a very friendly game, and it really brings the car together. It makes the car ride more enjoyable and light-hearted. To delete this entry and deny the masses access to this game would be a crime against humanity. ---Johnny</p>

<li><b>Don't Delete!</b> I can't beleive I'm seeing this on Wikipedia! My friends and I used to play this all the time (in the suburbs of Chicago) I had no idea it was so wide spread. This game is great, it creates a great bond between the participants (or a release of sexual tension, depending on who you're playing with). Just because Google hasn't picked it up yet doesn't mean that people aren't playing it. ---Molly</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm terribly sorry that my contribution is the same as Transit and Dana, but there's not much else to contribute. It's a game, pure and simple. If you'd like a long and mostly made up essay on the deep philosophy and spirituality surrounding the game, then fine. I'll write one up and e-mail it too you. But honestly, it’s a game, and the only real reason you play car games is to alleviate some of the tediousness of driving, especially long distances. Nipple touch mini, in conjunction with Punch Buggy and Yellow car I win (and The Game where applicable) accomplishes this. There is a severe lack of car games, barring the few you played as a kid, such as the license plate game, or some billboard game, but I honestly feel as though I’ve outgrown those games. I need a game with competition, with several people fighting to get the nipple-touch. It's competitive. Try it, i can almost guarantee you'll love it. NTM is fairly new to my community, probably imported by some college kid on a road trip, but it's a blast. I am honestly astounded that it's so widespread that it's on Wikipedia, it made my day. Even if it is a little too obscure for your tastes, if you leave this up on Wiki, I’m positive that many more people will learn of NTM and fall in love with it's silly, immature charms. After all, isn't this how things grow? Something fun gets posted somewhere. People read it and implement it into their everyday lives, then tells friends. This could become huge, and I think it would be a crying shame to kill it now. After all, it's a lot bigger than either Molly or I thought. Don't stifle a car gaming revolution. ---Johnny</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: My main concern with this article is verifiability. If this game is played by a small number of people, and no written records of it exist, we don't have any way of knowing that the article is correct, or finding errors. That kind of content isn't appropriate for an encyclopedia. There are a lot of places on the internet where you can tell people about something new and try to raise its popularity, but Wikipedia is trying very hard not to be a <i>promoter</i> so much as a <i>recorder</i>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It can be difficult for us to tell whether something like this is popular. I hadn't personally heard of it, and I couldn't find any google hits. If you can find internet references or other textual references (perhaps they were using a different name), or some other records of its popularity and existence, that would be a major help in keeping the article. Barring that, there may be more specialized internet sites which have more lenient inclusion requirements. -- <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreidieki_9302.html" title="User:Creidieki">Creidieki</a> 06:24, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Has anyone watched TSL &amp; can verify that the "Nipple-Touch Mini" game was played on this particular episode? If so, then it's a definite keep; if not, then it's either a hoax or clearly not-notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> oh give me a break, if you want a deletion give an actual reason. the amount of things on wikipedia is rediculous and this article, according to the couple people who have mentioned it, is relevant to them. Just because its not to you doesnt mean anything. so give a reason or dont write delete, all the people who voted to keep have valid reasons and don't cite "sock puppets" repeatedly. So I vote to keep it based on the fact that there now is a google hit, and that it is relevant to multiple users as well as their pools of friends. I also would like to state that the person who started this deletion probably did not read the article, because they think that the game is sexual, when it is stated differently in the article. In short you dont delete something just because you think its stupid, if its well written and relevant then let it slide. --Aaron 16:47, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> Aaron, careful not to be too biting with your opinions. I recognize the importance of keeping Wikipedia clean, and I feel that people do an excellent job with it. I do understand the opinions of many of the people that wrote to delete this article. The first user to respond, Creidieki, did read the article and his comment showed me that I needed to be implicit in stating that the game is not sexual (which I did). This user even came back later to support his claims, which is admirable. I also understand why one would think so without playing the game. Since I published this article, I have read up on "sock puppets" and "vanity articles," and now regret asking my friend (transit.letum) to help in our cause. I realize that doing that is against the traditional wiki rules and I didn't mean do start that. Other than that, however, I am not a... sock-puppeteer? This article is real and many people unrelated to me have come to show it.

Moreover, this is a policy decision that belongs at <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> talk, not in the confines of an AfD discussion. In any case, there's obviously no consensus here. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 21:41, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>We have to decide this once and for all. You may</p>
<ol>
<li>take any noun or verb,</li>
<li>translate into (1) Greek or (2) latin or (3) partially translate or (4) do not translate at all</li>
<li>append a '<a href="../../../-/p/h/-phobia.html" title="-phobia">-phobia</a>' and voila! a new article is ready.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamster.html" title="Hamster">hamster</a> -&gt;Mesocricetophobia = "fear of midsize hamsters". Now tell me that there are no people who irrationally hate or fear hamsters!</p>
<p>I suggest to decide right now that any such phobias must be speedily deleted on the spot, unless a reputable source with medical histories is presented. Various unscrupulous websites that sell <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snake_oil.html" title="Snake oil">snake oil</a> for phobias, described in the <a href="../../../-/p/h/-phobia.html" title="-phobia">-phobia</a> article do not count. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 20:18, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, it is a real life: a midcase between a policy and an individual case. I doubt that "pseudophobias" require the whole special policy".</li>
<li>"No hits" is a matter of my persistency. Let me post it into a couple of blogs, with a tragic story how I had three dead hamsters in a row on me so that I started really hating them: my kids cried; I had to carry these sick rodents to a clinic, then lie children that they run away there, &amp;c&amp;c, and I could not stand it any more. And the problem turned out to be in bad gas heater, but it was too late for me... In 2-3 weeks I will get 1,350 google hits.</li>

<li>There is an excellent article at <a href="../../../-/p/h/-phobia.html" title="-phobia">-phobia</a>, with a suitable list at its end.

<li>I hadn't thought through the huge number of articles that could be created. I can certainly see a case for the deletion of an article named, say, chukkaphobia, that solely consists of "Chukkaphobia is fear of chukkas" (with or without an image of a chukka). Can <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> A3 (specifically rephrasing) include this? In the worst case the rephrasing is from the Greek or Latin in the article title, to English in the page itself. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 22:46, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Do not delete - this page was started so that others may come in a fill in the blanks. It is intended to be a start and was written by an adult student of this bass player (Harlan) so all info is 100% accurate. The significance is that this person is maybe the only instructor in the DC area who can teach Victor Wooten's double thumb technique. Harlan has indicated that he may soon collaborate with Michael Manring on a CD. Just because Cheng doesn't live in DC doesn't justify the criticism. If Janet Jackson/Backstreet boys/Milli Vanilli grade popularity is the criteria for Wikipedia then good luck!!</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I have no ill will towards Mr Harlan or yourself.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>- Excuse me! there is no evidence that the world has accepted this religion at large!?! Just look at the number of members of www.tatu.ru or the ticket sales for t.A.T.u's concerts!!!</li>
</ul>
<p>The URL www.tatuism.com is not connected to the Tatuism movment. this domain is not in the control of the people who gave birth to this idea. It was said earlier "people are still trying to convert people to their "religion" with flyers and the like." this is not the case. Tatuism is not a religeon yet. Yes our message is being spread but we do not force ourselve upon anyone, we let you decide if you suport the idea. With this said, I think it shouldn't be deleted.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>- The debate isn't about the merits or lack thereof of this self-described religion, but its notability and merit as a Wikipedia page. Aside from references to www.tatuism.com, the only Google results I get for a "tatuism" search are references to tatuism.com and these <a href="http://east-wind.deviantart.com/" class="external text" title="http://east-wind.deviantart.com/" rel="nofollow">two</a> <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/ReturnToHades/" class="external text" title="http://spaces.msn.com/members/ReturnToHades/" rel="nofollow">pages</a>, which have the text of this Wikipedia page almost verbatim.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>-They just bought the domain tatuism.com so they're really serious about this. Give it time, Google doesn't pick up links that fast.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok all very valid points, but i dont think it should be deleted, Wikipedia is supposed to be a place you can find information on everything, even the obscure. Yes intitally this was just a bit of fun, but to my supprise poeple are taking it to heart. I think it should have its page, and not be deleted simply down to the fact google only comes back with a few references. After all whole thing is just over a week old. and was released to the world via a post on the tatu.ru fourm on the 12th of October 2005. Give it time.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Don't delete</b>...give the idea a chance...as was said before...it's not a religion forced on you...if u like it take it...if you don't then flip the page and walk away...if it's not going to reach the world via wikipedia then i assure you it will find it's way to the world somehow...not only will it have a place here but also it'll earn it...so i say <b>DON'T DELETE</b></li>

<p>Why delete it, from my experiance there was something similar to this from NSwiki...or something. It seemed like the person who wrote it took some time, so why delete it? He even gave an explination as to what it was, and what it pertained to; just because it doesn't apply to you doesn't mean it merrits deletion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.17.163.130 (<a href="../../../2/1/3/User_talk%7E213.17.163.130.html" title="User talk:213.17.163.130">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.17.163.130_69ba.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.17.163.130">contribs</a>) 13:31, 19 October 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Just because someone took time to write it doesn't mean that it's encyclopedic. By that logic, I could spend hours writing a long screed about any random topic and you would argue that it should be kept, even though hardly anyone would be interested.

<li><b>Comment</b>: And non-notability isn't a criterion for deletion either. Yes, I've reread the deletion policy, and I've also read <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">Notability and Music Guidelines</a>. This band doesn't seem to meet any of the criteria listed there. Now, these are of course "merely rules of thumb which some editors choose to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to keep an article that is on articles for deletion". I'm one of these editors. Perhaps you aren't. If you aren't, what rules of thumb do you use? Or to put it another way, what's your reason for a "keep" vote? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 08:38, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>What's my reason for a "keep" vote? I don't think the article should be deleted. It's verifiable and about a real subject. That's enough to be included in the "sum of all human knowledge" in my books. -- Grace Note.</li>
<li>And by the way, don't snidely correct my English. If I meant to write "non-notability" I would have done. -- Grace Note.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Lack of any assertion of notability is already a speedy deletion criterion where people are concerned, so it's only logical to apply it to groups of people (in this case bands). Instead of arguing notability isn't a criterion, it's better to argue why this particular band should be kept based on its own merits. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:15, 18 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure why exactly you feel justified in haranguing me. I clearly don't agree that it's better to argue the merits of this particular band, because I think <i>all</i> verifiable bands should be included in Wikipedia. I think "notability" means no more, no less than "I do or don't value this subject" and your valuation is meaningless to me if I do not share your system of value (and you cannot expect all of your potential readers to share it), whereas an objective standard, represented by verifiability, is meaningful.--Grace Note.
<ul>
<li>That seems a reasonable enough point of view, but: (i) I disagree with your interpretation of "notability", as for example I don't value (let's say) <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> but acknowledge that the media do and for this reason (as well perhaps as others) think that she's notable; (ii) there seems no incompatibility between a demand for verifiability and a demand for notability; and (iii) <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">Notability and Music Guidelines</a> are, well, guidelines for decisions about the worthiness of articles on bands -- guidelines that may be wrong (and that can be challenged by you) but that nevertheless exist. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 10:16, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Current version is little more than patent nonsense with no context and a weblink to a website.

I am the researcher.</i>") Based on the earlier article (the version when the AfD was added) I still say delete... and in fact I'm reverting back to that article even though it appears the author is the one who changed it, just so voters are at least looking at a version with content.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:42, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

I've moved all of the random anon ranting down here since he can't vote anyway due to his newbie status and is disrupting the process with his longwinded jabbering.

<dd>Could you please reconsider about the block? I believe he deserves the benefit of the doubt, and it's quite normal to get upset about an AfD process. The cleanup is useful, and much appreciated, but I feel the block is a bit much. Nominating a person's article for deletion and then silencing him seems a bit unfriendly to me.

<dd>I agree. As far as I can tell, he hasn't done anything truly disruptive like removing the AfD notice or changing anyone's votes. Blocking is rather extreme in this case.

<li><b>Remain</b> appreciate the comment about an essay, not an article freshgavin. The input was worthy of something. Maybe can figure it out since am in the newspaper and mag biz and the difference can be important - notable. Then again to be here may not. We'll have an editor try turn it to an Article over the week and see what happens. To "conform." Maybe more a Media Alert than an essay, in short. maybe. But the stockpuppet comment really did prove a point about what this so called "discussion" was / is about. Maybe that fool instead of using the word "ass" in what is supposed to be (thought to be) a credibile arena should do as said in the first Remain response -- go either learn to read or sit back and just keep re-reading Jack and Jill. They would get off on Jack and Jill more. Well at least the Jack part. This is so good. And that person confirmed the credibility of the "remain" response. Those like KF who comment without knowing content. As their own admission of stupidty. Funny if all this becomes music to someone else's eyes somewhere else. Could be a good story here in itself. If it were A Propaganda who would waste their time here. That Karma ... "fist" (nice, wonder where it has been - the fist that is) should surely learn what The Word - karma means. And they just did. About a time and a place. It comes. Now KF can go sit on Swaggart's lap to get the good feel better - or maybe find a Catholic Priest, for little boys - to sit on. Incoherent, hummm MCB can it be the world in fogged glasses they live in is just ... more nonsense. May be. But who is to Judge, right&#160;? Nonsense is not the article in question. But the fogged glassed would explain every thing. Article or essay may be just about POV. A truth in there somewhere. Oh right - I did not see anything in the rules that said when an author or researcher comments in response - they are called stockpuppets. No less other names. And what, the rules said ... don't take it personal&#160;? All must be fooling / kidding one's self. A good example. Another "good read." Was an interesting exchange though. Entertaining. More like instead of a stockpuppet - it was the editor author taking responsibility. Instead of showing yourselves for what you really are you should just edit the page blank except for the 2 words - cover up, and save everyone else lot of trouble. And then like it was said ... those others can go back to reading Jack and Jill. Anyway, "freshgavin" thanks for the intelligent response. Appreciate it. it said ... not everyone learned that AIDS kills from just listening to what their mommy tells them while growing up as there mom was wiping their "ass" for them. Thanks. This was all very interesting. When I see this pedia come up on an engine we'll remember the world's blogs serve the international communities with more. Until we meet again. And of course, we will. Maybe some people should go back to gossip with their schoolmates - would serve themselves in a self serving manner better that way. At least after 20 or 30 years they may learn to read (or use what little between their ears life gave them). Has nothing to do with doing something good for any international community. Oh btw - we have been news people for over 25 years. And History has been written. Right here. Date noted. Well earned. At least gets the blood moving. The brain working. Researcher2&#160;: )</li>
<li><b>Remain</b> - Opinion - carefully reviewing the rules of participation it states both author and others may comment on the discussion. Reasons for delete are noted to be discussed. If it were title of the article in discussion then it may hold merit to be changed. That is not what we see here above. I would note "non-notable Mingzhi Daisy Yang." Which I do not think the article is about simply just one person. There seems to be many. But the subject in first comment is "non notable". Yet I would ask is that coming - and please do not take this personal -- does that come from one who has done no research regarding facts as they too speak and make comment. The person Yang Mingzhi (asian culture reverses first and last name when addressed outside of America - if you did not know that too) Yang mingzhi does come out of a community as an on air person to a viewership of only 100 million people plus. But is it that since those people are of a different culture and then they need to be discounted into the bin of "non notable". of course, what is a mere 100 million people or a 1.3 billion people or someone involved with that - as a notable person&#160;? Also all the people involved cited in the article, are well known press people in the circles of the elite from one side of the world to the other. If I worked on a farm what would I know&#160;? And these non notables may not be known as you know them as your neighbor next door. Yet maybe they are the neighbor next door that you should know the names of and do not&#160;? Do you know the name of every neighbor on your block or around you block&#160;? One could be Barry Diller but would you know&#160;? Or do you even know who he is&#160;? Just surely another non notable (in real life - modern history and culture, TV culture that in). But no one watches TV right. People who earned a standing in "modern day" human affairs should not be discounted. Based on what was just said, someone might say this opinion is a rant. Especially seeing length. Oh why -- because it takes time to read&#160;? Like a magazine. That is why a magazine comes out monthly -- because it heavy in content -- to be Digested. WHo created Rolling Stone Magazine's Fashion section and department or Spin Magazine's Fashion sectin ans department do you know that&#160;? Another of no merit just a 400 billion dolar industry in America alone, that's all. Maybe I missed the definition of an encyclopedia in Webster's dictionary. Yet again it, the article in question and this opinion is set down with facts, places, dates, people by name, and merit. Is that a rant or just something that does not meet someone's approval or time schedule to ... really ... look into&#160;? Another comment "unsalvagable." It is strange that facts and events of real Human history are unsalvagable, at anytime. Why is that so when what is written are again facts that have been and are happening - also note: with happenings that include over distances of time. As one issue -- of course, not the main issue, is Immigration Marriage fraud, punishable in America by 5 years in jail and/or $250,000 find (according to law set in stone by Congress, Senate, and the Legislature). But you all knew that. Where in this encyclopedia is there made mention that marriage fraud is how "5" of the Atta clan acommplished taking down the world trade center buildings&#160;? Is it when you learn about one history does it not lend light to how it could effect many others&#160;? The comment open to discussion call "nonsense". Since when are facts - real events reduced to someone's opinion of "nonsense"&#160;? How did YOU yourself find out AIDS kills everyone. Did someone's mother tell them&#160;? Just another passing thought. It was that 4 page CDC flyer that was sent into every mailbox in the country spring of 1986. And how do you think it got there, Reagen just gave it up willingly&#160;? We have done a lot of research. What is in the article are "secrets", historical secret - that are only being allow to come to surface in: this millennium , not the last. And you do not live in the last millennium, or do you&#160;? Again is it because it does not meet someone's approval of what knowledge the world should have -- or to take away something that has a possible point it should remain. I never have consided historical facts to be nonsense. Wouldn't you really like to know who killed JFK&#160;? Or a article on that revelation with names and places would be nonsense too. Please do not take this personal or let the hairs stand up on the back of anyone's neck. And when listening to the audio cited in the article, the "wicked page", since when is what someone has said by their own verbal voice (especially a press rep of this proportion) become nonsense again verses a fact of happening and when credibilty in human beings are the overall question. Maybe there is something to be learned from the facts, dates, and places in the article. Maybe something to be learned by many around the world. Oh I guess this response of opinion would be considered still just a "rant" by the commenters because it is not in agreement with the community opinions and is responding. Or just that it is too long to read and take serious. We know many hard working people who like to read - even simply lay people. And take the time to do it. If the story -the article in question- had no merit someone would have just posted it and gone away. Not caring whether it remained or not. Or worse yet - just have it again posted by others - not spammed - but reposted and reposted again and again by people who look to see it remain. Of course this response may be too long for some to read. Again just bushed off as a rant. I wonder how many of the commenters actually went and researched the what was cited in the article before making comment. If they did then they would be able to tell us what the depth of obligations were or what the "I am a Fraud" statement on the Wicked page means in the value of America. Or how an issue can effect millions overall. Unless we have no value. Or socially connected human beings or human events have no value. Or the told sharing of mystery in life has no valuse. IF that is the case then it should be deleted. And to prove the point - others can paste and post the same article. As they would posted it from all over the country. I would not want to have to think this (what some consider honored) community is so narrow in mind that is discounts so many others in the world who see beyond the horizons of a backyard. And since it, the article, is about two known controversial figures - even if seen (by some) as (only) underground figures or under current figures - one would question how events that include Jimmy Swaggart and media giants like SMG can be seen as history non notable - or even underground for that matter. Like I said if the issue was title of article then maybe it should read "Matter of History" - "TheWordofGod.com" "The Travels of." To consider "The Word of God" itself in Book of Revelation and in other written works have been serious business to billions of people for thousands of years. Maybe thousands of years is as we can quickly bush it off as nonnotable too. There are a number of reasons to argue the article should remain -- intellectual reasons also -- but none of them are as short as the one line opinions as those stated (posted) by the "community" above. Not wanting to take up too much of your time because others may enjoy the read, a matter of History is an unencylopedic entry to any page of daily life. Or is it&#160;? And I would argue the article remain. Even if refined. Or then just delete and others can just as easily enter it again and again until this community does see its true merit or does the research to see the merit in full. I worked on this project with others and do not hide behind the cloak of what may be seen as the cloak of others. Anytime anyone wants to question the facts or merit of the actual article -- unless they are merely protecting some political agenda as well as motive - then I can be reached. As others too will raise there voice if it need to be heard over time, which we all have years of. The Researcher 2. MsBarbaraQin@yahoo.com Well, anyway, thanks for listening even if you dismiss this response as a rant. As for a handy excuse. Could have just left it -this discussion - unresponsed to and simply as it was said - reposted the article upon delete. We could go back to first grade and just read "Jack and Jill." That would resolve everything. Or would it&#160;? Researcher2</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>remain</b> - we could just call the article "Puzzle Pieces" and leave it alone.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Response</b> - of course the author deleted it. One of the authors anyway. Well, not quite deleted - edited most of the body. <b>Would not want anyone unhappy.</b> Would have deleted all but the notice said do not leave "blank", quote: "please do not blank this article or remove this notice while the discussion is in progress." If it was unwanted there, why put it back&#160;? Since according to the uhumm experts it is so "unsavagable." But I see you put it back. So thanks anyway. Funny. (if for nothing else it has made for brisk discussion. As it was said before. Seems to have gotten blood moving.) Maybe there is what LIFE intended ... and that is why it wound up there in the first place. Something in The Word - destiny. Ironic. Maybe those here who created the Universe can say otherwise. Of course. But you'd have to be able to read first. &#160;: ) "funny." Strange funny. Not laughing funny. Anyway thanks for putting it back. Looks better there than not. I'll have to tell "him" what is happening later in the day. Sure it will be appreciated. Also funny said "unintelligible." People in the real world (outside of this one) call it "intense" amongst other heavier things. Should we show "input" email received from Canada or somewhere on the other side of the world. Not necessary. The China Press link shows something like that about half way down where the pictures start. We have plenty. Mostly bigtime positive. People don't like people who do bad or fake things to good people. Especially with legs not crossed (as Anne would say). Many have found it clearly intelligible. What do you think, this is the only place it appears&#160;? It is not just on the web you know. Can't be that full of yourself now can you. "Intelligible." Not my opinion. Others have their own mind. We think it is even more. Nice discussion. Does look pretty good being back there in full body, doesn't it -- And it is only day 1 or 2&#160;? Very interesting. Researcher2</p>
