<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> I was sent the link to the Steak&amp;BJ Day site by a female colleague. To say it's not a famous holiday is ridiculous..... everyone I know, knows of the 'existence' of this humourous day (although there seems to be confusion over the exact date.)Maybe because most of my friends are men, and real women with a sense of humour. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.9.52.185 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.9.52.185_7644.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.9.52.185">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Regardless of whether the holiday is genuine or not the article should be kept - I do not see any significant differences from many urban legends which feature articles discussing their nature. Perhaps the article should focus more on the steak and bj day's roots in web culture with similar references, in order to highlight it's fictional nature rather than give any impression that the day is in any way a genuine holiday. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.110.69.163 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.110.69.163_93e8.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.110.69.163">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p><b>Delete</b> This article is about a non-existent holiday, created by a radio DJ, and is not famous or well-known enough to be considered encyclopedic. Also, this did not reach a proper resolution the last time an AfD occurred for it. SteveJ2006 21:55, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I wondered the same thing and found that Talk Like A Pirate Day was much more notable in comparison. Talk Like A Pirate Day returned 340 hits on nexis, including articles in AutoWeek, The Baltimore Sun, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The Sporting News, Navy Times, The New York Times, and 4 articles in the Washington Post alone. Steak and Blowjob Day returned only one article, in a college newspaper (The California Aggie of U. California-Davis). -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 03:59, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think the holiday gains notoriety every year - perhaps if it is deleted on notability this year it will pass sometime in the future. (I would also comment that this makes SD as recreated content a very iffy issue.) -- <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStillnotelf_81b2.html" title="User:Stillnotelf"><font color="#668353">stillnotelf</font></a> <a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStillnotelf_80d6.html" title="User talk:Stillnotelf"><font color="#FF4487">has a talk page</font></a> 04:29, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It occurred to me later that this holiday will never get mainstream press coverage - you don't see "blowjob" printed in family newspapers very often. -- <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStillnotelf_81b2.html" title="User:Stillnotelf"><font color="#668353">stillnotelf</font></a> <a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStillnotelf_80d6.html" title="User talk:Stillnotelf"><font color="#FF4487">has a talk page</font></a> 06:24, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Nexis contains alternative newspapers as well, and it appears this isn't even getting non-mainstream press coverage. The OC Weekly, LA Weekly, Village Voice, Houston Press, Miami New Times and others even manage to get "steak" and "blowjob" into the same article, but unfortunately not in any way that involves this topic. For example, The OC Weekly printed the line "Saying Sid's is a great place because you can get a piece of crap steak for 10 bucks is like bragging about getting a $5 blowjob from a homeless crack addict with trench mouth (who happens to be a relative)." I doubt the reason they haven't covered this holiday is just because it has a naughty word in its name. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 07:09, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think the big question is, even as more people might hear about it, is anyone actually practicing this "holiday"? If no one, or barely anyone, is actually practicing it, then it can't be considered more than the slightly humorous joke it was meant to be. SteveJ2006 06:03, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I hear more about this day than I do "Talk like a Pirate Day". I know a lot of people who talk about this day.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have personally celebrated this day with my partner for several years now - hey, she would prefer a steak and some oral to a bunch of flowers too... As far as I am aware there is no restriction on (for instance) religious holidays to require a certain threshold of participants before it "sufficiently exists" to warrant inclusion and it seems highly dismissive to attempt to apply such arbitrary heuristics to this content. Secondly, even if only a very small group (or indeed no-one) observe this holiday then it still does not undermine the fact that this day was created and promoted by Tom Birdsey, has an independent website and a large amount of existing references - I would note the issues and disputes, but would not censor what I perceive as legitimate content. (An aside - Neologism is not an argument for deletion per se as the content guidelines acknowledge. Indeed wikipedias own definition states "Neologisms are especially useful in identifying inventions, new phenomena, or old ideas which have taken on a new cultural context."). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 61.95.35.98 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_61.95.35.98_6e35.html" title="Special:Contributions/61.95.35.98">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>I would think it might be worth mentioning on here that at least half of the votes for "keep" have been from anonymous, unsigned users, a good portion of whom have no prior contributions to wikipedia. SteveJ2006 04:49, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Looks like it has enough exposure to be mentioned in a #1 link on Google for keywords "March 20th". Note to SteveJ2006 on his comment above: getting <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elitist.html" title="Elitist">Elitist</a>, aren't we?</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Just because its not an officially recognised 'holiday' doesn't make it any less real. It exists in some form or another, so why not have an article on it? Just because a few people don't like nor believe in its concept doesn't mean it shouldn't be documented. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.97.52.57 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.97.52.57_7aa9.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.97.52.57">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I'd like to point out first I am of the female persuasion and am all for s&amp;bj day in general and as such feel it should be kept. It's definitely more fun (and generally cheaper) tha Valentines Day and instead of focussing on pointless poems, gives the reciever some sustenance and fun. Oh and there's noit can't be reciprocal, far as I know, so other women shouldn't be unhappy about it. Besides, the simple fact that it has incited so much conversation from guests as well as regular wikipedia peeps suggests that it does carry cultural significance and should be kept in some form, even if it is only as the S&amp;BJ Day Debate/Controversy.

<li><b>Kep</b> Agree with sentiment re: FSM and Pirate day. I've heard about this "holiday" every year for four years now, from separate sources. Ironically, there seems to be some confusion about when it is, though... If you Google for "March 20th", the first hit is about this "holiday". Heck, I say keep just because I'm annoyed by people who's only argument against it is that it's Neologistic. &#160;:-D Come on, people, EVERYTHING is new at some point. <a href="../../../e/h/u/User%7EEhurtley_1062.html" title="User:Ehurtley">Ehurtley</a> 09:27, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> several reasons - 1) Legitimate bit of Internet Culture (more than 3 nerds in a blog) 2) just as legitamate as other "phenomenons" we have seen turn into holidays 3) many external links lead here,and Wiki is a source of much knowlege 4) don't be a prude... this may be sophmoric, but it is an amusing attempt at equality.

<p><b>Keep</b> This certainly at this point bears noting as an internet phenomena at the very least.
