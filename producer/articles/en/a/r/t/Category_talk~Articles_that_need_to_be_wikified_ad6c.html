<p>Is it possible to have a bot notify users of the <b>{{wikify}}</b> tag to apply the <b>{{wikify-date}}</b> tag instead?

<dd>There's a pesky bot that pesters contributors needlessly about images; is it possible to have a bot send a friendly reminder to users of the older tag? The idea is simply to get the word out about the new template. Another (albeit minor) benefit would be the whittling down of the frequency at which the bot will have to do the sorting. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolajimi_dee8.html" title="User:Folajimi">Folajimi</a> 17:13, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The category instructions says:</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Add the tag {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikify_3cf0.html" title="Template:Wikify">wikify</a>}} to the top of the article. A bot will automatically change this to something like {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikify-date_b486.html" title="Template:Wikify-date">wikify-date</a>}} within 24 hours. Any articles you see listed near the bottom of this page have been tagged and are waiting to be automatically sorted into a monthly subcategory.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As long as it says that, I don't think it's fair to complain to people that follow those instructions.

<dd>I've never heard of that. When I want to work on articles of a certain size, I set my threshold for stub display at the appropriate level, which makes them red links, but this lets you see them by subject. Although, at a quick glance, nothing jumps out at me as a subject I would want to work on. Perhaps there would be more variety if more articles were tagged as stubs.

<p>Am I the only one who notices that the cleanup tag is often used in place of the wikify tag and vice versa? So often I find articles that are tagged for wikify but are needing much more than that. <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_history_of_Denmark_687b.html" title="Military history of Denmark">Military history of Denmark</a> was a total mess until I spent over an hour on it today. I guess my point is that clearing wikify tags isn't the only thing that is going to fix the article in most cases. Perhaps people are too hasty in using the wikify tag --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrad101_32fb.html" title="User:Brad101">Brad101</a> 22:03, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, a lot of these articles need more than just wikification. I don't mind doing cleanup though (I'm unemployed so it's not as if I have anything better to do). &#160;:) <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedRollerskate_20f6.html" title="User:RedRollerskate">RedRollerskate</a> 22:15, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I agree too although I've noticed that it's more the cleanup tagged articles just need wikifying. a lot of the time when I've finished wikifying an article I end up just slapping another tag like {linkless} or {unreferenced} anyways. Maybe this needs mentioning on {cleanups} talkpage or maybe at <a href="../../../c/r/_/WP%7ECR_d625.html" title="WP:CR">WP:CR</a> <a href="../../../y/d/a/User%7EYdam_9ecb.html" title="User:Ydam">Ydam</a> 22:22, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey well it's a good idea but: Im not sure about using the word confirmed in those last 2! Remember don't bite the newbies. Also why what about a persoanl message section for those welcomes (so you can put {{subst:Welcomemos|Text=Your Message}}) I don't like the way so many people use a bland and unfriendly generic message with no hints (for example in this case) as to the errors the person has made. <a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmorton166_welcome_template_f90d.html" title="User:Tmorton166/welcome/template">See here</a> for an idea of what I mean.</dd>

<p>We haven't seen below 6000 articles on this page since early April. But we are getting closer and closer. We're 329 away right now. Lately we've had updates of -80, -42, +12, -78, +37, -38, -48, -44, and -33 since the start of July. So we've got down 314 in 9 days, an average of 35 a day. At that rate we'd be at 6000 in about 9-10 days. But I know we can do it sooner if we all do our parts. &#160;:) This moment of inspiration and go team! brought to you by <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 04:12, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, I think you guys are doing a good job. I try to help out a bit, doing about 5 articles every day from the oldest month (though I realize people here do waay more than that on average).

<dd>I'm not sure how many I'm wikifying at the moment, but one thing that has struck me is the number of copyvios being tagged as needing to be wikified. Everyone's doing a great job at wikifying, and I'm not sure if anyone's noticed but I've been attempting to clear July from all the copyvios (July actually <b>decreased</b> in the last update! Admittedly only by a 8 articles, but a decrease of 8 is better than an increase of 50+). The number of articles that are in July's category that have been prodded, AfD'd or are copyvios should reduce the number of July articles further. Too early to tell, but at the end of the month July may have considerably less articles carrying over than previous months have. <span class="plainlinks" style="color:#f00">—<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheJC_69d3.html" title="User:TheJC">TheJC</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheJC_cdb9.html" title="User talk:TheJC">Talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TheJC_fef2.html" title="Special:Contributions/TheJC">Contribs</a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=TheJC" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=TheJC" rel="nofollow">Count</a>)</span> 09:47, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've noticed that too. I'm definitely clearing more copyvios, speedy deletes, prods, and AfDs than in any other month.

<dd>Yes, the amount of copyvio's is really huge.

<dd>Re: Copyvios, we have really poor warnings during article creation which leads to a lot of good-faith people contributing copyvios because they don't know better (there's strong resistance towards any changing of the warning text). Ultimately though we need some automated means of detecting copyvios, such as a bot that reports all suspected ones (based on the google test), so instead of looking for needles in a haystack, we are just presented with a pile of needles with a few pieces of hay in it. We really need to abduct some programmer and make them write this bot... it's probably the most needed bot on the project. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 13:24, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>From the above discussions, a good combination in finding copyvios seems to be setting your stub level in your preferences really high, then finding the pages that are still blue, and feeding them into <a href="http://www.copyscape.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.copyscape.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.copyscape.com/</a>, making sure the results don't site us.

<dd>Very discouraging is it not? It does appear to me that there are so many articles, both new and old that are still hiding out there. I guess the solution is to try and clear more articles than are incoming as new. July is over 2000 articles now and when I began working on March over a month ago the count was over 2000 as well. The past two weeks or so I've noticed the pace has fallen behind so if it is taking us over a month to clear one month of tagged articles it's simple to see that things will forever be backlogged. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrad101_32fb.html" title="User:Brad101">Brad101</a> 22:16, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Cool - I am going to start a draft project page at User:Ladybirdintheuk/Wikiproject - wikification (draft) (don't look just yet, there won't be anything there for an hour or so!) Feel free to add/change anything, as this will only be a first draft.

<dd>Once we're happy with the wording we can go through the process of moving it to a proper project page. (There is a "proposed projects" page, but there are probably enough of us already that we can skip that bit, unless we want to use it as an attempt to round up a few more willing volunteers?). Once we have the project page set up there will be two last jobs:
<ul>
<li>Change the wikify template, so that it points to [[Category:Wikiproject_wikify]] (or whatever the standard wording is. (Will this cause problems with Bluebot etc, and if so, what do we need to do about it???)</li>
<li>Advertise!!!</li>

<p>Right. The draft (at User:Ladybirdintheuk/Wikiproject - wikification (draft))is pretty much completed, but no-where near perfect. We could do with a few more people having a look and giving their thoughts/adding anything they think should be included.

<dd>Sorry the way I coded the script was meant to subst the current month and year to the article page BUT instead it modified the template to always say <i>August 2006</i> rather than just using the current month. The solution to that method is to use includeonly tags around the <i>subst</i> part of the template. But then it doesnt display correctly on the article page (unless you subst the wikify tag itself) - are you getting this?</dd>

<dd>Basically the outcome would have been that EVERY article that got tagged with wikify would be placed into the August category - even next month and the month after.

<p>Further to the comments above, myself and <a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmorton166_173f.html" title="User:Tmorton166">User:Tmorton166</a> have worked out a draft project page to create a official Wikification project. The reason we're doing this is to try and get the project a bit more exposure and get a few more people involved. The draft can be seen at User:Ladybirdintheuk/Wikiproject - wikification (draft).</p>
<p>Please can you have a look at the draft and leave any comments either here or on the comments page. (Feel free to make any changes or additions you notice). If you think it looks fine as it is please comment below, so we know that you approve!</p>
<p>Once the page is ready, I am not sure if we should move the text to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArticles_that_need_to_be_wikified_f3f9.html" title="Category:Articles that need to be wikified">Category:Articles that need to be wikified</a>, and set up a redirect at Wikiproject: Wikification, or if we should put the text there, and work out how to redirect all the templates etc to that page. The former seems far easier (And I know how to do it by myself). The latter may look a bit less messy though, if people are prepared to help out to get it done properly. Please let me know your thoughts on this!</p>
<p>I'm not going to take any action either way until after the weekend, so we have time to discuss first. thanks -<a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELadybirdintheuk_176f.html" title="User:Ladybirdintheuk">Ladybirdintheuk</a> 10:25, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm starting to think that we need some sort of educational project or a better description of what "article needs to be wikified" means. I'm running into lots and lots of articles tagged for August 06 that don't need to be wikified. It's running at about a 40% clip. That's high. If an article is fully linked and sectioned, it does NOT need the wikified tag. Cleanup tag? Maybe. But not wikify. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 07:05, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've had a few too where I've had to leave a message for the tagger asking what they felt was necessary to wikify it and it was always very minor or nothing at all. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 11:57, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Both the cleanup and wikify tags are confusing in one way or another. I was sort of hinting at that problem when I posted about <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category_talk%7EArticles_that_need_to_be_wikified_ad6c.html#Tag_redundancy" title="Category talk:Articles that need to be wikified">Tag redundancy</a>. There are also way too many tags, some of which are hardly ever used and far too many to keep memorized.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I was sort of thinking there should be some sort of flag (or yet another tag) placed on every new article (perhaps automagically} which simply marks it as a new article. If the article survives deletion then a week or two later someone with more experience determining what an article needs can place the correct tags on. I've recently found articles that are over a year old that don't have categories, for example. I've recently been watching the recent changes area where I observe new articles coming in. Some are complete garbage which get speedied right off but I also noticed there were quite a few new articles started by more experienced wikipedians which already have the foundations for a good article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not exactly sure where I'm going with all this but it seems to me that wikipedia should think about changing or coming up with a process for new articles submitted where those articles are passed through a process that wouldn't leave them in the shape that we're finding as we try to eliminate the wikify back log. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrad101_32fb.html" title="User:Brad101">Brad101</a> 12:44, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep we do have alot of tag abuse. it's like people don't know which one fits so they put them all on. Blech. And an approval process will never happen. Should it? Don't know.

<dl>
<dd>I wasn't saying "Approval Process". More like new articles would first be checked for copyright and wiki guidlines then passed down to be wikified, then cats and links etc. The wikipedia guidelines are already an approval process but in unorganized form. Example would be all the copyright problems I find in articles that are already months old. In some cases people have done a lot of work on an article that I have to blank out for copyright problems. Seems like a waste of effort since the article was a copyvio from the beginning. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrad101_32fb.html" title="User:Brad101">Brad101</a> 20:47, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suspect that the <i>actual</i> number of articles that need to be wikified (regardless of whether they are tagged as such or not) is decreasing, but what we are seeing is that a greater and greater proportion of them are being tagged.

<p>I decided to contribute to this project, and the first article I tackled turned out to have copyright problems. I tagged it as a possible copyright violation. Should I also have removed the wikify tag? <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECAN_f981.html" title="User:CAN">CAN</a> 01:16, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for helping out. Yes, the whole text of of the article including tags (except the copyvio tag of course) can be removed when you put the copyvio tag on. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarion96_c83d.html" title="User:Garion96">Garion96</a> <a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarion96_d01f.html" title="User talk:Garion96">(talk)</a> 01:22, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hmmm, why is my talk page on the list of items to be wikified? Did I press the wrong key or something? <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoaming27_a0a5.html" title="User:Roaming27">Roaming27</a> 07:54, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I'm not sure I should post that here but I don't know where to go. I'm trying to translate articles from french to english. I'm sure I'm making spelling and style mistakes. Is there a category to put into the article in order to make sure some people will have a look at it and correct the mistakes? I looked for some kind of Category:Spelling_to_check or Category:Grammar_to _be_checked but I didn't find out. Thanks for your help. <a href="../../../a/j/o/User%7EAjor_be8f.html" title="User:Ajor">Ajor</a> 17:56, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yep. Put {{cleanup}} on an article and that will add it to the category of articles needing <a href="../../../c/u/_/WP%7ECU_027e.html" title="WP:CU">cleanup</a> and somebody will come along and fix the spelling and grammar mistakes. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedRollerskate_20f6.html" title="User:RedRollerskate">RedRollerskate</a> 18:08, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Category:Wikify from August 2006 is currently empty.

<dd>It's interesting you should mention that actually - today I found out that there's articles in non-existant categories since May 2006. However, the good thing is that there's only about 1-2 articles in each category. This brings up the point that these old categories can't be deleted because, for example, if there is an article that someone tagged with {{wikify}} in (say) January 2006, and no one has dated that {{wikify}} tag until (say) today, then articles will be placed in a non-existant category. <a href="../../../h/4/c/User%7EH4cksaw_7364.html" title="User:H4cksaw"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: darkgreen; border: 1px solid;">&#160;H4cksaw&#160;</span></a> <small><a href="../../../h/4/c/User_talk%7EH4cksaw_6f39.html" title="User talk:H4cksaw"><span style="color: #3399FF; text-decoration: underline;">(talk)</span></a></small> 20:09, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
