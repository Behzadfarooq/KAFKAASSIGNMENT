<li>Non-notable duo. Nothing noteworthy besides having serious problems. Based purely on their merit as musicians, very non-notable. Virtually all references online are to their politics/racism, instead of to their music. One album, no substantial following, not on any major listing. <b>Delete</b>.</li>

It may be that this is the kind of thing that happens and then goes away (we can hope). The ABC news story has quotes from head of the NAACP and metions that David Duke is exploiting the teens to publicize his political agenda. However, until they have sold some records (they are "planning to release their second"), or have developed more of a press sensation, they remain off the radar screen of notability.<em>—<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff"><font color="Indigo">Gaff</font></a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff"><font color="MediumSlateBlue">ταλκ</font></a></b></small></sup></em> 04:19, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</s><em>—<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff"><font color="Indigo">Gaff</font></a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff"><font color="MediumSlateBlue">ταλκ</font></a></b></small></sup></em> 16:54, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><s><b>Comment</b>. Did you read what I wrote? Its not a delete based on politics. Its a delete vote based on the fact that they have not sold many records and have recorded one (on what label anyone?--they do not meet WP:music inclusion criteria for a band). Peddling inflammatory rhetoric can stir up the press a bit, granted. And obviously this article will be kept. But I would bet, based on the content of the article and the notability of this band right now, that a few years from now nobody will be reading this article or care about this band. If WP were a crystal ball, maybe we would know whether or not they are more than a news sensation in the Fall of 2005, soon to be forgotten. However WP is not a crystal ball.

   "McFADDEN: And what's your opinion on Hitler?
</pre>
<pre>
   LAMB: I think that he had ... he wanted to preserve his base.
</pre>
<pre>
   McFADDEN: He had 6 million Jews executed.

   LAMB: I think that's an exaggeration.
</pre>
<pre>
   McFADDEN: You do.
</pre>
<pre>
   LAMB: Yes.
</pre>
<pre>
   LYNX: I hardly believe there are even that many Jews alive back then.
</pre>
<pre>
   McFADDEN: Is Hitler someone you admire or someone you don't admire? ... You think he was a great man?
</pre>
<pre>
   LYNX: Yeah, I think he did a lot -- he had a lot of good ideas."
</pre>
<p>From this, the scene was cut to Ted Shaw, president of the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund, who stated "It really breaks my heart to see those two young girls spewing out that kind of garbage,"</p>
<p>From this transcript, you can see that extra information which was not in the show has been added to the Wikipedia article, for whatever reason. By only keeping the original paragraph and locking the article, all those with strong ideals (on BOTH sides) will not be tempted to use this entry for their own political motives.</p>

David Hasselhoff is a musician too, but he's famous for other things, just like these kids are. The fact that they are Nazis or "bad people" is no basis for deleting information on them; otherwise we'd be removing articles on Hitler, Stalin and a zillion other figures. The purpose of an encyclopedia is not to catalogue just the people and ideologies that are nice, but to serve as an information resource on bad things as well. Incidentally, they also got an article on them in a Finnish newspaper as well. They're also very interesting from the perspectives of sociology and education theory, and the responsibilities of parents.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It seems to me that the appropriate subject for an article is the girls' mother, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_Gaede_a195.html" title="April Gaede">April Gaede</a>. She has a history in the "movement", she puts the girls onstage, she manages them, and it's safe to assume that she chooses the songs they perform. Also, while some hate music has some artistic merit -- I'd buy a <a href="../../../s/k/r/Skrewdriver.html" title="Skrewdriver">Skrewdriver</a> album if they weren't Nazis -- Prussian Blue is just terrible. It seems likely that they'll eventually fade away -- but their mother is here to stay. Therefore, I recommend that we write an article on Ms. gaede, and merge this in.

<dd>Actually, I think it makes a lot of sense. Everyone is making the mistake that there's an event here -- as though Prussian Blue has written an original song, or sold 5000 albums, or ever played before a crowd larger than a few hundred people, at a venue more prominent than the county fair. Well, that hasn't happened. All that has happened is, an <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_902f.html" title="ABC">ABC</a> producer caught wind of Ms. gaede's underground promotional campaign, promising that Prussian Blue would someday (not now) be the icon of the white power movement, and pandemonium has ensued. Do you give put someone in an encyclopedia just because they appeared on TV once? Does it matter that the TV appearance was not for having accomplished anything, but just for being freakish? (No one's written an article on the Meat lady from the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Springer_Show_575a.html" title="Jerry Springer Show">Jerry Springer Show</a>, and she's been on TV more often, for more discrete events, than Lamb and Lynx.) That's the problem with the Prussian Blue article -- there's no <i>there</i> there.</dd>
<dd>Meanwhile, Ms. Gaede has managed to get her daughter's album -- a cover album might I add -- national exposure, due to a consistent promotional effort in her column on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Vanguard_9439.html" title="National Vanguard">National Vanguard</a> website. She picks the songs, she arranges the gigs, she promises a future where the white young men of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">America</a> are awakened to the destiny and responsibility of the <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a> people because Lamb and Lynx are hot. "Pretty white girls sing hate music" makes a good lead on TV, but to the extent that there's any story here, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_Gaede_a195.html" title="April Gaede">April Gaede</a> is the story.</dd>
<dd>Hence, since Prussian Blue a) have no substantial following (they don't even have a record contract), b) have made no original contribution to music, the white power movement, or any other aspect of our culture, and c) don't even pick which songs they're going to cover, I recommend that the article be either deleted or reduced to a stub, and that the media circus of the last few days be documented in an article devoted to the ringmaster, Ms Gaede.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I came for this article after reading a news article about the neonazi band "Prussian Blue" on a reliable German newspaper (<a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/,tt4m2/kultur/artikel/287/63224/" class="external text" title="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/,tt4m2/kultur/artikel/287/63224/" rel="nofollow">Süddeutsche Zeitung</a>). 13:31, 28 October 2005</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Someone above has stated we should delete the article because the girls are gaining notoriety? Am I the only person who can't see the logic in this? We may as well VFD the entire wikipedia in that case!<a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigeonshouse_ab11.html" title="User:Pigeonshouse">Pigeonshouse</a> 19:07, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
