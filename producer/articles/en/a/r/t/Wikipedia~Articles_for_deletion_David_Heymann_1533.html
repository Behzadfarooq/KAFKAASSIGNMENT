<li>Are you implying that I am blindly creating articles? If so then you are mistaken. His name was redlinked in another article, he seemed notable to me, so I made a stub. You are free to disagree with me about whether he is notable or not, but I think you are violating <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> by accusing me of having anything other than the best interests of Wikipedia in mind. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 04:39, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Maybe "blindly" was a poor choice of words. Promiscuously? Thoughtlessly? Without regard to actual encyclopedic merit?</li>
<li>Perhaps you should acquaint yourself with <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> and ask yourself how this guy overcomes the "average professor" test, or even the "average architect" test. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 04:48, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's weird: you often refer to a non-existent "Air Force Amy" test, but have trouble with an actual guideline? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:25, 29 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> isn't a guideline; it's mentioned on a guideline page only as a proposal, and if you bothered to follow the link to the proposal itself, you'd see that the version you favor has been rather solidly rejected, and the existing proposal (still under development) is quite different. As for <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_Amy_77d6.html" title="Air Force Amy">Air Force Amy</a>, I cite the recent Afd <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Air_Force_Amy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Air_Force_Amy" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> as a precedent (as other editors cite previous AfD decisions), and don't pretend that that there's a consensus WP:Air Force Amy policy or guideline. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 14:56, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Not only does <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> not represent consensus, the nominator has not even produced any evidence that Heymann fails the so-called test. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 05:07, 29 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's called a "standard" -- they DO have standards in Texas, right? -- and it's widely accepted as such, no matter how much handwaving you and Monicasdude do. More to the point, as a standard for article creation, it's not up to me to prove anyone fails it, it's up to you to prove he passes it -- or are tests done differently in Texas? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:25, 29 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not a matter of how things are done in Texas, its a matter of how they are done on Wikipedia. The deletion process states "When in doubt, don't delete"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> In other words, the default position is always to keep the article - the burden of proof falls to anyone who wants it to be deleted to achieve at least rough consensus to do so. And I notice that once again you make a gratiuitous comment about Texas, rather than sticking to the substance of the issue at hand. Perhaps that is because there is no substance to your nomination for deletion? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 05:45, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per John and MD. I warn Calton to be civil and <i>comment on content not contributors</i> (or their origins or affiliations). We have to remember that Wiki is not paper.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - there doesn't seem to be a perfectly applicable policy here, but being selected by the President to design a house does seem to imply greater notability than the average professor. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 08:09, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> <b>Neutral - see comment</b> Far more notable professors have been cheerfully deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b> His publication list seems non-existent - he's a good teacher who built a house. Keeping him <b>as a professor</b> would set a whole new standard for professors. He not only fails the average professor test, but probably fails the <b>fourth quartile</b> professor test! If he's to be kept, it can only be as an architect. I've moved some material around in the article to reflect that. Also removed some personal details which, while verifiable, have no relevance to his notability. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 15:24, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - It should be noted that I have just completed migrating all of the external links to ref|ref style notation. This article actually has more references than some FAs I've seen out there. This certainly indicates verifiability and notability. — <a href="../../../s/c/m/User%7EScm83x_dc0d.html" title="User:Scm83x">Scm83x</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/m/User_talk%7EScm83x_0490.html" title="User talk:Scm83x">hook 'em</a></sup> 05:23, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks Scm83x. Your changes and those of <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">Dlyons483</a> have made a big impact to the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> The structure designed for Bush is more notable than just being for a president. The environmental design features incorporated into the structure are also noteworthy. As for the architect himself, he has received other honors aside from the presidential commission and other assignments worthy of note (e.g. Audubon). I am surprised this article is up for deletion consieration...must be some politics going on that i dont know about. <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovalent_6f27.html" title="User:Covalent">Covalent</a> 18:38, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> have a look at the original article and see how much it's changed - <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a> has put a lot of work into it. It was perfectly reasonable, in my view, to put the original article on AfD - it was focussed on his work as a professor (which he's good at, but not especially notable for). <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a></li>
