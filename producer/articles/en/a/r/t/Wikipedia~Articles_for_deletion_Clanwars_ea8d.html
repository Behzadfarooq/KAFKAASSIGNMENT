<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> I am a member on Clanwars and was hoping you could elaborate on your reasons for deleting this article? I have read many articles discussing strategies of games or games in general; I suppose I'm wondering what is wrong with a link to a gaming league as there are other articles on wiki for online gaming clans and leagues. Please reconsider your request. RyanKatora
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Being a member does not make a topic notable. For an article to remain on Wikipedia that is about a website it must satisfy the requirements in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. In particular, this article does assert the importance of the topic and does not establish it's notability to the degree required. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKershner_cf22.html" title="User:Kershner">Kershner</a> 00:03, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Please don't take the nomination as an insult, as it's certainly not meant to be. If you feel that this nomination is unjust because there are other gaming forums that are the same size as Clanwars or smaller, yet have Wikipedia articles, please point them out (say on my <a href="../../../b/i/l/User_talk%7EBillC_aaf9.html" title="User talk:BillC">talk page</a>). <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillC_d650.html" title="User:BillC">BillC</a> 00:21, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Clanwars is no different than CAL or Teamwarfare (whom both have Wikipedia entries). Clanwars has become just as popular as either league. Electronic Arts, a billion dollar company, recently included Clanwars integration in its recent release "Battle for Middle Earth II". Results are currently automatically sent to the Clanwars league system after an online match is played in BFME2. I would imagine integration into a game by one of the leaders of the video game industry is significant as will any future interaction between these two entities will also be significant. Recently Clanwars has been receiving numerous sponsorships by companies such as Nvidia, Zboard, BigHugeGames (a partner of Microsoft), and others. The league has continued to grow since its inception and will only continue to get larger. Clanwars is more than a “cookie cutter” style league such as Teamwarfare and has garnered much more attention from video game companies than any other online league. --Klaskey 15:21, 16 June 2006 (UTC) <small>This comment was in fact added by 136.142.210.221 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_136.142.210.221_49d0.html" title="Special:Contributions/136.142.210.221">contribs</a>). <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConscious_cf76.html" title="User:Conscious">Conscious</a> 15:38, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> I still debate the "no notability" charge. Surely if the head honchos at Electronic Arts along with Gamespy were able to notice and integrate the clanwars ladder system into their game, than wikipedia would have a place for the ladder system that is quickly finding its way onto the map for many of game design companies. Certainly these sponsorships and relationships with giants of the video game industry match if not outweigh the accomplishments of other ladder sites such as teamwarfare and CAL, both of which have wikipedia entires (as I've mentioned before). So far, I havent read one good rebuttal to those facts from any of the posters here. If you don't feel its notable, please do explain how teamwarfare or CAL is notable. I understand some of you may not have heard about Clanwars, but then again, perhaps this kind of stuff isnt your niche. Of course, as long as wikipedia covers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_necrophilia_in_the_mallard_duck" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_necrophilia_in_the_mallard_duck" rel="nofollow">Homosexual necrophilia in the mallard duck</a>, I guess there will be something of interest for everyone. --Klaskey 13:31, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> User has supported twice and only has three contributions, all to this deletion page.--<a href="../../../a/u/g/User%7EAuger_Martel_3d86.html" title="User:Auger Martel">Auger Martel</a> 14:45, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry, I must not quite understand the phrase "please note that this is not a vote. This is a discussion". As far as contributions go, I'll make sure that I'll run to wikipedia so that I can be the first to note the actors who participate in the next new beer commercial, or maybe I'll be sure to find another instance of homosexual necrophilia in a new breed of butterfly. Again, I only want to point out that nobody here is really arguing the points that I'm making, which means this really isn’t much of a discussion at all, just a bunch of people pointing fingers. I changed my "vote", hope that makes everyone happy.--Klaskey 17:29, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
