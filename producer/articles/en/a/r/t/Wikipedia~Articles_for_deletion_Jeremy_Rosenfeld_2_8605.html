<dd><b>Comment</b> as much as I would like to vote keep, since this AfD seems unreasonable since the article <i>just</i> passed Afd, Jimbo is in fact right that it is original research, since the sources used are correspondence, which is pretty much as original research you can get. If the statements had been used in a printed source to support a similar argument, and that was referenced, it would not be. As it is, it is original research. I maintain that it could well be notable in the future, however, with better sourcing. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a><a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">emi</font></a> 23:11, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>Suggesting</i> the use of a technology that had already been around for five years at the time, and which had already proven its usefulness for building specialized knowledge bases in various implementations, is hardly the most remarkable achievement in the world. Everything was there -- the failing encyclopedia project with the funding, the social connections, the technology. It was natural for things to fall into place. Hence it is no surprise that Larry came up with the Wikipedia proposal independently one month later. If you want to give people credit, think more about <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Cunningham_d473.html" title="Ward Cunningham">Ward Cunningham</a> or <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clifford_Adams_127b.html" title="Clifford Adams">Clifford Adams</a> (the developer of the original wiki software used by Wikipedia, who also came up with one of the first <a href="../../../c/a/m/CamelCase_3f45.html" title="CamelCase">CamelCase</a>-free implementations). But fundamentally, Wikipedia is a collaborative achievement, and this fixation on every single individual who played any role whatsoever is more harmful than useful.

<li>Delete. Having a separate article about Rosenfeld doesn't bring any clarity into the history. The matter is already summarized in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Wikipedia_74f2.html" title="History of Wikipedia">History of Wikipedia</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Sanger_037d.html" title="Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a>, and <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomis.html" title="Bomis">Bomis</a>. What could be usefully added to the article about Rosenfeld that could not be added to any of these articles? His personal notability is not established and details from his personal life are therefore irrelevant. While having a Wikipedia article about you can be considered an honor, it can also be a huge PITA, and there's no reason we should inflict it on someone whose claim to fame is very doubtful at best. I suggest that those who are interested in digging into the history either improve the consistency and NPOV across the aforementioned range of articles, or start tracking down Rosenfeld and work on a nice story about the early days of Nupedia and Wikipedia for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinews.html" title="Wikinews">Wikinews</a>, which welcomes original research like that.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 23:33, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>The 'guy in the elevator' argument very much is apt. Jeremey was the first person to show me a wiki and suggest that it be used to solve the problems we had with Larry's Nupedia design. But Larry and I both agree that Larry showing it to me at a later day was causally relevant in a way that Jeremey's happening to show it to me was not. There are literally dozens of people who are very important to the history of Wikipedia, including for example Eloquence who has joined this thread, and who was instrumental in a number of ways in the entire process. (Did you know that the final formation of the Wikimedia Foundation was prompted when he called me on the phone to tell me to hurry up and do it?) Unless we're so strangely inwardly focussed that we think that every single person who played any small role in Wikipedia should have an article, this one clearly should go. It isn't even borderline.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 00:27, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, Jimbo, I'm theoretically happy to change my vote, but I'd be doing so on the basis of the idea that Rosenfeld had <i>absolutely nothing substantive</i> to do with the creation of Wikipedia (and I would also then be inclined to remove mention of him from the Sanger article, given that his mentioning the idea of a wiki to you prompted no action).

<dd>Jimmy's original research reasoning is incorrect (the article is as based on published sources about Wikipedia's history; that these happen to be Wikipedia mailing lists is irrelevant), that does not invalidate the AFD nomination. The issue is notability, not OR.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 23:48, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just for my own understanding, do mailing lists really count as published sources? They're clearly not physically published, they're not "peer reviewed", I'm a little confused by this. Frankly, I consider neither mailing lists nor blogs acceptable sources. Notability was the criteria for the last AfD, and it passed. Saying that the issue now is once again notability makes this seem like even more of a questionable Afd. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a><a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">emi</font></a> 00:19, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It depends on what you're trying to source. Otherwise you might as well throw away virtually all of the references on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html#References" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia#References</a>. Something you said on a mailing list does not become more factual because someone who writes for a peer reviewed journal decides to cite your mailing list post in a paper (as Joseph Reagle recently did); in fact, if you review his recent paper, you'll probably disagree with some of his interpretations and might even find yourself quoted out of context. Why not, then, quote the mailing list posts he himself cites directly? It is where sources are <i>interpreted</i> and judgments of notability or truth are made that we go into POV and original research territory, and this is where we should refer to authorities.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 00:36, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point is to get as close as possible to a primary source for a factual claim without adding elements of original research (results of personal interviews and studies that have not been published, hypotheses that have not been verified, valuations that are subjective, and so forth). If you want to make the factual claim "Climate models have been used by the IPCC to anticipate a warming of 1.4 °C to 5.8 °C between 1990 and 2100", then of course you need a scientific publication which backs up this claim. If you want to source the claim "<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Sullivan_6a55.html" title="Andrew Sullivan">Andrew Sullivan</a> has argued that the Republicans should take a more liberal stance on same-sex marriage", then of course Andrew Sullivan's blog is a good source for that (though an unalterable copy might be desirable in some cases). Virtually all our articles about Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia projects are, by necessity, based on Wikipedia's own electronic publications and project websites as sources; using some academic reference to make a claim about Wikipedia's history would actually be less useful in many cases, since you're moving further away from the primary source.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 00:29, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree to a certain extent. Encyclopedias are supposed to be <i>based</i> on secondary material, with the occasional <i>openly available</i> primary info to back up the claims made by the secondary material. This article is entirely based on primary source material, it's not just quoting Jimbo to support assertions made by secondary sources. Also, I don't know about the availability of this material. Could most people go on the internet and find it, outside of the wikipedia site? I think that's a real problem with original research. For instance, let's say that I went to a library in the middle of nowhere and looked at the papers of Athol Fugard. I could quote stuff that he said in his letters and stuff, it would be true, it would be verifiable if someone could get to the middle of nowhere and look at those same papers. But it's original research, because it's not published, it's not <i>reasonably</i> verifiable. If, however, the letters of Athol Fugard have been published, and a score of libraries has them, it would be reasonable to quote them, because they're publically available, verifiable, no longer quite such original research. Thus I maintain that although I find this article borderline notable, since I think that a person who started something notable on a particular path is thereby notable, it is original research and should be deleted. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a><a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">emi</font></a> 18:24, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is absurd. If more than 50% of the vote here is to delete, then I will delete it myself. If somebody undoes my deletion, then I will be convinced that the AFD process is broken and will work to fix that. We have an absurdly high standard to delete that biases us to include clearly non-notable subjects. All the encyclopedic info in this article can and already is in other places. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> 18:04, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> How can Jimbo say nothing is verifiable when the article claims something about him.
