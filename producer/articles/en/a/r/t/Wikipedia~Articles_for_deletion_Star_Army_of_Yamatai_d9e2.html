<p>I added "please don't delete" but am not the creator (I'm Star Army's admin). It was likely one of my community's members. The notice said it could be removed if there was objection to deletion, so and I removed it because I objected. While my site isn't huge, I believe wholeheartedly it isn't insignificant. It has members from all over the world, from Japan and South Africa, to the U.K., Argentina, and of course home in the U.S. It recieves about fourty thousand visitors yearly and has set itself above the masses of fly-by-night crap role-play sites that give online text-based role-playing games a bad name. Our presence at conventions and close connection to the internet phenomenon that is 4chan are also significant to those involved. For these reasons, I ask that the mark for deletion be removed.</p>
<p>Thanks, Wes</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unforunately, with the Internet being intrinsically international, having international members isn't much of a claim to notability. In order to merit an article, the website must demonstrate meeting criteria proposed in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. This criteria is derived from <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> guildelines, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policies, and the availability of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, which allow us to avoid <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. This all helps to build an informative, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> article. Remember that Wikipedia is also <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a web directory or indiscriminate collection of information</a>. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 23:01, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, Wes and I are not the same person. Please don't jump to conclusions.&#160;:) While I have no objections to removing the article if it indeed does not meet Wikipedia's standards, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> seems to be unduly harsh, and doesn't seem to be fully enforced. Under its strict definition, even a popular, critically acclaimed <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webcomic.html" title="Webcomic">webcomic</a> like <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominic_Deegan_6803.html" title="Dominic Deegan">Dominic Deegan</a> would fail the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> test, since the article on <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominic_Deegan_6803.html" title="Dominic Deegan">Dominic Deegan</a> itself makes no attempt to offer evidence that it passes <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> in the first place. I'm not looking to stir up trouble here, but it would be greatly appreciated if <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> could be further clarified, as it seems somewhat subjective right now.

<dd>Wikipedia is in need of a lot of clean-up. That article no more meets the standards than this one.

<dd>I feel that I'm too new around here to be going around "prodding" other people's pages, but I recommend looking here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Webcomics" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Webcomics" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Webcomics</a>. -- GoldPanda 04:04, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I wasn't suggesting to prod them. (The prodding system doesn't work very well--there are people who go through the category and remove entries without explanation or good reason.) Just go straight to the deletion debate. I am familiar with that web project. If you read the first paragraph, it links directly to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">website notability guidelines, (aka WP:WEB).</a> Webcomics tend to create articles for a lot of non-notable sites. They get deleted quite a bit too. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_Deletion_Archive_00c7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics/Deletion/Archive">see the archive</a>. Most of the keeps are also "no concensus keeps".

<dd>Still, the standards shouldn't be based on opinion. If we stick to the standards as written, then Star Army qualifies as being notable.

<dd>The standards certainly do not mean to imply that <i>any</i> web award merits noteworthiness, just particularly well-known ones.

<p>[<i>from talk page:</i>] I will speak up.</p>
<p>Some SA players have discussed this issue. Though we understand, in a vague sort of way, that we are not up to snuff with Wikipedia, I find that if several webcomics, some of dubious fame or importance, are allowed stubs under their own WikiProject, why can't Star Army exist on Wikipedia as well? We've established ourselves well enough, and we are one of the few all-original RP universes that has any true depth.</p>
<p>I only ask for balance.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>I agree on this point</i>. While I stated that SA probably isnt of sufficient note to have a Wiki article, the Project Webcomics issue is a prime example of blatant stubs and advertisements, most of them with little note and little following. While a project for webcomics certainly has a place, webcomics should follow the same rules everyone else does. Nonnotable little ass-end bits of the web dont belong on Wiki. Sekiko</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
I also agree with this. Star Army has reinstated my interest in the world of roleplaying. While some might not like the level of technology present I myself feel it adds to the ability to incorperate new and exciting things of ones own creation into the game that simply wouldn't fit into so many others. I would find it difficult to find many if any other online roleplaying games that have such depth and yet are easy to get involved with and play.

My personal home page, for example, has its URL published in newspapers in the US, UK, Hungary, etc.. but no feature was done on it, therefore it doesn't meet these guidelines.) OR the site must have won an award from a major, notable award. (i.e. not an "award mill" like the above mentioned site.), or finally, the site must have had its content reproduced by a notable media company (i.e. if somone took your RPG stories and turned them into a book.

<dd>I can see where you're coming from, but if we included all such communities, we'd be swamped with articles that are of little encyclopedic value really to anyone except members. Internet forums are only notable if they're well-known outside...themselves, if that makes sense. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 21:10, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, I have no vendetta against your website, I've never even heard of it. I've simply been trying to explain our reasons for deletion to you to help you understand why this ISN'T a "personal vendetta" against you/your site, but just application of policy. I have already voted; I was trying to do you a favor. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 21:13, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well...if this has to be deleted, please allow it to be recreated in the future when I somehow create some worldwide news. At that point, I'll return and repost it.</dd>
