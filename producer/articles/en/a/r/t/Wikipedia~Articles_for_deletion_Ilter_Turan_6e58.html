<p>This wikipedia page appears to be just one huge resume. The only informative sentence is the second one, in which he is described as an international relations professor in Turkey. He is a teacher at a moderately prominent Turkish university, and I see no reason why that is deserving of a wikipedia page. To gauge how famous he actually is I looked up the various books he published. The first one, which was authored with others, gets about two pages worth of hits, roughly 20. The other "book" he wrote is actually an unpublished master's essay, whose only Google hit comes from his own personal page. Once finding that page, I actually saw that his wikipedia page is actually a completely copy+paste job from his faculty information page from the Bigli University site. I think a page on wikipedia should be self-explanatory as to why the subject deserves a wikipedia page. I cannot find, however, any reason from his page which is just one big list taken from his own personal listing. The page was created and updated by the user Ankaram (whom some believe to be Sedat Laciner, someone who has used wikipedia to promote himself and his organizations. Turan is actually on the editorial board of Laciner's International Strategic Research Org.- an organization for which Laciner created a wikipedia page for and Ankaram helped to update- so it is not surprising that Laciner would have created such a page for Turan as well.) I think wikipedia is no place for resumes and self-promotion, this page should be taken down as it adds nothing to general knowledge and is just a copy+paste job from someone's personal site.

<dd>I think we should be careful to confuse being cited a few times over the years by various news outlets and being wikipedia-worthy. When you consider the huge number of articles churned out by any news source, CNN, BBC, etc., on an extremely large array of topics, with an average of one or two people being quoted in each one, the number of people quoted more than once by a news outlet over the years is likely to be very large. Especially when it comes to an obscure area like Turkish politics, they probably did some research and came up with his name as someone to quote in an article or two. Saying that "the subject is notable enough to be quoted by main stream media" would set a very broad prescedent as to who deserves a wikipedia page. Tons of otherwise non-famous people, often professors like Turan is, are asked to give their opinions in articles. One of my college professors was just the subject of an NPR interview and has published quite at least a couple "mainstream" books on US politics. However he is not one anyone would classify as famous and does not have his own page. Meanwhile a search for various books and articles listed on the Turan page turns up nothing notable about them. Many of them were from 20 or 30 years ago even. I see no strong evidence of his notable status. Vartan84 16:52, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> no convincing evidence of notability. Being occasionally asked for their opinion as an academic expert in the media doesn't prove notability. It proves that journalists know how to use websites and telephones to find a suitable expert when they need to. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:41, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep if rewritten</b> as subject seems notable enough. But, if article remains in its current state, it should be <b>deleted</b> at the close of this AfD, as EXTREMELY poorly written, and either a copyvio or self-created. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffBurdges_be5a.html" title="User:JeffBurdges">JeffBurdges</a> 12:54, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The article cannot be kept in its present state. It is a verbatim copy of the information page on professor Turan at Istanbul Bilgi University's website: <a href="http://www.bilgi.edu.tr/pages/faculties.asp?keepO=4&amp;stuffid=362&amp;fid=2&amp;did=15&amp;r=6%2F14%2F2006+1%3A54%3A08+PM" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bilgi.edu.tr/pages/faculties.asp?keepO=4&amp;stuffid=362&amp;fid=2&amp;did=15&amp;r=6%2F14%2F2006+1%3A54%3A08+PM" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. The subject itself is notable enough. <a href="../../../i/s/t/Istanbul_Bilgi_University_8f11.html" title="Istanbul Bilgi University">Bilgi</a> is not a "moderately prominent" Turkish university but one of the leading universities of Turkey. (Disclosure: some of my best friends were or are affiliated with this university.) And the rector is the highest academic official, like the president or chancellor of an American university. I also get about 98,400 Google hits. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 20:36, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oops, I missed that rector part, that makes notability clear enough for a keep. Also I see that the article has been "fix" by deleting the copyvio information (all of it).
